			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Conundrum of Birmingham property market's revival: A city with a glut of office space cannot meet potential tenants' needs because they are seeking air-conditioned premises The commercial property market is poised for recovery. Rents have mostly stopped falling, tenants are beginning to seek new premises and developers are dusting down plans for new projects. No single city is representative of the market as a whole. But many of the factors driving the nascent recovery are evident in Birmingham. It has a large number of empty buildings. About 800,000 sq ft of space is vacant in Birmingham's core out of a total of about 16m sq ft. This year the amount of empty, central space will rise to more than 1m sq ft as a result of companies moving. Paradoxically, there is insufficient space of the right kind to meet tenants' demands. 'There is a general shortage of good-quality accommodation of any size,' says Mr Andrew Wilkes, head of facilities and property at Mercury Communications, which is seeking new premises of 120,000 sq ft in Birmingham. Like most other large prospective tenants, Mercury is reluctant to consider the older buildings without air-conditioning - which make up the bulk of Birmingham's empty stock of offices. Modern property is in short supply in Birmingham. Unlike London, it does not have a glut of space left from developments of the late 1980s. 'Birmingham did not really benefit from the boom; the rents went up but the buildings didn't,' says Mr Jon Bellfield, a director of Richardson Barberry, one of the most active developers in the city. The difficulty in finding space in Birmingham arises more from a scarcity of good supply than from a large demand from potential tenants. Demand from tenants is running at low levels, both because business confidence is subdued and because of the difficulties of disposing of former premises. But agents believe that if more buildings were available, there would be more tenants seeking to move into them. Richard Ellis says there are half a dozen companies that need more than 100,000 sq ft, although they are not actively looking for buildings because so little of the right quality is available. A number of bidders for the National Lottery looked at Birmingham, but were unavailable to find anything suitable buildings. The belief that a lack of the right supply has dampened demand is stirring developers into action. The first speculative scheme is due to start next month. This will be the first building of Brindley Place, a 1.1m sq ft scheme close to the International Convention Centre in the west of the city, outside the inner ring road. Argent, which has already sold the building to an institution, has yet to find a tenant, although it has been shortlisted by Mercury. The Fountains scheme in central Birmingham has planning consent for 90,000 sq ft of space by Axa Equity &amp; Law, the insurer. Richardson Barberry plans to start in September on a 58,000 sq ft speculative office scheme in Temple Street. Apart from Brindley Place, the largest potential project in central Birmingham is adjacent to Snow Hill Station, where Speyhawk, a developer which collapsed last year, had planned a 900,000 sq ft building. British Rail Property Board and the city's Economic Development Department, the site's owners, are seeking a new developer. Problems experienced by property owners in letting obsolescent buildings provides a powerful incentive for redevelopment. The enthusiasm with which developers are pursuing their plans begs the question of whether Birmingham  -which has 3m sq ft of valid planning permits - could end up with an oversupply of new space that will depress rents. Mr Andrew Causer, an analyst at brokers James Capel, believes not. He argues that the development pipeline is not big enough to prevent rents from rising from their current level of about Pounds 20 per sq ft towards Pounds 25 per sq ft over the next three years. Mr Bellfield agrees, pointing out that only cash-rich investors or institutions are willing to build speculatively. Most developers are anxious to secure a commitment from a potential tenant before beginning work. 'If everyone with a site started to build tomorrow, that might create an oversupply, but that is unlikely to happen,' he says.</p>

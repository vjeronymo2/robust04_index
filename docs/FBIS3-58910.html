For his part, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta  said it was "unimaginable" that Butrus-Ghali would not authorize  interventions which, basically, would be directed at the  alleviation of the difficult situation in which UN ground forces  find themselves in Bosnia.    Ciampi and Andreatta were speaking to journalists here in  connection with that part of the summit's final statement which  deals with Bosnia and, in particular, with the confirmed standby  readiness of alliance members to launch air strikes to break the  stranglehold on Sarajevo, to rotate out the Canadian blue  helmets blocked at Srebrenica and to reopen the Tuzla airport to  humanitarian airlifts.    Dire situations like those at Srebrenica and Tuzla are all  too concrete and call out for United Nations forces to be put in  a position to carry out their mandate, even if that means  intervention by NATO planes, Ciampi said. However, any step in  this direction must be carefully analyzed, taking into account  all possible consequences, including reprisal action and the  difficulties of pinpointing with certainty those responsible for  the situations one wants to remedy, Andreatta added.    However, it is not with fighter bombers that the Bosnia  problem will be solved, but by convincing the belligerents that  a military solution to the conflict has already been tried and  cannot be repeated, the Italian diplomatic chief continued.    "The illusion of a spring offensive" is today the worst  enemy  for chances of peace in the former Yugoslavia, he said.    The NATO summit ended here Tuesday without reaching  agreement  on new wording for a threatened air strike on Serb forces. The  final communique only called on the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] command in Bosnia to "urgently draw up plans to ensure  the rotation of the UN forces at the Muslim enclave of  Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at Tuzla,"  without referring to military action that NATO might undertake  to achieve these goals.    The document reiterated last August's reference to air  strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the  "strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other  Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic.    United States President Bill Clinton expressed the view that  today's declaration, while not making substantive changes to the  August stance, "increased the possibility of the use of air  strikes in Bosnia."</p>

Police sources have identified them as Sonia  Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover; Ovel Washington  Porter, 28, a seaman of Flankers, St. James and an unidentified  male higgler.    Mrs. Whitley-Anderson died in Montego Bay on Thursday on  arriving on the SAM flight from San Andres, Colombia; Mr. Porter  died in Bermuda on Sunday and the unidentified higgler died  Thursday morning while he was preparing to take the COPA flight  back to Kingston from Panama City.    According to Narcotics Police Division sources, Mrs.  Whitley-Anderson went to San Andres off the Colombian coast on  SAM flight 506 which left from Montego Bay on Sunday and  returned on Thursday.    She fell ill while the plane was returning to Montego Bay  and  when it landed at 3 p.m., a physician who was on board,  pronounced her dead.    Five small packets of cocaine were found in her brassiere  and  she is believed to have swallowed several more to smuggle them  in.    An autopsy is to be done on her body tomorrow.    The unidentified male higgler was found dead in the Aruba  hotel in Panama City on Thursday morning.  <H5>  Sources </H5>   Sources say he was getting ready to leave for Kingston on  the  COPA flight yesterday when he died from an overdose of cocaine  which he swallowed to smuggle here.    Mr. Porter worked as a seaman aboard the cruise ship Song of  America but lost his job recently. He left Jamaica on November  23 and after travelling to Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia,  arrived in Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda, on December 4. He  fell ill and died the following day and an autopsy done on him  on December 6 revealed that he had in his stomach 24 packets  with substance confirmed to be cocaine, weighing 191.99 grams.    Half a gram of cocaine in Bermuda sells for US$125.    Mr. Porter's body is to be flown to Jamaica today  (Saturday).    On Thursday agents from the Narcotics Police Division  accosted four women who had arrived at the Norman Manley  International Airport in Kingston aboard COPA flight 4l8 from  Panama City. They were intercepted outside the airport after  they had cleared immigration and customs.    One, identified by the police as Joan Watson, 38, higgler,  of  11 Olympic Way, Kingston, stripped herself naked and refused to  be searched, but the police subdued her and when she was  searched, a packet with 1 lb. of cocaine was found in her vagina.    The others, Joan Watson's sister, Densetta Watson, 33,  Maureen Patterson, 30, of 263 Amos Path, Bay Farm Villas,  Kingston and Lavern Wilson, 38, of Chapelton Road, May Pen,  Clarendon, were similarly searched and each was found with a  packet with 3/4 lb of cocaine in the vagina. The cocaine was  wrapped in masking tape.    All four were charged with possession of cocaine, dealing in  cocaine and importing cocaine. They are to appear before the  Sutton Street RM court next week.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, there is evidence in the record that employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do use their logging boots away from work. Employees come  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to and leave work wearing their logging boots, suggesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the boots are used away from the workplace. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, commenters cited specific activities where logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boots are used away from the logging work site. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters did not provide any comparable evidence that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other items of PPE required by the final rule are also used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by employees away from the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, OSHA has decided in the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to require the employer to provide logging boots. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency emphasizes that it is the totality of the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances in the logging industry that justify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. Of the reasons discussed above, none of them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standing alone would provide sufficient justification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> departing from the general requirement that employers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide PPE. Rather, it is the combination of these reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and special circumstances in the logging industry that make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it appropriate to allow employees to provide their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging boots.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA also emphasizes that regardless of who provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the logging boots, the final rule makes the employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for assuring that logging boots are used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee and are maintained in a serviceable condition. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, in the final rule the employer is responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuring that logging boots are inspected before initial use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a workshift. Attendant to this requirement, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer is also responsible for assuring that damaged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defective equipment is either repaired or replaced before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work is commenced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the other items of PPE required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, OSHA does not believe there is sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence in the record to justify a departure from OSHA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-established policy. Neither industry practice nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turnover rates compel the Agency to relieve employers of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to pay for the other items of PPE for loggers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, evidence in the record shows that many employers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently providing these other items of PPE (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 177). The record shows that, unlike logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boots, these items of PPE tend to remain at the workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are amenable for use by other employees. Further, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no evidence in the record of an established practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees using such PPE away from the workplace. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no evidence of established and uniform industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice of transporting such PPE from job to job.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is requiring, except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging boots, that the employer provide PPE at no cost to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Leg protection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the hearing notice OSHA raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three issues concerning leg protection for chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators: specifications for leg protection, the area to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be protected, and potential disadvantages of leg protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Specifications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required that chain-saw operators wear leg protection made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ballistic nylon or other material that provides at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent protection. Many commenters supported the leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection requirement for chain-saw operators (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73, 9&hyph;9&hyph;11; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Several commenters and hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants also supported OSHA's position that leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection meet certain criteria (Ex. 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Two commenters suggested that OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require leg protection made with KEVLAR because they believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KEVLAR provides more protection than ballistic nylon (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;30). One of these commenters said KEVLAR leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection provides 50 percent more protection than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ballistic nylon with a fraction of the weight and bulk, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing easier movement and reducing fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;30).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter also said that the U.S. Forest Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications call for KEVLAR leg protection. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters stated that a testing protocol for leg protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be adopted rather than specifying that leg protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be comprised of any certain type of material (Ex. 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter said OSHA should adopt the ISO or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canadian testing standards for leg protection (Ex. 9&hyph;16).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other commenters said there was no consensus in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this country regarding an appropriate testing standard (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter proposed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following testing standard be adopted: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he protective garment must have a minimum ``Threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chain Speed'' of 2500 feet per minute for operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using chain saws with an engine displacement of under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 65 cc and 3000 feet per minute for operators using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain saws with an engine displacement of over 65 cc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further the test procedure developed and currently used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the US Forest Service [should] be adopted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as the test method used to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Threshold Chain Speed'' of safety material (Ex. 5&hyph;68).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

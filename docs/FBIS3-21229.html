The promising new alloy is called the  ``quasi-crystalline particle dispersed aluminum alloy.'' For the  time being, the alloy is made into a thin 20- to 30-m-thick  tape. This new alloy was discovered by the research group of  Professor Ken Masumoto, director of the Metal Technology  Research Institute (MTRI) of Tohoku University, and Professor  Akihisa Inoue, of the same institute, during the course of  studies involving the super-rapid cooling/solidification of  aluminum alloy-based amorphous alloys.    Of particular interest because of the potential commercial  value are aluminum-manganese-nickel-based and  aluminum-manganese-cobalt-based high-strength alloys that were  developed jointly by MTRI and Yamaha Technical Research  Institute. Those alloys have been found to show a tensile  strength of 1,200 MPa, which is more than twice that of the  heat-treated 2000-series super-duralmin (2017), which is  currently used as a high-strength alloy. Moreover, the new  alloys' tapes are so ductile that they do not crack even when  bent 180 and folded flat.    These quasi-crystalline particle-dispersed aluminum alloys  are so called because spherical quasi-crystalline particles,  with diameters ranging from 30 to 50 m, are uniformly  dispersed in the matrix of an aluminum alloy. The quantities of  the quasi-crystalline particles are 50 to 70 volume-percent. The  ``quasi-crystal'' was first discovered by Shechtmann's research  group in Israel. At that time, there was no crystallographic  explanation for the mysterious phase with quintuple symmetry  found in a super-rapidly solidified aluminum-manganese alloy. It  was clarified with the aid of a high-resolution electron  microscope that the regular-icosahedral alloy contained many  phase strains, called `(phase-on) strains,' internally.  Subsequently, quasi-crystalline phases were discovered in two-  and three-element alloys containing magnesium and titanium, and  gradually the phase was understood to be a unique electron  compound. Although the initial quasi-crystalline phases had been  unstable quasi-stable phases, the first quasi-crystalline phase  which was a stable, quasi-stable phase, was discovered in 1986  in aluminum-lithium-copper-based alloys.    Having studied the above-mentioned series of  quasi-crystalline phases, MTRI in 1992 developed an  aluminum-manganese-cerium-based high-strength alloy in which  several 10s-m-diameter spherical quasi-crystalline particles  were dispersed, and it pursued further development of other  implementable alloys in an accelerated fashion. However, for  practical applications, the problem was to use rare-earth  metals, such as cerium. According to ST Project Leader Toshiharu  Hoshi of the Yamaha Technical Research Institute, ``when a  rare-earth metal is used, production conditions become  complicated because of its tendency to oxidation.'' In 1993,  MTRI discovered that transition-metal elements such as  manganese, cobalt and iron could replace cerium, and it began to  take a gigantic step toward the practical implementation of the  new alloys.</p>

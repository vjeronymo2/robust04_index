			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charges drive Xerox to Dollars 1bn shortfall XEROX yesterday announced strong fourth-quarter growth in its core document processing business while also reporting a Dollars 1bn net loss for 1992 after taking previously announced special charges. The company announced earlier this month that it was selling off its troubled financial services operations and taking a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 778m to cover this. Xerox reported a fourth-quarter loss after charges of Dollars 736m, or Dollars 7.80 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 91m, or 73 cents a share, in the same period of last year. For the full year, the company reported a loss of Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars 11.29 a share, after taking other charges, including a large non-cash charge for an accounting change. In 1991 it had net income of Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.91 a share. The company estimated that, excluding all its special charges, 1992 earnings were Dollars 628m, or Dollars 5.65 a share, compared with Dollars 555m, or Dollars 4.97 a share in 1991. In the fourth quarter, earnings from the document processing business were Dollars 226m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, compared with Dollars 188m, or Dollars 1.76 a share, a year earlier. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said that growth in document processing, achieved in spite of a weak economy, had been due to strong customer acceptance of Xerox's new digital products. 'Sales of the Xerox DocuTech Publishing series and our state-of-the-art full-colour copiers have exceeded our expectations and sales of new electronic laser printers are accelerating,' he said. The company's market share had been increasing. Document processing revenues rose 10 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 4.2bn, from Dollars 3.8bn, and for the full year were up 6 per cent at Dollars 14.7bn. Excluding the effect of foreign currencies, revenues grew 7 per cent in the latest quarter and 5 per cent in the full year. Revenue and income in the US grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than in the first half of the year, but revenues and income from Japanese and certain European operating companies remained adversely affected by weak economic conditions. Mr Allaire said the company expected to see further benefits from its new range in 1993 as it continued to introduce new products.</p>

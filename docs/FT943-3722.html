			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Village planned on Ravenscraig site The site of British Steel's Ravenscraig complex at Motherwell in Lanarkshire is intended to become an urban village built around an 80-acre lake, according to a redevelopment plan announced yesterday. The 1,000-acre site will be decontaminated and reclaimed at the cost of about Pounds 30m in public money. The plan envisages private-sector investment of Pounds 200m over 25 years to develop 350 acres of the site. The urban village would include housing, shops, offices, leisure and business facilities, and possibly a site for further education. Neighbouring communities will expand to cover the remainder of the site with housing. Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the Lanarkshire Development Agency, said: 'What we are attempting to do is to replace the missing bit of Motherwell which would have developed had the steelworks not been there.' The strategy has been devised by a group involving the Lanarkshire Development Agency, Scottish Enterprise, British Steel and local authorities. British Steel expects to start demolition work and decontamination next year at the plant, which closed in 1992.</p>

This is particularly true for larger businesses, which seek to connect their cellular services to private networks offered by interexchange carriers. By doing so, the business user obtains not only access to the features of the private network, but also the very substantial discounts on long distance prices that are sold as part of the service. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  These are the very discounts that the BOCs seek to obtain (BOC Mem. 26, June 20, 1994); today they can be obtained by customers of equal access systems, but generally not by others. Indeed the availability of equal access from BOC systems has pressured  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> non- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BOCs (notably McCaw) to offer connections to large customers' private networks, in order to retain their business. Businesses that do not obtain cellular service from equal access cellular systems have no access to these discounts and services, and have been frustrated in their efforts to reduce their cellular long distance costs. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  While the largest businesses might have the leverage with their cellular providers to gain access for their private interexchange services, smaller businesses and individuals cannot get those benefits_except where equal access requires it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``The one segment of the long-distance market that appears most competitive is the market for large customers.''

Dow chose to pay these higher prices rather than have its sales people change cellular telephone numbers, which they would have to do if Dow changed carriers.

The argument that vertical integration cannot increase a monopolist's profits is often attributed to Robert Bork, who expanded upon economic theory and popularized this argument among antitrust lawyers.

Bork.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Antitrust Paradox  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 229 (1978);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Scherer &amp; Ross at 522.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact, as indicated in Southwestern Bell's own documents, is that a successful strategy for raising prices is to focus on ancillary services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pp. 16&hyph;18 above. Southwestern Bell has found that it can ``aggressively change(e) elements of subscriber revenue to mitigate the effect of lower customer usage'' by raising the costs of ancillary services, for example, by ``increased monthly access charges *&blank;*&blank;* slightly higher roaming *&blank;*&blank;* eliminating `night hours' and extending peak hours in many of the markets.'' [SWB 203136&hyph;37] If Southwestern Bell finds that the best method of increasing revenue is to raise the price of roaming rates and access charges, it stand to reason that it would find it equally feasible and attractive to rise the rates of long distance charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southwestern's ``one monopoly rent'' argument is contrary to theory as well as fact. The theoretical model on which Southwestern relies depends, in general, on the presence of many key and restrictive conditions, at least  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> four  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of which are not present here. First, as Southwestern Bell acknowledges, the theory is limited to unregulated monopolists. Cellular duopolists are not universally unregulated: in California, home of 20 percent of the nation's population, cellular prices are regulated. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  Second, the theory requires that the two inputs (here, cellular service and long distance service) be used in fixed proportions; if the integrator or user can vary the proportions (by making more or fewer long distance calls) the general argument fails. Third, the argument does not apply where the firm cannot price discriminate in the downstream market_the long distance market_without vertical integration. Fourth, and most important, the argument applies only to the situation in which a monopolist is integrating with a firm in a competitive market; here we have decidedly imperfect competition in cellular, and (as the BOCs acknowledge) imperfect competition in long distance. The ``one monopoly rent'' model does not speak to the situation of integrating oligopolists. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Cal Pub.

That theory has been rejected by economists of all persuasions, who recognize that there are conditions under which a monopolist or oligopolist can vertically integrate and increase its monopoly profits. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  And it is directly contrary to the observable facts here: Southwestern has raised prices of ``ancillary'' services, such as roaming, rather than raise more visible prices ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SWB 203136&hyph;37), and the BOCs all observe that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> non- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> equal access carriers, such as McCaw, charge top dollar for long distance services that are ``ancillary'' to their cellular service, rather than simply raising the price of cellular service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Carlton &amp; Perloff 510; R.

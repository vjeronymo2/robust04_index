			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: The feel-good factor keeps cash flowing - Sponsorship / A look at how the arts are coping with recession ARTS sponsorship was one of the great growth industries of the 1980s. At the start of that decade corporate funding of the arts in the UK was estimated at Pounds 6m. In 1991 the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, in the first fully researched survey of the field, came up with an investment of Pounds 57m. Even with the recession tightening its grip, Colin Tweedy, director general of ABSA, expects arts sponsorship this year to be around 10 per cent higher. But, in recent months, many arts organisations, which have come to rely on corporate support for a vital part of their income, are finding it much more difficult to persuade existing sponsors to increase, or extend, their support, and to attract new backers. This is the time of year when marketing budgets are fixed for 1993 and while there are few instances of sponsors withdrawing from their commitments (except when, like British &amp; Commonwealth or Olympia &amp; York, they go bust), there are even fewer examples of companies increasing their sponsorship spend. An odd situation has developed. While the figures seem to show that sponsorship is still in good heart - there has been a 16 per cent increase this year in applications for the Pounds 4m. cash in the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, the Government pump priming money designed to stimulate new sponsorships - the development officers in arts companies are finding it very hard to tie down sponsors for next year. They are worried that the experience of BP may become typical. BP was one of the biggest sponsor of the arts in the UK, with a budget last year of Pounds 1.2m. Now , beset by financial problems, it is cutting back. It feels that while it is sacking 10 per cent of its workforce it cannot be seen to be helping external arts companies. It is honouring its commitments - to the re-hangs at the Tate Gallery, to the annual portrait award at the National Portrait Gallery, to the Cardiff Singer of the Year competition, but when its sponsorships come to an end, like the BP Arts Journalism Award, and the BP Speak a Poem competition, it is not renewing, and it is taking on no new events. By next year BP's expenditure will be Pounds 750,000 and falling. BP belongs to that group of companies - in oil, property, the banks, and insurance companies - who are suffering badly at the moment and who were also traditionally keen sponsors. Fortunately there are still small and medium sized companies experimenting with arts sponsorship for the first time and Colin Tweedy is bold enough to predict that even in 1993 sponsorship spending will rise slightly. It may well be a different kind of sponsorship. Traditionally the arts could sell itself to business under one, or all, of four counts. Backing the arts offered excellent hospitality opportunities; it was good marketing, ideal for getting a corporate or brand image across; it displayed a sense of responsibility to the community and the nation; and it was also a charitable act, a good deed in a naughty world. In the current economic climate companies are much more hard-headed. Some, notably Digital, IBM, and Lloyds Bank, set targets and evaluate the effect of their sponsorship money. Digital has perhaps made the greatest commitment to sponsorship as a marketing tool, preferring it to conventional advertising. It began in 1986 by focusing on dance. As a fairly new computer company in the UK it highlighted 8,000 potential buyers for its systems. In six years it has invited 6,000 of them to one of its sponsored dance evenings where it can put down social roots, to be built on later with business presentations. Geoff Shingles, chairman of Digital, says: 'I reckon it has worked out at around Pounds 1,000 a contact'. Digital has added theatre and fine art to its sponsorship portfolio and, through its backing of tours by the European Community Youth Orchestra, has used the arts to pioneer business links in Eastern as well as Western Europe. It is now reviewing its links with the ECYO, in which it will have invested Pounds 2.5m over six years. Its belief that the arts offers an excellent marketing opportunity remains firm and it is looking for a new international sponsorship. Digital has doubled its market share in the UK in the last decade. Obviously using the cultural and social cache of the arts for entertaining business contacts is a big attraction for sponsors. Glyndebourne, and the Royal Academy, which receive no subsidy, thrive through their success at selling themselves to companies as desirable meeting points. Glyndebourne has raised Pounds 30m. for its new theatre largely from business, and although the RA is finding that sponsors are less willing to offer the full guarantee against loss on its exhibitions which it has secured in the past, it is slowly finding backers for its 1993 shows. Typically Republic National Bank of New York, which is sponsoring next months Sickert exhibition at the RA, is as much interested in its opening party as promoting a retrospective on the Camden Town School artist. Companies are aware of the antagonism which follows if directors are seen to be the main beneficiaries of arts sponsorship. Entertaining at an art exhibition, or at a concert where the staff enjoy discounts on tickets, is still acceptable but corporate membership schemes, which accounted for around Pounds 12m of the Pounds 57m spent on arts sponsorship last year, and are a more obvious directors' perk, are under review. Companies are cutting back. It can cost up to Pounds 20,000 to be a top rank Friend at the Royal Opera House and this now seems an unjustifiable extravagance. Arts organisations are having to fight hard to maintain their revenue from this source. Some, like Sadler's Wells, have introduced new schemes, like the Business Circle, which, for Pounds 1,000, enables companies to participate in bi-monthly client hunting, business-to-business meetings in the theatre, plus booking advantages. Corporate hospitality will remain central to arts sponsorship. Indeed, by adding entertainment costs on top of the direct aid to arts companies, corporate spending on the arts could easily be expanded by another Pounds 30m a year. This is regarded as money well spent. At the other extreme, charitable donations to the arts, which could also boost the total bill by another Pounds 30m, are being scaled down. Ten years ago sponsorship might well have been included in the company's charity budget, along with health, education and other good causes. Until recently Marks &amp; Spencer viewed the arts this way, seeking no promotional advantage from its aid. Now sponsorship falls more within the orbit of marketing directors which accounts for attempts to justify its value. The arts has little to fear from this tougher approach. Its generally upmarket audience has a greater appeal than sports sponsorship, which is increasingly seen as expensive, over exploited, and indiscriminate. The arts offers an audience of opinion formers, the rich, and, in its variety, the young. In spite of the recession arts sponsorship is making headway in its most challenging area: helping to sell a brand, especially to the young. In the past advertising agencies have been reluctant to recommend arts sponsorship to their clients: it cuts into their commission. That is why many consumer goods makers are low spenders on the arts. This could be changing. Beer companies, perhaps worried about eventual restrictions on advertising, have leaped in. Becks Bier has sponsored a succession of trendy art shows, such as Gilbert &amp; George at the Tate; Holsten has become heavily involved with alternative comedy; and Rolling Rock with an Arts Council tour of contemporary music. Now Haagan-Daz, the ice cream maker, has taken the plunge with the Edinburgh Film Festival. And that epitome of youth culture, Doc Martens, has just announced backing for its local Midlands dance troupe. Arts sponsorship to date has ridden the recession fairly well. Overseas companies, using the arts to integrate with British life, have helped, especially the Japanese; the Japan Festival raised around Pounds 12m. from Japanese companies. Next month's Scandinavian Festival at the Barbican set itself a sponsorship target of Pounds 250,000 and raised well over Pounds 300,000, half of it from Scandinavian companies. There is also a raft of prosperous companies, such as the newly privatised British Gas, British Telecom, (which with a Pounds 1.6m. budget is now the biggest sponsor) and the power generators, which have become enthusiastic sponsors. Certainly most of the main arts companies are keeping their heads above water. The English National Opera has found sponsors for all seven new productions in its 1992-93 season - although the cash commitment tends to be smaller than last year. The Royal National Theatre is doing fairly well in its new policy of finding backers for new productions (Oracle has just decided to sponsor the musical Carousel); and the RSC has got backing from Unilever (Pounds 50,000) for its new Hamlet as well as from Royal Mail and AT &amp; T, which should prove useful if its major supporter, Royal Insurance, decides that its six- year, Pounds 2.1m, commitment is enough. Only Covent Garden seems out of favour at the moment. Obviously the climate for sponsorship is tougher, especially in the south east. Contrastingly, the Edinburgh Festival this year increased its sponsorship to Pounds 770,000. Most sponsorships are still entered into with a vague feeling of doing good. Usually one committed senior director argues the case and wins over his colleagues. These directors are having to call on all their persuasive powers. But, if they think realistically, companies will find that, used cleverly, arts sponsorship can, for very little money, be a flexible and effective way of promoting good will, a company, and its products or services.</p>

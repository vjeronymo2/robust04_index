			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: How to play second fiddle - Recital Disarmingly, the great Itzhak Perlman's Barbican recital on Thursday began not with a solo violin sonata, but with a keyboard sonata 'with violin accompaniment'. That was Mozart's K296 in C, from the transition-period in the late 1780s when composers were starting to imagine that a single violin might actually do more than just accompany a harpsichord or piano. It might have made too tame a start, or have seemed at best a relaxed way for Perlman to play himself in. The result was quite different. The violin's role is indeed subordinate to the piano's, and with the admirable Bruno Canino at the latter instrument there was not the slightest chance that it would dwindle against his 'accompaniment'. But Perlman gave us a miraculous object-lesson in how to play second fiddle: never overweening, always answering to the pianist - but rewarding him with the most subtle and richly varied responses, even in the mostly 3-note descant of the Andante and his scrubbing, clucking accompaniment in the Rondo. The sonata acquired vital depths and breadth beyond anything one expected. As it turned out, the real partner-sonatas that followed - Faure's op. 13, his First, and Poulenc's only one - were less well balanced, though entirely engaging. Perlman was faultlessly stylish and easy; Canino, whose pianism is quick, light-fingered and very sparing with the damper-pedal (which Poulenc loved to excess), sounded appreciative but distinctly spidery. There is as much elan vital in Faure's sonata as in the famous First Piano Quartet that came on its heels; here, we missed any real thrust from the bottom of the keyboard, and therefore some of the sonata's radiant, importunate drive. There was still plenty of art, as also in the Poulenc. The composer aimed to write something that would do justice to Ginette Neveu's tigress-powers; but tigerishness was never in his nature, and Neveu had to be content (we don't know whether she was, but Poulenc himself was dissatisfied) with his racketty, mercurial operetta-style in the outer movements, and measured sentiment in the Intermezzo. Though Canino was again too wary to allow full resonance to the piano-sound, everything he did was impeccably pointed - and Perlman devoted himself to realising the exact character of every movement, rather than exploiting their virtuoso potential. On paper the programme looked short, and it was. Perlman was reserving a surprise, however: after the Poulenc, without much feinting, he launched briskly into five encore-size pieces - evergreen Sarasate, Kreisler and Heifetz, haunting Faure and Stravinsky (the Berceuse and the little 'Chanson russe'). We had to be delighted, and were almost satisfied.</p>

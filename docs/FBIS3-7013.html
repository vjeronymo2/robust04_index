			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The contents of the draft import- and  investment-promotion measures which will make up the core of the  general foreign economic measures to be finalized by the end of  this month have been revealed. A feature of the measures is  that an "import expansion action plan" (provisional name) needs  to be prepared every year and that the 1994 plan will call for  assisting foreign companies wanting to sell to Japan, improving  import facilities, and promoting imports of particular products  such as prefabricated housing and automobiles, the imports of  which can grow large. The government wants to make its  announcement of voluntary actions to expand imports not only a  step toward reducing the trade surplus but also an opportunity  to resume Japanese-U.S. economic consultations.    The general foreign economic measures are composed of four  categories of projects -- macroeconomic policies including tax  cuts, and deregulation that would lead to market liberalization;  the promotion of imports and foreign investment; the  strengthening of competition; and the improved transparency of  government procurement -- and the three priority areas of the  economic framework talks, i.e., government procurement of  medical equipment and telecommunications, automobiles and auto  parts, and insurance. These measures will be announced next week.    The promotion of imports and foreign investment, along with  the macroeconomic measures and deregulation, will become the  selling point of the measures. At a trade conference (chaired  by Prime Minister Hosokawa) meeting held last October, the  government decided on a basic policy of promoting imports. As  such, the import expansion action plans to be prepared from 1994  will become detailed plans to implement this policy.    The main points of the action plan to be prepared for 1994  are to be: 1) the deregulation of imports and foreign  investment; 2) assistance for sales to Japan by foreign  companies; 3) the expansion of consumer demand for imports; 4)  the improvement of import facilities; and 5) the promotion of  imports of specific products.</p>

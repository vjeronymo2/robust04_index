			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong puts bank up for sale THE Hong Kong government has placed Overseas Trust Bank (OTB) up for sale, offering foreign banks a rare opportunity to buy into the colony's lucrative banking market. A government spokesman said the time was ripe to return the bank to the private sector. 'It has been restored to health and should be able to perform with results comparable to other banks of its size.' OTB has 48 branches in the colony and, in the year to June 30 1991, made a net profit of HKDollars 210m (USDollars 27.7m). It is expected to fetch more than HKDollars 3.5bn. OTB was rescued by the Hong Kong government in 1985 after investigators discovered widespread fraud and false loans totalling USDollars 90m on its books. In June 1991 it still had accumulated losses of HKDollars 2.15bn. It used to be the colony's third largest listed bank after Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank, but is now comparable to the colony's two smallest listed banks Wing Lung and Dah Sing. Over the past months several local banks have expressed interest in buying OTB. Foremost among these is Dao Heng Bank, the banking subsidiary of the Guoco Group, Dah Sing, and Xiamen International Bank, owned by the provincial government of Fujian in China. But the proposed sale also represents one of the few opportunities for a foreign bank to acquire banking assets in Hong Kong. Retail banking, which is regulated by a cartel, is very profitable and OTB is in the top five in terms of size of branch network. It would also offer a foreigner a base from which to build business in China. This is restricted mainly to cross-border loans and trade finance but with the financial liberalisation under way in China there may be opportunities to expand further.</p>

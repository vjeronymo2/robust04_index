			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S CHOICE OF MCDONALD'S  </P> <P> Surprised, amazed, dumbfounded, shocked and annoyed are just a few of my  reactions to the county board's "unanimous" selection of McDonald's as the  fast-food concessionaire for the new airport facility ("Ronald McDonald Beats  Out Carl's Jr. for Airport Space," March 29). I thought that we deserved  better, much better! The best that can be said about McDonald's is that they  are consistent: consistently bland and unimaginative with a limited menu that  hasn't changed appreciably in years. McDonald's has continually promoted their  limited menu with heavy advertising and hype aimed at the very young. All hype  and nothing new just about sums up McDonald's marketing approach.  </P> <P> As a member of a large group of "full-fare" business travelers already paying a  premium to fly in and out of John Wayne Airport, I was expecting a much better  fast-food restaurant such as Carl's Jr. Certainly an Orange County-based  concessionaire with a much more diverse menu, offering higher quality  selections would have been a better choice.  </P> <P> I certainly hope that the Orange County Board of Supervisors reconsiders its  decision on this matter. At the very least, please offer us a choice by  splitting the fast-food concession between McDonald's and Carl's Jr.  </P> <P> ROGER D. GIBB  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

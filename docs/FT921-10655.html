			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Woolworths outstrips Australian rival WOOLWORTHS, Australia's second largest retailer, has announced earnings and sales figures which suggest its performance is continuing to outstrip its larger rival, Coles Myer. Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said yesterday that earnings before interest and tax had risen 9.4 per cent in the 28 weeks to January 5, while sales were up 10.8 per cent to ADollars 4.9bn (ADollars 3.68bn) in the period. 'Both sales and profit are in line with budget at this stage and we expect to achieve year-end target profit before tax of ADollars 240m, assuming economic conditions do not deteriorate further,' Mr Simons said. 'In all respects, the company is in good shape to survive the current recession and emerge strongly when the recovery comes, which we expect to be modestly evident by mid-1993.' He added: 'Woolworths' future growth will be steadier as we have passed through the rebuilding period of the last four years when significant policy changes yielded quick results on the bottom line.' The Woolworths' figures easily shaded Coles Myer which posted a 2.1 per cent sales rise for the January half.</p>

The poll, conducted by the Beijing Institute of Social  Psychology, shows that classical works like The Dream of  Red , Besieged City, Family,  Jane Eyre, and Gone With the Wind are  still the favorite books of Beijing readers.    The poll received replies from 720 Beijing citizens, among  whom are factory workers, government employees, students,  teachers, researchers and company employees. Of them, 89.7  percent received high school and university educations.    The poll shows that Qian Zhongshu, Liang Shiqiu and Lu Xun  are the preferred writers for younger readers, followed by San  Mao of Taiwan, Wang Shuo, the native Beijing writer, and Liang  Yusheng and Jin Yong, both writers of Gongfu novels.    Beijing's middle-aged and older readers, however, like Lao  She, Ba Jin and Lu Xun the most, followed by Ding Ling, Bing Xin  and Zhou Zuoren. All of them are native writers.    The poll also sought out people's attitudes towards the  increasing descriptions of sex in newly published literary books.    The poll found that nearly half of the Beijing readers hold  a  noncommittal attitude -- "not good, not bad" -- toward lengthy  sex descriptions, while one-third of the readers marked it as "a  bad thing," and 18 percent as "a good thing."    Among those against sex descriptions, 32.6 percent said that  it is pandering to bad tastes, 30.2 percent said it does not  conform to the Chinese way of expression, and 11.2 percent said  it will lead to precocity in love affairs and even sexual  assaults.    Among the surveyed readers in favor of more sex descriptions  gave different reasons, 33.3 percent saying sex is a normal  human need, another 20.5 percent saying sex is one of the  beautiful things in human life, and 5.3 percent saying sex can  make people forget unpleasant things.    When asked of the relations between their purchasing  behavior  and the purpose of their reading, 44.6 percent of the readers  said they buy books according to their interest, and 34.7  percent said their first consideration is practical use, while  only 3.6 percent said they select books according to popularity.    Whereas popularity has for a time seemed to become the sole  standard for publishers in making choices, organizers of the  poll said their investigation is aimed at providing a more  realistic guide for the publishers.</p>

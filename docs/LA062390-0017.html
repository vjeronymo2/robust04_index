			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAN FOR REGIONAL MALL ABANDONED BY ITS DEVELOPER  </P> <P> A developer has dropped plans to open a regional shopping mall in the Santa  Clarita Valley, saying the area could not support both his project and another  mall already planned by Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. in Valencia.  </P> <P> "It wasn't by choice," Carl Nelson, vice president of Santa Fe Development Co.,  said Friday of the company's decision to abandon its mall proposal. He said the  company also found that it simply could not compete with Newhall Land, the  largest developer in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Santa Fe now intends to build a 100-acre shopping complex with discount stores  such as Mervyn's, Price Club and Home Club, Nelson said. The site is located in  Canyon Country, east of the Antelope Valley Freeway and Golden Valley Road. The  company also plans an 18-hole golf course and at least 1,000 residential units  in an adjoining development.  </P> <P> Santa Fe announced plans for a regional mall last December, setting the stage  for a bidding war with Newhall Land, which is trying to lure upscale department  stores to its $180-million mall, planned for 80 acres near McBean Parkway and  Valencia Boulevard.  </P> <P> The bidding war never materialized. Many retailers had either committed  themselves to Newhall Land or were reluctant to talk business with Santa Fe  because another mall already was in the works, Nelson said. Among mall builders  there is "an unwritten code that they don't pirate tenants away" once another  mall is in progress, he said.  </P> <P> May Co. has already signed up for the Newhall Land project, and Newhall is  negotiating with J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears Roebuck and Co. The first phase  of the Newhall mall, set to open in the spring of 1992, will include the May  Co., a movie theater, restaurants and other stores, said Marlee Lauffer, a  Newhall Land spokeswoman.  </P> <P> There is no scheduled opening for the second phase which, Newhall Land  officials hope, will include upscale department stores. The company has already  approached Nordstrom, Robinson's and Bullock's, Lauffer said. "We're not in the  negotiating stage, but we are talking to them," she said.  </P></p>

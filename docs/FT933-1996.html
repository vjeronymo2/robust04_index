			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Wang out of Chapter 11 protection WANG Laboratories, once a leading US maker of minicomputers and word processors, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday as a slimmed-down supplier of software for office computer systems. Wang's rehabilitation was completed after it received court approval for a financial restructuring agreed with its creditors. Unsecured creditors owed Dollars 450m have exchanged their claims for ownership of the company, with the issuance of 30m new shares. Holders of the company's ordinary B and C shares have been left with warrants, exerciseable into 20 per cent of Wang's shares in seven years and nine months. The company said these were 'not expected to be worth more than a few cents'. Both the shares and warrants will be traded on Nasdaq. Wang sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code in August 1992, when it had debt of around Dollars 500m.</p>

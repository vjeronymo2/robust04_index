			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEN. ROBERTI'S BILL TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLE  </P> <P> AK-47s and other assault rifles ought to be banned whether automatic or  semi-automatic. What possible justification is there for a person to possess  this kind of firepower?  </P> <P> Our country is an embarrassment to the world in one regard. We are a much too  violent country and have an incredible murder rate.  </P> <P> Let's support gun control locally, statewide and, most importantly if we want  to be effective, federally. We need to support our police, who are presently  outgunned by the criminals.  </P> <P> State Sen. David A. Roberti's bill is a start. It has passed the Senate, and  now a weaker version of the Los Angeles Democrat's bill is making its way  through the Assembly. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has been  identified as a possible swing vote.  </P> <P> I call on all in the 70th Assembly District to let Assemblyman Ferguson know  that we want the stricter Roberti bill. Gov. George Deukmejian has indicated,  in a qualified way, that he would sign the anti-assault rifle bill. We should  all encourage him to do so.  </P> <P> ANNE COX-CLASBY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

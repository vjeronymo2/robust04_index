			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING ON REDISTRICTING  </P> <P> Speaking of doublespeak in the supervisorial candidate debate on radio, Sarah  Flores talks like a politician, walks like a politician and was on the payroll  of an entrenched politician carrying out his political orders for umpteen years  -- but she is "not a politician" she keeps whining.  </P> <P> I have news for you, Sarah. The voters will win if they elect a good  politician, and lose if they elect a non-thinking "non-politician."  </P> <P> ROSEMARY QUESADA-WEINER  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

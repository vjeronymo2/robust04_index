			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Self-employed 'far more likely' to be poor The growth in self-employment in the 1980s has increased the proportion of self-employed who are women, young people or formerly unemployed, says a report published today. The Institute of Manpower Studies says that much of the growth has been in parts of the service sector where earnings and business survival prospects are low. This means that a self-employed person is more than three times as likely to be in the poorest tenth of the workforce than an employee, the institute says. Many of the self-employed end up with low incomes and savings in retirement, having failed to build up pension entitlement outside the state scheme. This includes people who have spent only short periods in sectors such as distribution, hotels and catering. The report says that a larger proportion of the working population experiences self-employment than in other European countries. Self-employment nearly doubled in the 1980s, with one in eight working people self-employed by the end of the decade. About a fifth of those who became self-employed during this period were previously unemployed, a much higher proportion than in the rest of Europe. Women now account for more than a quarter of the self-employed, compared with a fifth in 1979. An increasing proportion of new entrants to self-employment were people under 35, with an even sharper increase among the under-25s. The report, commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, says that the self-employed are over-represented in both the richest and poorest 10 per cent of incomes. Those at the top end of the income distribution are more likely to be men working in sectors such as banking, finance, business services and construction. Those at the bottom end of the income distribution are more likely to be women in services such as hairdressing and cleaning, and in manufacturing trades such as the clothing industry. The report concludes that the expansion of self-employment has contributed to the growing inequality of earned incomes in the UK. Self-employment and the distribution of income.

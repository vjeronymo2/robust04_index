			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Government of the Republic of Armenia Press </F> Service--ARMENPRESS report: "Egyptian Commercial Center To Be  Set Up in Yerevan"]    [Text] A group of experts from the Republic of Armenia  Ministry of Light Industry, headed by Minister Rudolf  Teymurazyan, spent several days in the Arab Republic of Egypt.  The purpose of the trip was to study the possibility of and  prospects for Armenian-Egyptian cooperation. The Armenian  delegation met with Egypt's deputy minister of foreign affairs,  minister of industry, minister of the economy, and minister of  foreign trade, chairman of the Egyptian parliament's permanent  commission for economic and energy issues, members of this  country's business circles, and bankers.    These meetings were in a way a continuation of the agreement  signed between Armenia and Egypt in 1992. Questions discussed in  the course of the meetings with Egypt's officials and members of  business circles went beyond the boundaries of the sphere of  light industry of both countries (cooperation in banking, trade  agreements, etc.).    In the course of the visit, a protocol was signed with the  Egyptian Ministry of Industry which elaborates in detail  economic cooperation between the two countries. In particular,  the Armenian side undertook an obligation to set up in Yerevan  an Egyptian commercial center where samples of Egyptian products  will be displayed. This will provide an opportunity for Armenian  industrialists, trade organizations, and all businessmen to  learn about them and discuss on the spot the possibility of  starting up joint enterprises or simply organizing sales of  these goods in Armenia. It is envisaged that the center, which  will be set up with the direct participation of the Republic of  Armenia Ministry of Light Industry, will begin operations as  early as May. An agreement was also reached on setting up a  similar center in Egypt where Armenia will be able to  demonstrate its products.    Also discussed were issues of signing an interbank agreement  and setting up a direct air link between Yerevan and Cairo.    As to the package of issues within the purview of the  Ministry of Light Industry itself, the first steps have already  been taken. The question of purchases of cotton in Egypt was  discussed in detail, and an agreement reached on prices. The  agreements have not yet been signed for purely technical  reasons: It has not yet been determined which organization will  be delivering raw materials from Alexandria to Yerevan.    "I hope that this matter will be resolved in the near  future," said the minister. "We are planning to host a visit of  Egyptian experts within a month, who will study the capacities  of our spinning factories. In short, the first steps have been  made. I am convinced that Armenian-Egyptian cooperation will  prove mutually beneficial and has great prospects."</p>

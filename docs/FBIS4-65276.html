			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Claudia Roth, Alliance/Greens top candidate </F> for the European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler;  place and date not given: "Opponents Are the Right-Wing  Extremists"]    [Text] Claudia Roth considers herself to be a  "passionate European." As an opponent of Maastricht, however,  the Alliance 90/Greens top candidate for the European Parliament  [EP] elections on 12 June sees this treaty as a symbol of an  undemocratic European Union [EU] that helps rather than hinders  right-wing nationalists. Eight German Greens went to Strasbourg  in 1989 as members of the European Parliament and two have since  joined other parliamentary groups. Karl-Otto Sattler spoke with  39-year-old Claudia Roth.    [Sattler] You and other Green members of the European  Parliament have filed an appeal in Karlsruhe for a  constitutional review of the Maastricht Treaty--like the  nationalist and anti-European Manfred Brunner. Is it a  comfortable feeling to be in such company?    [Roth] I was never in league with Mr. Brunner. We filed a  constitutional appeal against Maastricht because we are for  Europe; Brunner did so because he is against Europe and because  he wants the national option. I am passionately for Europe but I  am equally convinced that this Europe cannot be achieved with a  European Union that is thoroughly undemocratic. For me,  Maastricht is a symbol of that kind of undemocratic structure. I  fear that this helps rather than hinders right-wing nationalists.    [Sattler] It is mostly criticism of the EU--of the EU's  environmental, asylum, and transportation policies--that is  forthcoming from the Greens. Do you, in fact, have a positive,  pro-European perspective?    [Roth] In a time of renationalization of politics, it is our  job to present a European option in contrast to these  tendencies. It has to be a democratic option, however. At issue,  for example, is a true separation of powers--a fundamental  element of democracy that is not built into the EU. Moreover,  our understanding of Europe extends beyond the EU; our concern  is to overcome the division of Europe as a whole--a task that is  urgent following the collapse of the former East Bloc.    [Sattler] What kind of politics have the Greens engaged in  thus far in Strasbourg: Principled opposition or  realpolitik?    [Roth] Both, and that is not at all a contradiction. In many  areas we have introduced a fundamentally different approach and  formulated alternatives based on different principles. In our  case, for example, the debate about an integrated ecology policy  is very much further advanced than it is in the Bundestag. We  have also engaged in realpolitik by introducing  amendments on the most diverse subjects.    [Sattler] Were there specific instances of success?    [Roth] We have had some successes. Caution is advised, to be  sure, so that one does not get caught up too much in this farce.  If someone thinks that he can be a real parliamentary  representative here, he is, in my view, falling for a stage  production. A European Union theater piece is being quickly  staged and that is dangerous. For me, a success is when, for  example, after preliminary work with the other parliamentary  groups, we pass a very good resolution in a current affairs  debate on the situation in Turkey that then mobilizes the public  there and helps individual people. Of course, as a member of the  European Parliament I cannot draft any real laws, but you have  to be aware of that in advance. I also function a little bit as  a kind of extraparliamentary opposition in a parliament that is  not very democratic.    [Sattler] What are the Greens' main points of emphasis in  the  election campaign? Who is your opponent?    [Roth] Our opponents in the election campaign are all those  who fool around with rightist, right-wing extremist, and racist  ideologies. We fight for a Europe in which all citizens have the  same rights. We oppose a Europe with ethnic hierarchies. We  commit ourselves to the democratization of the EU. And we want  to overcome the division of Europe as a whole: East Europe must  be included. Then there is an issue that no longer seems to be  very attractive but that is very important for us--the  ecological restructuring of industrial society--and starting at  the European level.    [Sattler] Elections for the European Parliament function for  the most part as elections in which voters send a message  regarding domestic political issues--something which the Greens  can also profit from. Will people vote on 12 June for your party  for reasons of European policy at all?    [Roth] I hope very much so. But you are right, that is a  real  sore spot. As a matter of fact, it is hardly about Europe at  all. Basically, it is a kind of preliminary Bundestag election.  In the campaign, I am striving to have our party--our  clients--deal with Europe. Even among Greens people often still  persist in thinking along national lines. Many citizens have no  idea of the far-reaching influence of European policy on every  individual. That is why we say: Concern yourselves with Europe,  take Europe seriously!</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: WHAT A MERE $4.5 MILLION COULD DO  </P> <P> Watching Los Angeles County's supervisors try to preserve the flimsy remains of  their health care system this week, I wondered if another $4.5 million might  save some threatened clinics.  </P> <P> I didn't pull that figure out of the air. It's the minimum in taxpayers'  dollars the supervisors have channeled into their legal defense against the  U.S. Justice Department's charge that they rigged district boundaries to  exclude Latinos from the board.  </P> <P> So far, the legal expenses have been money down the drain. A federal judge  ruled against the supervisors after a long trial. But the supes -- the kind of  clients lawyers love -- aren't giving up. They're appealing, starting the long,  expensive process they hope takes them to the U.S. Supreme Court. Their  lawyers, I bet, hope so, too.  </P> <P> But what if they hadn't resisted the Justice Department's attempt to create a  supervisorial district that would assure a Latino being elected to the board?  What if, instead, they'd used the $4.5 million to partially ease the impact of  $138 million in reductions in state aid to the county made by Gov. George  Deukmejian and the Legislature? How much difference would a few million dollars  make in a county budget totaling almost $10 billion?  </P> <P> Plenty.  </P> <P> For instance, the $4.5 million would more than cover the $3.39 million in cuts  that the county mental health department has recommended for the San Fernando  Valley Mental Health Clinic in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> The clinic, the only such facility in the entire Valley, serves the poorest of  the mentally ill, those without health insurance, not even eligible for  Medi-Cal aid from the government. Outpatient care, including prescriptions and  counseling, keeps them sane. Their families also receive counseling, which  helps the patients maintain a tenuous grasp on normal life.  </P> <P> Or the supervisors could use the money in another part of the county. It would  take just $877,454 to preserve present services at another facility designated  for extinction, a center in Baldwin Park which provides short-term residential  care for the San Gabriel Valley's mentally ill. Compton's clinic could remain  in full operation for $963,000. Just $1.9 million would save a well-known, old  mental health facility, the Gateways Mental Health Center in Echo Park, from  recommended cuts.  </P> <P> Less than $1 million would preserve services at a county-operated evaluation  center at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, where the mentally ill go in  a crisis for evaluation. The center is the only such screening facility for the  San Gabriel and Pomona valleys and East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Mental health care, of course, isn't the only county service that could use  part of the $4.5 million. County government operates parks, the Sheriff's  Department, the jails, the courts. The cuts in state aid are hitting most of  these.  </P> <P> I looked through a list of requests from the county lawmakers, programs and  projects they'd like to finance if money was available.  </P> <P> One was for $400,000 to develop a trail from the Santa Clara River to Castaic  Creek in the far northern Valley -- with more than enough left for $344,000 to  put more employees in the parks at nights and on weekends.  </P> <P> A $131,000 request would go to About Face, which serves seriously emotionally  disturbed children in the San Gabriel Valley. And $438,000 would pay for a gang  alternatives program in the Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> I could give you more figures, but I'm sure you get the idea.  </P> <P> Aside from the reduction in services, there are two other issues involved.  </P> <P> One is representative government. Although the supervisors hold open hearings  on appropriations, there were no such sessions on paying lawyers to press on  with the the redistricting fight. That's because the supervisors said they were  entitled to confidentiality when discussing a lawsuit. In this case, taxpayers  didn't get to say whether they wanted the money spent on legal fees or other  services.  </P> <P> Second, the supervisors made an open-ended financial commitment: $4.5 million  represents the minimum price.  </P> <P> It could grow. Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose job was threatened by the  redistricting plan favored by the board's majority, was provided a lawyer to  represent his interests -- at taxpayer expense. And if the county ultimately  loses, a court might order the supervisors' to pay the multimillion-dollar  legal fees run up by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican  American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the plaintiffs in the  redistricting case.  </P> <P> No, the gloomy county fiscal picture could not have been transformed by  abandoning the expensive redistricting fight. The state cuts were too great for  that. But at least the money would have provided a Band-Aid for some rather  severe wounds. The supervisors had other priorities.  </P></p>

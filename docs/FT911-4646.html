			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): Why prefunded is preferred - Europe OCCUPATIONAL PENSION schemes in Europe are generally financed in one of three ways: prefunded arrangements - insured or non-insured - as in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands; book reserves as in Germany and Austria; and pay-as-you-go, as in France. Book reserves and pay-as-you-go may work very well while population and economy are growing, employment is high, and interest rates are low. But with an increasingly ageing population in western Europe and many countries in recession, prefunded arrangements will not only give greater security to the workforce but will become more necessary as company profit margins are squeezed and individuals are required to contribute more towards their pensions. The European Community, keen to promote the idea of funded pensions, is working on draft directives to encourage them. Several European countries (other than those with a tradition of funded schemes) have recently been dipping their toes in the water. Following legislation in Portugal in 1986 which required the external funding of any new pension plans, tax incentives were introduced in 1987 to encourage the funding of existing plans as well. Double tax relief was given for a one-year period and according to Mr George Clare of Euracs (European Actuarial Consultancy Services), this incentive worked. However, investment portfolios must include at least 50 per cent of state-issued securities. Spain introduced pensions legislation in 1988 with tax incentives for 'qualified' - funded - plans. However, the fact that labour representation on the control commissIon which governs the pension scheme must be greater than employer representation has not gone down well with employers. Tax relief for employees at an upper limit of Pta500,000 (cPounds 2,500) is also reckoned to be too low while employers can receive tax relief on their contributions only if that to each individual is identifiable. As a result, very few schemes have registered. In Belgium, a royal decree in May 1985 prohibited the future establishment of book reserve schemes, mainly due to concern over lack of employee protection in the event of bankruptcy. The most commonly used financing methods in Belgium are group insurance contracts, self-administered funds (ASBLs) and deposit administration contracts. Insurance companies have slightly more freedom in their investments than pension funds but many of the larger companies choose to fund their pensions through ASBLs. Austria, which in the past has relied heavily on book reserves, plans to achieve 50 per cent capitalisation of its book reserve schemes over the next 20 years. To encourage implementation of the process, employers receive favourable tax treatment. For example, if at least 1,000 employees are members of a pension fund and total contributions are limited to 10 per cent of total payroll, then employers' contributions will be fully tax-deductible. Pension monies in Switzerland are now required by law to be deposited in a foundation and administered separately from the company. Restrictions on pension fund investment were lifted in 1989 so that 30 per cent of fund assets may now be invested in foreign shares (previously 10 per cent). As a result, it has been suggested that Switzerland's stock exchange could be dominated by pension fund money by the year 2000. The same is true of Sweden. In the past the range of pension investments has been controlled by SPP, an insurance company regulated by the government, and the unions - 'an unholy alliance,' says Mr Clare of Euracs. 'Imagine a situation in the UK where the employers had no say,' he says. (The SPP also administers a book reserve scheme). There is talk of freeing restrictions on investment in equities and again it is believed that this could lead to the stock exchange being dominated by pension funds money. Even the situation in France and Germany is changing. In France, while the modified pay-as-you-go scheme, repartition, still provides the bulk of pension provision, according to Mr Jonathon Heller of Prudential Corporate Pensions, an increasing number of pension plans - both final salary and money purchase - are being financed on a prefunded basis. Although nearly 70 per cent of German companies provide pensions on a book reserve basis, there are a few pension funds (pensionskasse), similar to those in the UK. Some are old: for example, that of the giant chemical company, Hoechst, dates from the 1880s and has 75,000 members. But development of pension funds in Germany has been hindered by restrictions on investment. Only 20 per cent of a fund may be invested in equities. Recent moves to increase this amount to 30 per cent were rejected by the government after lobbying by the BAV (the insurance regulatory board). However, the ageing population, and perhaps more importantly, the costs of reunification are likely to lead to demands for employees to contribute to occupational schemes (they cannot contribute to book reserves) with a consequent demand for separate funding. There are about 60 EC draft directives affecting pension schemes and benefit practice and these are currently going through at the rate of one a month. In July last year a directive on the freedom of capital movements was followed by a keynote speech from Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner responsible for financial institutions and competition, which outlined three goals: that there should be full freedom to provide the services of managing pension funds; that there should be full freedom of cross-border investment and pension fund assets and that there should be full freedom of cross-border membership of pension funds. With the experience that UK fund managers have of unrestricted investment, they should be well-placed to take advantage of any easing of restrictions in this regard. A study carried out by consulting actuaries R Watson last year showed that the total assets of UK pension funds exceeded the sum total of all the rest of the EC members' pension funds put together. It is perhaps ironic that at the same time that other European countries are moving towards funded schemes, Britain with its earnings cap is placing some companies in the position of having to set up unfunded schemes for high-flying executives.</p>

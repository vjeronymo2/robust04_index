			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's largest port  of Shanghai has established sistership ties with Pusan Port of  the Republic of Korea (ROK).    A signing ceremony to the effect was held here Tuesday [12  April].    The Shanghai port has so far set up sistership ties with  eight foreign ports. The previous seven are the ports of  Seattle, New Orleans, the New Jersey Port in the United States,  Osaka and Yokohama in Japan, Antwerp in Belgium and Marseilles  in France.    As the biggest port in the ROK, Pusan Port handled a total  of  almost 70 million ton of goods last year.    Since the two countries set up diplomatic relations in 1991  and especially since Shanghai and Pusan became sister cities in  1993, trade between the two sides has increased greatly.    The two ports pledged to further their co-operation in  shipping, technology, information and personnel exchanges.</p>

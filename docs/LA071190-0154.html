			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MADONNA'S GARB, ACT STIRS HOT ITALIAN BLOOD, AND IT'S NEGATIVE  </P> <P> Rock star Madonna's "Blond Ambition" tour arrived in Italy to a  less-than-sellout crowd after weeks of protests against her by Roman Catholic  organizations.  </P> <P> And she canceled a second planned performance in Rome because of low ticket  sales and a threatened general strike by labor unions.  </P> <P> The show has angered the church and pro-family groups that object to the  lingerie-clad Madonna using a crucifix and other Christian symbols during her  sexually suggestive performance.  </P> <P> Madonna, an Italian-American, tried to win over the concert crowd Tuesday night  by donning the No. 15 jersey of Italian soccer star Roberto Baggio and by  occasionally speaking Italian during the show.  </P> <P> Scalpers sold tickets at cost or less. Police estimate there were 30,000 people  at Flaminio stadium, which has a capacity of 32,000. "The controversy has  gravely damaged the take," said David Zard, Madonna's promoter in Italy.  </P> <P> The state-run RAI television network dropped plans to record the concert for  future broadcast.  </P> <P> "My blood boils when I am misunderstood and judged unfairly for my  convictions," Madonna said before the concert.  </P></p>

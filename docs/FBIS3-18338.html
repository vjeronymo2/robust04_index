			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in the </F> Parliament in Vienna -- live]    [Text] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen; yesterday's  conclusion of EU [European Union] membership talks has opened  the door to the EU for Austria. Austria's way into a united  Europe is as old as the entire Second Republic. This way led  from the European Reconstruction Program, the Marshall Plan, to  the establishment of EFTA [European Free Trade Association],  from the association negotiations in the 1960's and the signing  of the Free Trade Agreement by the first Kreisky government up  to the European Economic Area that came into effect last year.  All these efforts show that for Austria it has always been a  fact that peace, stability, and prosperity can only be developed  and maintained together with the other democracies in Europe.  Let me stress the words together and democracies. The history  of this century has shown it was democracies that did not wage  wars against each other. Developments in the east and southeast  of our continent since the collapse of communism have confirmed  this attitude. The great challenges of our time can only be  tackled by joint solutions. This is true for securing Austria  as a business location, for safeguarding our social network, as  well as for protecting our environment, for future-oriented  transport and energy policies, and for participating in the next  steps in research and development. If our country does not want  to remain isolated in this situation, there is only one possible  decision, namely a clear declaration in favor of integration and  a declaration to participate actively in the dynamic development  of the EU after joining. If we take part in this European  dynamic and contribute our creativity, hard work, and experience  to the European entity, then we will have a share in creating  the great projects at the turn of the millennium and continue  playing our historic role in the very heart of the continent.    I think that on this important and decisive day we must also  state that these great projects in the world go beyond the  horizons of the EU. Nothing should be further from our minds  than Euro-centredness or the idea of an isolated fortress called  European Union. These projects and the efforts they involve  require the inclusion of the reform states in a joint area of  stability, prosperity, and democracy, as well as the opening up  to the dynamic new economic areas in East and Southeast Asia and  in Latin America and the restructuring of our relations with the  nations of the South.    Ladies and Gentlemen, 50 years ago the survivors of two  world  wars set their hopes on a united Europe. Their aim was to have  no more wars. And their way led to European integration. In  this community, nations that had been at war for centuries were  reconciled; and it secured for those nations that shed the  burden of dictatorship their place in Europe. This made the EU  the guarantor of peace and security for its members. Austria --  while keeping its neutrality -- has the opportunity to become a  member of this peace community and to participate in its  extension to form a framework of security including all of  Europe. [applause] It has become unthinkable today that citizens  of the EU fight wars against each other, shoot at each other.  This makes the Community -- beside all economic, social, and  ecological tasks -- a great peace project. Especially in view  of all the uncertainties prevailing not far from our country, we  will have a conscious share in this peace project and help form  it. [applause]    It is fashionable to complain about the lack of grand  concepts and visions in the sphere of politics. I would like to  ask the following question: What, if not the peaceful  unification of the continent where we are living, what, if not  the growing together of the most different peoples and cultures,  should be such a prospect, a task that is worth devotion.  However, there are naturally also numerous practical reasons  why the Austrian Government suggests to the Austrians that they  should join the European Union, why the Austrian Government  works to achieve this goal, and makes such a great effort.    I would like to make the following very clear today: In the  past few days, weeks, and months, Austria explained,  safeguarded, and ensured its interests with toughness,  consistence, and determination. The negotiations have shown  that we Austrians can join forces and cooperate if need be.  [applause]    We can state with some satisfaction today that we will  integrate in the European Union what is important for us  Austrians, that we will enjoy the advantages, but that we will  also assume the obligations that are linked with membership. I  strongly hope and believe the tough negotiations that were  occasionally observed critically by foreign and domestic  newspapers will turn into respect for Austria in the long run.  [applause]    It is also important at this point for us to say that, in  view of our commitment and our intention to participate in an  open Europe, in a market without frontiers, this opens up  numerous opportunities for our producers and consumers, but it  naturally also represents new challenges, and it will be  necessary to adapt as a result of the opening of the market.  Measures are required to make it possible for those who would  otherwise be facing difficulties to adapt to the new situation.  I would like to stress that these changes are necessary whether  we become members of the European Union or not. However, the  market will be opened up in such a way that we can safeguard and  expand our cultural and ecological interests. Austria will  adhere to its own regulations, but it will also integrate them  into a larger Europe, in cultural diversity. We will and want  to preserve and expand our pioneering role as an exemplary  welfare state and our pioneering role in the environmental  sphere.    Above all, Austria, this small country at the heart of  Europe  comprising barely 8 million people and whose name [Oesterreich]  is too long for the ordinary globes used in schools, this  country will participate in a large market of 320 million which  would be much more difficult to access without membership in the  European Union.    The foreign minister has just mentioned the major points of  the outcome of the talks in Brussels. Let me add one thing:  Austria's social, environmental, and health standards will  continue to be valid. Moreover, the European Union has for the  first time in its history stipulated an ecological goal in an  agreement. The foreign minister pointed this out. I would like  to underline his statement about Austria's intention to stick to  the ban of the use of nuclear energy and to continue its  commitment to a nuclear-free Central Europe.    For the future economic and social development of our  country the conclusion of the negotiations sets a substantially  new course. The full participation in the large single European  market as a partner with equal rights will permit Austria to use  for our benefit all the advantages that this common Europe  offers. At the same time, it eliminates the existing  disadvantages of isolation and rules out the danger of future  discrimination. In particular it guarantees that Austria will  be able to continue to take advantage of being even more  attractive as an economic center at the point where East meets  West, which will have a positive impact on developments on the  labor market. We will conduct a most intensive and enlightening  discussion with those citizens who sometimes anxiously ask  themselves why we are seeking membership in an economic area  whose average unemployment rate is higher than that of Austria.  These questions need to be answered -- we will provide the  answers.    Existing export barriers will fall, cooperation agreements  between companies will be essentially facilitated through the  harmonization of taxes and a common trade policy. Thus, the  significant competitive disadvantages for Austrian enterprises,  which are the result of the complicated European regulations of  origin, will disappear. The elimination of customs and border  checks will not only cut billions in expenses on the part of the  enterprises but will result in sizable price advantages for the  consumers, particularly in the area of foods, beverages, and  tobacco, and articles in daily use, which is why low-income  earners, in particular, will benefit from these lower prices.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the citizens often ask us politicians:  You always tell us about the advantages of our participation in  European integration. There must also be disadvantages, which  you must not conceal. We will not conceal them, and I would  like to take this opportunity to mention one point, namely that  there will be disadvantages, but that we will be able to  eliminate them and cope with them. Regarding peoples' worries  about a danger to the security of our country as a result of the  elimination of border checks, that it is up to the Austrian  Federal Government and, together with other governments through  cooperation between interior ministries and security  authorities, to provide other, new kinds of checks, so that the  citizens' fears of the elimination of border checks can be  dispelled.    Ladies and Gentlemen, I would finally like to point to the  considerable increase in prosperity that will follow from  Austria's accession to the European Union, and which, according  to provisional calculations by the Austrian Economic Research  Institute, will amount to some 50 billions net for the next five  years. This would constitute an additional economic growth of 2  percent and create some 30,000 new jobs. The gradual  implementation of economic and monetary union will lead to  further income gains.    Ladies and Gentlemen, this brings me back to my remark that  the conclusion of the negotiations in Brussels has opened the  door toward European Union. Whether, we will finally walk  through this door will have to be determined by the Austrian  people in a democratic decision. Until then a lot remains to be  done. Many citizens of our country already have an opinion on  the issue. Yet we also want to get the support of those  citizens who still hesitate or who do not or not yet want to  accompany us on the road to Europe. Therefore, we will have to  lead a very open discussion. After all, the point is not to try  to talk people into something but to convince people of a path  that we regard as the better path for the future, and, by  meeting our responsibility as the Austrian Government, we are  convinced that we have to pursue this objective. Together with  the other countries of the European Union, and probably also  with the north European countries, this path should lead us into  a common and peaceful European future. [applause]</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Dublin questions exclusion order THE IRISH government will today ask British ministers to explain why the Home Office has served an 'exclusion order' on a man cleared of an attempted taxi bomb attack on Downing Street. The case of Mr John Matthews, who was flown to Belfast yesterday, is set to be raised at an Anglo-Irish conference meeting in London, possibly souring relations between the two governments. Mr Matthews was freed by magistrates on Tuesday when the prosecution offered no evidence on a charge that he ordered a taxi driver to take a bomb to Downing Street.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS FOR TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> In arguing against term limitations, Polsby states that "term limitations throw  away the benefits of learning from experience."  </P> <P> Exactly! What poor Polsby doesn't seem to understand is that this is the very  reason we want to limit terms of our elected representatives. And what are the  major things our representatives learn from experience? How to get reelected by  getting money from powerful special interests, how to build up their personal  power bases at public expense, how to use their offices for personal gain, etc.  </P> <P> TOM KILLGROVE  </P> <P> Frazier Park  </P></p>

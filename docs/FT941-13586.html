			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Observer: Tongue-tied in Frankfurt Poor old Gunter Baer. The secretary-general of the European central bank governors' committee was thought to have sewn up the director-general's job at the European Monetary Institute. His committee had carried out most of the functions now transferred to the EMI and everyone seemed to think that he had acquitted himself perfectly well in the old job. But Baer has now fallen prey to a familiar problem for international job hunters. In return for Frankfurt getting the EMI, France gets to tighten its iron grip on the international financial jobs which matter. Robert Raymond, a senior Bank of France official, will be nodded through as the EMI's director-general at next month's council meeting in Basle. In his early 60s, Raymond is a distinguished former head of research at the French central bank and currently in charge of its credit department. Hence no one doubts his ability  - and his advanced years could save the European taxpayer big redundancy payments in an institution that is due to be abolished if and when Europe adopts economic and monetary union. However, the job is supposed to be a hands-on affair that could involve, among other things, a good deal of negotiation with local worthies. Pity Raymond can't speak the lingo.</p>

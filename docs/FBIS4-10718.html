			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Soraya Alencar in Brasilia, and Helena Vieira in </F> New York]    [Text] Brasilia -- After 11 years of negotiations, Brazil  will today close in New York the most important foreign debt  agreement ever reached with private creditors. D day is today,  as the old debt titles will be exchanged for the restructured  debt bonds. This means that the last four agreements are no  longer valid, and Brazil will come to pay the renegotiated debt,  which is made up of five kinds of different bonds. These bonds  can even be used in the privatization program.    According to the new agreement Brazil will have up to 30  years to pay approximately $51 billion, of which $35 billion  must be paid to 800 foreign private banks. In the negotiations  with the creditor banks Brazil obtained two unprecedented  concessions: First, the payment of the guarantees in  installments, a clause which until now had never before been  obtained by any country. From a total $4.6 billion that the  country must pay, Brazil will disburse $2.8 billion today. The  remaining $1.6 billion will be paid in four installments over 2  years.    Another triumph for Brazil was closing the deal without  first  obtaining IMF approval, as foreseen in one of the clauses.  Despite the efforts by former Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, who travelled to Washington last month, IMF  approval was not obtained. After consulting all the creditors  the steering committee of creditor banks reported that the  closing of the deal was being effected independently from IMF  approval.    Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who has been responsible  for the debt negotiations over the past two years, said in New  York today that the current agreement ends the chronic problem  of the foreign debt. His advisers say that in the next six  years, until the interest on some of the bonds begins to be  paid, the Brazilian Government will be able to heave a sigh of  relief and gain the time to stabilize the economy.    But Brazil still has other concerns in the foreign field.  The agreement with the Paris Club, which groups official  creditors, depends on an agreement with the IMF. The Brazilian  Government also needs to reach an agreement with the Dart  family, the greatest non-financial private creditor of Brazil.  The Dart family holds $1.4 billion worth of old debt titles,  and it does not accept the exchange conditions proposed by  Brazil. Brazil fears that the Dart family may file a lawsuit  demanding the immediate payment of the debt, or that it may  prevent the exchange of the debt documents today.    Pedro Malan, who yesterday arrived in New York, did not want  to confirm that everything was ready for the exchange of the  debt titles. In order to protect the Brazilian reserves  deposited abroad, the Central Bank has instructed the banks that  operate with exchange to deposit the surplus of the reserves  purchased abroad in the name of the Brazilian American Merchant  Bank, a Bank of Brazil subsidiary headquartered in the Cayman  Islands, a fiscal paradise safe from legal actions.</p>

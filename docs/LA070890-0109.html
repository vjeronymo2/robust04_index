			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRATULATIONS TO HONOR STUDENT  </P> <P> Although I do not come from Ecuador, and West San Antonio was my barrio and not  Carmelitos Housing Project, I also lived through the exhilaration of earning a  perfect high school academic transcript (San Antonio Vocational and Technical  High School, now "Fox High") in June, 1956, and shortly afterward found myself  "young, talented and Mexican" at Texas A &amp; M and Rice universities. (The  term Hispanics had not yet been "invented.")  </P> <P> We had no trouble in calling ourselves poor Mexicans in Texas. Fierce  uncomplicatedness or lack of sophistication?  </P> <P> For 2 1/2 years I worked as a staff mathematician at TRW in Houston before  coming here to work for Fluor and go to UCLA. Good things can happen.  </P> <P> It was a pleasure to read your article "4.0 Student Breaks Free of Housing  Project Stereotypes" (The Times, June 28). I thank you for the article and  congratulate the spirit of Viviana Arellano, a courageous and intelligent  person.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, many in the larger population believe that such personal  adaptation to reality as she perceived it constitutes "elitism" and that she  should "stay in her place."  </P> <P> I suggest to Arellano that she should develop personal leadership and teaching  potential so as to tactfully and diplomatically make this country truly a  kinder and gentler place.  </P> <P> RAMON MIRELES  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN MAKES APPEARANCE FOR STATE SENATE CANDIDATE  </P> <P> No less a political potentate than former governor and current state Democratic  Party Chairman Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. visited Laguna Hills last week on  behalf of Janice Graham, the party's candidate for the seat vacated by former  state Sen. William Campbell.  </P> <P> In urging the Leisure World crowd of 350 to support Graham, Brown compared her  candidacy in the heavily Republican 31st District to the movements for  democracy in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "Get Jan Graham elected," he said. "That will so shock Orange County that maybe  things might change."  </P> <P> Much of Brown's 20-minute speech was devoted to criticism of the past decade's  Republican administrations in Sacramento and Washington.  </P> <P> "There was no crack cocaine in this state when I was governor," he said.  </P> <P> Graham, a former schoolteacher, unsuccessfully challenged Campbell in 1988. She  was the top vote-getter among the Democratic candidates in a special election  last month. She finished fifth out of eight candidates overall, with 14.1% of  the vote.  </P> <P> In the April 10 runoff election will be Graham, Assemblyman Frank Hill  (R-Whittier), the top GOP vote-getter, and Robert Lewis of the American  Independent Party.  </P> <P> The 31st District includes the Southeast communities of Whittier, La Mirada and  La Habra Heights.  </P> <P> In a development related to the race, the California Abortion Rights Action  League last week asked the state attorney general, the district attorneys of  Los Angeles and Orange counties and the state Fair Political Practices  Commission to investigate a letter sent out by a conservative Republican group  during the February primary.  </P> <P> The letter, sent by the Sacramento-based Voter Information League, praises  Graham as "a pro-choice Democratic woman" who could make history by being  elected to the state Senate, and urges Democrats to vote for her rather than  for any Republicans.  </P> <P> The purpose of the letter, the group's treasurer, Allison Turner, admitted was  to "preserve the sanctity of the two-party system" by keeping Democrats from  affecting the Republican race.  </P> <P> Political officials, however, have speculated that the letter's intent was to  keep Democrats from voting for Republican pro-choice candidate Ron Isles, who  came in third in the race.  </P></p>

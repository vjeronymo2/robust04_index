			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: NTT's regional telephone units post pre-tax loss NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's leading telecommunications group, said its 11 regional local telephone divisions posted a pre-tax loss of Y175.7bn (Dollars 1.64bn) for the year to March. The figure will strengthen NTT's argument for dearerlocal calls, to which the ministry of posts and telecommunications has remained reluctant. In May, the company announced a 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y247.2bn for the year to March. NTT has been lobbying heavily since the start of this year for a rise in local rates. This, together with announcements to restructure operations by reducing the number of employees by 30,000 and retail outlets to one-third, has pushed up NTT's stock. Yesterday, NTT's share price rose 2.4 per cent to Y883,000. In spite of a cut in long-distance inter-city rates in the last fiscal year, due to increasing pressure from competitors, NTT's long-distance division posted a pre-tax profit of Y454.7bn. The company also announced its business results by type of services. Operating revenue of NTT's call charge service totalled Y561.9bn, while its pay phone service posted an operating loss of Y22.6bn. NTT's car phone service saw an operating loss of Y1.9bn, while its telephone number information service posted an operating loss of Y173.4bn.</p>

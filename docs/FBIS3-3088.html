			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A business executive  from Hong Kong said Hong Kong's future economy will be mainly  affected by there factors: the China factor, the factor within  Hong Kong's own economy and the international factor.    Liu Chi Keung, chairman of the Flow Chart International  Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, said that if effective measures are  formulated to cope with changes in these factors, "Hong Kong's  economy will be able to maintain its stability."    The China factor is the most important one for maintaining  Hong Kong's prosperity, said Liu, who is here attending the  ongoing session of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference.    He said, "I think that as long as the Chinese mainland  continues to implement the policy of reform and opening up and  maintains the momentum of its robust economic growth, Hong  Kong's economy will have a powerful backing and its market will  continue to prosper."    The formulation and readjustment of the mainland's economic  policies will have a significant impact on Hong Kong's economic  expansion, he noted.    To this end, he said, the mainland should maintain the  continuity of its policies, and take into consideration the  interests of both big and small businesses in Hong Kong so that  they will be able to gain good returns on their investment in,  and trade between, the mainland and Hong Kong.    Speaking of the factor within Hong Kong's own economy, he  said that this is crucial to Hong Kong's continued prosperity  and stability.    Several big projects being undertaken in Hong Kong are, in a  sense, spurring economic growth there during the present  transitional period, he said. But, he added, therein also lie a  number of hidden problems.    He said that under the pretext of "returning wealth to the  people," Hong Kong's budget unveiled recently by its finance  secretary has caused a sharp rise in the prices of buildings and  high inflation as well.    Consequently, the future government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (SAR) might face an economic slide when it  takes over the management of Hong Kong's economy, he noted.    He expressed the hope that relevant mainland government  departments should beware of man-made chaos in Hong Kong in the  financial sector during the transitional period.    The future Hong Kong SAR Government should tighten control  over the financial market in Hong Kong to enable the factor  within Hong Kong's economy to be "sound and orderly."    As for the international factor, he said that Hong Kong's  economy has become a component of the global economy.    Therefore, changes in the international economic environment  will produce a major impact on Hong Kong's smooth transition and  prosperity, he said.    So far as the Hong Kong stock exchange is concerned,  hundreds  of millions of investment dollars from Britain, Japan, the  United States and the rest of the world are often traded there  daily, resulting in steep ups and downs in stock prices.    "Such ups and downs will also have a tremendous impact on  Hong Kong's economic growth," he pointed out.    For this reason, efforts should be made to prevent  international consortiums from causing man-made fluctuations in  stock prices, he said.    Furthermore, protectionism pursued by some countries,  China's  most-favored-nation trading status with the U.S., the resumption  of China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, and entrepot trade will also affect Hong Kong's economic  development, he said.    Counter-measures should be taken promptly to reduce the  adverse effects of these factors to a minimum, he said in  conclusion.</p>

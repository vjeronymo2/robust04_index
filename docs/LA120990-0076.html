			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE SPARKLES IN RESURGENT CLEVELAND  </P> <P> In Tower City, the centerpiece of this city's downtown renaissance, visitors  pass by fountains and boutiques to consider an exhibit made of cardboard.  </P> <P> They're looking at a model of downtown Cleveland in the year 2000, a remarkable  tangle of hotels, parks, public works and stunning architecture.  </P> <P> Some of the vision could prove to be fantasy. But judging from the cranes  towering over the United States' 12th-largest metropolitan area, much of the  construction is already under way. From the shores of Lake Erie to the city's  Public Square, Cleveland is welding and riveting its way into the next century.  As the United States slips toward recession, this gritty Rust Belt survivor  actually suffers from a shortage of construction workers.  </P> <P> Fueling the activity is Clevelanders' willingness to spend money, bury their  differences and unite around common goals. The city's experience provides a  good lesson for other major cities facing hard times.  </P> <P> Nowhere are the results more evident than downtown, where builders are trying  to catch up on decades of pent-up demand. Until recently, Cleveland was a time  capsule that preserved old structures because nothing was built to replace  them.  </P> <P> Cleveland's problems were numerous, including a crisis of confidence caused by  burning ghettos, bumbling mayors, a river that caught fire and the collapse of  its steel, automobile and machine-tool industries. When Cleveland defaulted on  its bond obligations in 1978, it looked as if the city might never recover.  </P> <P> But it fought back. Mayor George Voinovich, now governor-elect of Ohio, helped  reverse the decline by getting business, political and community leaders to  agree on what needed to be done.  </P> <P> "When you had the economic problems we had in the early 1980s, you really  didn't have much choice," said Richard Shatten, executive vice president of  Cleveland Tomorrow, an economic development group made up of chief executives  from Cleveland's 50 largest companies.  </P> <P> What followed was a combination of private and public efforts that reshaped the  skyline and fostered employment. One example: A tax abatement to get LTV Steel  to invest an additional $1 billion in the area. The effort preserved 6,000  jobs.  </P> <P> Developer Albert Ratner, a Clevelander whose projects include the 16-acre  MetroTech development in Brooklyn, N.Y., chipped in by taking on the Terminal  Tower, the Depression-era skyscraper that dominates the skyline. He converted  the old railroad station at the base of the tower into a splashy development  with a Ritz-Carlton hotel and three levels of shopping.  </P> <P> Tower City is only the latest in a series of projects. On the opposite side of  Public Square, an office tower being built has surpassed the Terminal Tower as  the city's tallest structure. When completed next fall, the 948-foot bank  headquarters will be the tallest building between New York and Chicago.  </P> <P> Then there's the $344 million Gateway sports complex, a massive project that is  getting started on the edge of downtown. In an age of public financing of  sports facilities, the project -- which includes a stadium for the Indians  baseball team and an arena for the Cavaliers basketball team -- stands out  because of the role played by private investors.  </P> <P> Voters approved a tax on liquor and tobacco to pay half the cost and private  investors agreed to pay the rest.  </P> <P> "It's just fantastic what they've done to this city in recent years," said Bill  Carroll, a public affairs manager of Ford Motor Co., the city's largest private  employer, with 17,000 workers. Ford is investing $2 billion in its  Cleveland-area factories.  </P> <P> But Cleveland still has serious problems. The city's schools are considered  weak, and old-line manufacturers routinely close plants. Cleveland's growth  still lags behind its rivals, Columbus and Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Yet in a city where one can buy a four-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of  Shaker Heights for $129,900, Cleveland has an appeal that should help it over  the humps.  </P></p>

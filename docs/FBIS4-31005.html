			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 31 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) has not yet been invited to coalition talks,  and is not in the position to initiate such negotiations, SZDSZ  Chairman Ivan Peto told MTI today. Whether the Free Democrats  will take part in the next government, should they be invited to  do so, will be decided by a delegates' assembly behind closed  doors on Sunday [5 June], he said.    In the parliamentary elections which ended May 29, the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) won 54.15 percent of the  mandates and the runner-up SZDSZ 18.14 percent.    The Free Democrats conceive the operation of a coalition  cabinet in such a way that the parties supporting the government  have veto power regarding the choice of ministers and other  politicial office-holders whose appointment falls under the  prime minister's competence, Peto said.    The Free Democrats press for changes in the mechanism of  legislation. In their view, the government should involve all  parliamentary parties, including the opposition, in the drafting  of bills. The SZDSZ seeks to specify strict incompatibility  rules for deputies, and reduce the extra allowances due to  members of government, the chairman said.    The Free Democrats have repeatedly declared that the  coalition government should be balanced rather than reflect the  parties' power relations in parliament, Peto said, adding that  the key ministerial posts should be distributed between the  coalition parties accordingly.    Personal guarantees are also required for the implementation  of the coalition's common program, Peto said. "This is not yet  a coalition offer, only a piece of `fiction'," he added.    Peto also said that this week he would hold an informal  consultation with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, the date of which  has not yet been set.</p>

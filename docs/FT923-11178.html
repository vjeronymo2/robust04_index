			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Tax demand work may go to tender THE government is considering contracting out computer processing work on taxpayers' confidential files as part of a drive to transfer as much Civil Service work as possible to the private sector. The Inland Revenue said yesterday it was exploring 'the feasibility of a contractual partnership with one or possibly two major private sector computer organisations' to process tax demands. 'No decisions will be taken unless it can be demonstrated that the highest quality service and the best value for money is provided,' the Revenue said. It stressed that the organisation would remain responsible for preserving data secrecy. IBM, ICL, Computer Sciences Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation and Electronic Data Systems have been approached, and discussions should be concluded in the autumn. The move brought immediate condemnation from the Inland Revenue Staff Federation on the grounds that it could endanger the confidentiality of taxpayers. Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, appealed for 'this dangerous move' to be reversed. The contracting out of public sector jobsis part of a drive to put Civil Service work out to competitive tender. Departments have been asked to list activities that could be included in the initiative, known as market testing. A white paper suggested that market testing could save as much as 25 per cent of the Pounds 20bn total of central government annual costs.</p>

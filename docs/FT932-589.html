			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Observer: EBRD stopgap? No doubt it is sheer coincidence that only a couple of days after Jacques Attali resigns from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Sir William Ryrie announces his retirement as head of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector arm. Even so, Ryrie's departure could come in handy if the great powers run into difficulty finding the right pawn to fill the EBRD slot. Unlike Attali, Ryrie can look back with some pride on his nine years with the IFC. Morale is high, the IFC's triple A credit rating is secure, and it will invest more than Dollars 2bn in 170 projects this year. Even more important, it made Dollars 180m after tax for its shareholders last year. In many respects, the IFC ought to be the EBRD's role model. Doubtless, there would be diplomatic problems about replacing Attali with a Brit, especially since Sir Brian Unwin has just bagged the top job at the European Investment Bank. Even so, Ryrie would be an ideal stand-in until a more politically correct figure can be found.</p>

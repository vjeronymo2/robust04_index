			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / City bankers feel squeeze, not chop: Big job cuts are rare as yet Employees at City merchant and investment banks may be nervously awaiting redundancy notices as their organisations approach the end of their financial years and begin budgeting for the next. But the most stringent cuts so far have been not of jobs, but of expenses - the main casualties of austerity are taxi-drivers, caterers and newspaper publishers. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has put cost control policy into action with a ban on the use of taxis at the company's expense before 9pm. Employees' newspaper subscriptions are examined for duplication and, if necessary, ended. Entertainment, as always, is a target. Gifts distributed at the firm's receptions are strictly for guests: Lehman staff may not now help themselves. Corporate events should be centred on clients as much as possible. 'There should be no departmental lunches on the firm just because there is not much going on,' said a Lehman executive. The firm's impressively named European Expense Advisory Committee is inspiring and co-ordinating belt-tightening. Lehman defended using senior managers' time in identifying small cost savings: 'It all adds up,' it said. Lehman, although rumoured to be preparing swingeing redundancies, says departures are in single figures and the reason for them is substandard performance. Other US investment banks hit by the downturn in world bond markets have been cutting more radically. Goldman Sachs this week completed a round of 90 redundancies - nearly 5 per cent of its European headcount. SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which last week reported sharply lower interim profits, has made 10 people redundant. NatWest Markets has pulled out of several corporate bond markets and lowered staffing by 12 as a result. These disclosures have fuelled anxiety among City employees, but they do not yet represent the massacre portrayed by the rumour-mill and the headlines. Goldman Sachs has made the deepest cuts so far but the firm's London headcount has been rising this year and will remain higher than in January even after the redundancies. SG Warburg describes its policy as a 'freeze' at the staffing level of September 30. 'It would be foolish to get involved in panic measures which would affect the fabric of the business,' it said. Hambros, which yesterday reported a sharp fall in interim profits, set itself against staff cuts in the bond division which suffered most from adverse market conditions this year. 'If anything, we are expanding it,' said Sir Chips Keswick, deputy chairman. 'It is a core business and we have no intention of leaving it.' Remuneration is another matter. Goldman Sachs expects to inform employees about their bonuses in a few days. The average is expected to plummet from last year and Goldman, as the first investment bank to decide, puts down a benchmark. There may be more sackings to come, or to come to light. Visible redundancies can undermine client confidence. Investment banks privately admit that they, or at least their competitors, fudge redundancies by putting them under the heading of quality control. In general, City firms fervently deny any intention to embark on mass dismissals until they actually do so.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Continental fund raising open to abuse THE UK is one of the few European countries where political parties have no general recourse to public finance. Labour has been urging for some time that UK parties should be given public cash to avoid undue dependence on outside donors, claiming that the opaque UK system is 'an open invitation to corruption'. Most other industrialised countries have more rigorous rules on disclosure of political donations than those in force in Britain, but rigour is often conspicuously absent from their application. In Japan political parties and organisations have to make an annual report of income and spending. Contributors who provide annual amounts of more than a certain limit - normally Y1m - must be named. The report is also supposed to name recipients of political spending of more than Y50,000 a year, but there are many loopholes. Mr Shin Kanemaru, former paymaster of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, was charged earlier this year with evading taxes linked to receipt of funds from construction companies. Yesterday an official report in Tokyo said he failed to declare Y1.85bn (Dollars 16.7m) he received in kickbacks and donations from companies seeking favours. Germany has taken many initiatives in the past 30 years to quell illicit corporate financing of parties. In 1954 it became the first European country to introduce public financing for political parties. After scandals in the early 1980s, surrounding clandestine donations by companies led by the Flick industrial group, German parties are required by law to publish annual reports listing individual donors providing more than DM2,000 a year. Italian parties are legally obliged to provide annual accounts, but these substantially understate the true level of their financial transactions. Italian parties' official spending of L306bn (Pounds 128m) last year - of which more than one-third came from the public purse - is thought to represent only about 10 per cent of expenditures of all forms of party political activity. Most of the rest is presumed to come from clandestine industry sources. In a referendum in April Italians voted to ban state financing of political parties. In France laws on disclosure have been tightened, with all parties obliged to furnish full accounts. The Socialist party is believed to have been involved in large-scale illicit money-raising schemes until the early 1990s  -though such affairs are not limited to the left. In Spain donations by individuals or corporations are subject to a ceiling of Pta 1m. Parties rely for a big part of their funding on quarterly payments from the state. Evidence has surfaced of how the rules can be side-stepped. Spanish tax inspectors have uncovered a network of dubious contributions of Pta 1bn (Pounds 5.6m) channelled through the Barcelona-based Filesa group, some of which appear to have been passed on to the Socialist party.</p>

There will be two kinds of bidding in the second round. One  will be for prospecting ventures at 26 locations covering a  total of 216,000 square kilometers where there are estimated  reserves of 6.2 billion tons of oil and 800 billion cubic meters  of natural gas distributed in parts of the provinces, regions  and cities of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan,  Shandong, Hubei, Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin. The other will be  to raise the extraction rates from old oil fields, including 11  developed areas with a total oil-bearing area of 190.2 square  kilometers with geological reserves of 380 billion tons at 8  locations: Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu,  Zhongyuan and Jilin.    This year, in oil and gas poor areas there will be  construction for comprehensive use and for long-distance oil and  gas pipelines, using many forms of expanded cooperation with  foreign commercial interests, and a search will be made for  foreign partnerships and international management for  exploration and development of oil and gas resources.

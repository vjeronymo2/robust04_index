			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AETNA DEFIES GOVERNOR IN PENNSYLVANIA  </P> <P> Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. said today that it will stick with its decision  to stop selling car insurance in Pennsylvania despite a written admonition from  Gov. Robert P. Casey, who called the giant insurer "arrogant and callous."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Casey sent a strongly worded, three-paragraph letter to Aetna's  president, David A. Kocher, criticizing the company's decision Wednesday to  terminate business with its 200,000 Pennsylvania customers.  </P> <P> Casey said the company's withdrawal violated Pennsylvania law and displayed "an  arrogant and callous disregard for our state and your policyholders."  </P> <P> "If you persist in your decision, I hereby put you on notice that Pennsylvania  will use all remedies against your company which the law allows to protect the  200,000 Aetna policyholders in our state and the broad public interest of all  our citizens," Casey said in the letter.  </P> <P> Aetna, a Sears, Roebuck and Co. unit and the state's fifth-largest insurer,  said Pennsylvania's new car-insurance law would cause it to lose $20 million  during the next year.  </P> <P> The law enacted in February lowers all motorists' rates by 10% as of July 1 or  by 22% if they give up their rights to sue in most cases.  </P> <P> Aetna has also asked the courts to block the state Insurance Department from  trying to foil its exodus from the car-insurance market.  </P> <P> The Insurance Department filed a cease-and-desist order on Thursday against  Aetna to force it to stop sending out renewal notices and to reinstate  customers who are dropped. Aetna then asked the U.S. District Court in  Philadelphia to issue a temporary restraining order to block the department's  order.  </P> <P> John C. Hawkins, an Aetna spokesman, said in a statement that the company's  action was within its rights.  </P> <P> "The company holds the position that its actions in Pennsylvania to withdraw  from the personal auto insurance market and begin orderly non-renewal of its  policyholders are legal," Hawkins said. "There is nothing in Pennsylvania law  that prohibits us from taking this action."  </P></p>

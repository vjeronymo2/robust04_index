			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banks losing patience with Esco Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, is close to cutting the loan lifeline to Esco Leasing, a troubled finance company which has borrowed a total of Y220bn (Dollars 2.02bn) from 33 Japanese institutions. For the past two years, Hokkaido Takushoku has been attempting to restructure Esco, but the company has been unable to recover its own Y200bn loan to another finance company, Easy Capital and Consultants, which pumped much of the money into the property market. Esco is also based on the northern island of Hokkaido, and expanded aggressively during the so-called bubble years of the late 1980s when stock and property prices soared. The ensuing collapse in asset values left many financial companies exposed and forced their banks to bail them out. A restructuring plan for Esco was agreed by the 33 banks in March last year, when they accepted a cut in their interest repayments for two years. However, the banks are close to concluding that Esco is a hopeless case and that their exposure should be written off. Hokkaido Takushoku, often known as Takugin, has a ratio of non-performing loans to total loans of 5.39 per cent, the highest among Japan's 11 leading commercial banks. However, these official totals are generally regarded as a conservative estimate of the banks' exposure. Japanese banks are becoming more aggressive in writing off bad loans, and the Esco case would be a warning to other troubled financial companies that their banks are not prepared to extend unlimited support for a restructuring. Banks are likely to follow the lead of the main bank, which in this case is Takugin. The 33 banks say they have collateral worth about 60 per cent of their Y220bn exposure. However, as many banks have discovered, the value of property collateral can be far less than the book value of three or four years ago.</p>

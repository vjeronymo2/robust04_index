			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price plummets to lowest level since 1986 GOLD'S PRICE in US dollars slumped to its lowest level for seven years yesterday, the first trading day of the new year. Ironically, the fall was sparked partly by Australian and South African gold producers who could not resist selling forward at the very high prices quoted in their local currencies - a phenomenon caused by the strength of the US dollar. Dealers suggested that there was also some speculative selling from Switzerland by Middle East syndicates and that South Africa's central bank, the Reserve Bank, stepped in at one stage to buy gold in an attempt to slow the price's rate of descent. Gold was 'fixed' in London yesterday afternoon at Dollars 328.25 a troy ounce. Traders said that the price dropped to Dollars 327 at one stage and that, if it stayed below Dollars 328 - a key chart point - for any length of time, it might fall by another Dollars 5 or Dollars 10 an ounce. The precious metal closed in London last night at Dollars 329.15, down Dollars 3.90 an ounce from last Thursday's close. 'We are in an area where the professionals don't have many signposts to guide them,' Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland pointed out. 'I don't expect we will see a Dollars 20 or Dollars 30 move down, just moves of Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 and then some temporary recovery - a sawtooth pattern.' Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles Lambert, said gold was in a period of seasonally weak demand so the equilibrium of the market was tilted in favour of downward movements. She recalled gold touched Dollars 285 an ounce in February 1985 and June 1982 and suggested that some professionals now had that level as a target. 'But if it holds above Dollars 320 in the next week or so it will stay there. There is nothing to give it an upward impetus.' Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said a number of market participants were looking at Dollars 280 an ounce as 'a realistic downside target.' The reasoning was that in theory about 35 per cent of western world gold mine capacity, or 623.4 tonnes, should close down after a year or two because they would be uneconomic with prices at that relatively low level. He added: 'The gold market has now reached a point where prices will only rise sharply if there is a dramatic change in either the supply or demand side of the equation. And I strongly doubt that anything very dramatic is going to happen on the demand side.'</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: Nigerian anger on the march - Theatre As I was passing the Nigerian High Commission in London the other day, I noticed that that the protestors have re-appeared. 'Babangida, out, out]' and 'Academic Freedom Now]' went some of the placards. The demonstration reminded me of the permanent vigil that used to be mounted just across the road outside the South African Embassy in Trafalgar Square. Some Nigerians are clearly becoming aware of the similarities between repressive regimes, black or white. Nigeria has long been known for its chronic corruption. More recently there has been the repeated postponement by the military of the promised return to civilian rule. Marching for Fausa, the new play at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, suggests that the problems are getting worse, but also that there is an incipient rebellion by the educated young, and especially the women. Fausa does not appear; she is the girl from university who is taken off to become the 11th concubine of the Minister of Culture. The potential uprising is about how long this sort of thing can go on. What happens when the oil, on which the country depends for a large part of its revenues, runs out? How long can coup succeed coup without fulfilling the promises of reform? The authenticity of the background is not in doubt. Biyi Bandele, the young Nigerian author of the play, has been a journalist in his home country. Fausa captures beautifully the Nigerian claim that they have a relatively free press and the fact that practically everyone knows that it is manipulated. It can be just as corrupt as much of the rest of Nigerian society. The other fact which anyone who has visited Nigeria will recognise immediately is the front room to the Minister's office. Here sits the secretary typing away, answering the telephone and firmly denying that the Minister is within. It costs the businessman, who thinks he has an appointment, 6,000 naira to get even a hint that he might see the Minister in the end. Then there are the police. Decent fellows at heart, they become more desperate towards the close of the month as their salaries run out. It was lucky, one of them says to a victim of theft that he was robbed by Slow Poison Joe because he is the last of the gentleman burglars in town: he only wants to negotiate a deal in order to give the property back. With such corruption above them, why should ordinary people be more honest? Fausa claims, however, that there are far more sinister forces at work. Young people disappear, not just Fausa, but others who may never leave prison again, and others who are murdered. A parallel with Argentina in the 1970s comes to mind and, as in Argentina, it is the mothers and the women in general who begin to protest: also one or two journalists. The chief of the protesting journalists, and indeed the only one shown, is a young woman called Telani Belarabe played by Susan Aderin. She, too, ends in chains for her pains, her woman editor having sacked her for going beyond the bounds of a reporter's discretion. Fausa is not yet a brilliant play. Even under Annie Castledine's direction, some of the flashbacks jar a bit and there is sometimes a spurious use of music. But it is remarkably mature for a writer is his mid-twenties and it is undeniable that it has something to say. The irony lies in the title which one is tempted to confuse as Waiting for Fausa. Are the potential rebels really marching, or are they just waiting in the hope that someone like Godot might turn up? Perhaps the answer is deliberately left ambiguous. Nevertheless, here is a sign of genuine, articulate Nigerian anger. The people from the High Commission ought to go and see it. So should the demonstrators, for at least it shows there is hope.

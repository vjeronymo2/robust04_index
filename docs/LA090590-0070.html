			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DISTRICT TIGHTENS EXPENSE POLICIES  </P> <P> In the wake of alleged financial abuses by one of its members, the board of the  Ventura County Community College District on Tuesday tightened its rules on  reimbursement for telephone use and related business equipment.  </P> <P> The board approved the stricter policy, which also outlines rules for use of  the district's telephone credit cards and car phones.  </P> <P> The board also discussed proposed new rules for use of district fax machines  and computers. The vote was 4 to 0.  </P> <P> The policies, which board members said are intended to clarify existing rules  on how district employees and board members may be reimbursed for business  expenses, follow allegations of double-billing practices by board member James  (Tom) Ely. Ely was absent from the meeting Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> Under the district's new policy, board members may continue to receive, upon  request, such equipment as telephones and fax machines at district expense, but  their use shall be "solely for the conduct of district business."  </P> <P> All requests for reimbursement must be accompanied by a detailed explanation of  why the expense was incurred and how it relates to district business.  </P> <P> Questions about the district's expense policies arose earlier this year after  the district launched an investigation into Ely's travel expenses.  </P> <P> Last month, Ely and his wife, Ingrid, were charged with embezzlement,  conspiracy to commit grand theft and making a false or fraudulent claim in  connection with more than $12,000 in questionable expenses for which they were  reimbursed by the district.  </P> <P> The Elys, who pleaded innocent, are awaiting a preliminary hearing on the  charges.

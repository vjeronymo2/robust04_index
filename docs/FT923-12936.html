			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper surge takes prices to 18-month highs COPPER PRICES yesterday continued to ignore widespread world economic gloom and surged above Dollars 1.15 a lb (Dollars 2,534 a tonne) on the London Metal Exchange, the highest levels for 18 months. Many analysts had not expected to see copper, the most heavily-traded metal, reach Dollars 1.15 until much later this year. Traders suggested substantial Asian buying set the trend early yesterday and then some big merchant houses followed suit. The price was also helped upwards by some short-covering (hasty buying to cover their positions by organisations that had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of lower prices in future). There was some profit-taking later but the price did not dip very far and copper for delivery in three months closed in London at Dollars 2,545 a tonne, up Dollars 30 from Tuesday's close. While some analysts suggested that world economic conditions did not justify copper's recent price rise - it has jumped from just over Dollars 1 a lb at the begining of July - Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that copper supply and demand were finely balanced and demand was widely expected to increase next year. He said that while copper demand in Japan was reflecting slowing economic growth there, the Chinese might well buy about 200,000 tonnes this year - 'which would take up all the slack from Japan'. Mr Arnold said: 'Copper is more likely to go up (in price) than to drop sharply from now on'. He predicted the price would reach Dollars 1.20 a lb (Dollars 2,645 a tonne) in the fourth quarter of 1992. However, he dismissed the idea that copper could reach Dollars 1.50 a lb because such a price was 'crazy'. Copper demand in Asia will continue to grow in the 1990s, especially in the newly industrialised economies of South-east Asia, Mr Douglas C. Yearly, chairman of US producer Phelps Dodge Corporation, told an investment seminar, reports Reuter from Tokyo.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds has made a  lengthy reply to a letter from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams  about the Downing Street Ulster peace declaration, according to  Dublin sources today.    Mr Reynolds confirmed earlier that he would answer Mr  Adams's  request for clarification of the document he signed with Prime  Minister John Major in London last month.    But the Irish premier also made clear he could add little to  a series of public speeches he made about the peace initiative  and its aims.    Mr Reynolds has sought to spell out the aims of the joint  Anglo-Irish statement on a number of occasions in a bid to  provoke a positive response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein  allies.    So far, though, the hardline republican movement has  restricted itself to continuing consultations about the document  with its membership.    Sinn Fein-staged public meetings on the issue are set to  continue throughout Ireland until the middle of next month,  ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin.    In his reply to Mr Adams -- who sent a similar letter to Mr  Major -- Mr Reynolds is understood to have spelled out the  consequences of an end to the IRA terror campaign.    This is thought to have centred on the timing of exploratory  talks with Sinn Fein as part of the political process bid to  resolve the issue of Northern Ireland.    Since the December 15 signing of the peace statement, Dublin  has been more willing than London to move towards clarification  of the document, while stopping well short of any form of  renegotiation.    But in Dublin on Friday [28 January], after a meeting of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference,  Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to suggest that he,  too, would clarify some of the issues.    Deputy Irish premier and Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who  jointly chaired the conference session, today said every  opportunity to spell out the aims of the peace declaration had  to be taken.    He believed all the neccessary clarification was in the  "carefully and well-thought-out document," but stressed: "We are  not going to foreclose on the prospect for peace on this island."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 22 May (AFP) -- Provisional  President Emile Jonassaint, who is not recognized by the  international community, has ordered Haitian authorities to  severely punish the organizers of secret trips to the United  States. According to a communique broadcast on state television  Saturday night, the justice minister has asked government  prosecutors in trial courts to "implement the 17 November 1980  decree which punishes criminals and accomplices of those who  organize secret trips abroad."    There has been a clear increase over the past two weeks in  the number of Haitian "boat people" [preceding two words in  English] intercepted and turned back by U.S. Coast Guard cutters  while trying to reach the Florida coastline in flimsy boats.  According to Haitian sources, this increase is due to  deteriorating living conditions among the poor population  following UN sanctions, fueled by the hope of getting close  enough to the Florida coastline not to be turned back, which was  recently the case for 500 Haitians, as well as the new  procedures established by U.S. President Bill Clinton in favor  of Haitian "boat people." These procedures, which are not yet  in effect, include a preliminary interview for requesters of  political asylum before a decision on expulsion is made.    To this end, the United States has chartered two Ukrainian  vessels and has begun discussions with the UK on installing the  refugees in camps on Turks and Caicos Islands, a British crown  colony north of Haiti.</p>

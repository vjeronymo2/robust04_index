			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Middle classes on rise in trade unions The image of the average trade unionist conjured up by the rail dispute or by the union voters in the Labour leadership contest is strongly male and blue collar, but the latest data from the polling organisation MORI underlines how false this image has become. Not only are a majority of trade unionists not manual workers, but very nearly half are middle class under the standard occupational classification. MORI says that 47 per cent of union members now belong to the white collar and professional classes A, B and C1. That compares with only 30 per cent classified as ABC1 in 1979. There has also been a substantial increase in the proportion of women trade unionists, up from 24 per cent in 1979 to 38 per cent in 1994. In 1979 a total of 30 per cent of all adults over 18 were trade unionists - 76 per cent men and 24 per cent women. By 1994 the overall adult figure had fallen to 19 per cent - 62 per cent men and 38 per cent women. The age structure of trade unionists has changed relatively little. In 1979 a total of 37 per cent were aged 18-34, 42 per cent 35-54, and 21 per cent 55 and over. The figures are now 33 per cent, 48 per cent and 19 per cent. The change in the class composition largely reflects the change in the class and occupational structure of the population as a whole. In 1979 a total of 33 per cent of the population was classified as ABC1, 34 per cent as C2 (skilled manual workers) and 33 per cent as DE (semi-skilled and unskilled). By 1994 that had changed to 44 per cent, 26 per cent and 30 per cent. Mr Roger Mortimore, a political analyst at MORI, said: 'The changes in trade union membership are broadly in line with those in the population as a whole, but political leaders have not adapted to the rise of the middle-class trade unionist.' One possible reason is the greater publicity given to those unions, mainly manual worker, affiliated to the Labour party. The shift in the figures also reflects the decline in manufacturing employment and the continuing high levels of unionisation in the public sector among health, teaching and central and local government professionals. The Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey says that more than half of all trade unionists have educational qualifications to A level or equivalent. The same survey found that only 24 per cent of trade unionists work in manufacturing.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Donaldson to chair law panel LORD DONALDSON, the former master of the rolls, is to chair a new body that will tackle legal uncertainties affecting the UK wholesale financial markets. The financial law panel will comprise up to 12 distinguished lawyers and market practitioners. It will help to resolve legal difficulties before they reach the courts; review proposed legislation and regulations; and make proposals in the wholesale financial markets, which encompass issues such as foreign exchange dealings, derivatives and cross-border insolvency. Formation of the panel is the main recommendation of the legal risk review committee chaired by Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of National Westminster Bank, which was set up by the Bank of England in April last year. The committee was established after the confusion over the legal position of a number of developments in the financial markets including the local-authority swaps case. Lord Alexander said: 'We concluded that the underpinning of the wholesale financial markets is basically sound. But it is important to minimise uncertainty if the UK's standing as a pre-eminent international financial centre is not to be jeopardised.' The panel will have a chairman and a deputy chairman, up to 10 other members, and a small secretariat. It will also be able to establish working and advisory groups.

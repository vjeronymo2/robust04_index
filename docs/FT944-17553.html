			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Four new judges appointed to European Court of Justice Seven lawyers, largely unknown outside their own countries, were appointed unopposed yesterday to the most powerful judicial body in Europe. The appointments to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg represent the single biggest turnover of personnel in the court's history. Half the judges and their advisers up for reappointment are stepping down. The power these European lawyers wield was underlined last week when the court awarded retrospective pension rights to part-time workers, leaving employers facing possible costs of billions of pounds. Colleagues in the profession yesterday said so little was known about the new judges it was difficult to assess what impact they would have on the court's judgments. Every three years the court replaces several of its 13 judges and six advisers. Judges are appointed for six-year terms and many usually stand for reappointment. In 1991 only two members of the court changed. The judges stepping down are Mr Manuel Diez de Velasco from Spain, the French judge Mr Fernand Grevisse, and the German Mr Manfred Zuleeg. In addition, the president of the court, Mr Ole Due, a Dane, has resigned. A new president will be chosen from among the judges by secret ballot today. Mr Due has been been replaced by his Danish adviser, Mr Claus Gulmann. Two other advisers have resigned, so three have been appointed - Mr Philippe Leger from France, Mr Georgios Cosmas from Greece and Mr Michael Elmer from Denmark. Appointment to the court is by 'common accord' of the member state governments. There is no nationality requirement, but in practice each member state nominates one of its own nationals. The 13th judge is normally chosen on rotation from among the five largest member states. The Spanish judge was the 13th judge and is being replaced by an Italian, Mr Antonio La Pergola. The new French judge is Mr Jean-Pierre Puissochet and the new German judge is Mr Gunter Hirsch. In the UK, candidates tend to be either judges or senior barristers, and are nominated by the Foreign Office on the advice of the lord chancellor. Judges from other member states tend either to be academics or to have held senior positions in their country's administrations. Perhaps most is known about Mr La Pergola. He is a former president of the Italian Constitutional Court and close ally of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister.</p>

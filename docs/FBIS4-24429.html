			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign espionage remains a threat to Guangzhou's  political and social stability as well as the overall safety of  China according to Guangzhou leaders.    "Activities by foreign spies in China aimed at subversion,  infiltration, divisiveness and rebellion have not stopped," the  Guangzhou party secretary, Gao Siren, told a recent state  security meeting, the official GUANGZHOU DAILY reported on  Sunday. "Foreign enemy forces have joined hands to encourage  destructiveness, which is a danger to the social stability of  Guangzhou," he said.    The mayor of Guangzhou, Li Ziliu, said many people were  lulled into a "one-sided" belief that economic prosperity meant  "not being conscious about secrecy and the movements of the  enemy."    The warnings follow a special trip to the Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone in April by the director of the State Bureau of  Secrecy, Shen Hongying, who said those regions on "the front  line of China's opening to the outside world" caused the  greatest loss of state secrets. "The frequent foreign economic  exchanges of Shenzhen... have led to arduous and complicated  secrecy needs," Shen said.    Chinese leaders have expressed alarm at the frequency of  contacts between foreigners and Guangdong officials, which they  believe has resulted in disclosure of state secrets.    Officials from other parts of China frequently travel to  Shenzhen or Guangzhou to meet foreign couterparts for the sake  of convenience.    China's concept of enemy spies is not limited to  trenchcoated  diplomats poking around military bases. It includes everyone  from foreign businessmen gathering conventional market data to  journalists doing what in most countries would be considered  their regular work of news reporting.    Shen's and Gao's use of the term jingwai (outside the  border)  rather than waiguo (foreign country) in reference to espionage  activities that are supposed to be aimed against China reflects  their belief that Hong Kong and Taiwan people are possibly the  biggest threat to them.    While political secrets remain closely guarded, economic  reform has made it almost impossible for any significant  economic policy or information to be kept secret for long,  despite the best efforts of the secrecy cadres assigned to every  department of both central and local governments.    Gao said stepped up vigilance in guarding state secrets in  Guangzhou was crucial for both government cadres as well as the  common people.    Li dismissed suggestions that stepped up vigilance in  protecting economic, technological, and commercial secrets would  harm Guangdong's economy. "All such thoughts are badly  mistaken," the mayor said, without further explanation.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Talbott nears approval The Senate foreign relations committee yesterday approved by 17 votes to one the nomination of Mr Strobe Talbott to be the new US deputy secretary of state. The sole dissenter was Senator Jesse Helms, the right wing Republican from North Carolina, who then lost another committee vote which would have delayed consideration by the full Senate for another two weeks. The chamber is now expected to confirm Mr Talbott within the next 48 hours. A handful of Republicans will vote against but he avoided one potential minefield in his Tuesday testimony by recanting old writings that some construed anti-Israeli. Mr Helms challenged Mr Talbott, a former Time magazine writer, at a confirmation hearing on Tuesday for writing in 1981 Israel had become a liability to US security interests. Mr Talbott said his views had changed but the essay was critical of Likud not Israel. Several national Jewish groups and at least two Republican senators, Connie Mack of Florida and Alfonse D'Amato of New York, have come out against the nomination.</p>

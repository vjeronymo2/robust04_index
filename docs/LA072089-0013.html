			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> JURY CLEARS HOSPITAL IN BOY'S MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A Harbor Gateway convalescent hospital was not to blame for a 1984 incident in  which a schizophrenic patient allegedly molested a 6-year-old boy who had come  to the hospital for a Sunday prayer service, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury  found this week.  </P> <P> While jurors said Monday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital was negligent in  permitting the youngster to wander unattended down its hallways, they also  found that the negligence was not directly to blame for the confrontation with  the mentally disturbed patient or for the severe psychological trauma that the  youngster, now 12, has reportedly suffered.  </P> <P> Several jurors said after the verdict that they believed Faith of Our Fathers  Church in Torrance and two church members were responsible for the boy's  welfare. The jurors also said they vindicated the hospital because they  believed witnesses who testified that the boy had psychological problems before  the incident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emotional Trial  </P> <P> The verdict was reached after an emotional seven-week trial and four days of  deliberations.  </P> <P> Ray Moore, a lawyer for the hospital, praised the verdict. But the 39-year-old  mother who filed the lawsuit five years ago on behalf of her son said the  result was "unbelievable" and "unacceptable."  </P> <P> The mother said she was not concerned with winning a large cash settlement but  rather in receiving a verdict affirming the hospital's responsibility. "My son  was violated and there was no justice," she said.  </P> <P> But the mother and son, who now live in Huntington Beach, will not walk away  without compensation.  </P> <P> Midway through the trial, the church was dropped as a defendant when it agreed  to pay a $1-million settlement without admitting that it was liable for the  boy's injuries. The mother said that at least $350,000 of the settlement will  go to her attorney, Richard Farnell, and to cover court costs.  </P> <P> Jurors said the eleventh-hour settlement may have saved the church, now called  the Living Word Fellowship, from an even larger loss.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Church Cited  </P> <P> "Too bad the church settled, because we would have nailed the church," said  jury foreman Linda De Silva. "The church had no credibility to us. . . . It was  definitely the church that caused all of this," she said. "They were definitely  responsible."  </P> <P> Before the settlement, church lawyer Tony Serritella had argued that the  Torrance congregation could not be held liable because the hospital prayer  meeting was the personal ministry of two parishioners and not a  church-sanctioned event.  </P> <P> Jurors had heard testimony that the 6-year-old became restless halfway through  the prayer meeting on Jan. 22, 1984, and wandered down a hospital corridor  where Alfred Ray Hatch -- a toothless, bearded man with open sores on his legs  -- lured him into a treatment room.  </P> <P> A Sheriff's Department report says Hatch admitted that he molested the boy and  forced the boy to perform sex acts on him. Hatch was charged with oral  copulation and performing lewd acts with a child but did not have to stand  trial because he was declared incompetent and was committed to a state mental  hospital.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suicide Attempts  </P> <P> The boy's attorney, Farnell, had argued that the hospital was liable for the  attack because it failed to properly supervise Hatch or the boy. The boy's  mother testified that in the past five years, he has been depressed and anxious  and has tried to commit suicide 10 times.  </P> <P> Moore countered that the hospital provided as much security as it could without  turning the hospital into a prison. He also attempted to show that the boy had  psychological problems before his encounter with Hatch and that his mother  impeded his recovery by not following medication and therapy instructions.  </P> <P> Moore's arguments and the jury's own focus of blame on the church led to the  victory for the hospital, the jurors said.  </P> <P> "It was unanimous that the boy was injured and that it was a criminal assault,"  said one juror, who asked not to be named. "The church should have kept track  of the boy. That was their responsibility."  </P> <P> Farnell said he has not yet decided whether to file an appeal.  </P></p>

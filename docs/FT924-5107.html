			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Politicians play the local numbers game: Alison Smith reports on warnings from both sides over the council tax MR Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and Mr Jack Straw, his Labour shadow, have two things in common. Both are barristers, and both have warned extensively against trusting forecasts of council tax levels. Mr Straw's warnings derive from suspicion that the government is in the business of producing misleading figures. Mr Howard insists that council tax levels will be set by local authorities, and so he will not authorise any forecasts. Mr Howard's approach contrasts with the government's readiness in past years to produce reams of poll tax numbers at a time when there was greater freedom for councils to run their own budgets. Nonetheless, he has not been able to avoid being drawn into the numbers game. In admitting the basis on which the department had been doing its grant calculations, he has made a significant contribution to the first set of forecasts which have already appeared. The departmental figures cannot reflect personal circumstances. Single-person households will get a 25 per cent discount, 3m people in England on low incomes will pay nothing and a further 2m will pay a reduced charge. Moreover, the figures cannot reflect whether an individual's bill will be reduced through the Pounds 340m transitional relief scheme. In broad terms, however, the department's figures give a reasonable guide to the likely levels of bills, provided that some caveats are taken into account. The calculations assume, for example, that councils spend at the level of government assumptions, rather than take advantage of the slight scope for spending above that level that exists even in the increasingly rigorous 'capping' regime which gives ministers extensive control over council budgets. Other factors likely to increase the size of the bills include the allowance that councils will have to make for the potential shrinkage of the tax base, perhaps because there are more single-person households or because people successfully appeal against the banding of their homes. And the ghost of the poll tax still hovers over local government finance, with poll tax arrears outside the capping system and - in a few areas - capable of adding substantially to council tax bills. In a year when the settlement has been so tight, it may seem implausible (except in the London Borough of Wandsworth) that some bills could be lower than the department envisaged. Yet this may be true in some areas, because of the politics of local government. The tax comes at a time when shire districts and counties are acutely conscious of the local government organisation review. Sir John Banham, who leads the review in England, is drawing up the first of his reports on how local government should be slimmed. Ministerial preferences for unitary authorities have pitted councils against each other, while government emphasis on opinion-polling as a factor in whether a council should survive gives an incentive beyond the county council elections in May to seek local popularity. Council tax bills will show separately the costs imposed by a county and by a district: those councils which still have balances may well be tempted to use them to keep bills down as part of the campaign for continued existence, or in a final spending of their resources if they know they are doomed. So far as national politics are concerned, decisions on local spending appear based on a cool judgment by ministers that it is more important to keep bills as low as possible than to worry about the squeeze on services. Seeing ministers stumbling from political disaster to PR calamity has become so familiar that it comes as almost a shock to realise that that judgment looks right in the immediate terms of Westminster. The clampdown on spending, means that the transitional relief scheme, although modest in cash terms, should be enough to see off the worst concerns in London and the south-east among Tory voters. A shrewd assessment of the position came from one Whitehall official who said: 'The problem is likely to be with the (spending) settlement, not the tax.' Although cries of anguish from local authorities are routine in response to every recent local government finance statement, there is little doubt that this year budgets are under severe strain. The increasing noise from Tory councils in this chorus is an ominous sign that the spending settlement may lead to local revolt. The opposition will need to work hard if it is not to be only local. The Commons is used to hearing reports of fewer home helps, fewer library opening hours, worse conditions in schools. It is harder for the opposition to embarrass the government with these examples than with the case of a pensioner couple in receipt of a squillion-pound poll tax bill, but it still looks the most likely ground for the battle. Mr Straw has made a start, but there is a long way to go. For Labour, the task is to make the council tax about jobs and services.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROPERTIES ASSESSED FOR COUNCIL TAX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Number      Number         Estimate Band                          in England   in London        of bill??  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A (under pounds40,000)         5,245,375      85,794        pounds329 B (pounds40-52,000)            3,827,600     384,389        pounds384 C (pounds52-68,000)            4,377,279     791,263        pounds439 D (pounds68-88,000)            2,911,535     746,103        pounds494 E (pounds88-120,000)           1,812,610     471,029        pounds604 F (pounds120-160,000)            982,586     233,020        pounds713 G (pounds160-320,000)            747,679     196,288        pounds823 H (pounds320,000-plus)           120,702      53,336        pounds988  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Valuation Office Agency ??Using Department of Environment figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

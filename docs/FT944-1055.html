			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World in a box: The explosive growth in television viewing in China - The Power of Communication It is a winter's night in Beijing and light snow is sprinkling the window ledges of a worker's dormitory near the city centre, but for the Ma family this is perfect television viewing weather. For Mr Ma, a worker in a car factory, his retired wife and 24-year-old son, bliss these days is viewing the three colour TV sets in their modest two-bedroom apartment - fed by a satellite dish on the balcony and fibre-optic cable. The Mas, who bought their first TV, a locally-made black-and-white set, in 1979, never expected the world outside China to be opened to them as it has been by satellite and cable television. Mr Ma is still shaking his head in wonderment at the spectacle of bungee jumping which he saw for the first time a few nights previously. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that we would have three TV sets and access to such a wide choice of programmes,' says Mrs Ma, who admits a preference for sentimental Hong Kong soap operas. Mr Ma, on the other hand, favours Beijing opera whose peculiar cadences are not to everybody's taste - which is why, his wife jokes, the family requires more than one television set. Ma junior is a soccer aficionado and can indulge his preference on the 24-hour-a-day sport channel broadcast by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Hong Kong-based Star TV via Asia-Sat 1. China's communications revolution is in full swing, although official resistance to the spread of satellite dishes and stricter controls on cable programming mean dissemination of services remains a murky business. In October last year, the state council, or China's cabinet, issued Proclamation 129, which repeated the government's ban on receiving direct foreign broadcasts and imposed severe restrictions on ownership of satellite dishes. The Chinese authorities, made nervous by a flood of uncontrolled information, targeted foreign news broadcasts in particular, including the BBC's, which often carry items critical of Beijing on issues such as human rights. At her home in Beijing's western suburbs, Mrs Zhong, a university teacher, flips through the dozen or so cable channels showing their mixture of cartoons, local news and soap operas before stopping at a static-filled screen. 'That's where the BBC used to be,' she says ruefully. The Zhong family used to receive the BBC, and also CNN, via a large communal satellite dish in their residential compound but, after the state council ban, the service ceased. The Zhongs must now rely solely on cable programming from the government-owned Beijing Cable TV Station. For them, much of the cable programming seems rather mindless, with a heavy diet of Hong Kong and Taiwanese soap operas and kung fu movies. 'The government learnt a lesson after 1989 (the Tiananmen square pro-democracy agitation) and now seems intent on numbing people's political awareness,' says Mrs Zhong. Cable services are spreading rapidly and are available to more than 10 per cent of households with television sets. Some 600 cable systems have been licensed in China, many operated by large institutions for their employees, to relay government-approved programmes that avoid the salacious and politically-incorrect. But for lucky families like the Mas, who had installed their satellite dish or wok (the dishes are likened to the Chinese cooking vessel) before the state council ban, the choice is much wider via Asia-Sat 1. Available services include five Star-TV channels, plus regional services from as far away as Yunnan in southern China. 'People envy us,' says Mrs Ma. 'We can receive more than a dozen channels on satellite, and that is on top of the channels available on cable. Before we bought a satellite dish, we thought of renovating the house, but we bought a dish instead.' The Mas paid Yn3,000 (Dollars 350) for their dish 'through a relative'. Prices range between Yn3,000 and Yn10,000. A cable service costs households Yn8 per month, or less than Dollars 1 Mr Li Hong, manager of the marketing department of Beijing Cable TV Station, says that in Beijing there are 700,000 subscribers (about one in five households) and he expects Beijing subscribers to number 1m next year. Despite the ban on satellite dishes, production continues at a number of factories in the capital, including Factory No 701, a former defence industries plant now owned by Beijing municipality. A sales manager said that, while production had been harmed by the ban, the factory was still in business, selling woks to people in remote areas to improve their access to government-run TV. City people and work units were also finding ways round the ban so there was a steady demand for dishes. Business in the longer run holds enormous promise for foreign and domestic companies involved in delivering programmes and technical services to China's hundreds of millions of television viewers, but a nervous government seems set to keep the brakes on for the time being. This has not prevented the continued spread of television, which has found its way into the vast majority of Chinese households. According to a recent survey by the People's Daily newspaper, 96 per cent of all urban households owned either a colour or black-and-white set, while the figure for rural areas was 48.5 per cent. China is the world's biggest producer of black-and-white TVs and the third biggest producer of colour sets behind South Korea and the US. With multi-set families like the Mas setting a trend, it would seem that domestic demand for colour sets will continue to rise. Mrs Ma herself could hardly be a better advertisement for the new television age. 'Television has changed our lives,' she says. 'It was boring before when we did not have TV, but life has now become more colourful.'</p>

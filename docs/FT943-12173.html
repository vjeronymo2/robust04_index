			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: German group to cut links with Castle Energy Metallgesellschaft, the German industrial group crippled last year by its energy dealings in the US, yesterday revealed it was planning to end its loss-making relationship with Castle Energy, a US refiner. Long-term oil contracts between Castle, of which the German group owns 40 per cent, and MG Corp, its principal US subsidiary, have continued to sap the group's profits in the months since it organised a financial rescue. MG Corp is committed to buying Castle's output under contracts stretching into the next century, at prices above normal market levels. The company is believed to have been trying to negotiate changes to the contracts for some months, with no success. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, MG disclosed it was seeking to 'terminate and/or modify' its relationship with Castle. If it is unable to agree a settlement with Castle, then it is likely to remove financial support from the company, virtually all of whose debt is owed to MG. The German group warned it did not intend to extend debt which falls due from Castle on September 30. Yesterday's news represents an attempt by MG to increase the pressure on Castle in the renegotiations of its contracts with the German group. If these fail MG could face substantial costs, including the write-off of its investment in the company and the loss of much of the debt it is owed. The contracts between MG and Castle have been the subject of intense investigation this year. 'Castle Energy is a money-making machine, and MG Corp is a money-destroying machine,' Mr Kajo Neukirchen, Metallgesellschaft's chairman, was reported as saying recently. 'Whoever is responsible for the 76 individual contracts between MG Corp and Castle Energy must have certainly had an ulterior motive,' he added.</p>

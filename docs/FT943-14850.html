			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: PNG mine review Mr Roy Shipes, a US-based consultant, has flown to Papua New Guinea's Lihir Island to begin a two-week review of a planned goldmine project there, at the request of the country's mining and pet-roleum minister Mr John Kaputin, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Development of the mine, which would be one of the largest outside South Africa, has been held up for months by wrangling within the PNG government over how the project should be structured and financed. Originally, there were hopes that the necessary special mining lease for the project - a joint venture between RTZ of the UK and Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain - would be granted at the beginning of 1994. However, the matter became bogged down in the PNG cabinet, with the dispute apparently centring on whether the state-owned Malaysia Mining Corporation should be brought in at an early stage, and what share of the equity should be given to local landowners.</p>

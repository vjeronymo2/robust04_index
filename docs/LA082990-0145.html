			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SAUDIS BOOST NON-ALCOHOL ORDER  </P> <P> The Bavaria brewery said today that Saudi Arabia has asked it to double its  exports of non-alcoholic beer to the Middle Eastern nation to help quench the  thirst of American soldiers.  </P> <P> "The demand is much too large for us at the moment," said Rien Coolen, a  spokesman for the Bavaria brewery.  </P> <P> Before the request, Bavaria was finding it difficult to meet the demands for  non-alcoholic beer in Saudi Arabia. A strictly Islamic nation, Saudi Arabia  bans the sale of alcohol.  </P> <P> To help meet the Saudi request, the brewery is increasing output and will ask  employees to work overtime, Coolen said.  </P></p>

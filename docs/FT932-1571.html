			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Himself - Theatre Writer Brian Phelan had an idea. The resemblance between the old style actor-managers who barnstormed the country mesmerising audiences with fire and brimstone dramatics, and the modern evangelical preachers in the US with their equally spine-chilling rantings, could surely be crafted into a play. Phelan's second idea was really just a footnote. There is only one actor with the physical presence and dominating personality to step into the shoes of Donald Wolfit and Jimmy Swaggart. Luckily Timothy West was available. Himself is now touring the country. Coming from Dublin, Phelan makes his actor-turned-preacher Irish - Christopher Cameron, or 'Himself', as the man of the house is known in Ireland. And 'Himself', rather than 'Sir' or 'Maestro' demanded by other actor-managers, suits his cosy, domesticated, character. Cameron is not a man of bombast, rather a second-rate travelling player, delighted to be invited to lecture at a Kansas drama school. But his whimsical style and actorly skills attract the attention of sinister business interests, anxious to find a preacher through whom they can cash in on the gullible public who think that a Dollars 25 donation ensures access to Heaven. Cameron treats the role of Bible basher as just another meaty part and the money starts to roll in. The problem is that Phelan does not know what to do with his characters, except the obvious. Himself starts to believe that he is chosen of God; the young acolyte Sister Annie (Sharon Small), who arrives as a sexual rival to Cameron's sensible wife Meg (Susan Engel), just disappears. The initial ending is predictable, but the follow up is incredible. Director Paul Unwin manages to disguise the elusive plot by keeping the dialogue on the boil, and by transforming the drab bare sets of life on the road to a glamorous luxury studio as Himself dominates the Californian TV ratings. We watch the man change from a bald, cor-seted, journeyman actor into a white robed, toupeed prophet, we know that his basic niceness is unimpaired. He, and we, are enjoying a role. The villainous string-pullers always remain mysterious and the plot developments are contrived, but Phelan is good on character, especially Dermot Crowley as John, the marketing man who has found the perfect product in God; Jud Meyers as Tom, the true believer whose faith is explioted; and Susan Engel, who manages to tame Timothy West into a good company man. Richmond until June 26 (081 940 0088)</p>

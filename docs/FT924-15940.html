			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / New Anglo-German ERM row: Treasury angered by leaked report of Bundesbank's defence over Black Wednesday BRITAIN AND Germany were last night embroiled in an extraordinary diplomatic row after an apparent attempt by the Bundesbank to set the record straight over its role in sterling's devaluation misfired. A statement by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, which was made available to the Financial Times through the German embassy in London, brought relations between the UK Treasury and the German central bank to a new low. In his statement, Mr Schlesinger insisted he had not undermined sterling in the controversial interview he gave to Handelsblatt, the German business daily, the day before Black Wednesday when the pound was forced to quit the European exchange rate mechanism. He also: Rebutted UK suggestions that the Bundesbank had failed to give sterling sufficient support in foreign exchange market operations before it floated. Revealed that the Bundesbank had spent DM44bn (Pounds 17.3bn) on defending the pound and lira and that most of that had gone to support sterling. Denied that the Bundesbank had favoured the French franc over the pound during the recent turmoil on the currency markets. Insisted the Bundesbank could not be blamed for what it described as anonymous statements and rumours in the markets and inaccurate reproduction of the central bank's statements by newspapers. The disclosures prompted a sharp response from the UK Treasury. In a statement to which Mr John Major, the prime minister, later attached his name, the Treasury attacked the German disclosures as a breach of confidential communications between the German and UK governments. The statement said Mr Schlesinger's remarks about the interview 'misses the point'. It accused the German embassy in London of having issued on behalf of the Bundesbank 'an almost complete version' of a confidential paper which the German ambassador had delivered to the Foreign Office on Monday. The Bank of England said it did 'not entirely recognise' the German version of events leading to the sterling crisis as set out in the four-page document from the Bundesbank, the release of which it 'very much regretted'. Contacted in Frankfurt last night, Mr Schlesinger appeared dismayed by the latest events. The Bundesbank had hoped to clear the air, he said. 'We have a right and a duty to make our standpoint clear.' Despite the intensification of the Anglo-German row, he said he hoped 'all sides could return to orderly and business-like relationships'. The abrupt escalation in the row over events surrounding sterling's withdrawal from the ERM brought to a head an increasingly bitter dispute between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank. It began when the German embassy in London contacted the Financial Times yesterday to offer a statement from the Bundesbank in which Mr Schlesinger put his side of the sterling devaluation story. The statement had been supplied to the embassy by the German central bank and the embassy said it was given discretion on its distribution. The statement's authenticity was checked with the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. With the knowledge of the German embassy, the UK Treasury and the Bank of England were contacted for their comments. In his statement, entitled 'Comments by Bundesbank President Prof. Dr Helmut Schlesinger on reproaches made by some members of the British government', Mr Schlesinger said he had 'expressly excluded the UK currency from being endangered' in his interview with Handelsblatt. He quoted at length sections of the interview as it appeared in the German newspaper on September 17. The Treasury said the problems for sterling arose not from reports published on September 17, but from what had been published on September 16 and in early reports of Mr Schlesinger's interview which had begun to circulate on the evening of September 15. Among remarks attributed to Mr Schlesinger was the statement that 'the situation in the EMS could have been further eased if there had been a more comprehensive realignment'. The UK Treasury said that 'against a history of reports emanating from the Bundesbank, this was inevitably interpreted as a reference to sterling'. Mr Schlesinger's statement detailed the scale of the Bundesbank support for sterling. He said it had intervened before sterling hit its ERM floor, which had not been required under ERM rules and that D-Mark sales financed by the Bundesbank when the pound hit its floor were 'the largest compulsory interventions ever' for a partner currency. The 'greater part' of the DM44bn of compulsory D-Mark sales during the week of the sterling crisis were for sterling, he added. Bundesbank officials indicated the sum involved was more than DM25bn. The Bundesbank chief said the high level of support for sterling 'was primarily due to the fact that the UK monetary authorities seem to have been prepared to allow sterling to fall to its lower intervention point. The Banque de France, by contrast, concentrated on keeping the franc rate above its intervention point . . .' However, this evidence of German support for the pound cut little ice with the UK Treasury, which said: 'The UK government has never claimed that the Bundesbank did not comply with its technical obligations under the ERM. We have simply noted the very public way in which statements of support for the (French) franc were made, in contrast to the undermining statements made in relation to sterling.' The Treasury's rebuttal also insisted that the German government never suggested a broader realignment of the ERM on the weekend of September 11/12 shortly before the Italian lira was devalued within the system. Last night, the German embassy said yesterday's statement was different from that given by Baron Hermann Von Richthofen, the German ambassador to London, to Sir David Gilmore, permanent under secretary at the Foreign Office. Philip Stephens writes: As well as prompting an angry response from Mr Major, the row between the Bundesbank and the Treasury raised new questions among ministerial colleagues about Mr Norman Lamont's long-term future as chancellor. After a day of painstaking attempts to rebuild bridges with Britain's European partners, the prime minister at first declined last night to comment directly on Mr Schlesinger's comments. Speaking after a meeting with Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, Mr Major said he had not seen the note sent to the Foreign Office: 'When I have seen it I will comment on it'. But within minutes, the Treasury indicated that Mr Major had attached his name - and that of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - to the government's detailed rebuttal of the Bundesbank president's charges. The public clashes prompted dismay among other ministers and raised questions among some about Mr Lamont's handling of the issue. The Foreign Office, anxious to mend fences with Bonn, will see the latest dispute as a significant setback. Bad blood, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 26</p>

			<p>Analyzed   <F P=102>   94WS0325C Paris LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE in French 22 Apr 94 p  41--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0325C </F> <F P=104>  Paris LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "The Downside of Liberalization"] </F>   [Text] According to the financial rating firm  Moody's, European carriers could lose an average of 25 percent  of their market shares when telecommunication services are fully  liberalized.    European telecoms operators, most of whom still enjoy a  monopoly on telephone service and infrastructures, could lose  approximately 25 percent of their shares over the next 10 years,  when the European Union fully liberalizes the telecommunications  industry. Such is the conclusion of a study by the financial  rating firm Moody's.    Some French experts, who cite Britain's experience, find the  25-percent figure a bit high. Ten years post-liberalization, BT  [British Telecom] reportedly still has 90 percent of the  telecommunication services market in Great Britain. Moody's also  estimates that competition from open markets could lower the  market shares of traditional carriers by 10 to 15 percent in  certain niches during the first two years after liberalization.    Generally speaking, companies such as Telefonica, Stet, or  Deutsche Telekom, which charge high rates for both residential  and business service, will be more vulnerable to the risks of  competitive pressure than France Telecom or Belgacom.    Moody's considers BT a perfect example of a company that was  successful in making the transition from monopoly to  market-oriented carrier, for it positioned itself to be  competitive in a totally open telecoms market.    European operators should nonetheless enjoy a solid credit  rating in the medium term, since the process of  telecommunications liberalization in the European Union will be  much slower than in other parts of the world.    But their rating is still expected to deteriorate in the  longer run, when liberalization--slated for 1998 or 2003  depending on the country--goes into effect, says Moody's.  Indeed, carriers will have to take on debt to invest the  substantial sums needed to expand and update networks, and will  be dealing with competition for the first time.    That being the case, traditional operators will have to cut  costs to become more flexible on rates and withstand competitive  pressures. The speed and timing of decisions will be crucial.</p>

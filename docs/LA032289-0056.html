			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Czechoslovak appeals court cut a month from dissident Vaclav Havel's  nine-month jail sentence. Havel, 52, a co-founder of the Charter 77 human  rights movement, was arrested Jan. 16 when he sought to mark the 20th  anniversary of a student's suicide-protest against the 1968 Soviet-led invasion  of Czechoslovakia. The appeals court, while confirming Havel's Feb. 21  conviction on an incitement charge, also ordered him transferred to a prison  with less harsh conditions than those normally ordered for repeat offenders.  About 200 of Havel's supporters paraded outside the courtroom calling for his  freedom. Havel called the sentence "an act of revenge for my opinions."  </P></p>

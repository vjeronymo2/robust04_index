			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Economics Notebook: A challenging descent from heaven assassinated head of the Treuhand agency charged with privatising East German industry - resigned as state secretary of the German Economics Ministry in 1980, he left to run a steel company. As announced last week, Sir Peter Middleton, who is resigning as permanent secretary of the UK Treasury next month, will move to the City as a director and deputy chairman of the Barclays Bank group and to head Barclays' newly-formed markets and investment banking division. Once in the Square Mile, he will be rubbing shoulders with other ex-Treasury knights. Sir Geoffrey Littler, one of Sir Peter's former deputies, was appointed last week to be chairman of NatWest Investment Bank. Sir Douglas Wass, Sir Peter's immediate predecessor as permanent secretary, is co-chairman of Nomura International. The amakudari, or 'descent from heaven', of these eminent gentlemen will doubtless gild their final working years. But what does it tell us about Britain, and is it good news for the country? Just as Downing Street was announcing Sir Peter's departure from the Treasury, the Confederation of British Industry reported a sharp fall in industry's research and development since 1988. The report showed that industry-funded R&amp;D in Britain, in proportion to output, was about half Japanese and German levels. The coincidence of these two news items gives powerful backing to an argument put forward earlier this year by Mr Walter Eltis, the director general of the National Economic Development Office*, to the effect that Britain's poor investment record in manufacturing and fragile international competitiveness can be partly linked to too great a concentration of national effort in the areas of finance and banking. Mr Eltis cited figures showing that investment in financial services in Britain rose 313 per cent in volume terms between 1979 and 1990 while investment in manufacturing barely rose at all. In the 11 years, financial sector investment as a share of total investment in plant and machinery rose to 29.4 per cent from 11.7 per cent. But while the UK had put a 'great many eggs into the financial basket', the recent history of UK banking had exposed miscalculations and weaknesses such as the catalogue of loss-making decisions at the Midland Bank. Mr Eltis concluded that excessive inflation, poor real rates of return and a pro-housing bias in the UK's financial institutions had also crimped investment. But 'the impact on the direction of investment of an apparently hyper-profitable City, the superiority of which now appears in part illusory' was a factor. Worryingly, Mr Eltis suggests that the recent woes in UK banking and insurance cast doubt over the ability of Britain's financial sector to reap the promised harvest of the Europrean single market. It will be up to Sir Peter Middleton and the other mature madarins who make a bee-line for the City to prove him wrong. **** A bias in favour of finance is not an exclusively British preserve. When Mr Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, sought a vehicle to turn his vision of a united European economic area stretching from the Urals to the coast of Portugal into reality, he thought of a bank. At last week's inauguration of the EBRD in London, there were plenty of people suggesting that a better way of helping eastern and central Europe move to democracy and develop the market economy would be for the west to lower trade barriers to products in which the former communist countries have a comparative advantage. In Washington last week, the Czechoslovak foreign minister Mr Jiri Dienstbier was giving the same message to President George Bush. The progress being made towards reaching association agreements between the European Community and Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows that the EC is responding to these pressures. In London last week, Mr Henning Christophersen, an EC Commission member, acknowledged that the former communist states 'had no real economic prospects' without free access to the industrial world's markets. This view was echoed by Mr Attali, who said the EBRD would prepare a strategy for opening up trade relations between east and west. What this would entail was unclear, however. Like much else concerning the business operations of the EBRD, it is a question of wait and see. **** Is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ripe for expansion? A South Korean delegation will visit the OECD this week for talks about joining the 24-nation Paris-based economic think tank of industrialised countries. Mexico is also a likely candidate, while several east European countries have also expressed an interest in joining. New members are only admitted to the club with the unanimous agreement of existing members. South Korea's human rights record could pose problems. But it is a member of the EBRD which has the promotion of pluralism and democracy among its goals. *In 'The State of the Economy 1991', published by IEA, 2 Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB at Pounds 9.95.</p>

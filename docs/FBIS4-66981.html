			<p>Minority   Groups   <F P=102> BK3004112494 Bangkok KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT in Thai 30 Apr 94 pp  16, 15 </F>  <F P=103> BK3004112494 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT </F> <F P=105>  Thai </F> BFN     [Excerpt] A KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT correspondent filed a  report on his recent visit to Shan State, the territory under  control of Khun Sa, a world-renowned heroin producer. He said  he could hear the sounds of gunfire from the fighting between  the Burmese and ethnic minority forces along the Thai-Burmese  border in Mae Hong Son Province. He also reported that many  young men aged between 10 and 15 are receiving military  training. Boys are drafted into the Shan Army when they reach  15 years of age.    From Saengchai Saengchu, the Khan Sa group's assistant  coordinator for civilian affairs, he learned that in early 1994  the Burmese Government spent $1 billion to buy 14 Mirage  aircraft from China. The Chinese Mirage is a copy of the  Russian version.    Saengchai said: "We have information that the Burmese  Government paid 40 percent of the cost of the Mirage in cash.  The aircraft will be used to suppress antigovernment minority  groups. The Burmese Government obtained money from signing away  fishing, gem mining, and logging concessions. The remaining 60  percent could be paid to China by allowing it to build a highway  from Mandalay to Rangoon and a large seaport to give China a new  access to the sea."    Saengchai said his information is that not all the planes  will be used against Khun Sa forces. Most of them will be  targetted against the Karen rebel group who controls the area  opposite Thailand's Mae Sariang District and Tak Province. Two  of the planes have already been shot down by Karen rebels.    Shan State leader Khun Sa, however, said he was not  frightened by Burmese Government's purchase of Chinese planes to  suppress rebellious minority groups. His forces have  antiaircraft guns and SAM-7 rockets to deal with these planes.  His men have also been instructed to build protective shelters.    Khun Sa said: "We have hired foreign technicians. We are now  able to produce RPG's. Although their quality is not that good,  they will be able to shoot down Burmese planes because the  planes are an older model and have low capabilities. They also  have a short flying period because of their small fuel tanks."  Moreover, Khun Sa said he now has 47,000 soldiers after the  training of the 27th batch in early 1994. Another batch of  4,000 have already started the 28th training cycle. Another  7,000 is expected to be trained in the 29th cycle and another  8,000 in the 30th cycle. He expects that by the end of this  year his forces will grow by another 20,000 men. This size will  be sufficient to fight the Burmese Government soldiers. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by W.K.: "The Candidacy of Siwiec Accepted by </F> Olechowski; Priorities of Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The security of our country, the issue of European  Union [EU] membership, and policy toward our Eastern neighbors  and the Central and East European countries--these are the four  priorities of Polish diplomacy that were submitted yesterday to  members of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee by Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski. On 12 May, Minister Olechowski is  supposed to deliver an official speech in the Sejm in which he  will present the goals of our country's foreign policy.    The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MON] stated  that  one of the main goals of the Polish diplomatic service is to  make the Polish defense system compatible with that of NATO as  soon as possible. He said that, in its striving for EU  membership, Poland intends to take advantage of the period in  which the EU will be chaired by Germany. It will want to obtain  further commitments concerning Poland's admission to the  "Twelve." While speaking about Eastern policy, Olechowski, who  has left on a private visit to Moscow, stressed the need to  enliven Polish-Russian contacts, so that they could reach the  level of development that has been achieved with Western states.  Olechowski expressed the view that it must be agreed with Russia  that "we disagree on global issues" and that we must try to  cooperate in all other areas.    The minister also emphasized that Poland is satisfied with  the level of cooperation within the Visegrad Group. In reply to  a question concerning the chances of Marek Siwiec (of the  Democratic Left Alliance) filling the post of deputy foreign  affairs minister, the MON head revealed that he likes this  candidate for the position. While speaking about changes in the  organization of the ministry, Olechowski said that people in the  posts of deputy ministers will create foreign policy along with  the head of the ministry and will fulfill representative  functions in both Poland and abroad. They will not, however,  steer the ministry or "any of its sections."    Committee Chairman Bronisaw Geremek divulged that one of the  problems of Poland's Eastern policy is the stand on the  possibility of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Geremek  said that, on this issue, the opinions of the committee's  members are divided. Some of them believe that, if such a  conflict erupts, we should keep out of it. Others believe that  if Ukraine's independence is jeopardized, it will prove that  Russia's imperialism is reviving. Therefore, the committee  chairman stated, it is necessary to closely follow developments  in the CIS.    Geremek stressed that the session of the committee and the  forthcoming debate in the Sejm prove that the discussion on our  country's foreign policy is becoming increasingly more  democratic. Asked why the meeting of the committee was closed to  the press at the last moment, the chairman stated that the  minister had requested it because he wanted his Sejm speech "not  to lose the charm of freshness."</p>

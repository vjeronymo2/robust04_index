			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A group of 75 US congressmen, led by John Spratt,  Head of the Congressional Textile Caucus, has urged US Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor to take retaliatory measures  against nine major textile exporters, including Thailand,  charging them with failing to satisfactorily open their markets  for access of US textile exports by a February 15 deadline.    According to a report from the Thai Commercial Counsellor in  Washington to the Commerce Permanent Secretary, the nine textile  and garment exporters targetted for US action are Indonesia,  Egypt, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Turkey and  the Philippines.    The report maintained that the US textile group cast doubt  on  whether the US government could achieve success in its  market-opening talks with other countries under the Uruguay  Round negotiations, which is scheduled to be endorsed on April  15.    The group was disappointed as the US could not negotiate to  prolong the textile agreement. It demanded the government do  what it had promised: open foreign markets for US products like  the US market is opened for foreign imports.    The group has proposed the US government impose retaliatory  measures against countries failing to satisfactorily open their  markets for US products.    The measures proposed include:    -- Increasing customs duties on major textile products.    -- Opposing membership applications to the World Trade  Organisation.    -- Cancelling the generalised system of preference  privileges.</p>

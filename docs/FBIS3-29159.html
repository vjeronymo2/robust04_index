			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The cabinet approved on  Tuesday [15 February] a fiscal 1994 defense budget proposal of  4,683.5 billion yen, up 0.9 percent over the initial fiscal 1993  budget and the smallest rate of increase in 34 years.    In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the  budget proposal sets aside 882 billion yen to acquire front-line  weapons, including four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767  AWACS reconnaissance planes, officials said.    The purchases will double the number of AWACS planes, which  could be used to detect a possible firing of North Korean  missiles or an intrusion by Russian jet bombers or missiles into  Japanese airspace, the officials said.    In view of "still unstable security factors surrounding  Japan," the government sanctioned a Defense Agency request to  purchase new radar for its Patriot antimissile system and  sophisticated computer software to enhance the intercepting  capability of Japan's armory of 320 Patriot missiles, an  official said.    Under the current five-year defense buildup plan, officials  said, Japan is trying to expand the Patriot armory from 16 to 26  firing units -- or a total of 520 Patriots to be fired from 130  mobile launching vehicles.    The fresh Patriot radar and firing control system will cost  33.5 billion yen, while a set of Patriot parts and computer  software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said.    The software will raise the capability of eight of Japan's  Patriot units to the level of the PAC-2 Patriot missiles -- the  same models used by U.S. troops during the 1991 Gulf war to  knock out Iraqi SCUD missiles, they said.    One firing unit comprises five mobile launching vehicles, a  phased array antenna, 20 missiles and another radar vehicle.    But unless Japan acquired the Theater Missile Defense (TMD)  system -- an improved version of the PAC-2 Patriot -- it would  not be able to shoot down North Korean Nodong-1 missiles, which  are reportedly capable of delivering nuclear warheads, they said.    North Korea is now under international pressure to allow  inspections of suspected nuclear weapons plants in Yongbyon,  some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.    Yoshiaki Hotsuki, special assistant for the defense buildup  program of the agency's defense policy bureau, told reporters,  "the PAC-2 Patriot system cannot repel the Nodong missile, so we  are watching how far the United States has developed the TMD  system."    The Defense Agency had originally pushed for purchases of  the  AWACS and Patriots to counter the threat of Russian jet bombers  and missiles, whose longer ranges are seen placing a greater  limit on Japan's intercepting time and capability, the officials  said.    Now the agency says the North Korean missiles have given it  another headache. The 1993 defense white paper warned, "the  Nodong missile will be able to reach most parts of Japanese  territory if Pyongyang deploys it to specific areas on its soil."    The fiscal 1994 defense budget accounts for 0.948 percent of  Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994.    Meanwhile, the budget boosts its allocations toward the  costs  of U.S. Forces in Japan by 8 percent to 432.4 billion yen.    Of this sum, 123.4 billion yen is to pay 75 percent of the  labor costs of some 22,000 Japanese employees at U.S. bases in  Japan, utilities and other costs.</p>

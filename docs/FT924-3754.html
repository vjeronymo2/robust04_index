			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Bush orders 28,000 troops into Somalia to aid relief PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday ordered 28,000 US troops into Somalia to bring relief to the country's starving population in an operation dubbed Restore Hope. Marines will fly in early next week, securing the capital, Mogadishu, and an inland airfield for a massive UN military airlift to the country, said Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary. 'We are prepared for hostilities should they occur . . . and if necessary to take pre-emptive action,' he said. In a televised address, Mr Bush said he wanted to create a secure environment and open the supply routes so food could be moved into the areas of Somalia worst hit by famine. Once that was accomplished the US would withdraw its own troops and hand over the security operation to a UN peacekeeping force, Mr Bush said. 'Make no mistake about it, we and our allies will make sure that aid goes through.' On Thursday evening the US was given the go-ahead by a unanimous UN Security Council vote authorising the use of a multinational force composed mainly of US troops to protect the distribution of aid in Somalia. French president Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that France would send 1,500-2,000 troops. An Italian contingent, estimated by newspapers at 2,000, would join the force, said Italy's foreign minister, Mr Emilio Colombo. Belgium will send 550 paratroopers and Canada 900 troops. Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif said Islamabad was willing to send more troops to join the 500 already there. Britain is likely to offer the use of transport aeroplanes, the Defence Ministry said. The operation may open a new chapter both for UN intervention in the internal affairs of member nations and for the US in its role as the world's sole remaining superpower. The humanitarian operation to help the Kurds in Iraq after the Gulf war provides some precedent for a US military relief operation. American troops, however, have not been deployed in such numbers before without any reference to national security interests. President-elect Bill Clinton had earlier called the UN approval of a US-led force an 'historic and welcome step', and commended Mr Bush for 'taking the lead in this important humanitarian effort'. Some Clinton advisers, however, appeared concerned that the operation would not be over by the time he takes office on January 20, and that his administration would be left to extricate the US from Somalia. Although Mr Bush would prefer to have US troops home before he hands over to Mr Clinton, Pentagon officials said they were more likely to stay two to three months. Some congressmen, from both parties, are also worried that the US's commitment could turn out to be too broad and ill-defined.</p>

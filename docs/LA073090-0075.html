			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN SURFERS ARRIVING IN WAVES;  </P> <P> TOURISM: NO OTHER LOCATION IN THE WORLD IS QUITE THE MECCA FOR DEVOTEES OF THE  SPORT, THANKS IN PART TO EQUIPMENT MAKERS AND THE LOCAL LIFESTYLE.  </P> <P> The three Japanese surfers who walked into Jack's Surfboards didn't bat an  eyelash at the $360 price tags for new surfboards.  </P> <P> They just pointed to a dozen shiny new boards displayed on a rack and, without  haggling over prices, told the salesman, "We want that one, that one and that  one."  </P> <P> Traveler's checks were hurriedly signed for the amount, which, with tax, came  to $1,150. That business finished, they then asked, "Which way is Trestles?"  </P> <P> "They always say they want to go to Trestles," said store manager Shawn  Shehadeh, who drew the visitors a map and sent them on their way down Pacific  Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Once a rare sight, today hundreds of Japanese, Australian and Brazilian surfers  and other surfing travelers make a point of visiting Orange County each year,  according to surf shop owners and industry experts. Many are not leaving.  </P> <P> "To the foreign traveler, California is a paradise. But aside from surfing, a  lot of them come here because of the lifestyle," said Thomas K. Brimer, owner  of the Frog House surf shop in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Orange County, more than any other location in the world, is a surfing mecca.  More surfboard makers and more manufacturers and distributors of surfing  apparel, wet suits, body boards and related water equipment are in Orange  County than anywhere else.  </P> <P> "I think California is the most modern of all the surfing places in the world,"  said Emerilson (Gio) Gil Emerin, 21, who left his native Brazil and has been in  Huntington Beach for a year. "It's got the best equipment in the world, the  surf here is good, it's got the best girls, and the best people.  </P> <P> "You walk in a surf shop in Brazil, and you find maybe one or two different  kinds of wet suits. Here, you get 10 kinds of wet suits and 10 different  manufacturers," Gil Emerin said.  </P> <P> The Japanese arrive hoping to turn a small profit from their California trips.  Like eager traders eyeing pork bellies, the Japanese buy surfboards low and  sell high, taking advantage of a phenomenal demand in Japan for U.S.-made  boards.  </P> <P> With gasoline at $3.82 a gallon, other petroleum-based products such as  surfboards are exorbitantly expensive in Japan. In addition, having few  surfboard shapers -- people who sand and shape a surfboard blank into the  finished product -- means that California-made boards sell for $800 to $1,000.  </P> <P> "In Japan," said Tokyo-born Takayuki Wakita, 18, who is staying in San Clemente  for two months, Japanese-made "surfboards sell for $700. Everything is  expensive and everybody wants an American-made surfboard."  </P> <P> The Japanese come with tons of money. They are well-versed on surfing and  surfing lore, although they have trouble pronouncing the surf spots, and they  "try and buy anything" related to surfing, Shehadeh said.  </P> <P> "They buy an off-the-rack board for $360, use it for two months while they're  visiting here, then sell it in Japan for $800, and it helps pay for their  trip," Shehadeh explained, adding: "They're willing to pay for the big names  with big bucks."  </P> <P> Current favorite surfboard models among the Japanese include those by Channel  Islands Surfboards of Santa Barbara. The board's popularity stems in part from  several visits to Japan by Channel Islands Surfboard owner Al Merrick and by  Tom Curren, one of the world's most popular professional surfers, who is  sponsored by Channel Islands.  </P> <P> To the Japanese, surfing in Orange County is a serious business. But to the  Brazilians, Orange County is a fun place to party. For the Australians, it's a  combination of everything. Cultural perspectives can often get ruffled, said  Brazilian Gil Emerin, who told a story about the time he took a girlfriend to  Huntington Beach late at night.  </P> <P> "I was sitting on the beach around midnight and all of a sudden we hear this  loud voice saying: 'The beach is now closed. Go home!' I said, 'What do you  mean, the beach is closed?'  </P> <P> "Then a Jeep pulls up and this cop tells us again, 'The beach is closed. You  have to leave.' I argued. I mean, who can close a beach? In Brazil, our beaches  are open . . . all the time. Only God can close a beach."  </P> <P> For surfer Robert Bogie from Bell's Beach, Australia, his native land's rural  coastline and natural beauty beats California's, he said.  </P> <P> "But in California, it has a certain je ne sais quoi (I don't know), a certain  little something extra," Bogie said.  </P> <P> Bogie, a 27-year-old accountant, landed at Los Angeles International Airport  six weeks ago. Typical of most surf travelers, he didn't know anyone and had no  place to stay.  </P> <P> "I stayed overnight on the beach in Santa Monica with the homeless people. The  next day I hitched a ride to a surf shop at Zuma Beach. I bought a board,  surfed and met two women from Perth and West Germany. A week later, we drove  down to Newport Beach, and we've been sharing expenses ever since," Bogie said.  </P> <P> Bogie has surfed in Portugal, Bali and Hawaii. But when he first visited Orange  County three years ago, he remembered what it was like to see the pier at  Huntington Beach for the first time.  </P> <P> "It has a reputation because it was featured in some of the (surfing)  magazines. I think that the Huntington Beach Pier, in regards to the California  surf scene, represents a certain amount of nostalgia, and it's that nostalgia  you feel while sitting on the pier with the wind on your face and the sun  shining on you. It's a buzz to realize that all the world champions of surfing  surfed here."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Another plenary session has been postponed in  Lusaka, Zambia. The session was expected to examine the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA]  reply presented to the mediator yesterday. Our correspondent in  Lusaka, Joao Ligio reports.    The new document presented by UNITA asks for the  continuation  of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's [Vorgan]  broadcasts on shortwave, the return of its property in good  condition, and the granting of party installations and houses  for its leaders. UNITA also announced the introduction of a new  list of its 70 deputies.    The government, which was expected to give its official  reaction had the plenary session had taken place, said that  Vorgan Radio should operate on shortwave only until December.  Thereafter, it should join other medium wave national broadcasts.    On the return of property, the government says: Give me what  is mine, and you will have what is yours. If you impose  conditions on what is mine, you will receive equal treatment.    On the granting of party installations and houses for UNITA  leaders, the government referred to the law regulating the  acquisition of immovable property in the country.    On the new list of UNITA deputies, the government wants to  know the fate of those who in parliament speak in the name of  UNITA.    What is strange is that this document does not mention the  debate over ministries and provinces. This could mean the  parties are making progress in this direction. According to  UNITA's Jorge Valentim, his delegation accepts the government's  offer of the Ministries of Health, Tourism and Hotel Industry,  and Public Works. The Public Works Ministry will still be  debated, in view of its nonexistence. Jorge Valentim said UNITA  accepts the Provinces of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango,  and it is presently negotiating the Provinces of Benguela and  Huambo, which the government says are negotiable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Naji 'Allush, leader of the Arab Popular </F> Liberation Movement: "Season for Questions About Yasir 'Arafat"]    [Text] This year, Arabs in general, and Palestinians in  particular, are asking more and more questions about 'Arafat's  identity. The questions involve his name, family, his true ties  to Palestine, etc.    Why are these questions being raised now? Why weren't they  asked on such a large scale when 'Arafat experienced a meteoric  rise to fame against the backdrop of armed struggle?    These questions are definitely the result of skepticism. The  "rebel" who sparked off armed resistance in 1965 is now a  would-be "governor". The identity of a "rebel" lies in his  rifle. A rebel can also lead others while he remains in caves  and hideouts and walks the streets wearing a mask. However, a  ruler cannot rule wearing a mask and cannot become a head of  state without revealing his identity.    The Arabs of Palestine, just like all other Arabs, care a  great deal about knowing people and their background, even if  this means little to them. Faced with such questions, what will  'Arafat do?    Press and radio reporters have tried to ask Yasir 'Arafat  where he was born. He avoided their questions. Television  reporters have persistently asked 'Arafat to tell viewers about  Jerusalem, his birthplace, and about the playground of his  childhood. He refused. When pressed, however, he said: "I was  born in the al-Aqsa Mosque." A witty person commented: It seems  Mr. 'Arafat does not know that the al-Aqsa Mosque has no  hospital. Also, women do not usually give birth during prayer.    The "rebel" has turned into a would-be "governor". The  people want to have an idea about their new ruler, who has now  abandoned the assumed role of liberating rebel and agreed to  supervise a process of liquidation.    What has 'Arafat got to tell those people? How will he reply  to their persistent questions? He cannot now refuse to answer,  as he did in the past on the pretext of security and secrecy.    He will say: My real name is Muhammad 'Abd-al-Ra'uf  al-Qudwah. The majority will be surprised.    Where was your father born? Where did he die? Where was  your grandfather born? Where did he die?    My father was was born in Cairo. He also died in Cairo. My  grandfather died in Cairo. That is all.    Do you have a family home in Palestine?    No, we were not like all the other Palestinians who had a  home and planted trees. Besides, Salah-al-Din did not have a  house in Palestine.    How do you consider yourself a Palestinian according to the  law of the Palestine National Council [PNC], when you do not  have well-known Palestinian parents? Why did you deny Nayif  Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, membership in the PNC because he does  not have Palestinian parents, even though his father's  birthplace is known? Hawatimah's birthplace is known. Hawatimah  has been leading a Palestinian faction since 1968. Why did you  foment a parochial Palestinian approach driving the people who  advocated your leadership to consider Palestine an entity that  differs from the rest of the Arab homeland; to say that the  Palestinians descend from non-Arab Kanaanites; to say that  Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza, should be a state; that...,  that..., that..., and that the Palestinian identity should be  asserted before the Arab identity, so that it can merge with the  Zionist identity?    It is true that Salah-al-Din did not have a house in  Palestine. However, he went to Palestine to liberate it and not  to become a mayor under occupation.    The man who came to us from Egypt and who lived in Egypt,  along with his father and grandfather, also does not bear  Egyptian nationality. He would not tell us where he came from,  how he became Palestinian, and why did he not become an  Egyptian, like all others who lived in Egypt late last century.  If we go to Jablah, we will find the roots of the al-Qassam  family, who was martyred in Palestine in 1963.    If we go to Homs, we will find the roots of the family of  Sa'id al-'As, who was martyred near Hebron in 1937. Where can  we find the roots of the man who lives amongst us and plans to  go back to Gaza-Jericho as a ruler under occupation?    The people asking this question will go to Jerusalem and  Amman and will not find an answer because the experts in family  trees and city and village dwellers know nothing about 'Arafat,  nor about 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Qudwah. Bi'r Zayt Mayor Tawfiq  Ibrahim al-Kaylah asked me in 1978 in Baghdad: Do you know  where Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] comes from? I replied: Why?  He said: We, the mayors of the West Bank and Gaza, got  together and none of us knew anything about 'Arafat, his father,  grandfather, or house. I told him: You will not find anything  of this, because his father and grandfather were nor born in  Palestine, nor lived there. His father visited Jerusalem in the  1920's and married a woman from Jerusalem, and this is the  secret of 'Arafat's affinity with Palestine, as people in the  know say. 'Arafat has led the Palestinians to Gaza-Jericho  after wresting leadership in the name of armed struggle and full  liberation. He reduced this liberation into a state, then into  representation, and then into Gaza-Jericho. No one knows where  he will end up.    The Palestinians, together with the Arab masses, should  ask: How did this change happen? In whose interest is it? Why  did the factions fail to know the person who was leading them  and the PLO since 1968, in accordance with his program, until we  reached the Gaza-Jericho accord? As it has become necessary now  to know the person who will become a ruler, it is necessary to  know his program well before he, together with his followers,  become the authority that liquidates the cause and turns the  Palestinian municipal system into an alternative to liberation  and the cause. However, why are these questions raised now?    We believe there are many reasons, and the most prominent  are  the following:    First: The Gaza-Jericho accord prompted people to ask: Where  did the man who agreed to something that was never previously  accepted by any Palestinian leadership come from? Who is this  person, who carried the gun in the name of liberation, to lead  his supporters and opponents to the liquidation of the cause?    Second: 'Arafat's competitors from the West Bank and Gaza,  who exploited his move toward the settlement, are working to  replace him now that he has played the role they could not play.  They are the alternatives who want to rule. Therefore, sons of  famous families, who agreed to play a limited role under the  power of resistance, are now trying to show that their origins  are more deeply rooted than those of the president.    Third: Many people want to know the personality of the  coming  ruler, because the identity of this ruler is not known like that  of Faysal al-Husayni, Sirri Nusaybah, Hanan 'Ashrawi, and  others. This makes people ask many questions.    Fourth: His aides, who agreed to play secondary roles in the  past, now want to play greater roles, to have positions in the  future. Those people are encouraged by Arab and foreign  quarters that seek to implement the Gaza-Jericho accord in  accordance with the set plans. What will 'Arafat say in  response to questions about his identity? What will he answer  regarding his program, which was exposed by the Gaza-Jericho  accord?    The secret is in the official quarters in Cairo that sent  'Arafat to become the chairman of the PLO instead of al-Shuqayri  [former PLO chairman], that has taken care of him throughout all  these years, which sent him to Gaza-Jericho, and which is still  planning for him and looking after his march.    However, the answers to the questions might come from Tel  Aviv and Washington, or from any other place. 'Arafat, who does  not know the Palestinian people, will face many difficulties.  The first: How can he govern while his identity and program are  still unknown, although he led the resistance with an unknown  identity and program? Resistance is one thing, governing is  something else. The secret, however, will become more ambiguous  if the ruler leaves before stepping on the land of Palestine,  when other well-known leaders appear.    The bitter fact, however, will remain, whether or not the  man  stays, and whether or not the secret is revealed. How did  'Arafat lead committees, councils, and masses that did not know  him? How was he able all this time to hide the reality of his  program, which is more important than his identity and origin?  We admit he is smart and others are naive, although the man was  exposed by his personality and acts, although his course was not  revolutionary, his experience not that of a leader, his bravery  not real, and although he did not enjoy any of the skills that  qualify him to be a leader. All this was known by all those who  dealt with him inside and outside the PLO. What is not known  about him was not hidden from those who wanted to know and who  refused to place their fate in the hands of unknown persons.    Despite all this, some factions supported him while others  opposed him in a way that strengthened his position. The whole  Arab order supported him. Although the Arab order differed with  him, it wanted him to stay and to expeditiously impose his full  authority over the Palestinians. Now that he has led the  resistance, the PLO, and the Palestinians to the Gaza-Jericho  accord, his identity and program must be known so that despair  will make people see no other savior except him. [as published]    As people such as 'Adnan al-Yasin [Palestinian security  official arrested in Tunis for collaboration with the Mosad]  have been exposed, other people will be exposed in the coming  days, months, and years.    In brief, 'Arafat has hidden behind the liberation program  in  order to hide his identity and his program, in order to lead the  Palestine question to its present situation. He has  strengthened and protected himself by the capitulation of the  Arab order and by American arrogance. Now that he has revealed  his program, he does not care if his identity is revealed as  long as he is protected by the force of the international order.</p>

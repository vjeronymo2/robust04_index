			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FLAMES WILL TRY TO WIN FIRST CUP WITH CUP FIRST  </P> <P> In the long and esteemed history of the Montreal Canadiens, the team has never  lost the Stanley Cup at home.  </P> <P> Upon hearing that, Calgary Coach Terry Crisp -- the guy who "ain't afraid of no  ghosts," who says home-ice advantage is a maligned and over-used phrase, who  says his team always plays well in Montreal, who puts no stock in odds and  percentages -- spit out a phrase akin to "Oh, shoot!"  </P> <P> "Now I'm nervous," Crisp said. "I've never heard of that statistic."  </P> <P> But Crisp and his Calgary Flames are going to make a run at it tonight when  they go into Game 6 of the Stanley Cup series with a three-games-to-two lead.  </P> <P> A victory by Montreal would tie the series and send it to Calgary for Game 7 on  Sunday. A victory by Calgary would give the Flames their first Stanley Cup and  end the streak that lends itself to talk of ghosts and mystique.  </P> <P> "Well," Crisp said. "If it has to happen, we'd like to be the team to do it."  </P> <P> The Flames won Game 4 here Sunday night, coming back after a double-overtime  loss at the Forum in Game 3. And then the Flames won a second consecutive game  in Calgary Tuesday to tie the series. A victory in Game 6 to win the Cup would  be the Flames' third consecutive victory over the Canadiens.  </P> <P> The Canadiens haven't lost three in a row this season.  </P> <P> Crisp chose rest over practice for his team on the travel day, making the  announcement shortly after saying that the Flames' performance in Game 5 was  their worst of the series.  </P> <P> When Montreal Coach Pat Burns was asked after the game Tuesday night what his  game plan will be tonight, he said: "We are going to win. There is nothing else  we can do. The only thing to do on Thursday is win the game."  </P> <P> Said Montreal's Bobby Smith: "It's gonna be a great Game 6 at the Montreal  Forum. The Stanley Cup finals! We have a lot of momentum on our side coming off  the last 40 or 50 minutes of Game 5."  </P> <P> Among the many complaints the Canadiens had about the way the game was  officiated Tuesday was this from Bobby Smith, commenting on an interference  call on him that negated a Montreal power play: "Yes, I bumped him. But I've  bumped my wife harder trying to get past her in the kitchen."  </P> <P> Calgary's Al MacInnis on the fact that both teams use four lines: "Bobby Smith  said earlier that we're the first team that they've played this season with  four lines. It is a big part of both clubs. You can run into injuries when  players get tired. And you have more fresh guys out there, so it's a real  advantage."  </P> <P> Commenting on how well right winger Joey Mullen has been playing, Crisp said:  "He's a throwback. I've been saying this all year. He's a throwback to Gordie  Howe and Glenn Hall. No hoopla or big banners. Just put your jersey on and  play. I keep seeing things from Joey Mullen. When it comes to athe third or  fourth effort, Joey keeps coming up with a new twist."  </P></p>

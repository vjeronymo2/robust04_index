The lamellar transformation  process relates to aging temperature and cooling rate, at which  _a_[.sub]2[/] single phase forms. A model of lamellar  transformation kinetics was developed. The stability of lamellae  decreases with decreasing interlamellar spacing and  discontinuous coarsening occurs during aging.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Seven terrorists were killed in clashes with  security forces in Batman's Beseri and Siirt's Kurtalan and  Baykan Districts and on Gabar Mountain near Sirnak. Four  terrorists, one of them a foreigner, surrendered to the security  forces in a bid to benefit from the repentance law.    Sixteen members of the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] organization, who were trained in Greece in  explosives and sabotage actions and who were planning to  undertake actions in tourist centers in the Aegean region, were  captured in Izmir along with their weapons. The terrorists  arrived in Turkey from Greece aboard boats. The three boats  they used, one of them a speedboat, were confiscated.    The separatist organization's foreign courier and its  regional leader are among those caught as a result of a series  of operations conducted by the Izmir Security Directorate  antiterror units. In their interrogation, the terrorists  confessed that they were trained in explosives and sabotage at a  PKK camp in Greece. It was said that they were caught at a time  when they were awaiting orders to begin actions in order to  undermine Turkish tourism. Noting that they provided personnel  for the terrorist organization's cadres in the mountains, the  terrorists explained that they conducted work in Izmir's  Yamanlar Mountain for a camp to be used temporarily for entering  and leaving the country. Searches conducted of the terrorists'  houses and of their persons yielded one Kalashnikov automatic  rifle, two pistols, magazines and ammunition for these weapons,  two sticks of dynamite, and large quantities of documents and  action plans. The 16 terrorists were referred to the Izmir  State Security Court.</p>

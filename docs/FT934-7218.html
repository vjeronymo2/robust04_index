			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities Yesterday's setback for the equity market shows just how nervous investors have become ahead of the budget. The week's slew of economic statistics gave weight to the idea that the UK is growing without reigniting inflation, a combination of circumstances which should be favourable for equities. Low inflation helps justify low gilt and equity yields, while growth promises that earnings recovery will eventually arrive. The combination is not, perhaps, as surprising as it first appears. The large output gap in the UK and the productivity rise which accompanies the early stages of recovery tend to keep cost-push inflation down. Yet equities have already discounted a great deal of good news. Against that the Budget could hurt the market both by damaging consumer confidence in the vital four weeks before Christmas, and if the tax benefits of pensions come under renewed fire. Fund managers' pips have thus far notably failed to squeak, but the policy is not without cost. This week saw both Whitbread and Cable &amp; Wireless resuming pension fund contributions. Others are likely to follow. The weight of new issues may also give pause for thought. This year the demands on both gilt and equity markets have been eased by the Dollars 30bn a quarter flowing from the US to international markets. Unless American investors take fright at a strengthening dollar and rising US interest rates, UK equities look well underpinned. If the funds flow out again, however, they will prove hard to replace.</p>

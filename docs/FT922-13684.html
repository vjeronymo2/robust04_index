			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Letter: Political stance seen as 'breaking rule' and a disservice - but supported by example (1) Sir, I was stunned to read your leader ('The day of decision', April 9) advising a vote for Labour. For the FT to espouse the cause of a party whose philosophy is essentially anti-market beggars belief. It is true that the Tories have made mistakes, but their values have never been in doubt. You have swallowed the slogan 'Time for a change' on the view that the current team is tired and it would be bad for democracy if the Tories were given a fourth term. Your piece reminded me of a research note whose whole tenor was bearish, but the conclusion is that one should buy. Professionals in the City surely subscribe to the FT because its views and advice are bedded in hard financial fact. You have broken that rule. Shame on you for being so slack and self-indulgent.

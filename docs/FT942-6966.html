			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Observer: Softly, softly Lord Lawson's desire to secure the secretary-generalship of the OECD seems to have provoked an uncharacteristic outbreak of diplomacy on the part of the former British chancellor, if his performance yesterday at the Royal Institute of International Affairs is anything to go by. Even Walter Eltis, a free-market guru from the DTI, couldn't get him to blame Europe's high unemployment on its hopeless industrial and social policies. 'People do have a choice whether to reap the rewards of their efforts through more generous social provisions, or by having more money in their own pockets.' Lawson knows he needs the votes of those dreadful high-taxing, high-spending, interventionist Social-Christian-Democrat European governments. Then there is the tricky little matter of the highly unflattering portrait he paints of the OECD in his memoirs. The strictures were 'perhaps too harsh, but I believe they contained a kernel of truth'. Anyway, he had been referring not to the diligent economists, but to the ministerial meetings (like the one next month that may or may not elect him). Given half the chance, he would 'find a way of making those meetings more worthwhile'.</p>

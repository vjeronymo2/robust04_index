			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 10 (AFP) -- Air France, the  loss-making state-owned French airline, unveiled its 3.5 billion  dollar restructuring plan Thursday [10 March], which calls for  5,000 job cuts and a three-year wage freeze -- measures likely  to draw sharp protest from the company's militant unions.    The 20 billion-franc (3.5 billion-dollar) recapitalization  plan is to be spread over three years, according to company  officials who handed the plan to the group's unions Thursday.    The plan includes 5,000 job losses, though no sackings, and  a  three-year wage freeze. The recapitalization is conditioned on  the plan's acceptance by the workforce.    Apart from the capital injection, the plan calls for  increased productivity, a cut in the wage bill and  reorganization of the company.    The aim is to transform Air France from an "institution"  into  an "business," with a 30 percent increase in productivity over  three years to achieve balance by 1997.    Union leaders are to meet the new president of Air France,  Christian Blanc, who replaced Bernard Attali after a strike last  October, on Thursday to discuss the plan.    Francois Cabrera of the CFDT [French Democratic  Confederation  of Labor] union said early Thursday that the refusal to inject  vital resources without first guaranteeing union acceptance  amounted to blackmail.    Blanc's plan outlines a "wage freeze over three years with a  complete block in the first year and possible adjustments in  1995 and 1996 depending on results," Cabrera said.    The government said Wednesday that the allocation of second  and third tranches of new capital would depend on the success of  the restructuring.    Since a strike last October forced the government to abandon  an earlier restructuring plan, Air France's bankers have been  paying its monthly fuel and salary bills.    Under the Blanc rescue plan, Air France workers, who last  October stopped flights into Paris by occupiing runways at the  city's two main airports, were offered shares in the national  carrier in return for the pay cuts.    "The goal is that in three years a significant part of the  capital of the company should belong to the personnel of Air  France" (now 99.3 percent state-owned), Blanc said in a letter  to workers.    French Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet,  in Tokyo Thursday, said that the need to recapitalize Air France  had forced the government to privatise insurance group Assurance  Generales de France (AGF).    "We need a little more money, because you don't get  something  for nothing. We need money for Air France," he said. "We are  selling one asset in order to revive another asset."    Air France lost around 7.5 billion francs in 1993,  equivalent  to 13 percent of sales, and has debts totalling 6.1 billion  dollars.</p>

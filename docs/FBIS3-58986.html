"I will go through this difficult period," he stressed.  Thus, the president will give a speech at a ceremony of the  pope's UN representative in Vienna on the occasion of World  Peace Day under the slogan "Year of the Family." "I will  naturally underline the value of the family, but I will also  point out that I have seen in my personal life recently how  these values can be endangered easily," Klestil told DIE PRESSE  yesterday.    The main speech at the ceremony, organized by Nuncio  Squicciarini, will be delivered by State Secretary Cardinal  Sodano from the Vatican. In the interview with DIE PRESSE,  Klestil left no doubt that he does not have any intention of  resigning because of this private matter.</p>

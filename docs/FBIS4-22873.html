Losev (NIIAR [Atomic  Reactors SRI]); received December 19,1991; UDC 621.039.58]    [Abstract] Wide-scale work on manufacturing transplutonium  elements and using them for manufacturing of radiation sources,  as well as on using plutonium for manufacturing of experimental  fuel elements and TVS [expansion not given] is being conducted  at the NIIAR. The article presents results of studies conducted  by NPO ``Radiyevyy institut'' and NIIAR on developing a  procedure for and work conducted on determining the content of  plutonium isotopes in samples of soil and river bottom deposits  collected over the NIIAR territory and in the sanitary  protection and observation zones. It lists basic requirements to  analytical procedures for determining plutonium activity and  shows a flow chart of the analysis used in the studies. The  procedure validity was tested when analyzing IAEA samples Soil  6; the analysis error did not exceed 10% at a  0.95% confidence  level. The samples were collected in the most representative  points between June 19 and 26, 1989, and between June 11 and 15,  1990. No noticeable effect of NIIAR activity on plutonium  content in samples was detected. The studies showed that  specific plutonium activity within 40 km of NIIAR was at the  level of global activity for the Northern Hemisphere prior to  the Chernobyl AES accident.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/414: "White Paper Tour of the </F> Capitals: the Future of Employment in Europe"]    [Text] [EC] Commissioner Padraig Flynn yesterday raised the  stakes regarding Europe's employment problem by reasserting the  importance to the Union of a sustained and credible attack on  untenable levels of unemployment, and what this means to the  basic health of Europe. He had just completed fruitful and  positive discussions with ministers of the Belgian Government  concerning the employment dimension of the White Paper on  Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. This was the ninth step  of his tour of capitals.    With the Corfu Summit only a few weeks away, Commissioner  Flynn pleaded for greater vision to ensure the future of  employment in Europe, a plea which he had made in a major  presentation delivered on Tuesday [17 May] in the University of  Leuven.    In that sometimes controversial address to academics,  politicians and the wider Flanders Community, Commissioner Flynn  warned that "we ignore at our peril the human damage and  dislocation caused by the scale of unemployment we face."    In a clear message to member states in the run up to the  Corfu Summit, he stated that his tour of capitals, to discuss  follow-up to the White Paper, had heartened him in many ways,  but had left him with some concerns.    "I do not believe that member states have yet fully grasped  the enormity of the challenge, the urgency of the need for  collective reflection and coordinated action".    Mr Flynn went on to give a strong warning against the  temptation to simply wait for growth as the solution to the  union's unemployment problems.    "Let us be careful. We need to consider the implications of  the choices we now make. Do we continue with our short-term --  even day-to-day -- approach to managing political, social and  economic affairs, or do we really engage in a longer term  strategy. Do we just sigh with relief at the glimmer of  returning growth, or understand that it is very welcome but far  from enough."    Commissioner Flynn urged the union to commit itself to an  ambitious and balanced strategy now. He believes that the  messages which emerge from the Council in June must be  affirmative and must offer both hope and credibility.    "We need to mobilise support on a massive scale, before  improved, and very welcome, growth offers the illusion of relief  from the pressure for change. We need to use the breathing  space which growth will bring over the next couple of years. Or  the next downturn will be bigger, for more people, than the one  we have just suffered. The last crash was traumatic for Europe.  It shook the union, and its reverberations continue."    "Make no mistake," he stressed, "if we do not grasp this  opportunity, we will have left behind too many people and  families by the time the next crash arrives, as it surely will."    But aspiration must be joined to substance in addressing  such  complex problems. In this regard the commissioner outlined the  importance of translating growth into jobs, and stressed that,  to do so in a sustained and effective way, structural change was  required. He described the way that new balances could be  achieved in the design, operation and interplay between  taxation, social protection and regulation.    He believes that it is crucial for governments and the  social  partners to look at how to develop new ideas on working time and  work organisation, new technology and quality of human  resources, competitiveness and greater employment generation.  Mr Flynn stressed the importance of the new synergies between  manufacturing and services, the difficulties and opportunities  represented by demographic change, and the clear need for social  protection and taxation systems to be transformed into pathways  to employment, not barriers to access.    At Leuven, Commissioner Flynn recalled that President Delors  had chosen the single market project as the way to relaunch the  European endeavour when he became president-elect in 1984. The  commissioner stated that "in my view the new commission in 1995  should set as its number one priority the design and  implementation of a new Europe- wide employment strategy, for  without this, talk of further integration will ring hollow in  the hearts and minds of ordinary people, European Union  citizens."    Mr Flynn pointed out that the White Paper offers challenges  as well as opportunities to all those invested with  decision-making responsibility, not least in the way that they,  themselves, now operate, and suggested that perhaps government  has to reinvent itself, that the dynamics of government, not  just the workplace, have to change.    "Europe can be the crucible for future development for the  world, a Europe of quality leading the way, engaging its  citizens. But it is in danger of being looked back on as a  transient bloc, that did not serve and draw the most potential  from its human resources," he said.

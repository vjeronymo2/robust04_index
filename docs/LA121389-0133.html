			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH FITNESS  </P> <P> I read with interest your article "State Students Make Weak Showing in First  Fitness Test" (Part A, Nov. 15) concerning the physical performance of  California schoolchildren. The Department of Education is to be commended for  providing a preview of what may be a very alarming picture of our children's  comprehensive physical health status.  </P> <P> The department's tests are instructive on physical performance of our  schoolchildren, but a more complete evaluation of health and fitness must be  undertaken. Recent studies in selected school districts show that risk factors  such as obesity, poor nutrition and smoking are more evident in today's  children. Since these factors are higher today, our children have a greater  chance of early cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> Your readers may be interested in knowing about my legislation, AB 293, which  establishes state guidelines on physical health and fitness. These guidelines  will be developed through a comprehensive, physical health assessment program  conducted by the California State University and the University of California  medical schools. Upon completion, the guidelines will be distributed to the  Department of Education for curriculum development and teacher training. The  state guidelines will show our commitment to the growth of our children's minds  as well as the health of their bodies.  </P> <P> CHARLES M. CALDERON  </P> <P> Assemblyman  </P> <P> D-Whittier  </P></p>

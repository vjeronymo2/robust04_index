			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: SANDERS MAKES THEM COUNT BUT DOESN'T KNOW NUMBERS  </P> <P>  Bob Finnigan of the Seattle Times wrote: "Deion Sanders is a two-sport marvel,  drafted by the Yankees in baseball and Atlanta in the NFL, but he's also a  natural no-brainer.  </P> <P> "He came into the Yankee camp this spring and asked for uniform No. 3 (Babe  Ruth's), then No. 4 (Lou Gehrig's), then No. 5 (Joe DiMaggio's). He got No. 44  (Reggie Jackson) and changed that for No. 18."  </P> <P> Said Jackson when he got a look at Sanders with all his jewelry: "He had on his  Mr. T starter set."  </P> <P> Add Sanders: Asked whether he would rather hit a home run in baseball or return  a punt for a touchdown in football, he opted for the punt return.  </P> <P> "That counts for six points," he said. "The homer only counts for one."  </P> <P> For the record: In a list of famous athletes who excelled in other sports,  which ran on Page 12 in Thursday's editions, Jackie Robinson was short-changed,  even though he headed the list.  </P> <P> It was noted that he participated in track and football at UCLA, but left out  basketball.  </P> <P> In basketball, Robinson was a two-time scoring champion in the Pacific Coast  Conference Southern Division. In 1939-40, he outscored USC All-American Ralph  Vaughn to win the title.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Outside of the Big Ten, what conference has sent the most  different schools out here for the Rose Bowl?  </P> <P> Objection sustained: When Houston slugger Glenn Davis asked that his name be  deleted from a beer promotion, the Chicago Sun-Times came up with this item:  </P> <P> "A Honus Wagner baseball card in the Hall of Fame carries this caption:  'Produced by Caporal Tobacco Co. in 1909-11, the card was recalled when Wagner,  who did not smoke, objected to the use of his picture in connection with a  tobacco product.' "  </P> <P> Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Quick now, who is the only member of the St. Louis  Cardinals who has played in every game this year?  </P> <P> You got it, Pedro Guerrero.  </P> <P> Knee-deep! From Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel: "Months ago, top  basketball officials were privately predicting Rick Pitino would make the jump  from the Knicks back into college ball -- if not at Kentucky, then at some  other big-time campus. Reason: Rick's ego, they say, was too large for the NBA,  where the coach is not the big frog."  </P> <P> That's exhaustion: Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson told the Louisville  Courier-Journal he was convinced he would have to take a rest this season when  he could not stop his hands from shaking violently when he raised them over his  head.  </P> <P> Anderson: "The first day home I slept 16 hours, the next day 12 and the next  day 11. It wasn't because I was just physically tired, but because I was  mentally exhausted. I could not have gone another day. Not one more day. I was  extremely worn out."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Ivy League, with four schools -- Brown, Pennsylvania,  Harvard and Columbia.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Juan Samuel, on being traded from the Philadelphia Phillies to the  New York Mets: "I don't know whether I won or lost, but I think I picked up  about 10 games in the standings."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Komago from Washington: "Breakthrough </F> in the Japan-U.S. Trade Talks: The Next Two Months Are Crucial"]    [Text] Rapid appreciation of the yen and depreciation of  the dollar, and the volatility of the Japanese political  situation have, ironically, opened up the possibility of  resolving the deadlock over Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. The  U.S. administration has come to feel strongly the importance of  Japan-U.S. interdependence, and realizes that "excessive  pressure on Japan will have the opposite effect, and will  undermine U.S. interests as well."    The key to bringing about a breakthrough in bilateral trade  talks is whether Japan will be able to correct its rigid stance  over the next two months while the temporary U.S. "cease-fire,"  as evidenced in the suspension of sanctions against Japan over  government procurement, takes effect.  <H5>  Statement With the U.S. Congress in Mind </H5>   After a meeting of the U.S. Government policy coordination  body, the National Economic Council (NEC) last weekend, a senior  White House official said: "This time, Japan will surely get  our message." He was talking about the flexible approach of the  United States to Japan--for instance, the "suspension for two  months" of procedures to impose sanctions under the U.S. Omnibus  Trade Act on the issue of Japanese Government procurement.  Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market was  also part of such efforts.    While the statement made by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)  Mickey Kantor indicating the new U.S. attitude also contained  tough expressions, such as: "Japanese Government procurement of  supercomputers continues to be subject to special monitoring,"  the fact that the statement was made late on a Saturday  afternoon without an attendant news conference, as if it was  being hidden from the public, clearly shows Kantor wanted to  avoid irritating Congress by adopting a softer stance.    There had been heated debate in the NEC before this  conclusion was reached. Against the USTR's strong wish to push  through with sanctions, the NEC staff and officials of the  Departments of the Treasury and Commerce took a more cautious  attitude. The USTR, which had had a major say on the matter  since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  in mid-February, was held in check for once.  <H5>  Apprehensions Over Rapid Yen Appreciation </H5>   According to a Treasury official, the decisive argument was:  "Japan and the United States are in the same boat in a  relationship of interdependence." Any further pressure on  Japan, it was argued, would cause further yen appreciation and  dollar depreciation, a trend which had already been aggravated  by the inauguration of the Hata administration, which is  believed to have a very shaky hold on power. The result would  not only delay economic recovery in Japan, it could also dampen  U.S. economic conditions with a rise in long-term U.S. interest  rates, which in turn could bring about chaos in the world market.    "Economic confrontation between Japan and the United States  does more harm than good." Faced with the historic prospect of  the exchange rate dipping below 100 yen to a dollar, the U.S.  administration, at long last, began to take a realistic view.  Kantor had also presented to Tsutomu Hata, (then) deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, proposals on the pending issue of  objective criteria in the framework talks which were more  acceptable to Japan. The new suggestions linked the issue to  the "objectives of the framework talks" to increase Japanese  imports and expand foreign participation in the Japanese market.  The United States has not taken a more considerate stance  toward Japan since July last year.    Nevertheless, the position adopted by the United States has  a  deadline of "two months." Depending on the Japanese response,  the United States may turn to a tougher USTR-inspired position  just before the meeting of leaders of the advanced countries  (the Naples summit) in July.    Japanese bureaucrats have been quick to voice the opinion  that "the United States has no right to press Japan to respond  by imposing a deadline." This attitude may offset all the  efforts by U.S. officials to take a more moderate position. If  Japan continues to talk and act as if under a spell which forces  it to answer "no" to every suggestion, there can be no  improvement in the situation.    On the other hand, former Under Secretary of State Robert  Zoellick advises that "right now, if only Japan compromises a  little, the situation may improve." For example, if Japan makes  certain concessions on government procurement, where the United  States has suspended the imposition of sanctions, there is the  possibility that a solution in this area may be reached very  quickly.  <H5>  Speculation About a Final Solution in "September" </H5>   As far as tax reform, one of the keys to a compromise  between  the two countries, is concerned, the belief is growing even in  the United States that the Social Democratic Party of Japan's  decision to leave the coalition government has made it  impossible for any sort of tax reform policy to be decided upon  before the end of June. Even if a conclusion on tax reform is  delayed, however, Japan might still be able to get round this if  something is done about the midterm prospects of the current  account surplus.    Furthermore, the prevailing view in the White House is that  final agreement on the framework talks will come in "September,"  rather than July.    Although at present the dominant view within the U.S.  administration is that it would not be wise to corner a  politically unstable Japan, it is high time Japan also came up  with effective ideas.</p>

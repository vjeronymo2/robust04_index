First, residents will purchase apartments and housing will  become their biggest durable consumption item. Second, people  will invest in a small family car. Already a number of  better-off families have bought a family vehicle. Third, while  telephones have now become common in ordinary households,  mini-computers will become their popular asset in the future.  Fourth, people will tend to spend more on promotion of their  health. Fifth, savings deposits will be increasingly turned  into investments in stocks and bonds.</p>

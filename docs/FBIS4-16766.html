			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva report: "Social Democrats Can Hardly </F> Unite. They Urged Saving Reforms From Reformers"]    [Text] The F. Ebert Fund and the Social Democratic Party of  Russia held on 16 and 17 April a conference with the theme  "Prospects and Problems of the Development of Social Democracy  in Russia." Not only did the conference not produce the  impression of reaching some sort of agreement, but not even a  discussion: Everyone spoke about his own thing with the result  that they could not arrive at anything at all. Not that they  were going to. Aleksandr Yakovlev urged everybody to unite for  the sake of an imminent reforming and strengthening of democracy.    Gennadiy Burbulis urged "saving reforms from reformers, and  democracy from democrats," and stated that tendencies toward  disintegration in the country are at an end, and that there are  every grounds for stabilization and the creation of a stable  party system. Burbulis believed that one should now create a  party-political system of centrism rather than a party.  Burbulis accounted for the start of stabilization by the fact  that the process of structuring society "has brought about  several corporate systems that have divided power, resources,  and spheres of influence and are now ready to achieve  stability." Burbulis recommended that "one's own part be found  in the formation of corporate systems since otherwise there are  no chances to seriously influence society." Boris Kagarlitskiy  (Party of Labor) stated "that boundaries should be drawn rather  than a union formed:" "It is hard to speak about uniting even  in this room where those who were shooting at each other in  October are present." As he put it, "There will be no war, but  there will be a devastating struggle for peace" if one attempts  to try and unite social democratic forces too intensively.    The conference resulted neither in unification, nor war, nor  a struggle for peace -- the active politicians and theorists  simply pondered a topic of interest to them while most gave  little heed to what the others said.    As for prospects of social democracy developing in Russia,  in  the end the conference did not elicit them.</p>

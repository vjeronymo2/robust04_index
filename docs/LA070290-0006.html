			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 'OPINION DEFENSE' IN LIBEL CASES  </P> <P> Another blow has been struck against personal freedom in the U.S. Supreme  Court's libel decision ("Supreme Court Strips Away 'Opinion' as Libel Defense,"  Part A, June 22). In a systematic way, the rights of the individual have been  curtailed in this country, not for the benefit of the whole nation but in  conformity with a narrow interpretation of a conservative vocal minority.  </P> <P> Almost imperceptibly, thought control has become institutionalized. A litmus  test of adherence to beliefs has been tacitly imposed. The voice of dissent has  been stifled; no longer are different opinions tolerated.  </P> <P> In recent events two messages are clear. One, ideas are more dangerous than  guns and, thus, need more control. Also, writers of letters to the editor:  Beware!  </P> <P> Of course, this is just an opinion.  </P> <P> PATRICK J.

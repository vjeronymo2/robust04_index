How to handle the current account imbalance  has become the weakest part of the Hiraiwa Report (final report  of Economic Reform Research Committee).    2. The "domestic emphasis" approach of achieving a  reduction in the current account surplus through improving the  quality of life has been supported by the research committee.  This purport is not reflected in the report.    3. The choice of financial resources for social  infrastructure spending holds important meaning as a specific  policy concerning this problem. However, a fiscal viewpoint has  been placed at the center of financial resources rather than  macroeconomic policy. As a result, it fails to propose specific  policy by the "domestic emphasis" approach.  <H5>  Savings Not Tied to Public Investment </H5>   The Economic Reform Research Committee started by embracing  various issues such as relaxation of regulations and conversion  of the industrial structure. Important among them is the theme  of how to handle the current account imbalance. This is a topic  carried over from the Maekawa Report.    However, the handling of this topic is the weakest. Without  specific proposals, it describes the situation as if it were  someone else's affair that someday "it will be close to a form  that can harmonize internationally."    Why is there such a big setback like this on the most  important topic? I should like to examine this issue looking  back over the course of the discussions.    The message of the Maekawa Report is that the current  account  surplus should be reduced for the sake of international harmony.  It states that the aim will be an improvement in the quality of  the people's life through the process of that realization.    It is not generally known, but at the first meeting of the  Hiraiwa Research Committee, many members voiced the opinion that  a reverse approach from the Maekawa Report should be taken. In  other words, first aim at an improvement in the quality of life  and reform the domestic economic structure. A reduction in the  current account surplus will be achieved as a result. It should  be called a "domestic emphasis" approach, so to speak.    If reduction of the current account surplus is cited as the  main goal, it seems that the goal will be achieved just by  reduction of the surplus through economic recovery. The reason  that the proposal of the Maekawa Report came to an impasse  probably lies here. What is needed now is examination of the  structural part of the current account surplus, and it should  begin with domestic issues before attempting the reduction of  the current account surplus.  <H3>  "Domestic Emphasis" Not Reflected; Social Infrastructure  Spending by Construction Bonds </H3>   Consequently, taking a "domestic emphasis" approach is  correct, and I also approve. However, this initial purport  unfortunately is not reflected in the final report.    People are saving for homes and old age. Not a small portion  of those savings are directed to overseas asset holdings without  ties to private investment or public investment. Domestic social  capital is still as meager as ever, and precious savings for old  age are being exposed to asset employment risks such as foreign  exchange losses.    This is the issue of Japan's economic structure which is  involved in the current account surplus.    The effective use of household savings domestically,  direction toward necessary investment, improvement in the  quality of life, and the practice of good-quality stock  formation for old age: such changes in structure are "economic  reform."    There is an important policy for such domestic reforms and  the key that will tie it to reduction of the current account  surplus, or in other words, the "domestic emphasis" approach.  That is the choice of financial resources (taxes or bonds) for  social infrastructure spending.    Let's explain this a little. If savings exceed investments,  there will be an increase in debt (government bonds) for the  government or debt to foreign countries. Consequently, reduction  of the current account surplus is tantamount to increasing  private consumption and investment (expansion of domestic  demand) or expansion of the fiscal deficit.    By increased issue of construction bonds, the weight of the  composition of public assets will shift from foreign assets to  government bonds and that of the macro resource allocation from  foreign investment and consumption to domestic social capital.  In other words, it means that household savings are directly  connected to repletion of the domestic living and industrial  bases.    So long as expansion of the fiscal deficit is completely  offset by expansion of the private-sector savings and investment  differential, the current account surplus will decrease.    Thus, the financial resource for social infrastructure  spending has a close relationship with macro resource  allocation. General concern about the current account balance is  concentrated on whether or not numerical goals for surplus  reduction will be established. As a specific policy issue,  however, this financial resource issue is a very important theme.  <H5>  Theory of Burden on Future Generations Lacks Accuracy </H5>   An intense dispute developed in the research committee  concerning the financial resource for social infrastructure  spending.    There are two viewpoints in the financial resource dispute.  One is the public burden, particularly the issue related to the  balance of the burden between generations, and the other is the  macroeconomic policy mentioned previously.    Of course, the latter viewpoint is important in the  "domestic emphasis" approach. Looking from this viewpoint, the  increased issue of construction bonds to carry out social  infrastructure spending is clearly desired.    In other words, what is the best way to hold public savings?  Viewing the current state of Japan, it is necessary to reduce  the relative weight of foreign debt and hold high-quality social  capital domestically. That is done by issuing construction bonds.    Unfortunately, however, discussion from this viewpoint is  not  fully made. That is because the argument against construction  bonds is made only within the framework of the burden on future  generations. That is as follows:    "If social infrastructure spending is made with government  debt, it will defer the bill for the debt to future generations  and conversely inflict pain on them."    This concept is easy to accept at first glance; however, it  is not correct because the point that government debt and the  debt for the economy overall are confused. Government bonds are  a liability for the government, but an asset for the people who  hold the government bonds.    When the government redeems its bonds, a stratum receiving  the redemption (owners of government bonds) will exist at the  same time. Consequently, viewed by the economy overall, it is  not a debt. Redemption of government bonds is no more than a  transfer of income inside a future generation.    Next, "The cumulative increase in the government bond  balance  will bring an increase in government bond costs and hold down  future policy expenditures."    Such a problem in budget compilation certainly will be  generated. Even now, government bond costs have risen to 21.3  percent of general account expenditures (initial budget).    However, it is not good to focus only on the future burden  concerning this problem because it is possible to exceed fixed  tax revenues by issue of government bonds and execute it  anticipating future problems. Social capital is an issue that  should be started at an early point in time. Consequently, in  this sense, not balancing public finance is rather desired at  this time.    Moreover, in the case of construction bonds, assets will  remain corresponding to the amount of the government bond issue.  Consequently, with regard to the cumulative increase in the  government bond balance, the size itself is almost meaningless.    So, the problem is which to emphasize, this fiscal viewpoint  or the aforementioned macroeconomic policy viewpoint.    The conclusion of the financial resource dispute is the  following sentence:    " To secure financial resources that will not leave a burden  on future generations as the premise, a review should be  conducted of the basic plan for public investment..."    It had been "(tax) financial resources" in the draft, but at  the final stage, the word (tax) was taken out. As already  mentioned, construction bonds also do not leave a burden on  future generations. Consequently, the choice of tax or bond is  not made in this part.    On the other hand, no reference is made in the report  regarding the financial resources desired from the viewpoint of  macroeconomic policy.  <H5>  Taxes Lose Mobility as Financial Resource </H5>   The most important route in the "domestic emphasis" approach  disappears here. Financial resources appear to be a small  problem, but it was an important point involving the framework  of the report.    As a postscript, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not  perceive the logic that construction bonds do not leave a burden  on future generations. Consequently, the "financial resources"  written in the report probably are interpreted to indicate taxes.    If that interpretation goes unchallenged, there is a great  possibility that an increase amount in the basic plan on public  investment will not be realized. That is because there are great  limitations on financial resources, but this is the biggest  problem point when taxes are considered the financial resource.  In other words, there is a possibility that the necessary  investment cannot be made in the necessary time period.    Viewed in terms of results, it must be said that the  "domestic emphasis" approach is defeated by MOF fiscal  supremacy. Fiscal supremacy conceives that a fiscal balance has  precedence over the Japanese economy.    If the people's savings are used effectively, the living  base  and future industrial base will rapidly be made replete, and it  will be possible to obtain more affluence. However, the report  fails to point out the way.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wladimir Goitia] </F>   [Text] Montevideo -- Winston Fritsch, the Brazilian  Government secretary of economic policy, yesterday denied that  Brazil and Argentina have reached an agreement on the adoption  of a Common External Tariff (TEC) of 12 percent for capital  goods and chemicals, which will reportedly begin in 2001 within  Mercosur [Common Market of the South].    Contrary to what the Uruguayan press has reported over the  past two days, Fritsch confirmed that there is still impasse in  the definition of a protection tariff on informatics and  pharmaceutical products, conventional capital products,  commodities that are subject to quotas, and cars. "Until there  is consensus on all products affected by the common external  tariff, we will not sign anything," Fritsch told the ESTADO news  agency. He said Brazil will not close any partial deal. He  thus referred to the 15-percent portion of the list of products  affected by the TEC, on which no agreement has yet been reached.  Agreement has so far been reached on practically 85 percent of  the list of products, with tariffs ranging from 0 to 20 percent.  Fritsch said he believes the list will be ready at the end of  the first half of the year. He believes more negotiations will  be necessary.    Shortly after arriving in Montevideo yesterday afternoon,  accompanied by Foreign Trade Secretary Renato Marques and other  Itamaraty advisers, Fritsch met with Argentine technicians at  the Argentine Embassy to continue negotiating the subject, which  will be raised at a Common Market Group meeting today.    A consultant with fluent contacts with technicians of  Argentine ministries has said that Argentina might agree to a  TEC ranging from 8 to 12 percent for those products, provided  this tariff gradually falls to 0 until year 2,001. If Argentina  makes this proposal at the meeting in Montevideo, Brazil will  reject it. Next Monday, Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and  Paraguayan Presidents Itamar Franco, Carlos Menem, Luis Lacalle,  and Juan Carlos Wasmosy, respectively, will meet in Colonia, 170  km from Montevideo, for the 5th Common Market Council meeting.  Depending on the impasse, the TEC may or may not be confirmed.    The TEC is not the only obstacle obstructing the  implementation of Mercosur, which is scheduled for 1995.  Regulations on origin, the deployment of duty-free zones, and  the protection of consumers are other controversial, unresolved  matters. Such matters have so far been analyzed at the level of  work subgroups, at which the technicians of the four countries  formulated their proposals. Those three subjects, along with  the list of exceptions, will now be studied within the Common  Market Group, which is an executive organ of Mercosur.</p>

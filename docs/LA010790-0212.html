			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NURSING HOMES TURN AWAY FROM TETHERING THE ELDERLY;  </P> <P> ELDER CARE: RESTRAINTS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED STANDARD PRACTICE TO PROTECT  PATIENTS WHO MIGHT FALL OR WANDER AWAY. BUT NURSING HOMES ARE FINDING  ALTERNATIVES -- AND FINDING THAT FREEING PATIENTS HAS MANY BENEFITS.  </P> <P> William Harmon used to spend every day tied to a chair in a nursing home,  sometimes in a stupor, sometimes pleading to be freed.  </P> <P> "They'd just sit there all day long, every body tied in restraints," said Mabel  Harmon, who moved her 70-year-old husband out of the home in August. "I don't  think he would be living now if he hadn't gotten out of there."  </P> <P> Harmon's situation was not unique. Two out of five residents of American  nursing homes routinely are tied to their beds or chairs, ostensibly to protect  them from injury. Concern is mounting that such restraints may do more harm  than good.  </P> <P> Harmon now is at Stapeley in the German town section of Philadelphia. It is one  of a small but growing number of homes that use no restraints.  </P> <P> Since he's been over at Stapeley he's a completely different person," Mabel  Harmon said. "He does what he wants to do. He answers your questions. He walks  up and down the hall. He goes into the lounge."  </P> <P> Nursing home administrators say that devices such as lap belts, wheelchairs  with locking trays and vests that tie to beds or chairs are used mainly to keep  residents from falling or wandering away and to control aggressive behavior.  </P> <P> Critics say that restraints often are used for the staff's convenience and  seldom eliminate the risk of injury. They say that tying people can cause or  aggravate problems such as emotional withdrawal and depression, and that  injuries are incurred in trying to get free. Strangulation, constipation,  incontinence, pressure sores, loss of bone mass, weakened muscles and decreased  ability to walk are the ultimate consequences for many of those who are  tethered, they say.  </P> <P> "We have to ask ourselves: What price safety?" said Jill Blakeslee, director of  health services for the Kendal Corp., a nonprofit, Quaker-run Pennsylvania  corporation that has pioneered the concept of restraint-free nursing homes in  the United States. "Safe and quality care can be given to our frail old people  without tying them to their beds and their chairs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Think About Yourself  </P> <P> Kendal and the Senate Committee on Aging last month sponsored a symposium,  "Untie the Elderly: Quality Care Without Restraints," at which Blakeslee spoke.  "Think about yourself as you grow old," she told participants. "Is that what  you would want?"  </P> <P> Michael Plevyak's family chose to place his 74-year-old mother, Genevieve, who  has Alzheimer's disease, at Friends Hall in West Chester, Pa., because she  would not be tied there. "The only thing she desires to do is move about and  walk. That's why we're so thrilled that she is in a facility that allows her to  engage in the one activity she gets any joy out of," he said.  </P> <P> In 199, 41% of all nursing home residents were restrained; in 1977, the  proportion was 25%, federal surveys show. Restraints were involved in 37 deaths  in U.S. and Canadian nursing homes between 1980 and 1987. The deaths primarily  were caused by strangulation or suffocation -- but in two cases the victims  burned to death after setting fire to their restraints in an attempt to escape.  </P> <P> In U.S. and Canadian nursing homes studied over the last decade, restraint  rates ranged from 25% to 85%, Neville Strumpf and Lois Evans of the University  of Pennsylvania School of Nursing reported in the January, 1989, issue of the  Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawsuits Feared  </P> <P> Family members at first may be horrified to learn that their relative is  restrained, but medical professionals "can talk people into a big variety of  things that afterwards they must wonder about," said Lynne Mitchell-Pederson, a  nurse at St. Boniface General Hospital in Winnipeg, Canada. St. Boniface has  all but eliminated the practice of tying patients since a restrained woman  strangled in 1981.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there are attorneys and family members "wanting and willing  to sue if a home doesn't use protective devices to protect the resident," said  Fred Watson, administrator of the Christian City Convalescent Center in  Atlanta. "We've got to get over that hurdle."  </P> <P> Christian City was restraint-free when it opened 12 years ago, but began using  the devices under pressure from insurance carriers, doctors and families,  Watson said. It now restrains 20% to 30% of its charges, but is reducing that  proportion.  </P> <P> The widespread use of restraints is widely attributed at least in part, to the  fear of being sued, but some attorneys say that reliance on restraints as a  liability protection is largely unfounded.  </P> <P> In fact, one study found that tying people resulted in more lawsuits than not  using them, said Philadelphia attorney Alan Reeve Hunt, chairman of Kendal's  board. For example, an Alabama jury in June held a nursing home liable for $2.5  million in the strangulation of an 86-year-old woman in a restraint vest that  was on backwards. The case is under appeal.  </P> <P> Restraints "became a standard of care without ever being tested," said Sarah  Burger, a consultant for the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home  Reform. "Everybody just assumed they did good."  </P> <P> Growing concern about negative effects and recognition that restraints don't  eliminate liability are leading to a reduction in their use. So far, 13 nursing  homes in the United States are known to be restraint-free, according to Kendal.  Tough new federal rules will take effect in October, and Florida has untied  3,000 people since August.  </P> <P> "There's a contest going on to see who's going to be the first restraint-free  facility," Florida licensing director Connie Cheren said.  </P> <P> "This is not a movement in its infancy," said Nancy Dubler, an attorney with  the Department of Social Medicine at Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center in  New York. "This is a discussion on the verge of bringing change."  </P> <P> The Health Care Financing Administration reported last December that 8.5% of  more than 15,000 nursing homes it surveyed were violating rules that allow a  patient to be restrained "only when authorized by a physician in writing, for a  specified period of time or in emergencies."  </P> <P> The new rules ban "physical restraints imposed or psychoactive drugs  administered for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to  treat ... medical symptoms." Nursing homes for the first time will have to  "show that they have tried every other conceivable means to solve the problem,"  Burger said.  </P> <P> Removing restraints requires creative, individualized alternatives, said Beryl  Goldman, Kendal associate director for health services. For example, doors that  sound a buzzer when opened might be installed on a wanderer's room. Brightly  colored tape placed in front of exits can help keep confused residents from  leaving. Rocking chairs can help those who need to be in motion.  </P> <P> One home was able to avoid restraining an 85-year-old woman who constantly  paced with a doll but needed to rest so her ulcers would heal, said Joanne  Rader, director of mental health at Benedictine Nursing Facility in Mount  Angel, Ore.  </P> <P> Staff members filled the doll with seven pounds of birdseed. "Now, when she's  walking with the doll, she has a very heavy baby. So they say, 'Oh, that baby's  so heavy. Why don't you sit down and put your feet up?' That's a heck of a lot  more fun than tying a person down," Rader said.  </P> <P> St. Boniface's Mitchell-Pederson cited the case of one Alzheimer's patient who  disrupted meals and stole food. "When we asked, 'Could he be hungry?' and  doubled his calorie intake he stopped stealing food . . . In this case, it was  his diet that needed attention; restraints compounded the problem."  </P> <P> An 85-year-old woman restrained in a chair for fear that she would wander off  and fall down the stairs was given shoes with rubber soles instead of slippers  and "was thus allowed to wander at will throughout the building," she said.  </P> <P> "There's tremendous excitement out there . . . toward developing and  implementing a non-restraint philosophy. It's no fun to be the one who has to  tie someone down when they don't want to be tied down," Rader said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Be No Alternative  </P> <P> Some nursing home officials, however, caution that there are cases where there  are no clear alternatives to restraints.  </P> <P> "While we can agree that overuse or wholesale use of restraints is not  desirable, it is equally wrong to say no restraints should ever be used," said  David Mettler of Hillhaven Corp., which runs 345 nursing homes in 38 states.  </P> <P> "This is not a black-and-white issue," Mettler said. "Sometimes it may even be  necessary to restrict the rights of an individual resident in order to provide  for the health and safety of others."  </P> <P> For dramatic reduction in restraints, residents and families must accept that  "if people have a certain amount of freedom, then they also run the risk of  getting hurt," said attorney Joanne Ivancic of HFIC Management Co., which  handles insurance claims for Hillhaven.  </P> <P> Benedictine has eliminated most restraints, but "there's maybe 5% to 10% of the  people that I can't figure out how get restraint-free," Rader said, citing as  one example those who pull out tubes unless restrained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skepticism Replaced by Praise  </P> <P> Nursing home staffer who initially are skeptical about being able to manage  residents without restraints usually find they prefer it, said Kendal's  Goldman. She quoted from a recent letter from a nurse at Friends Hall, which in  1987 adopted a no-restraint policy: "I wouldn't work any other place now. I  wouldn't have said that or believed it two years ago."  </P> <P> Nine nursing homes in a Kendal demonstration program have reduced restraint use  without increasing falls, staff or costs, Goldman said.  </P> <P> That is possible because residents who can move around generally stay healthier  and require less care. Blakeslee said. Also, it takes a lot of time to properly  apply restraints and remove them for exercise and use of bathrooms.  </P> <P> Stapeley in 1988 set a goal of untying five residents a month and a year later  removed the last restraint, said Henrietta Roberts, executive director. "I  can't tell you how the families have been pleased by this. The sense of  humanitarianism, the sense that you are dealing with a person . . . has made a  great deal of difference. The patients are easier to care for."  </P> <P> Supporters of the change at Stapeley include Bernie Lieberman, whose  89-year-old mother, Frances, had been routinely restrained after she fell and  broke a hip. Now, staffers help her walk and she wears no restraints while  seated.  </P> <P> "She seems much more cheerful and positive as a result of having more freedom,"  Lieberman said. "Even though her mind was not working well, she was just the  kind of person who wanted to get up and walk."  </P></p>

Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in presenting the summit logo  here Monday [7 March], said that Italy as G-7 president was  working at a diplomatic level for greater Russian involvement in  political discussions at the July gathering.    While awaiting the nod from the other members of the G-7  club  of leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan,  Germany, France, Britain, and Canada -- Italy is going ahead  with its organization of the summit and is making it possible,  in the event the others do agree, that Yeltsin, who is to arrive  in Naples on Saturday morning of the second day of the summit,  could take part in the G-7 sessions as early as Saturday  afternoon, July 9.    In any case, the evening of Saturday, July 9, Yeltsin will  take part in an official dinner being offered to all  participants by the Italian premier, in the presence of Head of  State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.    The plan is for Yeltsin to take part Sunday morning in the  final work session and at the subsequent presentation of the  results of the summit.    However, Ciampi's office today specified that no definitive  decision had yet been taken with regard to how and when Yeltsin  would be taking part in the Naples parley. A decision will be  made by the Seven shortly before the summit opens, according to  the same source.    Meanwhile, it was learned here that Ciampi would take part  in  the opening session of G-7 environmental ministers set for March  12 and 13 in Florence.    The meeting was convened by Italian Environment Minister  Valdo Spini last year because, as he said today, the  industrialized nations have a special responsibility to promote  sustainable development for the entire planet. However, Spini  also highlighted the role that the environment could play in  creating jobs within the big industrialized states.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont in call to Tories MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, has appealed to Conservative MPs to keep faith with the government's steady-as-she-goes economic strategy, warning against the 'illusory benefits of a quick fix'. In a three-page letter, aimed at reassuring backbench unease, he cautions MPs not to expect instant economic growth but insists that the basic foundations for recovery were established before the general election. 'The government has accepted that the pace of recovery will be slow,' he writes. 'Policy cannot be set to determine the level of output on a short-term basis . . rather, policy must be designed to deliver sustainable growth over the medium term.' The letter, now being distributed by Conservative Central Office, gives firm assurances that MPs' alternative strategies have all been carefully examined by the Treasury. But it concludes that there would be no advantage in a premature cut in interest rates or a realignment in the exchange rate mechanism. The experience of Italy and France had shown that devaluations within the ERM raised interest rates, not lowered them, he says. In conciliatory language intended to raise spirits before the summer recess, Mr Lamont offers a vigorous defence of the ERM as a key instrument for defeating inflation, and emphasises that the government's commitment to the mechanism is 'unshakeable'. While recognising concerns about interest rates and indebtedness, he points out that trade figures and surveys of business confidence give grounds for optimism that the economy is strengthening. Two dozen of Britain's largest housebuilders yesterday warned Mr Lamont that his economic policies could push the recession in the housing market into a slump. In a letter to the chancellor, the builders said that the government's aim of achieving zero inflation through high interest rates would totally undermine confidence among individuals and industry.</p>

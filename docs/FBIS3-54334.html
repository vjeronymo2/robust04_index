The foreign minister voiced special interest in what  is taking place in Ethiopia and Kenya, where a considerable  number of Israeli irrigation and dam experts are working. He  proposed that Egypt provide the two countries with Egyptian  experts.    Musa told the ministers that, despite peace and  reconciliation between Egypt and Israel, it is not in the basin  countries' interest to permit external parties to tamper with  the Nile waters.    He explained that under no circumstances would Egypt  tolerate  any harm to its water resources because this is "a life or death  issue" for Egypt. Therefore, he added, it is better for experts  from Egyptian and the other Nile basin countries to cooperate to  implement projects in these countries, as such a cooperation  will ensure the interests of the countries in which projects are  implemented, as well as those of Egypt in which the Nile river  ends. Employing Israeli or European experts, he said, may open  the door for foreign interests to play a destructive role in the  water issue.    The Egyptian foreign minister pointed out that his country  had informed all parties involved, including Israel and the big  powers, that the Nile waters issue is not a subject of any  Middle East multilateral negotiations or any Middle East  cooperation in the water area and that it concerns no one except  the basin countries themselves.    In another development, Egyptian Irrigation Minister  Engineer  'Abd-al-Hadi Radi told AL-ITTIHAD that alleged reports from  Khartoum, or other capitals, on Sudan requesting new  negotiations on sharing the Nile water by Egypt and Sudan are  absolutely unfounded.</p>

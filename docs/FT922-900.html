			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool In the closing week of the Australian sales a relatively large offering of 172,000 bales is being auctioned at Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle. The easier tendency of recnt weeks continued on Monday and Tuesday, with a high proportion being passed in up to 33 per cent in Sydney. However, prices improved on Wednesday at all three centres, particularly for fine merino fleece of good style. Japan has been buying strongly, and Chinese interest in the market is thought to have been an important factor. The AWC market indicator after falling to 539, rose three cents a kg to 542 compared with 561 a week ago.</p>

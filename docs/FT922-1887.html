			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Cost fears over axing Tube spur THE COST of abandoning the Pounds 1.7bn planned extension of London's Jubilee underground line may be more than Pounds 200m, according to the London Docklands Development Corporation. Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developers of Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, had promised to pay Pounds 400m over 25 years towards the line. Canary Wharf was put into administrative receivership last month, putting the Jub-ilee Line extension in jeopardy. The government has said that it will not go ahead with the extension unless a purchaser can be found for Canary Wharf that would be willing to take over O&amp;Y's commitment. In a briefing paper submitted to the Department of Transport, the London Docklands Development Corporation says that taxpayers and shareholders of construction companies have already spent more than Pounds 100m in preparatory work on the extension. London Transport says it has spent Pounds 100m on bringing designs to the point at which contractors can tender for work. Contractors are estimated to have spent a further Pounds 20m on preparing bids. The development corporation estimates that the costs of aborting the extension may be a further Pounds 35m to Pounds 85m. Contractors have submitted bids for almost all of the 10-mile extension. London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by Italstrade, the Italian engineering group, as being likely to win the contract a 2 1/2 -mile section.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / German-Dutch steelmakers in aid challenge Leading German and Dutch steel producers said yesterday they would go ahead this week with a European Court challenge to the Brussels decision to approve state subsidies for Ilva, the Italian state steel producer. The German Steel Federation, with Preussag Stahl, Thyssen Stahl and Hoogovens, the Dutch steelmaker, will be backing similar complaints at the Luxembourg court by British Steel, EISA, the European independent steel manufacturers, and Denmark's Det Danske Stalvalsevaerk. The steel federation said yesterday the massive subsidies to the loss-making Italian state concern were causing substantial damage to private manufacturers in all member states. 'It is illegal, because it is not compatible with the steel subsidy code,' it added. 'There is no room for an exception to be declared. Moreover the European Commission has not demanded any adequate compensation in terms of an appropriate reduction of capacity.' Along with CSI of Spain, Ilva received the lion's share of Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.4bn) of aid approved by EU industry ministers in December. The Commission says it has acted legally under Article 95 of the European Coal and Steel treaty, which allows state aid to be paid to steel companies, but only with the unanimous consent of the Council of Minsters. 'The decision to allow these subsidies to be paid was taken with the full backing of all the member states,' said a Commission spokesman. The German federation argues that approval of any further subsidies is permissible only in terms of the subsidy code if it does not lead to any distortion of competition. It is understood British Steel will start its action early next week against the subsidies to Ilva and CSI. The UK steelmaker said this week the Commission should not have applied Article 95 in these cases. Instead, it said, the Commission should have insisted on 'the full and proper enforcement' of the steel aid code. Separately, Brussels will open an investigation into German government aid paid to Ekostahl, the German steelmaker, following the decision by Riva, the private Italian steel company, not to buy east Germany's largest steel mill. The commission is concerned that capital injections to Ekostahl, via the state run Treuhand privatisation agency, contravene EU rules on state aid.</p>

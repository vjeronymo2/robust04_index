			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: A recycled monument to reluctant sponsorship - Diary THE centrepiece of the Riocentro is a 20-foot red and white sculpture entitled Paradise Regained, made entirely of recycled aluminium. But the monument has proved something of a headache. British sculptress Edwina Sandys made it at the invitation of the UN Development Programme, and the hope was that some kindly sponsor would foot the bill. That has not happened, and Ms Sandys is now about Dollars 75,000 (Pounds 41,200) out of pocket. She is still hoping to find a commercial backer so that the piece can stay in Rio as a memento. ***** Summit participants are taking great national pride in the decor of their negotiating cubicles. The FT prize for the most imaginatively decorated office goes to Senegal, with its elegantly arranged swathes of colourful batik. The Japanese box is, of course, the biggest and best-equipped. The Malaysians do a good line in exotic flowers and have the best coffee. The delegation from Botswana has an impressive array of tropical plants and the slickest public relations machine. A special award goes to the British as the most organised party; there is always someone available for a briefing, even if the receptionist is rather ferocious. The Saudis have strung carpets on the walls along with pictures of King Fahd. A picture of Saddam Hussein dominates the Iraqi box. The Chinese have covered their cubicle with uninspiring information posters. The Brazilians are commended for their friendliness and constant supply of coffee. The booby prize goes to the US, which rents a tiny undecorated box which would fit 20 times into the Japanese cubicle. American delegates prefer to spend time and hold briefings in the Sheraton hotel, 15 miles away. ***** They call her the Dragon Lady: Ting Wen Liam. She is officially Malaysia's ambassador to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation in Rome, but she has been leading her country's side in summit negotiations on the forest agreement - with considerable effect. She had the job of fending off attempts to establish an international treaty on forests. As one of the world's largest exporters of tropical hardwoods, Malaysia does not want its logging subjected to outside controls. There are signs that the diminutive and tough-talking Ms Ting is succeeding, for the summit might well drop plans for a treaty in favour of a loose declaration of forest principles, which many people would reject as meaningless.</p>

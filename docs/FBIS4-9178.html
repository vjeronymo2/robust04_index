			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed item carried in the "You Ask, We Answer" </F> column: "When Will We Join the European Union?"]    [Text] A reader, J. H. from Povazska Bystrica, would like  to know why, of the Visegrad Four states, it is Poland and  Hungary that are making haste with their applications to become  full-fledged members of the European Union [EU]. The Foreign  Ministry Press department has issued a statement on this matter  from which we have selected the following:    "On 13 April, Foreign Minister E. Kukan received in  Bratislava the ambassador of the Polish Republic, J. Korolec,  who, on behalf of the Polish Government, requested support from  Slovakia for the Polish Republic's official application to join  the EU, which Polish Foreign Minister A. Olechowski had  submitted in Athens on 8 April to the current Greek chairman of  the EU. Minister E. Kukan welcomed the submission of Poland's  application to become a full-fledged member of the EU. At the  same time, he said that Slovakia will also submit its  application for EU membership following the completion of the  ratification process for the European Association Agreement in  all of the parliaments of the EU member countries. Until then,  all of the necessary measures will be taken in order to achieve  such standards in political, economic, legislative, and social  development that, along with the other applicants for EU  membership from Central Europe and the assistance of the EU and  its member states, the Republic attains full-fledged membership  in the EU as quickly as possible."    It is also necessary to point out that Poland and Hungary  have already gone through the ratification "sieve" of approval  for their association agreements and, therefore, were able to  submit their applications to become full-fledged EU members.</p>

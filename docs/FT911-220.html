			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Saudis to take up Dollars 4.5bn loan: First fund-raising from banks for at least 20 years SAUDI ARABIA is close to calling upon a Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.66bn) loan from international banks, having negotiated an increase in the loan's size and a reduction in the interest margin charged, bankers said yesterday. They said a loan agreement had been signed by the Saudi government and 20 international banks this month in Paris. The loan, arranged by JP Morgan of New York, should be drawn down shortly. The financing, the first fund-raising by the government from international banks for at least 20 years, was first negotiated in February, before the ground assault on Kuwait had been launched by the US-led coalition. Then, the three-year loan was for Dollars 3.5bn and the interest margin over London interbank offered rates, the floating benchmark used in the international loans market, set at  1/2 percentage point. Bankers said at the time that the loan carried a war risk premium. The Saudis used the swift ending of the war to negotiate a reduction in the interest margin to  3/8 point over Libor. Morgan also brought in new banks to increase the size of the transaction. Difficulties over the loan documentation apparently delayed the signing. The purpose of the loan is general, although it is possible that at least some of it will be used to pay the Saudi contribution to the coalition war effort. It pledged Dollars 13.5bn to the US. The Saudi government has tried to to keep the fund-raising quiet, as it is seen as a source of embarrassment inside the country because of the Islamic proscription against usury. However, there are expectations that it will have to raise more soon. Although benefiting from higher oil prices and increased oil production resulting from the Gulf crisis, the Saudis insist they have lost out because of the cost of the war.</p>

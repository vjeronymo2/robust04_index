			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS FORMS UNIT TO STUDY GOVERNOR RACE  </P> <P> State Controller Gray Davis took another measured step Wednesday toward  becoming a Democratic candidate for governor.  </P> <P> "I think California is ready for a governor who isn't afraid to stand up and  fight the insurance companies, oil companies and banks when they step over the  line," Davis said.  </P> <P> With that, he issued a brief statement saying he was forming an exploratory  committee to assess his chances as a candidate for governor in 1990. This was  his second careful move toward the gubernatorial race, having earlier this year  filed the legal papers necessary to raise funds for an exploratory campaign.  </P> <P> The cautious nature of Davis' actions came despite advice from some quarters  that he should act more boldly -- to barnstorm the state or otherwise try to  stir up some excitement. After all, these backers said, he is the underdog,  trailing three other contenders in the polls, and has nothing to gain by being  low key.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Ready to Gamble  </P> <P> But in an interview, Davis said he is not ready to gamble his political career  just yet and so would go slow through the fall and maybe up until the first of  next year. At that time, Davis would have to decide firmly whether to seek the  governorship.  </P> <P> "I'm going to aggressively communicate my message for the next several months  and measure how people respond to it," Davis said.  </P> <P> His early message has three elements.  </P> <P> Foremost, Davis offers himself as a new-breed Democratic Populist. He was the  only potential candidate for governor to back Ralph Nader's Proposition 103  insurance reform in 1988 and was a vocal backer of the campaign to bar oil  drilling in Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> "I have fought for working Californians and won. A lot of people talk a good  game but don't deliver."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pushes 'Volunteerism'  </P> <P> Davis also said he is determined to become a champion of "volunteerism." In  these times of fiscal restraint, Davis argues, government is overlooking the  potential benefits of citizen involvement.  </P> <P> Finally, Davis is now trying to capitalize on the years from 1975 to 1981 when  he was chief of staff to former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> "I'm the only candidate who has spent any time in the governor's office. I've  spent 7 years there," he said.  </P> <P> A relentless fund-raiser and disciplined campaigner, Davis went from the  governor's office to the state Assembly to the position of controller in 5  years.  </P></p>

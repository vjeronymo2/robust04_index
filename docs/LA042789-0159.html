			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SHEETS ALLEGEDLY LINK PAIR IN DUERR SLAYING  </P> <P> Police have seized bloodstained sheets and linens that they believe link both a  longtime boyfriend and a high-school acquaintance with last week's stabbing  death of Denise Marie Duerr of Garden Grove, court documents revealed  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Search warrant affidavits indicate that Duerr, 22, was fatally stabbed with an  ice pick at least 14 times in or near her own apartment, then wrapped in  bloodstained sheets, put in the trunk of her 1984 Fiero and dumped in the hills  near Corona.  </P> <P> Charged in Duerr's murder are Cameron C. Seaholm, 22, a drifter who knew the  victim in high school, and Clyde Spontak, 22, of Garden Grove, a friend of  Seaholm's who lived with Duerr on and off during a stormy 6-year relationship.  Police have not established a motive for the slaying.  </P> <P> The documents filed in Superior Court in Riverside also include a statement by  Seaholm that he and Spontak had planned to sell a quarter-kilogram of cocaine  about the time of the killing. The cocaine was in Spontak's possession,  Seaholm's statement says.  </P> <P> In the statement to police, Seaholm acknowledged dumping the body but insisted  that he had nothing to do with the slaying. He said he stole Duerr's car while  coming down from a cocaine high and found the victim's partially decomposed and  still-bleeding body only after the car got a flat tire and he had to open the  trunk.  </P> <P> An Orange County firefighter confirmed that he saw a Fiero with tire trouble at  the approximate spot and time cited by Seaholm, court records show.  </P> <P> But investigators said they they do not believe the rest of Seaholm's  explanation. "We've got some other evidence that I can't talk about that would  seem to shoot  </P> <P> down that story," said Sgt. David Weiss of the Riverside County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> "We've shown a lot of inconsistencies in his story so far, and we think  (Seaholm and Spontak) were both involved in the murder," Weiss said.  </P> <P> Investigators said it was inconsistency in Spontak's story that also led them  to suspect the boyfriend in the killing.  </P> <P> After Duerr's partially clad body was found April 19 near the Riverside Freeway  south of Corona, Spontak grieved openly and said he had last seen his  girlfriend alive as she headed for work one morning a few days before.  </P> <P> But investigators said contradictory evidence was uncovered Saturday in a  search of the Garden Grove apartment that Spontak shared with Duerr. At the  Monroe Street apartment, police found what appeared to be bloodstains on a  mattress, the mattress cover and the garage floor. Bloodied sheets had earlier  been found in the car.  </P> <P> Laboratory tests comparing the blood samples to Duerr's blood type have not  been completed, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators also hoped to find at the apartment the ice pick used in the  slaying but came up empty handed, court documents show. Nonetheless,  investigators said they were so convinced by the evidence uncovered in the  search that they arrested Spontak on suspicion of murder 6 hours after entering  the apartment Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arraignment Wednesday  </P> <P> Arraignment for both Spontak, a sound electrician, and Seaholm is scheduled for  Wednesday in Riverside County Municipal Court in Corona.  </P> <P> In addition to evidence found at the apartment, a neighbor has acknowledged  that, at the request of Spontak, he lied to police about having seen Spontak  kiss Duerr goodby on the morning of her disappearance, Riverside Deputy Dist.  Atty. Daniel C. Lough said Wednesday.  </P> <P> In the statement to police, Seaholm said that for virtually the entire weekend  just before he stole Duerr's car to visit his stepparents' home in Lake  Elsinore, he had stayed high on cocaine that he had stolen from Spontak.  </P> <P> His statement said that Seaholm and Spontak had spent much of that weekend  packing for resale a quarter-kilo of cocaine.  </P> <P> Police said that amount of cocaine would carry a street value of about $4,000.  </P></p>

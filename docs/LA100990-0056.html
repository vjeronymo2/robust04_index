			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HISTORY CURRICULUM STIRS PASSIONATE DISSENT;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: STATE PREPARES TO CHOOSE UNIFIED TEXTS, BUT ETHNIC GROUPS BATTLE FOR  THEIR OWN VERSIONS.  </P> <P> As the state Board of Education prepares to consider new history textbooks for  California public schools this week, a fundamental question underlies much of  the discussion:  </P> <P> Is it still possible to write a single history for all Americans -- one that  weaves together all of the ethnic, racial and religious experiences that have  helped forge the United States? Or have California and the nation gone so far  down the path of ethnic separatism that common links no longer can be taught?  </P> <P> The question arises because the new books, as they have moved through the  state's textbook adoption process, have encountered passionate protests by  blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans, American Indians and fundamentalist  Christians, among others.  </P> <P> Each of these groups wants to tell its version of U.S. and world history. Some  would like to add "facts" disputed by some historians, while others insist that  embarrassing material be ignored or minimized.  </P> <P> Despite the protests, the state board is likely to approve the textbooks  because they are essential elements in an effort -- being watched around the  country -- to breathe more life into the teaching of history in California  classrooms.  </P> <P> The new curriculum is being tested in a few school districts and, if adopted,  will not be in widespread use for another year or two. It calls for much more  instruction in U.S. and world history at earlier ages, puts a renewed emphasis  on geography and includes instruction at every grade level in the history of  religion, a subject often avoided because it is controversial. There is also  much discussion about democracy -- how difficult it has been to achieve and  maintain.  </P> <P> "The California curriculum is an improvement in every way," said Gilbert T.  Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council, which seeks to improve the  quality of social studies textbooks.  </P> <P> If the board approves the books at its meeting Friday, the battleground will  shift to local school boards which must decide whether to buy the books.  Protests are expected in large urban districts with heavy minority enrollments.  </P> <P> Many critics concede that the books -- Houghton Mifflin social studies for  kindergarten through eighth grade, and an eighth-grade book published by Holt,  Rinehart &amp; Winston -- contain far more information about racial and  religious minorities than earlier textbooks.  </P> <P> "The issue is not whether people are included in the books or not," said Joyce  E. King, a black woman who cast a "no" vote when the Houghton Mifflin and Holt,  Rinehart &amp; Winston textbooks were approved, 10 to 3, by the state  Curriculum Commission in July.  </P> <P> "There is a fundamental attitude that predominates in these books and that is  not understood," said King, an associate professor and director of teacher  education at Santa Clara University.  </P> <P> That "fundamental attitude" is largely white and European, according to King  and other black critics, who say the historical achievements of whites are  over-emphasized, while those of nonwhites are ignored or given superficial  treatment.  </P> <P> King, who was born and educated in California, said she did not learn about the  Harlem Renaissance, the 1920s blossoming of black art, music and literature,  until her junior year of college when she was a Stanford University student  studying in Italy.  </P> <P> Some black educators want to supplement, or even replace, what they call  "Eurocentric" history with an "Afrocentric" curriculum that stresses the  accomplishments of blacks, especially of African-Americans. They contend that  such a course of study would improve both the academic performance and the  self-esteem of black youngsters.  </P> <P> While many educators agree that textbooks have ignored or minimized the  contributions of blacks and other minority groups, some call this new ethnic  approach "happy history" or "feel-good history," which they say would be as  much a disservice to black students as the discriminatory texts of the past  were to whites.  </P> <P> They also believe that teaching several different ethnic histories, instead of  a unified U.S. history, could contribute to an unraveling of American society.  </P> <P> "Pluralism is a positive value," Diane Ravitch, professor of history and  education at Teachers College, Columbia University, recently wrote in the  American Scholar, "but it is also important that we preserve a sense of an  American community -- a society and a culture to which we all belong."  </P> <P> "If there is no overall community with an agreed-upon vision of liberty and  justice, if all we have is a collection of racial and ethnic cultures lacking  any common bonds, then we have no means to mobilize public opinion on behalf of  people who are not members of our particular group," Ravitch wrote.  </P> <P> Said state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, "The question is, do we keep  the society together or do we break up into tribal warfare?"  </P> <P> But some who stress the ethnic approach to history dispute the idea of "common  bonds."  </P> <P> "These common values that people talk about are really the white man's values,"  said Herbert Kohl, a white author and educator. "There is this Greek,  Eurocentric notion that there are values that come from the West against which  the whole world should be judged. That simply isn't so. There are other values  that aren't European that have equal merit."  </P> <P> Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA and chair of the Curriculum  Commission subcommittee that supervised the textbook adoption process, said a  new approach to history was badly needed because "kids are abysmally ignorant  about history, a fact that has been confirmed by every major national  assessment in recent years."  </P> <P> California "wiped the slate clean," wrote new curriculum guidelines, then asked  publishers to come up with textbooks to match the new guidelines. Most  publishers declined, but Houghton Mifflin produced a "marvelous series -- it is  not perfect but it is a great improvement over what is in the schools now," she  said.  </P> <P> "Now we are seeing a power play on every side," Crabtree added. "If everything  is going to turn out to be a bloody battle over the curriculum and over every  word in the textbooks, then it will destroy the system."  </P> <P> Several concerns have been raised in letters and at public hearings of the  Curriculum Commission and the State Board of Education. Among them:  </P> <P> * Representatives of several Jewish organizations said Judaism is subjected to  a more critical analysis than Christianity in the Houghton Mifflin series. They  also objected to references in the sixth-grade book to the participation of  Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> * Muslim speakers said treatment of the roots of Islam in the seventh-grade  book is inadequate and some suggested that only a Muslim author could write an  accurate account.  </P> <P> * Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, said the  frequently brutal treatment of Chinese railroad workers in the American West is  given scant attention. "We do not want 'ethnic history,' " Der said. "We want  accurate history for all children of all races. We do not want to be  marginalized."  </P> <P> * Sam Rios, director of Chicano Studies at California State University,  Sacramento, said the Houghton Mifflin series "does an injustice" to  Mexican-American history, although Latinos have been less specific than blacks  in outlining alternatives.  </P> <P> * Representatives of several gay and lesbian groups complained that their  organizations are excluded from the history texts.  </P> <P> But the strongest criticisms have come from blacks.  </P> <P> Some African-American educators and scholars contend that ancient Egypt, the  source of much that is valued in Western civilization, was a black African  nation, not the multicolored, multiracial society that has been portrayed in  most histories.  </P> <P> Gary B. Nash, professor of history at UCLA and one of the authors of the  Houghton Mifflin series, said this argument "is simply not accepted by most  African historians, black or white."  </P> <P> The debate is not surprising to Nash, who described history as "a form of  property" that has been "generally used by elites" to control what is known  about their societies.  </P> <P> "What we've seen since the 1960s," Nash said, "is a massive redistribution of  the property of history. It is no longer exclusively the property of white  males. We are hearing from many groups -- blacks, Asians, Latinos, women, even  gays and lesbians, who all want to erase this historical amnesia."  </P> <P> "The challenge for people like me is to weave all these stories together in an  accurate and balanced way," he said. "In order to do that, you have to decide  how much attention to pay to what, or you would wind up with a book you had to  carry around in a wheelbarrow."  </P></p>

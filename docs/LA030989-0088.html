			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT AGENDA OKD FOR LA CANADA  </P> <P> The La Canada Flintridge Redevelopment Agency identified four areas of concern  for future agency meetings and set up a tentative schedule that will carry  redevelopment discussions into at least late spring or early summer.  </P> <P> The agency agreed to discuss the topics at regularly scheduled meetings  beginning at the second meeting in April. City staff will research the topics  and report back to the agency.  </P> <P> Whether La Canada Flintridge will be able to avoid building low-income housing  within the city limits and still qualify for redevelopment funds will be the  first topic addressed.  </P> <P> Other agency items include a discussion of the method of determining property  valuation increases for the city, a review of redevelopment laws regarding  blight and examples of blight within La Canada Flintridge, and the agency's  power of property condemnation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constant Concern  </P> <P> "Basically, these four items have been brought up a number of times in  discussions," City Manager Don Otterman said, "and I think these are areas  where there are still concerns."  </P> <P> The housing fund has been the subject of debate for months. State law requires  that 20% of all tax increment money received by a redevelopment agency be used  for building and maintaining low-income housing within the community.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the city has been looking for ways to meet state requirements while  appeasing those who object to building low-income housing within city limits.  </P> <P> A bill to exempt certain communities from the 20% housing fund requirement was  recently introduced in the state Legislature. Under that proposal, the money  would be used for building low-income housing on adjacent county property,  rather than within city limits.  </P></p>

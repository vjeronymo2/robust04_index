It was therefore  natural that journalists at a meeting in Zvezdnyy Gorodok  attempted to tease out all the details of how the cosmonauts  feel. There was no hint of the slightest complaint, and  immediately after the news conference Aleksandr Serebrov went  off for another swim in the sports pool.    Incidentally, this was 50-year-old Serebrov's fourth flight  already, and two of the expeditions turned out to be lengthy.  He now has several world records to his credit, the most  impressive being 10 space walks. One of these -- when the  orbital station was carefully examined from all sides during the  "Panorama" scientific experiment -- gave grounds for assuming  that Mir will "survive" until the joint missions with the  Americans in 1997.    Even this time, incidentally, Serebrov and Tsibliyev  conducted experiments in growing biological crystals under a  commercial order from the American firms Boeing and Payload. As  a check back on Earth has shown, the crystals obtained are of a  distinctly high quality. By the way, there should be no  delusions about the scientific intensity of the expedition.  Crews, including this one, have to spend a considerable  proportion of their time on preventive work -- essentially  do-it-yourself jobs. Therefore, it seemed to me, Serebrov is  somewhat skeptical about the idea of a fifth flight, which, on  the one hand, would enable him to become undisputed  record-holder but, on the other, would be of little interest to  a specialist in the current situation.    But we do have an achievement for the Guinness Book of  Records. Serebrov conducted studies involving a  microaccelerometer and thereby, in orbit, helped his latest  terrestrial research student, Yelena Bogdanova from the  "Energiya" Science-and-Production Association, in her  preparation to defend her dissertation.    This flight was also unusual in that the crew's relationship  with Mission Control Center was contract-based. In the event of  a mistake either side would have had to repay up to 30 percent  of the cost of the spoiled segment of work. Any change of  program proposed by Mission Control Center required legal  coordination with the crew's agents on Earth. It did not get to  the point of financial penalties during this expedition, but  there were a dozen instances when an official document was  written at Mission Control Center to broaden the crew's  functions and exempt them from any claim in the event of any  kind of failure. Serebrov and Tsibliyev are unanimous that the  contract system is still rough and and imperfect but that even  in this form it imposes a discipline and is a great help in work.    The cosmonauts' were pretty pessimistic in their assessment  of the situation in the country which they left more than six  months ago, saying that nothing has changed here since Gogol's  time. Gaydar's exit from the government provoked particularly  gloomy thoughts among the cosmonauts.    On the way to the swimming pool I managed to get a word with  Aleksandr Serebrov on a delicate matter -- the recent pre-launch  conflict between cosmonaut physicians Valeriy Polyakov and  German Arzamazov. Serebrov noted that their relationship is a  precise repetition of the theme of "Two Captains" [Dva Kapitana;  1944 Veniamin Kaverin novel paralleling the lives and conflicts  of a pre-revolutionary explorer and a young Soviet airman]. The  most curious thing is that just before the replacement team  arrived Serebrov, without having any information from Earth,  predicted a probable clash between the contenders for a record  one and one-half year flight.    Incidentally, it is premature to make final judgments in  this  unpleasant episode. After our first item the "troublemaker"  German Arzamazov contacted the editorial office. His story  differs from the official version. Incidentally, Serebrov's  astonishing prediction testifies that what happened cannot be  described as a nervous breakdown, as it is being depicted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Antonio Suarez, president of the National  Association of Judicial Employees, and Gabriel de Vega, director  of the National Drug Directorate, commented on the U.S. State  Department's harsh, controversial report.    [Begin recording] [Suarez] We have been criticized for not  having a strong enough hand, but we have a list of 262 judges  and employees assassinated in Colombia. We would not have such  a long history of bloodshed if we weren't doing something. The  U.S. State Department's remarks are interfering and an attempt  to meddle in Colombia's administration of justice. That is why  we, just this once, support the prosecutor general's policy.    [De Vega] As far as my office is concerned, the report is  objective and measured. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: Inside the mind of an elusive president THE JUGGLER: FRANKLYN ROOSEVELT AS WARTIME STATESMAN by Warren F Kimball Princeton Pounds 16, 304 pages WARREN KIMBALL, an American diplomatic historian best known for his definitive edition of the Churchill-Roosevelt letters, has set himself what many would consider an impossible task. He has sought to identify the basic assumptions that underlay Franklyn D Roosevelt's wartime diplomacy and post-war strategy. Kimball argues throughout this collection of individual essays written at different times that, behind the President's rhetorical posturings and tactical manoeuverings, there was a constancy of purpose. By looking at the broad shape and long-term intentions of Roosevelt's specific policies, Kimball convincingly lays to rest the old canard that the President was merely reacting to daily events; but he also attempts the far more difficult task of defining 'the juggler's' vision of the post-war world, an amalgam between the ideological, the pragmatic and the practical which Kimball calls 'Roosevelt's Americanism'. Each essay, based on extensive work in the American archives and with a broad knowledge of the Anglo-American secondary literature, has been reworked to throw new light on the central theme. Kimball writes with verve and energy ; even the extensive footnotes hold one's attention. This book is guaranteed to provoke debate but of a productive kind that will interest British as well as American readers. If there was a consistency in Roosevelt's activities, it was neither obvious to his wartime allies or even to his fellow citizens. From his own studies of lend-lease and the Morganthau Plan that defeated Germany, Kimball is fully familiar with the strongly supported case for Roosevelt's elusiveness and changeability. The president's treatment of Churchill and Stalin was such a strange combination of ruthless realism and egoistic optimism that conventional characterisations have to be abandoned. Roosevelt's hopes that the 'good neighbours' policy of the western hemisphere would become the model for relations between the great and small countries in the rest of the world involved a whole range of unspoken assumptions that have to be teased out of the president's wartime policies. Kimball rightly insists on Roosevelt's central role in directing American diplomacy despite the smokescreen with which he often surrounded himself. A surprisingly good case is made for the president's consistent espousal of certain causes: his strong and continuous opposition to colonialism and his belief that decolonisation and independence would be an inevitable result of the war. In this essay on 'Roosevelt and Colonialism' and in his treatment of the president's appraisal of the Soviet Union's future importance in maintaining the European peace, Kimball makes large claims for Roosevelt's prescience. It is certainly true that some of the assumptions behind Roosevelt's actions, whether successful or not, appear to have been vindicated by the events of the last years. Roosevelt assumed that the Soviet Union would recognise in time the virtues and superiority of the American system and would eventually follow the paths of democracy, capitalism and free trade. Similarly, the Russians, eastern Europe and the British, freed from their crippling colonial inheritance, would learn from the special relationship that the US had created with their continental neighbours. Roosevelt's post-war planning envisioned evolutionary change though hardly, in the Soviet case, the 40 years it has taken. The Cold War years pushed Franklyn Roosevelt off the centre of the historical stage. Our present image of the president, both in terms of his domestic and foreign policy, was fashioned in the 1960s when the New Deal and Roosevelt's Soviet strategy was subjected to scathing criticism. These diplomatic essays may represent the beginning of a more balanced appreciation of this great, if highly controversial, leader. Kimball's attempt to systematise Roosevelt's thinking , as the very title of his book acknowledges, is bound to be flawed. Roosevelt never articulated a cohesive philosophy and prided himself on his unusual dexterity. Essays of this kind are suggestive rather than conclusive, and so this rethinking of Roosevelt's war aims is to be warmly welcomed but the verdict remains 'not proven'.</p>

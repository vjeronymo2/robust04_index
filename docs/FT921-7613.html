			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Net at Mair Astley surges to NZDollars 5.6m MAIR Astley, the New Zealand commodity trader and primary product exporter, yesterday reported a surge in net profits to NZDollars 5.59m (USDollars 3m) for the six months to December 31, from NZDollars 97,000 a year earlier. It announced a one-for-three bonus and a return to dividend payments. The company is New Zealand's largest exporter of venison and among the top international traders in wool, leather and pelts. The profit improvement follows a sharp rise in demand for these products, helped by the recent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. Mr John Roy, executive chairman, said the turnround had also been assisted by a refocus on value-added activities such as leather manufacture. At the pre-tax level, profits turned round to NZDollars 8.01m from losses of NZDollars 25,000. Tax took NZDollars 2.73m compared with NZDollars 167,000. Total assets fell to NZDollars 166.7m from NZDollars 210.74m due to asset sales. A 5 cent dividend was declared, the first since 1989, when the company began a period of reconstruction.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATKINS GIVEN PROBATION FOR ASHLAND SCAM  </P> <P> Orin E. Atkins, the former chairman of Ashland Oil Inc., was sentenced Friday  to probation and community service for trying to sell confidential company  documents to Iran.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight of Manhattan said that although he felt  Atkins had committed a serious crime, he decided prison time was not warranted  because Atkins cooperated with prosecutors and agreed to pay restitution to  Ashland.  </P> <P> The restitution settlement, announced in court by Ashland attorney John C.  Elam, calls for Atkins to forgo more than $2 million in consulting fees and  pension benefits and repay $250,000.  </P> <P> Haight sentenced Atkins to two years' probation and 600 hours of community  service. The judge imposed no additional fine, citing Atkins' diminished  finances.  </P> <P> Atkins, 66, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in September, 1989, to  conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate with the government.  </P> <P> He had faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.  </P> <P> Atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but remained as a  paid Ashland consultant, he obtained confidential documents involving the  company's decision not to pay the National Iranian Oil Co. for $283 million in  crude oil purchased in 1979.  </P> <P> The company said it withheld payment because of a trade ban on Iran that the  United States imposed following the taking of American hostages at the U.S.  Embassy in Tehran in November, 1979.  </P> <P> Atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the documents to the  Iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit against Ashland over its  non-payment.  </P> <P> The documents were offered at various times for $20 million or a 25%  contingency fee.  </P> <P> While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last  year obtained a $325-million settlement, which with interest was worth more  than $500 million.  </P> <P> In a statement to the court before sentencing, Atkins described the  embarrassment and anguish his acts caused his family and friends.  </P> <P> "I have no excuses for my actions other than I think anger or some resentment  obviously short-circuited my brain," Atkins said.  </P></p>

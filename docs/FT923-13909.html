			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Fresh curbs on foreigners THE Russian government was yesterday reported to have adopted new restrictions on the movement of foreigners at a time when the country is trying to attract foreign investment and open up to the west. Itar-Tass news agency said in an unsourced report that foreigners would have to apply for Security Ministry (ex-KGB) permission to visit 'several areas' in the Moscow, Leningrad (now St Petersburg), Nizhny Novgorod, Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), Chelyabinsk, Kaliningrad, Astrakhan and Krasnoyarsk regions. Many of these areas used to be sealed off but have been opened up in recent times.  They include large military plants, defence installations, and environmental disaster areas. Officials at the ministries for foreign affairs and security could not confirm the report last night. But if it is true, the move would indicate a sinister step back to the old days of Soviet dictatorship, playing into the hands of conservatives and giving an opposite message to that of partnership with the west proclaimed by President Boris Yeltsin. Supporters of ousted Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia kidnapped the deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Kavsadze, yesterday in a new show of resistance to the country's leadership, according to Interfax news agency, Reuter reports from Moscow. A spokesman for the ruling state council told local journalists that Mr Kavsadze's car had been blown up in the west of the republic. His driver had been killed. Western Georgia is the main stronghold of Mr Gamsakhurdia, overthrown in January after a two-week battle in which hundreds died.</p>

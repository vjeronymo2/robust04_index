			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 2 (XINHUA) -- The China Aviation  Foundation, the latest effort by the Chinese aviation industry  to raise funds from overseas, has achieved total success,  official sources here said.    The sources said that within a year's time in its first  campaign, the foundation has raised 96.6 million U.S. dollars.    Now these funds have found their way into aviation  enterprises, among which eight have begun to operate on new  bases, the sources said.    Once a part of China's defense industry, the aviation sector  has in recent years transformed itself into a major manufacturer  of aircraft, combustion turbine engines, automobiles,  motorcycles, foodstuff packaging machines and other civil  products, the sales income of which now accounts for 70 percent  of the industry's total output value.    Despite its advantages in high-tech fields, the industry  nonetheless has been beset by a shortage of funds. The whole  industry received only seven million U.S. dollars of overseas  investment before the foundation was established.    In 1993, the China National Aviation Industry Corporation  (CNAIC), with the support of several overseas companies and  banks, established the China aviation foundation.    Soon after it was launched, the foundation entrusted the  Hong  Kong-based Tienlee Company with raising funds from overseas for  66 industrial projects it had selected out beforehand.    Zhang Hongbiao, vice-president of CNAIC, said that the 66  projects were chosen on the basis of strict feasibility studies,  including predicted investment and marketing prospects.    Zhang said project enterprises could use the funds for  technical upgrading, purchase of equipment, personnel training,  marketing studies, or even as circulating capital.    The vice-president said that project enterprises receiving  the funds may operate as Sino-foreign joint ventures, though  they must be solely managed by Chinese.    Among those to begin to operate on the new basis is Tianjin  Tianli Aviation Electronics Ltd., which received 7.95 million  U.S. dollars from the foundation for new product development.    The vice-president pointed out that the aviation foundation  will be playing an important role in the industry's blueprint  for the coming 10 to 15 years.    He added that preparations for the raising of second and  third batches of funds are already under way.</p>

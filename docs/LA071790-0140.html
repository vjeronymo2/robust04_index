			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> POSITION CREATED TO KEEP CITY BUSINESSES  </P> <P> Hoping to underscore its desire to keep businesses in the community, the City  Council has approved the new full-time staff position of community development  analyst.  </P> <P> The council also approved the establishment of an ad hoc Business Advisory  Committee, in which members of the Chamber of Commerce, the business community,  a planning commissioner and residents at large will look into ways to retain  businesses in the city.  </P> <P> "(The committee) will be looking into what the city can do to promote a healthy  business climate," City Manager Robert C. Dunek said.  </P> <P> Over the last year, several businesses have moved out of Los Alamitos, Dunek  said. The losses resulted in a noticeable dip in sales tax revenue, and the  city set out to find out why businesses were leaving.  </P> <P> The analyst position carries with it a salary range of $2,541 to $3,120 a  month. The appointee will be responsible for code enforcement activities, the  community development block grant program and working to revitalize the  business community.  </P> <P> The ad hoc committee will report back to the council at its budget review  session in January. The committee might then become an on-going liaison between  the city staff and businesses, Dunek said.KATHIE BOZANICH  </P></p>

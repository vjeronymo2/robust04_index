			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Poll resolves Lebanon power struggle A POWER struggle for the leadership of Lebanon's main Christian political party, the Phalange, was resolved peacefully yesterday with the re-election of Mr Georges Saadeh, a parliamentary deputy and minister of posts and telecommunications. At stake were the participation of the Maronite Catholic party in prime minister Rashid Solh's government and a boycott of this summer's parliamentary elections. Mr Saadeh's victory indicates a degree of acceptance by Maronites of Lebanon's Syrian-backed government and constitutes a severe setback for his opponent, Dr Samir Geagea, the leader of the 'Lebanese Forces' Phalangist militia. The Lebanese army last week seized heavy weapons stored illegally by the militia at Amchit and Jeita. The Maronite synod opposes general elections while Syrian troops remain in Beirut. Had Dr Geagea won the Phalange party leadership, the Maronite community - about 30 per cent of Lebanon's population - would probably have boycotted the elections. Mr Saadeh has not defined his position on the issue, but is likely to encourage his followers to vote. Dr Geagea abandoned a career as a medical doctor to become a militia leader. He was named minister without portfolio in the Lebanese government formed last month, but resigned within hours to protest at the predominance of pro-Syrian ministers in the cabinet. Mr Saadeh maintained the Phalange should 'be present at the heart of Lebanese political life' regardless of the imbalance. He felt that his party's absence would further isolate the Maronite community which was torn by the 1990 war between Dr Geagea and rebel Gen Michel Aoun. When Gen Aoun was defeated by Syrian forces in 1990, many Maronites felt humiliated by the deployment of Syrian troops in the Christian enclave. The Phalange was founded by the late Sheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1936. Relations between the party and the militia have been strained in recent years as the political and military branches vied for leadership of the Maronite community. With yesterday's election, the power of the militia was further diminished.</p>

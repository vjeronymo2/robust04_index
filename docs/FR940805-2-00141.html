			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 29, 1994, Dr. Nelson Wivel of the Office of Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, requested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix M&hyph;VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments, be amended to clarify submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gene Transfer Experiments currently reads:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review for all gene transfer protocols.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment reads:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review for all gene transfer protocols; therefore, submission of the response to the Points to Consider is required.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment was reviewed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee during the June 9&hyph;10, 1994, meeting. The Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Committee approved a motion to accept the proposed amendment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix M&hyph;VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments, by a vote of 13 in favor, 0 opposed, and no abstentions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I accept this recommendation, and Appendix M&hyph;VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments, of the NIH Guidelines will be amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Deletion of Appendix L of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Release into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 29, 1994, Dr. Nelson Wivel of the Office of Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, requested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix L, Release into the Environment of Certain Plants, be deleted from the NIH Guidelines based on the following: (1) Section I of the NIH Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows experiments to proceed that are reviewed and approved by another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity for NIH review or approval (52 FR 31849); (2) the Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Committee has not reviewed any deliberate release experiment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving recombinant DNA since 1984; (3) at its May 30&hyph;31, 1991, meeting, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee recommended that Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted from the NIH Guidelines; and (4) experiments involving deliberate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release into the environment are currently reviewed within the framework of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing Federal regulations, as administered by the Environmental Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I of the NIH Guidelines was amended on August 24, 1987, such that any recombinant DNA experiment (other than human gene transfer) may proceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and NIH approval if it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been reviewed and approved by another Federal agency that has jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over such a proposal. The amended version (52 FR 31849) of Section I reads as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section I&hyph;A. Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``*&blank;*&blank;*Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH Guidelines requires approval by the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval. Once approval, or other applicable clearances, have been obtained from a Federal agency other than the NIH (whether the experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed without the necessity for NIH review or approval*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 6, 1990, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subcommittee recommended that the requirement for Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Committee review of experiments involving deliberate environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release of organisms containing recombinant DNA be eliminated from the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines. This recommendation reflected the fact that the Federal regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, are responsible for the review and approval of environmental release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiments. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee reviewed the request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recommended that the following sections be deleted from the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines (Actions Under the Guidelines,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , July 5, Part III):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Deliberate release into the environment of any organism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA except those listed below. The term ``deliberate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release'' is defined as a planned introduction of recombinant DNA-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms, plants, or animals into the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2&hyph;a. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Introductions conducted under conditions considered to be accepted scientific practices in which there is adequate evidence of biological and/or physical control of the recombinant DNA-containing organisms.

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / By-election victor says Monklands needs time to heal Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour victor of the Monklands East by-election, yesterday said there should be a period of healing to repair the wounds inflicted by the bruising campaign. But she also accused the Scottish National party, which narrowly failed to win the seat, of stirring up religious tensions in the constituency. She said it had been 'despicable' for canvassers to appeal to Protestants by reminding them that she was a Catholic. Mrs Liddell won the seat with a majority of 1,640 over the SNP. That compared with the late John Smith's majority of 15,712. The turnout was 70 per cent. Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, rejected Mrs Liddell's accusations, saying the party had played 'neither the green card nor the orange card, but the Scottish card'. The main issue in the campaign was alleged discrimination by Labour-run Monklands district council against largely Protestant Airdrie, at the centre of the constituency, in favour of mainly Catholic Coatbridge. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said the government should use its powers to hold an inquiry into the actions of the council. Mr Ian Lang, the secretary of state for Scotland, said he could not order an inquiry without evidence. Support in Scotland for the Scottish National party is at 30 per cent, its highest level since 1988, while Labour has 46 per cent, says a System Three opinion poll for The Herald newspaper in Glasgow. The Tories are put at 12 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 11 per cent</p>

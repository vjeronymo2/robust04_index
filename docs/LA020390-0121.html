			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMP CARE SELLING IRVINE BUILDING  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care Corp., the troubled owner of a chain of drug and alcohol  treatment centers, said Friday it had agreed to sell its former corporate  headquarters in Irvine for $9 million to an unidentified buyer.  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care said last year it would move to Missouri and sell most of  its assets in California in order to pay a pressing $25-million debt.  </P> <P> That announcement came shortly after a deal to merge with a Virginia hospital  company fell through in October when the hospital's lender backed out.  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care said in a statement that the sale of its two-story building  at 18551 Von Karman Avenue depends on the results of a test for environmental  contamination demanded by the buyer, a test not yet complete. The buyer has put  down a $500,000 deposit, but the company says the sale also depends on the  buyer raising the rest of the purchase price.  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care operates the CareUnit Hospitals for drug and alcohol  treatment, among other businesses.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile phones Wolff Olins, the identity consultants, have expensively concluded that orange is distinctive, dynamic, open and positive. It is also, apparently, simple, friendly and approachable. Most people, however, still think of it as fruit. Hutchison Telecom's new mobile phone system, Orange, is thus open to the crack that it is a lemon - particularly since Orange comes from the company which produced the dead Rabbit network. The name is doubly unfortunate because the Orange network looks attractive. Since it will cover the main UK metropolitan areas and the connecting motorways at launch, it has a significant advantage over its rival, Mercury One-2-One. Its expansion will also be more rapid. Orange will cover 70 per cent of the population by the end of the year and 90 per cent by mid-1995. One-2-One will cover only around 30 per cent of the population by the year end. The pricing of calls and handsets, yet to be announced, will put pressure on margins in the rest of the mobile phone industry. Coverage is wide enough to make Orange a realistic alternative to Vodafone and Cellnet. They have been picking up low-use domestic customers, but the old networks' profitability is critically dependent on their business tariffs. Those fat margins could be undermined if business users drift to Orange in significant numbers. Wide coverage and lower handset prices are also a threat to One-2-One. It may suffer for its decision to constrain capital spending and roll its network out slowly.</p>

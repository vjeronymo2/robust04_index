			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial" View From the State Bank"] </F>   [Text] Economic deterioration had reached alarming  proportions during the previous financial year. This has been  confirmed by the latest State Bank annual report which cites  fiscal policy as one of the weakest areas of economic  management. To meet the widening budget deficit, the government  borrowed for budgetary support Rs [rupees] 63 billion against  the whole year's target of Rs 25 billion. If the borrowing by  autonomous corporations is also included, this figure would go  up to Rs 129 billion. It should, therefore, not come as a  surprise that Pakistan's total GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is  mortgaged by debts to the extent of 86 percent. Financial  discipline has rarely been the strong point of economy but  during the 1992-93 financial year it seems to have been totally  discounted. It was only in the later half of the year that some  demand management measures were initiated but the economy had  already been subjected to serious strains.    With an economic growth at three percent, the same as the  rate of growth of population, there was no increase in per  capita income. The growth in the agriculture sector declined  from 9.7 percent to minus 3.7 percent, and that of the  manufacturing sector from 8.3 to 5.6 percent. Exports growth  fell from 14.6 to 0.4 percent, but imports went up from 7.3 to  9.9 percent. Trade account recorded a deficit of 3.1 billion  dollars causing a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves  from 1,012 million dollars to 461 million dollars by the end of  June last year. Heavy borrowing by the government and an  excessive monetary expansion at 24 percent had a cripling effect  on inflation whichs went into double digits and was recorded at  10.3 percent. The State Bank feels that price indices suffer  from technical deficiencies and inaccuracies which would suggest  that price pressures have accentuated more than these indices  reflect. The decline in national savings from 17 percent to 14.6  percent is an inevitable consequence.    Against such dismal performance of the economy, the targets  set for this year underscore the need for financial discipline  and concerted efforts. It has been proposed to achieve an  economic growth of 7.5 percent, bring down inflation to 8  percent, build up foreign exchange reserves up to 1.3 billion  dollars and reduce the budget deficit to 5.4 percent of the  gross domestic product. Last year budgetary deficit was as high  as 7.9 percent. Monetary expansion will be restricted to 14.5  percent. Already the [passage indistinct] effort in the budget  was its [words indistinct]. The report makes a special mention  of the demand management and resource generation measures  introduced during the term of the caretakers. The caretaker  government had raised additional resources worth Rs.17 billion.  For the current year, the nation has already been subjected to a  heavy dose of taxation and any further burden on it is to be  avoided.    The SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] report is of the view that  it is too early to evaluate the outcome for the current  financial year, but developments so far on the supply as well as  on the demand side would indicate that the continuation of the  reform measures and tight demand management policies pursued in  the first half of the year will lead to higher growth,  containment of inflation and improvement in the balance of  payments. After having regained its autonomy, it is to be hoped  that the State Bank will, through a balanced monetary policy,  help to keep a lid on government borrowing, control monetary  expansion within the target and contain inflation. The role of  the central bank in keeping the economy on course is as  important as that of the economic policy managers.</p>

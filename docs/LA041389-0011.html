			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BREAK IN RISK-REWARD CONNECTION ALLOWED VALDEZ SPILL TO HAPPEN  </P> <P> If you're playing a dangerous game, and you swear that it's safe, aren't you  responsible if someone gets hurt?  </P> <P> If you make a gigantic mess, don't you have to clean it up?  </P> <P> If the Internal Revenue Service suspects you didn't pay your taxes, aren't you  subject to a painstaking audit?  </P> <P> In a capitalist system, isn't there supposed to be some connection between risk  and reward?  </P> <P> One of the most sickening things about the oil spill off the Alaskan coast is  what it says about the way the world really works.  </P> <P> It is another cynical lesson that the really big players don't have to play by  the same rules that apply to the rest of us. In this case, a Titanic foul-up by  a major oil company, those responsible will not really pay the price. We will.  </P> <P> For starters, taxpayers and consumers will subsidize the cost of the whole  murderous mess. Exxon's loss of more than 10 million gallons of oil from the  Exxon Valdez can be fully written off corporate income taxes, as can all of the  cleanup costs paid by the company. No wonder Exxon announced that cost was no  object in attacking the spill. They aren't paying it.  </P> <P> Moreover, it is absolutely unclear who in the end is going to pick up the tab  from the damages caused by the spill -- Exxon, its insurers or the taxpayers.  The rules on who is ultimately responsible in such disasters are extremely  muddy and desperately need to be clarified. Congress, by setting up a welter of  insurance funds, tried to socialize the risk so that no oil company would face  bankruptcy in the event of something like the Valdez catastrophe.  </P> <P> But if the risk is socialized, the rewards of the deadly oil traffic remain  firmly private. In the wake of the spill, the price of crude oil and products  have skyrocketed -- the largest single oil price increase in history. As a  result, oil companies as a whole have made tens of millions of dollars on the  disaster, to such an extent that industry insiders kid that Exxon slid onto  that reef on purpose.  </P> <P> That may be a sick joke, but it points to the dangerous lack of accountability  in this disaster.  </P> <P> Maybe the corporate mind would be more focused if responsible executives, right  on up to the chairman, lost their jobs when something like this happens. The  president of Japan Air Lines stepped down when one of his jets crashed.  Lawrence Rawls, Exxon chief executive, is still there, drawing his generous  salary. Conceivably, if he and others down the line who grew complacent and  ultimately put a known alcoholic in charge of a tanker knew that their jobs  were at stake, this accident might not have happened.  </P> <P> This spill might also prompt some rethinking about oil company taxes. If the  public bears most of the cost of the destruction of the environment and  millions of Earth's creatures, then perhaps the public purse ought to enjoy  more of the gain from the hazardous commerce in oil. In a free enterprise  system, theoretically at least, there should be some connection between risk  and reward.  </P> <P> That principle was reflected in the Windfall Profits Tax of 1980, which sought  to capture the profits that domestic oil producers reaped when the price of  domestic oil was deregulated and rose to the OPEC cartel price. But did the  companies overpay that tax as intended? The IRS believes that at least some of  the producers operating in Alaska and California did not; that they  significantly underpaid.  </P> <P> Last summer, the IRS issued a deficiency notice to Arco for $1.2 billion for  underpayment of taxes from 1980 to 1983 on windfall profits from the Alaskan  North Slope. That figure does not include possible underpayments from 1983 to  mid-1985, when prices fell below the windfall profits tax-base price, or  underpayments by the other major producers.  </P> <P> Officials in California -- in the controller's office, the state Lands  Commission and in the City of Long Beach -- and some industry analysts believe  that the oil companies have avoided paying the windfall profits tax on oil  produced in California as well. They suspect this was accomplished by means of  a complicated system of underpricing crude oil when it was sold to the  companies' refining subsidiaries. This had the effect of transferring the  profits "downstream," so that they would be taxed at the then-corporate rate of  46% instead of at the much-higher windfall profits rate.  </P> <P> The issue is pending in several court cases in California, and the oil  companies have spent tens of millions of dollars in legal fees challenging the  complex charges. If the companies lose, they stand to pay plenty. Officials  estimate that the damages to the state of California alone, in lost tax  revenues and oil royalties, came to at least $550 million between 1980 and  1985. The losses to the federal treasury could run into the billions, but so  far the IRS has not aggressively pursued the case.  </P> <P> If Alaskan and California crude oil has systematically been priced below its  fair market value, how can rational environmental decisions be made? If this  oil is in fact more valuable than past pricing would indicate, then the  government can and should have imposed tighter and more costly precautions on  the ways the companies have been operating.  </P> <P> That and a few heads on the line might have spared us our current grief.  </P></p>

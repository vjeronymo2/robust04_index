The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. section 78s (b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change adds to Article IV of MSTC's rules an interpretation which describes the Reorganization Processing System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, or the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the rule filing is to set forth in MSTC's rules the fact that MSTC may provide reorganization notices by computer facility. The computer facility that MSTC developed for the purpose of providing reorganization notices is a user-friendly, real-time computer system that allows participants, through the use of intuitive, data-driven displays, to view offer information on-line. It will allow MSTC participants to inquire as to various offer criteria, including offer type(s), target CUSIP(s), MSTC offer status, and offer date(s). Participants will be able to tailor their inquiries to only those offers in which they have a depository position. They may also view the location of a position within their MSTC account(s) for a chosen CUSIP. In addition, participants will be able to inquire as to a CUSIP's reorganization history. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 4 of Article IV of MSTC's rules describes MSTC's activities with respect to reorganizations, and sections 3 and 4 of Rule 2 of Article IV describe MSTC's responsibilities with respect to reorganization information disseminated by MSTC. Pursuant to these rules, MSTC currently provides daily notification of newly announced and updated corporate reorganization offers to its participants through manually produced, hard-copy notices. MSTC produces these notices, which include pertinent offer information, for a variety of offer types including, but not limited to, mergers, reverse splits, tenders and exchanges, expiring rights and warrants, put options on corporate and municipal bonds, and expiring convertible securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each current notice includes a disclaimer to the effect that MSTC does not guarantee the correctness or completeness of the information provided. This liability standard has been used for over twenty years and was part of MSTC's written procedures when MSTC applied for and received permanent registration as a clearing agency. The proposed interpretation sets forth language that limits MSTC's liability with respect to the information provided by computer. The liability standard is substantially the same as the standard for the hard copy notices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have been received. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

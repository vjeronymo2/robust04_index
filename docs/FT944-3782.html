			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / S Korean groups can visit north South Korea has granted permission for six domestic companies to send officials to North Korea to discuss possible investments. The South Korean companies include the conglomerates Samsung, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar and Ssangyong, and two smaller concerns, Yongsin Trading and Taedong Chemical. Seoul approved their applications to travel to North Korea in spite of Pyongyang's refusal to open direct negotiations with South Korea on economic co-operation. North Korea, however, is encouraging South Korean companies to invest on a private basis. However the corporate executives may not be allowed to visit North Korea until next year since Pyongyang decided last week to deny entry to all foreigners until the end of the month. The only apparent exception to the ban is the visit by US senators Mr Frank Murkowski and Mr Paul Simon, who arrived in Pyongyang yesterday abroad a US military aircraft in the first such flight to North Korea in 40 years. The two senators will discuss the improvement in relations between the US and North Korea and the implementation of the recent bilateral accord to resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute. The US and North Korea on Friday agreed to details on establishing low-level diplomatic offices in each other's capital as part of the recent nuclear agreement. The diplomatic offices will not be opened, however, until progress is achieved on several other issues, including North Korea's acceptance of South Korean light-water reactors to replace its more dangerous graphite reactors. Questions also remain over the disposal of North Korea's spent nuclear fuel rods, which contain weapons-grade plutonium. In addition, South Korea is demanding that North Korea resume talks with Seoul before it is allowed to establish diplomatic ties with the US. It is uncertain why North Korea has banned entry of foreigners, but some believe it may be related to the possible formal assumption of power by Mr Kim Jong-il later this month. The travel ban may also reflect disagreements within the North Korean hierarchy over the extent and pace of opening the country to foreign investment, according to Mr Song Young-dae, vice minister for national unification in Seoul. The military and the committee for the peaceful unification of the fatherland, the North Korean agency in charge of inter-Korean relations, are believed to oppose proposals by the government's administration council to promote foreign investment to solve economic problems. The internal debate may have delayed the assumption of power by Mr Kim, who is trying to reduce the influence of the hardliners by removing them from key positions, Mr Song said. But this has proved to be a difficult task. Mr Kim may not become general-secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party and president until the reorganisation of the power structure is completed. Workers from three South Korean motor vehicle companies - Daewoo, Sssangyong and Asia Motors - have ended their strike protesting against the government's decision to allow Samsung to produce cars.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In analytical terms, prior to final promulgation of today's proposed rule, the rate that lenders charge now when considering making an UST-related loan can be described as: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ^i=r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> +r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> where: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =Prevailing interest rate on UST-related loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i=Risk-free rate of return  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =Risk premium banks charge for loans to small businesses.

(This factor includes the financial risk that a lender may have to pay for contamination, or uncertainty regarding the true value of collateral, in the event of contamination.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the current uncertainty regarding a holder's obligations to comply with the UST regulatory requirements, the risk premium ``r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' that banks have to charge in order to be adequately compensated for their risk in an UST-related loan may often be so high that it effectively precludes lenders from making loans at this level. A related barrier to lending is that since all UST owners bear a systematic risk imposed by government regulations, lenders cannot diversify to substantially reduce or eliminate the UST-related risk premium, r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , by holding a portfolio of UST-related loans with different characteristics and risks. Since most UST owners and operators are small businesses that cannot self finance, they will either forego or delay UST facility improvements. While many UST-related loans are expected to be used for financing tank upgrades or replacements, these loans may also be used to provide additional services at the facility (e.g., an expanded area for food items at a convenience store). If lenders are precluded from making UST-related loans, both environmental protection and economic growth may suffer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By providing the exemption for holders from UST regulatory requirements contained in this proposed rule and thus reducing the uncertainty associated with making an UST-related loan, the risk premium is expected to be significantly reduced. The interest rate relationship after final promulgation of today's proposed rule can be described as: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule)=i+r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> +r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> where: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule)=Prevailing interest on UST-related loans after final promulgation of today's proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule)=Risk premium charged for UST owners after final promulgation of today's proposed rule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule) will still exist, it is expected to be significantly less than r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The result would be the reduction of the prevailing interest rate on UST-related loans to a level, r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (post rule), that is both adequate to compensate lenders for their perceived risk and at the same time affordable for credit-worthy UST owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are social costs associated with owners' and operators' inability to use the least costly financial mechanism to comply with the existing UST regulations. By reducing the risk premium to a level at which lenders are both willing and able to make UST-related loans, this proposed regulation is expected to increase the ability of UST owners and operators to comply with subtitle I regulations, thereby reducing these social costs. To the extent that loans are made for environmental compliance purposes, social costs would also be reduced by decreasing the number and severity of releases from old USTs that might otherwise occur in the absence of upgrading or replacing tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is interested in obtaining comments on how this proposed rule might allow UST owners and operators to use less costly financial mechanisms to comply with UST regulations. Specifically, the Agency requests information from lenders on the current interest rate charged for loans when property with one or more USTs is used as collateral. The Agency also requests information from lenders regarding the extent to which credit might have been extended to UST owners and operators in the past had this proposed rule been in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further information and a more detailed discussion of the costs and benefits associated with today's proposal is contained in the ``Regulatory Background Document'' for this proposed rule, located in the OUST Docket at 401 M Street, SW.; room 2616; Washington, DC 20460.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII.

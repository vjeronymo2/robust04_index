			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, 11 Mar (MENA)--Egyptian Interior Minister  Major General Hasan al-Alfi has stated that the security  services recently foiled several terror schemes.    He told the London-based Arabic daily AL-HAYAH that police  identified and monitored the extremist groups after tightening  control of desert areas, shanty towns, and Nile islands, where  those groups had their secret hideouts.    Al-Alfi stressed that foreign quarters are involved in the  terrorist operations in Egypt.    He said police are constantly directing abortive blows at  terrorist schemes. The arrest of those involved in recent bank  bombings in Cairo and al-Jizah comes within this context, he  said.    The interior minister renewed rejection of a dialogue with  the terrorists.    He said terrorists try to create what he described as "media  furor." Some foreign news media help them by inflating their  operations, he noted.    Al-Alfi said Egyptian security agencies are watching  developments in the structure of the terrorist groups on every  level, beginning with relations among them and ending with the  splits and alliances that affect changes of membership.    He said Egypt is in constant touch with foreign states where  some extremist leaders reside.    Al-Alfi said the lack of indictment against Ayman  al-Zawahiri, an al-Jihad organization leader now living in  Switzerland, in the case of the attempt on Prime Minister 'Atif  Sidqi's life concerns the interrogation authorities. Perhaps  those authorities don't have enough evidence for an indictment,  he said.</p>

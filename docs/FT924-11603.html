			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Growing support for increases in aid Sir, Just two points to add to your excellent leader stressing 'Aid Matters' (22 October). First, since Monday the parliamentary ground swell against cutting Britain's overseas aid budget has grown still further; 37 Conservative MPs have now signed the World Development Movement-sponsored letter to the chancellor calling on him to, at least, maintain the small planned increases in aid set out in last year's Autumn Statement. As the government defines its 'go for growth' strategy, ministers would do well to reflect not only on the compelling humanitarian arguments for aid, but also the business, exports and jobs aid secures for Britain. Second, you rightly highlight the crippling effect of the Multi- Fibre Arrangement (MFA) on developing countries, for whom clothing and textiles make up a quarter of all manufactured exports. Unnoticed by many, earlier this month the Council of Ministers decided to roll over the EC's system of MFA restrictions for yet another year, pending a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. With now little prospect of a GATT settlement, there is no excuse for the EC not to agree to start phasing out its discriminatory textile quotas against the Third World.

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange SQUEEZE combined with bargain hunting helped stock index futures end sharply ahead after an initial retreat, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened at 2,480 and quickly went into retreat, falling to 2,472 within minutes of the opening. Independent traders were the main sellers, which also had the effect of leading the underlying cash market lower. But a feeling that September had been oversold, together with the independent traders moving to cover short positions, not only caused a turnround but led to a squeeze, sending the contract strongly forward. The release of poor UK economic data had no effect and was followed by a quiet period of sideways trading over the lunch time period before buyers returned to send the contract to a strong finish. September closed at 2,509, up 17 from Monday's close and around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Volume reached 6,429 lots. In traded options, turnover improved to reach 25,005, up from 20,613 the previous day. A large part of the day's business was in the FT-SE 100 option ahead of Friday's expiry. Volume in the index option totalled 13,284 lots. The Euro FT-SE traded 1,433 contracts. Business in the stock options was dull. BAe was the most actively traded, with a day's total of 900 contracts. This was followed by Courtalds on 891 lots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim yesterday defended the  need to overcome "rigid patterns of political power in the  international community," and proposed the installation of  structures reflecting the new reality that appeared with the end  of the cold war, the BRASIL news agency has reported.    In a speech delivered in Bonn during the luncheon offered in  his honor by German Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Amorim emphasized the need of organizations, such as the United  Nations, to have an all-encompassing and meaningful  representativity reflecting the new international order.    According to him, mechanisms must be adopted that are "tuned  to the new international political configuration" so that the  multilateral forums reflect "with more faithfulness and equity  the various interests and concepts that are appearing in today's  world." Brazil supports the idea of expanding the UN Security  Council, and is striving for inclusion among those countries  seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The  Brazilian Government supports German candidacy to the Security  Council.    During the first day of his 48-hour visit to Bonn and  Berlin,  Amorim emphasized Brazilian interest in expanding its scientific  and technological cooperation with Germany, including that in  high technology projects. As he recalled, recent measures  adopted in the country, including ratification of the agreement  among Brazil, Argentina, and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (which contemplates supervision of the nuclear facilities  and the peaceful use of atomic energy), and Brazil's decision to  comply with the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control  Regime (MTCR) will facilitate this cooperation.    The Brazilian foreign minister also pointed out that at  several multilateral forums Brazil has been contributing to  preserving balance in the post-cold war world, such as in issues  related to trade, the environment, disarmament, and human rights.</p>

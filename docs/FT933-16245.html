			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / People: Credit Lyonais Bernard Thiolon, recently retired from Credit Lyonnais after a 41-year career at the French bank, is joining the board of Kingfisher as its seventh non-executive director on the eleven man board. Kingfisher's corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker says that as well as his familiarity with the French corporate scene, Thiolon understands British business culture too, 'which is important and none too common.' Earlier this year, Kingfisher merged with Darty, France's largest electrical retailer. Top Darty executives are represented within the executive management groups, but it is not the company's policy to put the bosses of its operating companies on the plc board. Thiolon is a director of Darty. Group general manager of Credit Lyonnais until his retirement at the end of last year, 64-year-old Thiolon has also been on the board of Eurotunnel for the last ten years. 'He speaks perfect English and he has convinced me he understands everything about British culture - except cricket, which he thinks goes on too long' Whittaker reckons.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coats acquires Dutch fashion group for Pounds 35m COATS VIYELLA, the textiles and clothing company, has acquired Berghaus International Fashion Group, a Dutch-based distributor of ladies outer wear, for up to Pounds 35m. The deal means Coats has realised its ambition to start clothes distribution in continental Europe. Its clothing activities have so far mainly been UK based. Berghaus is also well established in the former USSR, which Coats left in 1917. 'We've had aspirations in Russia and they know how to deal and how to get paid,' according to Mr Russell Walls, Coats' group finance director. Berghaus, which is unrelated to the UK manufacturer of outdoor equipment, has two small factories but relies on sourcing from eastern Europe and the Far East for about 90 per cent of sales. In 1992 the company made pre-tax and interest profits of Fl 12.7m (Pounds 4.6m) on sales of Fl 218m. The company sells ladies coats and jackets throughout western Europe under the Berghaus, Damo and Polar Bear brands. Its sales network is slightly skewed towards northern Europe. It also supplies ladies outer wear to Marks &amp; Spencer, one of Coats most important clothing clients. Coats raised the acquisition finance through a placing yesterday morning to institutions, arranged by Cazenove and BZW, of 15.2m shares at 218p. Coats' shares fell 3p to 224p. Coats' net borrowings remain quite high, with gearing over 50 per cent at the year end, following the 1991 acquisition of Tootal. All of the Berghaus management have agreed to stay for 'the medium term' and will retain day to day control, Mr Walls said. The purchase price included Fl 22.6m of goodwill and Fl 35.5m of debt. Also included is a maximum of Fl 1.5m if Berghaus achieves certain profit targets.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANS H. KIRST, 74; SUCCESSFUL POST-WAR GERMAN NOVELIST  </P> <P> Hans Hellmut Kirst, one of West Germany's most successful post-war novelists,  died Thursday at the age of 74.  </P> <P> Among his 46 books was the 1962 drama "Night of the Generals," which was made  into a 1967 motion picture starring Peter O'Toole.  </P> <P> Kirst's works, which were translated into 28 languages and sold more than 12  million copies worldwide, focused on military life and modern historical  events, such as the 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> Born in the East Prussian city of Osterode, Kirst left school in 1933 to become  a career soldier with Hitler's army. He served through World War II and was  imprisoned by U.S. occupation forces after the fall of Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> He began his writing career in the late 1940s and gained prominence with his  "08-15" trilogy in the mid-1950s. "08-15" is a military designation for basic  recruits, stemming from the name of a standard pistol issued to German troops  during World War I.  </P></p>

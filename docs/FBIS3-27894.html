"Once the nuclear problem is settled, we will have serious  discussions about bilateral economic cooperation programs," Kim  said in an interview with the SEGYE TIMES marking the fifth  anniversary of the paper's founding.    The President said the two sides may jointly participate in  economic projects as part of bilateral cooperation.    "The administration also plans to allow South Korean  businessmen to visit North Korea and participate in development  projects in the Najin and Sonbong areas in the North," he said.    On the domestic political front, President Kim said  individual ability will be the most important yardstick in  nominating the ruling party's candidates for the 1995 local  elections and the 1996 parliamentary elections.    "The scheduled implementation of full-fledged local autonomy  (next year) and the need for winning a national competitive edge  require legislators to play a new role," he said.    The President, who also heads the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party (DLP), said that his party will nominate as candidates for  next year's gubernatorial and mayoral elections those who can  deal with the changes in the role and functions of local  governments in the age of local autonomy and  internationalization. Kim said that foreign language education  is important in raising the nation's internationalization  standard.</p>

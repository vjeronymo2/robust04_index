			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS THIS THE PASTA OF THE '90S?  </P> <P> In November, a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal announced it had  gained cachet. Last month, Cook's magazine called it "The Pasta of the '90s."  </P> <P> This isn't some boutique farmer's neat new invention. This is rice -- you've  heard of it. Most of the world has been hip to it for some time. In China, the  Rice Measure symbolizes justice, mercy and virtue. In Hong Kong, social workers  ferret out welfare cheats by snooping in applicants' rice bins to check the  quality of rice stocked. And in Los Angeles, risotto is showing up in all the  best places.  </P> <P> But is rice really the pasta of the '90s?  </P> <P> "No way," Valentino's Piero Selvaggio says. "Rice is one-dimensional while  pasta is multi-multi dimensional."  </P> <P> "Oh, no, no, no," says Celestino Drago, owner/chef of Beverly Hills' Celestino.  "I don't think that rice can ever be as popular as pasta in America."  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," Mauro Vincente of Rex and Pazzia declares. "It's more  popular, yes, but nothing can replace pasta."  </P> <P> You can't blame Italians for being defensive about pasta. If F.T. Marinetti had  his way in Italy before World War II, rice would have been the pasta of the  '30s. His "Manifesto of Futurist Cuisine" denounced pasta -- and especially  macaroni -- as an oppressive political element responsible for, among other  things, weakness, pessimism, inactivity and fat-bellied conceit. The only  solution Marinetti saw to this macaroni blight was a total ban on pasta -- with  rice as the sole starch substitute. Needless to say, Mussolini ignored his  plan.  </P> <P> Even American-born chefs think pasta is irreplaceable. "We don't have the same  relationship to rice as we have to pasta," says chef Evan Kleiman of Trattoria  Angeli. "I mean, every kid in America eats spaghetti, right? It's a fun thing  to eat. Rice, on the other hand, has always been this badly treated, boiled  gloppy thing that sat on the side of the plate."  </P> <P> So what is it about rice? Well, where Rice-a-Roni was once the most exotic rice  dish Americans -- Southerners excluded -- had been exposed to, interesting  ethnic rice dishes are now common, at least in large cities. Kleiman admits to  being hooked on the crusty Persian rice dish sometimes called chelo or chilau.  And Toribio Prado, who always cooked at least one token pasta dish at Cha Cha  Cha and Cafe Mambo, decided no pasta dishes were necessary on the rice-heavy  menu at El Mocambo (see review above). What's more, Cook's magazine reports  that American rice consumption has doubled since the late '70s.  </P> <P> And if you thought you were tired of oat bran stories, wait till rice bran  fever hits. Once the stuff was used as cattle and pig feed, but last year  preliminary experiments on test hamsters at the U.S. Department of Agriculture  in Albany, Calif., showed that defatted rice bran not only lowers cholesterol  levels, it's a double-strength cholesterol reducer -- something like new  improved double-strength Tide.  </P></p>

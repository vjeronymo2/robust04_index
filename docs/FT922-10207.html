			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Bush seeks go-ahead for Chile free trade pact: Treaty would be important step to goal of trading bloc covering the Americas PRESIDENT Bush is expected to ask Congress for permission to negotiate a free trade agreement with Chile during a visit to Washington by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin which starts on May 13. The pact would be the first between the US and a South American country and an important stepping stone towards President Bush's goal of a free trade bloc covering the Americas. Politically, it would send a message to the stalled Gatt negotiations that, as with the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the US will not sit and wait for liberalised trade. Congressman Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican and a prime Congressional mover behind the Nafta, said the president was likely to move quickly on Chile while he still had Congressional authorisation for 'fast track' negotiating authority. This allows him to submit a trade agreement to Congress for a yes or no vote with no amendments allowed. His power to use 'fast track' expires on March 1 next year. Because of the rapid pace of its economic liberalisation, Chile falls into a special category of trading partners in Latin America. Other countries in the region, queued up for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) under the Enterprise for Americas Initiative, cannot expect such early consideration until their reforms are further advanced. Hints that the Chilean negotiations would start soon have recently been dropped by US Administration officials. Mr David Mulford, the US treasury under-secretary, last week said the talks should begin within the next two months. Chile has since April last year declared an FTA with the US to be top priority. A free trade agreement with Chile is considered relatively uncontroversial in the US. Unlike Mexico, its total population of 13m is not seen as threatening to US jobs. The economies are highly complementary. Two way trade in 1990 reached Dollars 2.84bn, (Pounds 1.6bn), 18 per cent of Chile's foreign trade. The greatest beneficiaries are expected to be American mining equipment companies which would gain an advantage in the competition for the almost 100 major mining projects being developed in the country. Chile already has a FTA with Mexico, the first bilateral pact in Latin America signed in September last year. Congressman Kolbe said President Bush must give Congress 60 days in which to challenge his intention to negotiate with Chile. Such a pact would be comparatively easy to negotiate and could be submitted for Congressional approval early next year. The Administration has until March 1, 1993, to notify Congress of its intention to use 'fast track'.</p>

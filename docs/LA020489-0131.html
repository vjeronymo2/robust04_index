			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUC PROMISES PUBLIC ROLE IN SDG&amp;E REVIEW  </P> <P> A state Public Utilities Commission official promised Friday to hold "as many  public participation hearings as possible" in San Diego during the agency's  upcoming review of Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego  Gas &amp; Electric.  </P> <P> PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn Carew said copies of "testimony, exhibits and  other documents" generated by the PUC review will be stored and available for  public viewing at the downtown branch of the San Diego Public Library.  </P> <P> During a lengthy pre-hearing session Friday in San Diego, Carew also ordered  SDG&amp;E and Edison to describe the "nature and extent" of their business  dealings since the merger was announced in November. Carew ordered utility  lawyers to detail the role that Edison executives have played "in SDG&amp;E's  daily operations and management decision-making."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaint by UCAN  </P> <P> Carew's order followed a complaint by San Diego-based Utility Consumers Action  Network that SDG&amp;E and Rosemead-based Edison have ignored state regulations  that prohibit the transfer of proprietary information.  </P> <P> Joseph Malkin, SCE's Los Angeles-based attorney, argued that the "great deal"  of information exchanged so far was "essential . . . to prepare for this (PUC)  proceeding. . . . There is no 'de facto' control of SDG&amp;E by Edison."  </P> <P> Carew on Friday also refused to adopt Edison's proposed hearing schedule. That  "expedited" schedule suggested that the PUC's extensive review be completed by  Dec. 27. Carew, who will dictate a schedule during an upcoming pre-hearing in  San Diego, complained that Edison's proposed schedule left "little time" for  her to write a decision that the full PUC would use to approve, amend or reject  the proposed merger.  </P> <P> Edison's "unusually ambitious" schedule was driven by the desire to complete  the proposed merger before a March 31, 1990, "drop dead date" that was included  in the merger agreement, Malkin said.  </P> <P> Malkin also complained that a lengthier hearing schedule could jeopardize the  merger "because there's more chance for some external event to take place that  (would change) the value of the deal."  </P> <P> However, Deputy City Atty. William Shaffran contended that the March 31, 1990,  deadline "should have no effect whatsoever" on the PUC's review.  </P> <P> In a brief speech during the session, Mayor Maureen O'Connor demanded that the  PUC "level the playing field by strictly limiting and supervising the  expenditures made by all parties in this takeover effort." O'Connor in recent  weeks has attacked Edison as a free-spending company that expects to spend $16  million to prove its case to the PUC.  </P> <P> O'Connor also asked the PUC for an "accounting" of discussions between  regulators and utility executives involved in the merger.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Carew refused to immediately institute "sunshine" rules  that would severely restrict the lobbying of PUC officials. Instead, she  ordered parties to the review to study proposed regulations that are expected  to be adopted in 30 days.  </P> <P> The PUC took the unusual step of bringing two "public advisers" to the meeting,  largely because O'Connor had invited San Diegans to attend the meeting. The  advisers counseled a handful of San Diegans on the complexities of the upcoming  review. Pre-hearing sessions such as Friday's meeting in San Diego generally  are attended only by attorneys, utility representatives and consumer group  leaders.  </P> <P> The public advisers will return to San Diego on Thursday and Friday to conduct  workshops that will explain the public's role in the decidedly complex review.  </P></p>

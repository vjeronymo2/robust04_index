			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Separate gables MY WIFE and I own our house with no outstanding mortgage. I left the home about 18 months ago and have lived in rented accommodation ever since. The house is on the market but, in present circumstances, it might well be some time before a sale is completed. When this is done, will this house be counted as my 'main' home for CGT purposes? I have not notified the inspector of taxes of my change of address, but have arrangements to ensure that all mail addressed to that house is forwarded to me. The problem is significant in that we bought the house in 1976. The sale price should be about five times our purchase cost, and the capital gain in excess of Pounds 100,000. All the proceeds will be needed to establish my wife and I in two separate homes. Presumably, the cost can be indexed, but how does one establish the value in March 1982? When I fill in my tax return this year, is it mandatory that I complete the 'change of address' panel, where the wording is: 'If you no longer live at the address shown on the front of this form, give your current address'? You must not conceal your separation from your tax inspector - you would be risking civil and possibly criminal penalties. Ask him for the free pamphlet CGT4 (Owner-occupied house): you will see from this that there should be no CGT for you to pay on the sale of the house, provided that the sale contract is made by the third anniversary of the day you moved out of it in 1991. If it does prove necessary to establish the market value of the house as at March 31 1982 (if the sale contract is not made until more then three years after you moved out, for example), your estate agent and solicitor will be able to assist in negotiations with the district valuer. The cost of ascertaining the March 31 1982 value would be deductible in calculating the chargeable gain (by virtue of section 38(2)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

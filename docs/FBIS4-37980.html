			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni leader  'Ali Salim al-Bid spoke Sunday with the heads of state of Saudi  Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Syria to discuss the  conflict in Yemen, Aden television said.    Al-Bid contacted Saudi King Fahd, Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan of the UAE and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad by  telephone as northern forces launched a new intensive  bombardment of this southern stronghold.    He told them of "the persistence of the military regime in  Sanaa" in continuing the war, and its "repeated violations of UN  Security Council Resolution 924 which called for an immediate  ceasefire," the television said.    Fighting raged Sunday in the suburbs of Aden, following the  collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the  two-month-old civil war.    The Arab leaders expressed concern at continued fighting and  called for an immediate truce, the television reported.    War broke out on May 5 between al-Bid's southern forces and  those of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, ending four years of  uneasy unity since former conservative, tribal North Yemen  merged with the Marxist South.</p>

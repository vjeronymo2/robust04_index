			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle's foot-stamping, emotional response to the Tower  defeat, accusing the Democrats in the Senate of "using McCarthyite mud-slinging  tactics" against Tower as part of a deliberate campaign to undermine the  presidency (Part I, March 11) seems an odd route for him to take to screech at  the 53 senators who voted against Tower's confirmation.  </P> <P> Given Quayle's ultra-conservative views and his family's past affiliation with  the John Birch Society, it would not be far-fetched to assume that Quayle would  have stood up to be counted as one of Joe McCarthy's staunchest supporters.  </P> <P> ARTHUR LEWIS  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Asset sale lifts North Broken Hill Peko Lower iron ore and uranium prices and increased expenditure meant that North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and resources group, reported a fall in profits before tax and abnormals to ADollars 201.1m (USDollars 150m), ADollars 11.1m less than in the previous year. However, due to a ADollars 65.2m abnormal surplus from the sale of non-core businesses and investments, profits after tax and abnormals were up ADollars 52.9m to ADollars 185.3m. Total sales were ADollars 1.13bn, compared with ADollars 1.51bn. Operating profits from the iron ore business fell to ADollars 129.1m from ADollars 136.1m; uranium was down to ADollars 46.1m from ADollars 75m; and the equipment business fell to ADollars 29.8m against ADollars 30.5m.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: US bonds One of the big fears in the US Treasury bond market after the Salomon Brothers' debacle was that the authorities would become over-zealous in their approach to regulation. Instead, the Treasury appears to have decided to let market forces mete out their own punishment on any dealer rash enough to try a bit of manipulation. Its mere threat to counter any squeeze by un-scheduled sales of additional paper should render attempts by big operators to corner a particular issue too risky. The Treasury's almost insatiable demand for funds gives it the muscle to intervene massively in the bond market if it wishes. Once the new plan is up and running, traders should become less worried about being caught in a squeeze after selling short. The result should be a more liquid market and one where deals are done at genuine prices. Admittedly, this assumes that the authorities are now better placed to detect a squeeze; they were dilatory in latching on to last May's effort, which eventually proved Salomon's undoing. The downside is the likelihood of greater short-term price fluctuation, while government bond dealing could become less profitable for the bigger houses. Nor can the Treasury expect to raise much money through its intervention issues. At first sight, the new plan looks as though it could be the first step down a road towards UK-style tap issues which would give the Treasury flexibility to borrow cheaply at times of strong investor demand. But the US Treasury's requirements are too large for this, and regular but unpredictable issuance outside the auctions could undermine the futures market which investors use to hedge a whole spectrum of issues. The new weapon will have to be used sparingly and essentially punitively. But that, after all, is the purpose for which it is intended.</p>

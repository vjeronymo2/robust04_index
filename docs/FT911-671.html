			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Private TV and radio for Malta Malta is to have private radio and television broadcasting after a gap of 16 years under legislation approved by parliament this week, writes Godfrey Grima in Valletta. The legislation sanctions the creation of 10 radio stations, a television cable operation and several non-profit-making community radios. Radio and television stations were nationalised by the former Socialist premier, Mr Dom Mintoff, in 1975. Broadcasting in Malta has become increasingly politicised.</p>

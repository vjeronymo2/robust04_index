			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring gives appetising boost to AG Barr profit AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company with brands including Irn-Bru and Tizer, reaped the benefits of the 1991 restructuring of its production and distribution arrangements, as profits more than doubled in the half-year to April 25. At the pre-tax level, they rose from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 2.64m, though Mr Robin Barr, chairman, said that last time's total was depressed. The profits advance was struck on turnover only 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 41.1m) and after interest payable slightly down at Pounds 624,000 (Pounds 713,000). Mr Barr said that debt was cut from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.5m at the end of the half. Mr Barr said that sales of the company's brands, which account for a little more than 75 per cent of total output, rose 5 per cent in the half. This was helped, especially in the case of Irn-Bru, by advertising. He said he wanted to increase awareness and sales further in the south of England. In Scotland Irn-Bru already outsells Pepsi. However sales of own-label products, mostly gained in the acquisition of Mandora St Clements from Mansfield Brewery,were down 3 per cent. The reduction in the cost base was mostly achieved by the closure last year of the Evesham factory, which the company has estimated would save about Pounds 1.5m a year. About 120 jobs were lost. As a result Mr Barr reckons that current levels of profitability are sustainable, especially if the important holiday months of July and August have fine weather. Earnings leapt to 9.09p (4.37p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.75p (1.0833), a rise of 62 per cent.</p>

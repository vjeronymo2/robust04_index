			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Payments for civil money penalties would be due 15 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance is verified, if a hearing decision upholding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the imposition of the penalty had been rendered before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance had been verified, or the 60-day period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting a hearing has expired and the facility has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested a hearing or has waived its right to a hearing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A hearing decision upholding the imposition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty if compliance was achieved before the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The effective date of termination if compliance has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been achieved by that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, &sect;431.153 (Evidentiary hearing) does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify the number of days a facility has to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. We proposed amending &sect;431.153 to add a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b) which specifies that a NF or ICF/MR must file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a request for hearing within 60 days of receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of denial, termination, nonrenewal, or imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a civil money penalty or other remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the way other civil money penalties are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered, as provided in section 1128A(f) of the Act, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the amount of any penalty, when determined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State to the facility against whom the penalty has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed. Interest would be assessed on the unpaid balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the penalty beginning on the due date. We proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rate of interest to be assessed on the unpaid balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be negotiable and for that reason might vary on a case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by case basis. Funds collected by HCFA or the State as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of a civil money penalty would be returned to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare Trust Fund or to the State, respectively. Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties collected from dually participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State in proportion commensurate with the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportions of the number of Medicare and Medicaid beds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually in use at the facility at the time the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives notice of the imposition of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty. Under section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected by a Medicaid State agency must be put into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common fund to be applied to the protection of the health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property of residents of any NF that the State or HCFA finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficient, including payment for the cost of relocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oversight of the collection and use of funds will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed through HCFA's State agency evaluation program now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

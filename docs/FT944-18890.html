			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Labour attacks insurance tax The Labour party yesterday extended its attack on the government's recent tax increases by claiming that the tax on insurance premiums which comes into effect today will make it harder for the public to fight crime, James Blitz writes. Senior party figures said the tax would add Pounds 13.90 to the annual average expenditure of British households. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the 2.5 per cent tax on household and car insurance, introduced in the last Budget, was another example of how the Tories had broken their pledge not to raise taxation. She said the tax would 'hit hardest at those living in high crime areas, often the most disadvantaged parts of the country'. However, she refused to give a commitment that Labour would abolish the tax if it came into government. Ms Harman signalled yesterday that Labour would try to highlight the impact of the Conservative party's taxation policy by insisting that the net effect of the government's last two Budgets had been to add 7p in the pound to the basic rate of income tax. She believed that the government might try to soften the impact of its indirect taxes - including value added tax on fuel and reductions in mortgage interest relief - by cutting direct taxation before the election. 'If that happens, we will respond by looking at how much that 7p-in-the-pound bill has been reduced,' she said.</p>

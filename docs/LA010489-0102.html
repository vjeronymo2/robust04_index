			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRE DESTROYS RESTAURANT IN FULLERTON  </P> <P> Fire gutted a popular restaurant in downtown Fullerton early Tuesday, prompting  officials to close the landmark building housing the business, a city  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Tony's Melody Inn at 106 S. Harbor Blvd. was destroyed and half of its  next-door neighbor, Furniture Concepts, burned, spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said.  The two other businesses in the building escaped damage.  </P> <P> "The actual damage has not been determined but is expected to exceed $1  million," Palmer said.  </P> <P> She said the two-story building, which was built in the early 1900s, will be  demolished because "the fire removed the structural support for the masonry  walls."  </P> <P> The fire started in the common attic of the two businesses and was discovered  by a Fullerton Fire Department engine company that was returning from a medical  aid call about 11:58 p.m. Monday, Palmer said. It took 36 firefighters from the  Fullerton, Buena Park and Anaheim departments until 2:30 a.m. to control the  blaze, she said.  </P> <P> The city's chief building official deemed the building unsafe for entry, which  meant fire officials could not enter the building to determine the cause of the  blaze, Palmer said.  </P> <P> Fire Marshal Mark Martin said debris will have to be removed before  firefighters can safely enter the building. At the earliest, removal will occur  Thursday.  </P> <P> The northbound curb lane in the 100 block of South Harbor Boulevard was closed  as a result of the damage, Palmer said. The lane may be reopened this  afternoon.  </P> <P> The Melody Inn, which started in the 1940s as a nightclub, was refurbished a  few years ago when Tony Florentine acquired ownership and reopened it as a  restaurant and cocktail lounge. Neither he nor Pierre Nicolas, owner of the  landmark building, could be reached for comment.  </P></p>

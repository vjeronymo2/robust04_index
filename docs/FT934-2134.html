			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Southern Electric pay-out surges Southern Electric is lifting its interim distribution to shareholders by 19.7 per cent. The Maidenhead-based utility, which serves central southern England, also indicated yesterday that the full year increase would be in the 12 per cent to 14 per cent range, in line with analysts' forecasts. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 were Pounds 89.2m. Last year's outcome for the same period was Pounds 15.3m, but since then, Southern has altered its accounting to reflect changes in the timing of payments under the electricity industry's new contracts with British Coal. On a comparable basis, last year's result would have been Pounds 77m, suggesting a profit increase of some 16 per cent. Turnover for the six months amounted to Pounds 764.9m, against Pounds 760.6m. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, pointed to three reasons behind the profits rise: Subsidiaries and associated companies had performed better, more than doubling their contribution. The contracting business transformed a Pounds 600,000 loss into a Pounds 1.7m profit. The retailing side reduced its share of the losses of a joint venture with Eastern and Midlands Elec-tricity from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 600,000. Interest charges were lower thanks to the repayment of Pounds 184m of government debt. Gearing has fallen from 17 per cent to 0.3 per cent. Costs are still coming down. Controllable costs fell by 3.5 per cent during the period. Manning levels in the electricity business are expected to fall from 5,276 at the beginning of this year to about 4,000 by 1995-96. The interim dividend is 6.7p, against 5.6p, payable from earnings of 24.8p per share. Mr John Deane, finance director, said Southern was not aiming to rebalance its dividend split like some other regional electricity companies. COMMENT Although Southern did not match the highest dividend increases produced by the recs this season, the market liked the result and pushed the shares up 7p to 679p. At this level they show a prospective yield of just under 4 per cent, using Mr Deane's indications, putting the group at the low end of the sector. Southern's drive against costs is yielding results, and the low level of gearing is underpinning progress on the financial side. With indications that housebuilding in its region is picking up, the potential looks good, particularly if progress can be maintained in the contracting and retail businesses.</p>

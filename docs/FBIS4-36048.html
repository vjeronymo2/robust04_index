			<p>BFN     [Text] An additional Katyusha volley was fired at the  western Galilee a short time ago. Menahem Horowitz, our  correspondent in the north, updates us:    [Horowitz] Good evening, about half an hour ago, explosions  were heard once again in the western Galilee. Katyushas were  fired from Lebanon at the Galilee and the security zone in south  Lebanon. In response, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South  Lebanese Army] artillery fired at terrorist positions in south  Lebanon. IDF guns have shelled terrorist targets there  intermittently throughout the day. Many northern border  inhabitants are spending the night in shelters and are  anticipating a very tense night.</p>

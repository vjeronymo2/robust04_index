			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: SINGING PRAISES OF COSMETICS  </P> <P> Folk singer Judy Collins, who had big hits with her recordings of "Both Sides  Now" and "Send In the Clowns," is looking for another hit with her new line of  cosmetics. Called Judy Collins Harmonics, they're what the singer calls a  "natural alternative to cosmetic surgery." She'll debut her new venture on  Financial News Network's "Telshop" video-shopping service from February through  April.  </P> <P> A Name With a Nice Ring  </P> <P> We ran into jewelry designer Lee Brevard, who said he's just finished an  assignment for Farrah Fawcett. "She wanted a cross, something designed  especially for her. She didn't ask for anything specific, but she gave me a  sapphire ring that she hoped I could use and another ring that she said I could  perhaps melt down." Brevard's final design is of silver and gold with Fawcett's  original green sapphire in the center and five star sapphires in different  colors surrounding it. All the edges are rounded and smooth, Brevard says, and  it's a combination of shiny and matte finishes. But Brevard's favorite jewel is  Fawcett herself. "She's a wonderful, kind, intelligent and patient person," he  said. And she had to be, because Brevard was so busy, he was four months late  with her cross.  </P> <P> Eyes in L.A.  </P> <P> Sheena Easton is one of many who have bought "the silver Bombay," the hot new  spec shape at L.A. Eyeworks. The shop's Lou Gaez tells us Easton was in for the  semi-rectangular aluminum frame, and she turned it into her own signature style  by ordering mirrored lenses. "She really has a special knack," Gaez says.  Rocker Brad X (his last name is Xavier), ordered "Jimmy Jacks with clips," a  round, John Lennon style of sunglasses with clip-on sunglasses attached, so he  gets a double dose of protection. And Marlee Matlin's choice was "brown  Priscilla frames," which Gaez says are "very classy and sophisticated."  </P> <P> A Dressy Showcase  </P> <P> You thought Melanie Griffith looked great at the Golden Globe Awards in her  off-the-shoulder, black chiffon dress? We did too. So we phoned around and  found that the dress is by Giorgio Armani, that it is from the designer's  spring-summer collection and that it was purchased by Griffith at the Armani  shop in New York. Furthermore, an Armani representative tells us, Griffith  chose that dress because the low neckline would be best for showing off the new  diamond necklace she had just gotten from her past and future husband, Don  Johnson. She also wore the necklace at the awards.  </P> <P> A Wonderful Model  </P> <P> The recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies in New York brought out an  impressive number of music greats, including Stevie Wonder. He attended the  event, as an honored guest, in a Go-Silk cream silk suit and black silk  T-shirt, all purchased at Fred Segal on Melrose just days before. Listen hears  that bandleader Paul Shaffer, who was also at the music tributes, came back  from New York and into Fred Segal to buy a few Go-Silk shirts for his nightly  appearances on "Late Night With David Letterman."  </P> <P> Real Women Getting Ahead  </P> <P> The long line of Breck Girls who, since 1946, have been the heart of the  shampoo company's ad campaigns, has included Christie Brinkley, Jaclyn Smith,  Cybill Shepherd, Brooke Shields, Cheryl Tiegs and Kim Basinger. But last year  the Breck Girl became a Breck Woman, due to what a company spokeswoman calls "a  shift in marketing." Part of that shift includes a new focus "not on fashion  models, but on real women." So this year, candidates for the title will be  chosen by a TV audience, not by the company executives. The candidates will all  appear on ABC-TV's "Home Show" starting Monday. On Thursday, viewers will be  asked to choose the winner via a special phone-in number. And next Friday, the  winner will be announced. That's democracy in action -- except that real women  often have to work and can't watch noontime TV.  </P></p>

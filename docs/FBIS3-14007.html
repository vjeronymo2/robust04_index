			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kashmir: Islamic Consensus Not With </F> Pakistan"]    [Text] Geneva, 24 February (NPT) -- Mr. Salman Khursheed,  India's minister of external affairs, claims that the Islamic  Conference countries understand India's stand on Kashmir, and  that not all of its member nations are expected to vote in  support of Pakistan.    Although Pakistan is trying to dye the Kashmir issue in  Islamic colors, Mr. Khursheed was successful in getting the  attention of the secretary general of the Conference by pointing  out that after Indonesia, India has the largest Muslim  population in the world, and that the votes of the Conference  members in support of this resolution will affect the Indian  Muslims.    India is discussing three concerns with members of the Human  Rights Commission. One is that this controversial resolution  will increase terrorism in Kashmir and would curb the progress  of human rights protection efforts. The second is that voting in  support or remaining absent during the vote will affect  bilateral relations. Third, support of this resolution will  directly affect India-Pakistan relations.    Mr. Khursheed met with representatives of several countries  over the last three days and said that not participating in  voting would be against the basic principles of human rights and  would increase Pakistan's role in terrorism.    He said that the proposed resolution is being viewed in the  framework of human rights in different parts of the world.    Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the opposition leader in the Lok  Sabha who had also gone to take part in the conference, has  insisted that member nations not be absent during the Pakistan  resolution vote. He said that all nations friendly to India  should vote against the resolution.    He told newsmen that the question was not one of human  rights  violations in Kashmir, but of Pakistan's support for terrorism  in Kashmir, and that every country should oppose this.  *</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: How to find your dream boat - Catherine Stott provides a guide to the pick of holidays afloat / Cruising CRUISING IS the one kind of travel that has continued to get better. It has become more glamorous and more affordable. Long gone is its image as the winter pastime of the geriatric rich. The about-turn came in the 1980s with the launch of a new generation of ships which, helped by strong marketing, were addressed to quite a different audience. Now, first-time cruisers are more likely to be young and fun-loving, often with accompanying children, than rich and old. Gone (almost) are the gruesome old rust-buckets with shared facilities, shoe-box cabins and no air-conditioning. Here to stay are, at one end of the scale, floating resorts of great luxury and, at the other, elitist 'boutique cruisers' carrying around 200 passengers prepared to pay for the best. Initially, many people remain cruise-resistant. The most common worries are feeling restricted, sea-sickness, and being trapped in a holiday camp atmosphere. The short answers are that if you tend to feel shut in, you will choose one of the larger ships. Sea-sickness is rarely a problem, since all cruise ships have high-tech stabilisers designed to reduce roll. If you are prone to it, acu-pressure wrist-bands and the little patches worn on the neck prevent most bouts. And all ships' hospitals offer injections to stop it. As for the on-board atmosphere, that depends on the style of ship you choose  -but 80 per cent of people elect to go for another cruise once they have tried it. There is plenty of choice: there were 120 ships world-wide in 1985; next year, there will be 175. Cruising offers a touch of romance - besides most places look better from the sea. It allows less intrepid travellers to reach parts of the globe they would not otherwise contemplate, in comfort and safety. I sailed around India recently with several hundred truly timid people who had the journey of their lives, mostly using the ship as a hotel in different ports - including Rangoon which is still difficult to visit in any other way. And you really do get what you pay for, with no hidden charges. All transport, meals and entertainment will have been settled in advance. Only (optional) shore excursions, drinks at duty-free prices and tips are extra. This need not be a worry: all ships set out reasonable guidelines on how much to give, and to whom. On an average cruise, it would work out at about Pounds 3 a person per day. As a first-time cruiser, how do you begin to choose? Answer: set yourself an honest quiz to find out what you want and what you would hate. The Passenger Shipping Assocation says it receives only 35 complaints a year out of 200,000 cruisers and an equal number of ferry passengers. 'Complaints are invariably from people who have chosen the wrong ship and are expecting more than they have paid for,' says director Ken Page. Next, decide when and where you want to go. Only the Caribbean and south Pacific are year-round destinations (although the Caribbean is prohibitively expensive from December to April if you stay in a hotel, it is cheaper to cruise there in that period because, curiously, the peak season for Caribbean cruising is July and August when the weather is far more humid). Alaska, the present 'in' destination, is navigable only between June and early September - prime months, too, for the Baltic. The Mediterranean season runs from late March to early November in the brochures, but seasoned sun-seekers will know that although prices may be seductively low at both ends, the weather can be blustery and the waters turbulent at these times. In the northern hemisphere winter - their summer - South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand have the best cruising weather. And south-east Asia, an increasingly popular area, is best from October to March although there can be small rains (as distinct from full-blown monsoons) in December and January in certain areas. Closer to Britain, the cheaper traditional winter destinations are the Atlantic islands (Madeira, Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote), and south to The Gambia and Senegal. These well-trodden paths may not appeal to more discerning travellers, however. Sensible first-time cruisers in Britain will acquire a big selection of brochures from a travel agent displaying a window sticker saying 'PSARA'. This indicates it has staff trained to advise on cruising; there are 1,000 such agents. Now it is time to decide on your holiday prioritiies. Cruising tends to be gregarious. If you are a loner, or a self-sufficient couple, it will not work unless you can afford the most expensive and smallest possible ship where the on-board entertainment is negligible and the personal space huge. Should you regard yourself as a swinger or raver, choose a big, new vessel. Paradoxically, the largest ships often have the most compact cabins - cleverly-planned modules that are quite adequate for those who regard their accommodation as no more than a place in which to sleep before the next bout of swinging and raving. If the dimensions of cabins are not given in the brochure, ring the cruise company and ask. Older ships tend to have a wider range of accommodation. Prices for newer liners vary according to whether there is a view, a bath as well as a shower and, increasingly, a veranda. Next: how many ports do you want to visit? Remember that most shore excursions leave the ship at 8am; if you were late to bed, this might not be convenient. Cunard has two ships, one in the Caribbean, the other in the Mediterranean, which offer a different port each day but most passengers seem to find one every two days about right. Seventy-five per cent of the world's cruisers are American. Should you prefer to sail mostly with Britons, it is easy to book on ships leaving and returning to UK ports. This market has grown by 1,500 annually for the past five years - an increase that has led P &amp; O, which already has two ships sailing world-wide from Southampton to announce plans for a new, Pounds 200m liner cruising from the UK in 1995. Cruising for under Pounds 1,200. This category has the most choice. For excellent Italian food and a cheerful European atmosphere, the Costa Classica is new, sparkling and good value. You can choose from two Caribbean routes out of Miami, with a starting price of Pounds 849 for 15 nights (seven in Miami or Orlando) including the return flight from Britain. The Crown Princess and Regal Princess, mega-cruisers from Princess Cruises (part of P &amp; O), offer nine nights in the Caribbean from Pounds 895. The Song of America, operated by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, has an interesting itinerary from Los Angeles south to Mexico, including return flight, from Pounds 1,175. The QE2, with its vast range of accommodation across a large price range, has cruises from two to 100 days - good food in the top classes, 60 things to do each day. The Norway, once the France, is now Norwegian Cruise Lines' flagship. Taking 2,300 passengers weekly round the Caribbean, it is still very stylish, with glassed-in decks of shops and cafes. Its range of cabins starts at Pounds 995 a person for a nine-night holiday out of Miami. Cruises over Pounds 1,800. The Crystal Harmony is a new, luxurious ship from Crystal Cruises which offers opulence at half the price of some rivals. There is a choice of restaurants, the biggest pool afloat, marble-lined lifts and spacious cabins. A 13-day cruise from Tilbury costs from Pounds 2,424. Equally good value on the large-and-luxurious circuit is the Royal Princess, which has no inside cabins and an unusually high proportion of full bathrooms and verandas. Other ships in this category with high reputations are the Royal Viking Sun, voted consistently as the world's No 1 cruise ship; all the ships of the Holland America Line; and Cunard's Sagafjord and Vistafjord, which have an extremely loyal following. Cruises over Pounds 3,000. The 'boutique cruisers' take around 200 passengers in surroundings of all-inclusive splendour. These luxury ships have such shallow drafts that they can enter bays, harbours and rivers inaccessible to most others. They offer virtually no structured entertainment; the passengers mostly are rich. Vessels include Cunard's Sea Goddess I and II, the Seabourn Pride and Seabourn Spirit, the Royal Viking Queen and the Song of Flower. Work on a budget of around Pounds 500 a person per day and you will not be far out.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The time for talk is over: Boris Yeltsin must seize the initiative if he is to translatehis referendum win into action As the referendum returns are announced across Russia, it is clear that President Boris Yeltsin has carved out some space for action - but no more than that. To win a vote of trust and of support for his economic and social programme from a turnout of more than 60 per cent is not bad in any democratic state. Yeltsin's opponents, such as General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, who argued yesterday that the president's policies were 'based on a minority', are prisoners of a prevalent Soviet attitude which sees anything less than formal unanimity as a defeat. Was the victory fairly won? Not by western standards. The television and radio were overwhelmingly biased towards the president and his camp. Though opponents were heard, it was via 'sound bites' on news programmes. Yeltsin, benefiting from the covert advice of Saatchi and Saatchi and Gallup, was presented as both strong and lovable, a Russian muzhik who was also a statesman. In his confidential report on how Yeltsin was perceived, Mr Gordon Heald, Gallup's managing director, wrote that 'time and again, (people) stressed his muzhestvennost, or his manly qualities. . . . He was seen to be strong, brave, frank, straightforward and, most important, resolute. . . . We believe this should be very much emphasised in the campaign . . .' It was. The most popular poster had the slogan: 'A strong president for a strong Russia'. On the TV talk shows, it was Yeltsin's people who tended to be over-represented, Yeltsin's tours and speeches which were highlighted. The reason is not just that the top management of the two national channels, Central and Russian TV, are political appointees of the president. It is also that most producers and news presenters are liberal - like those in the media everywhere usually are - and have not yet developed an objective style. Many see the problem clearly enough, but regard their duty as confirming democratic and market change through Yeltsin's leadership rather than as upholding abstract standards of fairness. Thus when Mr Nikolai Pavlov, a leader of the nationalist-communist National Salvation Front, said yesterday that 'the subservient mass media will start a hysterical cry about massive support for the president', he had part of a point. Nobody, however, is going to pursue that with much vigour. The question now is: what is to be done? In this area, the initiative is very much Yeltsin's. He has been clear about what he intends to do. He usually is. He was clear on March 20 that he intended to introduce presidential rule; it was instead bartered away within the Congress of People's Deputies for Sunday's referendum. Some observers believe Yeltsin's proclivity for compromise will again reassert itself. However, most - and this seems to include most Russians - expect his courage to assert itself, and for him to push through some hard decisions. In his eve-of-referendum speech, Yeltsin said his first priority would be to usher in a new constitution, the main principles of which have already been published. It comprises a 'strong' presidential republic in which the president is both head of state and chief executive, with the rights of appointment and dismissal of all key officials - only some of which would need parliamentary approval. The parliament itself would be changed from the present Soviet structure of Congress and Supreme Soviet to a bicameral body, with an upper Council of the Federation elected from the republics and regions, and a lower State Duma of Deputies elected on an equal territorial basis across Russia. Yeltsin must get this through the existing Congress - and cannot. He must therefore find some way - either by decree, and/or by agreeing it with the heads of the republics and regions - of putting the constitution in place while observing (as he said in his pre-poll speech) the 'principles of constitutionality', if not the details of the constitution itself. This is the key battleground. His opponents have the advantage of being able to lean on the constitution to stop him. He has the drawback of having to act unlawfully. To get the support of the regional and republican leaders for the constitutional and economic changes he proposes, Yeltsin must give them something - probably in the form of a new federal treaty which would allow the regions to enjoy a different relationship with the centre. In effect, each one would make a separate treaty with the central government, producing more of a confederation than a federation. This would probably lead to endless trouble in the future, but it is likely to be the price he must pay. Finally, he has said he will act decisively on the economy, proposing decrees on limiting credit, on providing a legal basis for private property and on 'safeguarding Russia's interests' in relations with the other former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. All of this will provoke the opposition of parliament, which he must override if he is to prevail. It is this action which will determine whether Russia can at last capitalise on the reforms of the past 15 months by constructing the skeleton of a financial, monetary and fiscal system robust enough to allow the development of a real private sector, and convincing enough to allow the west to shell out the billions it has promised. A broad economic strategy is ready - though the government is now less united than it was last year, and the reformers more boxed in by the so-called 'industrialists', such as Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. The plan would bring real pain in some areas, especially for the enterprises, which have escaped relatively lightly until now, but it carries the possibility of making 1993 the year in which reform was consolidated. The battle against inflation is at the core of the strategy. Inflation has eased to about 15 per cent a month, but it is far from under control. It continues to wipe out savings, deprive enterprises of the ability to plan, keep foreign investment at bay and render the dollar a more attractive store of value than the rouble. To this end, the growth in central bank credits - seen as the basic engine of inflation - will be scaled back to 30 per cent in the current quarter, and to 15 per cent in the next two, from a high of about 70 per cent in the past year. This would mean figures which will hurt those, including the government, which have been anaesthetised to the financial crisis by cheap credits. The advances made by the central bank to cover the budget deficit will be cut to about Rb1,300bn this quarter, and cut further in the next two. Credits to the former Soviet states - some almost completely dependent on them - will be pulled back to about Rb200bn this quarter, and to Rb150bn each in the next two. Enterprises, including agriculture, will get a total of Rb1,500bn this quarter, less in the next two. These figures spell, respectively, harsh cuts in government spending; the possible collapse of state budgets in the neighbouring republics; and bankruptcies and unemployment in industries. It would be very difficult to retain political and social stability if they are implemented; but it would be very difficult to control inflation and benefit from international assistance if they are not. In this scenario, foreign assistance on the Dollars 44bn scale proposed by leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo earlier this month is essential. It would fund enterprises, the privatisation process and above all social security and unemployment benefit with dollars. Since the dollars would be used by the government to buy existing roubles, there would be no inflationary effect. Thus the strategy depends crucially on G7 commitment and approval - bringing the west into the reform process in a more committed and interventionist way than before. This is a challenging programme indeed. It is another big chapter in the Russian revolution which rattles on. Yeltsin did not run an impressive campaign, yet the active majority of his fellow countrymen and women felt that they could trust him and that they wanted him to carry on with his reforms. They did not feel the need to see other candidates for the presidency, but they do want a different parliament. This does not give Yeltsin the legal right to press ahead, but it gives him a popular base, for a time.</p>

To prepare for the session, some 120  deputies from Beijing and Tianjin began a 10-day inspection tour  of Beijing Municipality on 19 January. During their inspection  tour, the deputies gave their views and made many suggestions on  various aspects of Beijing's urban construction, economic  development, and social life.    The Beijing municipal government held a forum on 28 January,  where principal municipal leaders heard the deputies' views and  suggestions.    Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee  Environmental Protection Committee, spoke about Beijing's urban  plans and environmental protection. He said: Beijing is  China's capital; it is also suffering from a water shortage. In  drawing up urban industrial development plans, anything that  affects water resources and the air should be restricted, not  only in the city proper but also in surburban districts and  counties. After more than a decade of readjustment, enterprises  with serious pollution problems have been moved out of the city.  The municipal government has also adopted measures to reduce  pollution, such as developing centralized heating and natural  gas supply systems. However, there are still a few factories  producing pollution in the city proper.    Qu Geping pointed out that the NPC is considering revising  relevant laws and regulations to ban the use of raw coal, which  produces heavy pollutants. He urged the municipality to take  the lead in this regard.    Many deputies also spoke about commodity prices, an issue of  great concern to ordinary Chinese citizens. Qin Zhongda, member  of the NPC Standing Committee, said: Municipal leaders have  been personally attending to work related to the supply of  grain, edible oil, and other foodstuff. Departments responsible  for commodity prices have also done a tremendous amount of work.  With the approaching of the Spring Festival, a traditional  Chinese holiday, the government has indicated that prices will  be controlled during the holiday season. What will happen after  the holiday season? He expressed confidence in the government  to do a good job in this regard, but he also urged it to keep  the size of price increases under control for a protracted  period.    Other deputies also gave their views on issues of science  and  technology, education, and reduction of the peasants' burden.    At the forum, Chen Xitong, responsible person of the  municipal government, thanked the deputies for giving their  views and making suggestions. In response to the questions  raised and criticism made by the deputies, he said: The  municipal government will seriously study solutions and will see  to it that everyone of the questions is answered. Taking the  questions raised by the deputies seriously in order to resolve  them is an important expression of socialist democracy.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (12): Toeing the line - Profile of Transfesa BUT FOR the foresight and persistence of the Spanish distribution group Transfesa, Spain would find it difficult to integrate its railfreight industry with its European partners. Its trade with the rest of the Community, especially exports of fresh fruit, would be suffering. Through an accident of history Spain and its Iberian neighbour Portugal have a rail gauge which is 23cm wider than that in France and the rest of the EC. For years it meant long delays at the Franco-Spanish border points while goods were unloaded from one train and re-loaded into another. It put the shelf-life of perishable goods at risk and escalated the handling costs of all products. Transfesa is a specialist in railfreight transport. When it started international operations in 1951 it recognised the need to streamline procedures at the border. Its engineers identified the need for a facility to quickly change the axles on the rolling stock. Given the Spanish government's massive support for Spain's export industry, it is surprising how disinterested the Spanish Railways, RENFE, was in the proposal. So was French Railways, SNCF. Neither of them thought the idea could work. But Transfesa pressed ahead and invested Pta6.3m (Dollars 67,000) erecting two axle changing depots at the Franco-Spanish frontier stations at Hendaye (opened in 1950) and Cervere (opened 1951) and providing ancillary equipment. The system entails lifting the wagons by crane and is very labour intensive. The depots have an axle changing capacity of 300,000 two-axle wagons a year and at the moment are changing axles on 140,000 wagons a year. Last year a new patented automatic system whereby the axles are lifted and lowered hydraulically in a pit was introduced to the Hendaye depot. With the new system each wagon's axles can be changed in four minutes, and four wagons can be changed at once, in eight minutes. A train of 1,000 tonnes can change axles in 50 minutes. International traffic passing through the depots is made up of Transfesa's own wagons and loads being moved by RENFE and SNCF. Goods include car parts for assembly, finished cars, fruit, cereals, bulk paper, chemicals, powders and granulated products.</p>

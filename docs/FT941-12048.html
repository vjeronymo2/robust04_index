			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Xerox shares lifted by strong final term Shares in Xerox rose sharply on Wall Street yesterday after the company announced net income from its core document processing business rose 9 per cent in the final quarter of 1993 to Dollars 236m. Although part of the growth was due to favourable movements in foreign exchange markets - Xerox said processing income was up only 5 per cent in the fourth quarter if the effect of foreign currency translation was excluded - the improvement cheered investors who until recently had been disappointed by the company's earnings performance. By late morning, Xerox shares were up Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 97 1/4 , a 52-week high. The company has been restructuring. Further job cuts are planned as part of the programme, aimed at reducing Xerox's payroll by 10,000 jobs, or 10 per cent, over the next two years. Xerox's solid final quarter took the company's full-year 1993 earnings from its document processing business to Dollars 620m, up from Dollars 562m in 1992. That gain was wiped out by a previously announced fourth-quarter charge of Dollars 813m which was taken to cover the cost of a big restructuring programme and to settle a 1992 anti-trust lawsuit. Revenue for the quarter was almost unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn. For the year, revenue was static at Dollars 14.6bn against Dollars 14.7bn. Mr Paul Allair, Xerox's chairman and chief executive, said that pre-charge profits were up over the year in spite of lower-than-expected revenue growth because of the company's restructuring. During 1993, Xerox's worldwide document processing workforce was cut by 2,300. The reductions, combined with expense controls, helped improve the company's ratio of expenses-to-revenue ratio by 1.1 per cent.</p>

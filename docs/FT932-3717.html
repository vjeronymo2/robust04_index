			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BETTER than expected US producer price index figures enlivened an otherwise dull Footsie futures market though further gains were checked by talk of a political scandal, writes Joel Kibazo. A general lack of buying interest as dealers continued to reflect on the UK political scene characterised the morning session. Having opened at 2,854, the June contract on the FTSE dipped to 2,852 and hovered around that level for the next few hours. The release of the US figures over the lunch hour prised buyers from the sidelines sending the June contract to the day's high of 2,873. However the buying ran out of steam as the market neared its official close as talk of an impending political scandal circulated. June closed at 2,865. Total turnover in the traded options remained low at 26,314. Activity in the FT-SE 100 option remained poor reaching 6,518 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 2,521 lots. Shell was the most active stock option with a total of 2,403 lots dealt.</p>

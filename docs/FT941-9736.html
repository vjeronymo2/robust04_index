			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The secrets of Thai cuisine - Nicholas Woodsworth enrols on a challenging and enjoyable cookery course in Bangkok I have never had much time for Bangkok. A heaving, clamorous monster of a city that has slipped its leash, it seems permanently out of control. It grows and grows, and continues to grow. It is unstoppable. It thrives on money and fat-cat generals and rotten business deals and veniality. It eats people and belches blue smoke. Worst of all, from the traveller's view, it deadens the senses of the unsuspecting visitor. After their first two-hour traffic jam between airport and hotel, many people just switch off. Whenever I am in transit in Bangkok, I lie low and simply pretend the whole thing isn't there. At least, that is the way it was until I noticed the little cluster of food carts parked each day outside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. They are nothing special - battered, three-wheeled aluminium pushcarts with tin roofs for the rain, car batteries and fluorescent tubes for lighting, and butane canisters and gas rings for cooking. They are found on almost every street corner. But to judge from the happy faces of the commuters on their way to and from the crowded ferries on the Chao Phya River, they were giving great pleasure and satisfaction in an otherwise hectic routine. No matter how chaotic their city has become, Bangkok's citizens retain a reputation for aesthetic and sensual appreciation. Outside on the street the diesel fumes may be thick and the traffic snarled, but in their souls the Thais, a creative and expressive people, continue to enjoy life through their considerable artistic and social skills - through their love of conversation and company, through religion, art, music, and, most famously in the west at least, through the creation of a surprising and delightful cuisine. But how in the midst of this smoggy streetside mayhem, I wondered, could anyone enjoy food? I was interested enough to wander over to the carts and sit down. The scene was strictly Asian urban minimalist - metal tables and chairs on the sidewalk, a plastic bucket for dish washing in the gutter, Coke cases stacked against the wall. Nor did the food itself look like much; when I pointed vaguely at the first pot at hand, what was placed in front of me in a plastic bowl looked like a green, sludgy and nondescript stew. I could not have been less expectant. But the moment I put a spoonful in my mouth I knew that this was worth exploring. Here were fresh, lively, unfamiliar flavours - chillies and pungent herbs, sharp lemon and milky coconut tastes, sweetness and subtle spicing. All blended wonderfully, transforming ordinary chicken. Thai green curry showed me that there is little time to waste in Bangkok after all. A good way to get to know a food is to eat it. Even better is to cook it. But getting to know Thai food presents problems to the westerner. Many ingredients - roots, leaves, chillies, fermented concoctions of fish and shrimp, liquid extractions of fruit-pods and trees - are so strange and exotic most of us do not even know how they look, much less how they are used. More challenging still, the flavour combinations produced in Thai cooking are wholly unexpected and take a leap of the imagination that not everyone, at first, might have. Nor do Thai cooking methods much resemble anything in the west - when was the last time you used a pestle and mortar, or steamed food in a banana leaf? Put all these elements together, add the problem of language, and you are left with one solution: going back to school. After tasting green curry I enrolled at the Thai Cooking School at the Oriental. There is no sweaty-palmed swotting in the Oriental's classrooms. For the next five mornings I was ferried over the Chao Phya River in a hotel launch; awaiting me on the other side, in an old-fashioned colonial building surrounded by tropical gardens, was a small class and Sarnsern Gajaseni, cookery instructor. Sarnsern believes that cooking, like eating or any other worthwhile endeavour, should provide pleasure. But the greater the knowledge, he admits, the greater the pleasure. Thai food is like nothing else on earth. At the crossroads of south-east Asia, this country has borrowed from the two cultural giants that loom over it. From China it has taken ingredients such as noodles and techniques such as stir-frying. From India it learned about about the use of spices in giving subtlety and infinite variety to even the simplest of foods. Nor is a western colonial element missing - Thai cooking would be unrecognisable without the hot chilli, gift of the Portuguese who brought it from South America. What sets the seal on Thai cuisine, though, are the country's distinctive local ingredients. Sarnsern spends time familiarising students with their look, feel and taste. I already knew coconut, garlic, and soy sauce, but am now more at home with a score of other Thai indispensables - lemon grass, coriander, tamarind, basil, Thai ginger and kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, shrimp paste and others. I can even judge, approximately, the various firepower of half a dozen different kinds of chilli. Knowing what to do with them all is, of course, another matter. The best way is to watch someone who does. Part of this involves learning simple techniques of manipulation. Ninety per cent of time in Thai kitchens is spent in preparation rather than actual cooking - rarely more, for most dishes, than 10 or 12 minutes. The fine slicing of vegetables, chopping of meat or pounding of fresh herbs requires little specialist skill. But how, for example, do you extract the delightfully tart and fresh flavour of tamarind from a sticky mess of seed pods, or make two kinds of milk, thick and thin, from the meat of the coconut? There are tricks and tips to be learned that can make Thai cooking convenient in the west without de-naturing it too far. For example one need not extract, grate and hand-squeeze fresh coconut meat two separate times to obtain two kinds of milk. It is much easier, I discovered, to stick a tin of coconut milk into the freezer - it will separate itself, the thick milk rising to the top. Or, if fresh Thai spices are unavailable, I know now that soaking them in water and lemon juice before use will bring out more flavour. And, if time is really tight and I cannot make my own fresh Thai curry paste, I know how to liven up a commercially-prepared paste with a few ingredients. The real skill of the Thai cook, however, lies not in physical technique, but in the complex and carefully calculated combination of flavours he gives to his sauce, dip, soup salad and curry bases. Thai cooking requires only small quantities of meat, fish, poultry or seafood, and the vegetables used are generally bland - everything rests on the inspired but judicious use of herbs, spices and condiments. The days slipped by and we worked our way through the Thai repertoire. We watched the construction of fiery dips made of chillies, fish sauce, lime juice and palm sugar; mild dips of shrimp paste, coconut milk, and smoked fish; hot and sour soups using prawns and Thai ginger, coriander root and basil, spinach and dried shrimps; spiced salads of squid and mint, lime leaves and shallots, chillies and lemon grass. By the time we got to the deep-fried noodles, the steamed dishes, the stir-fries and the oil and coconut-based curries - to my mind the apex of Thai cooking - we were over our astonishment at incongruous-sounding combinations; salty, sweet, sour, and hot - all flavours can be combined to happy effect as long as there is a harmonious balance. We had also learned not to be afraid of keeping hot dishes hot with their full compliment of chillies - such dishes are never meant to be eaten alone, but found on the table with milder, cooling fare. Perhaps the most agreeable principle to be learned in Thai cooking is that there are no hard and fast rules. Thai cooks operate on personal taste and the intuition that comes from experience. Where one household might use three spoons of lime juice for a particular dish, the house up the road might use six and the one opposite none, or wine vinegar instead. How does the enthusiastic amateur get the experience to allow full play to his or her creativity and intuition? Sarnsern advises three procedures. Get and use a good cookbook. I have bought Vatcharin Bhumichitr's The Taste of Thailand, (Asia Books, Pounds 10.99, 223 pages), and find it excellent. Work by experimentation, using small quantities of spices at first and gradually increasing them according to preference. Last, expose yourself to as much good Thai food as possible. It is a good reason, I think for heading back to that monster of a city.

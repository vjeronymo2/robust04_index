During the talks,  concerning China's moves to strengthen its military power  through such measures as the resumption of nuclear testing,  Japanese officers said: "There are arguments in Asia that  China's moves might threaten the security of other Asian  nations. We hope China will boost the transparency in defense  matters." However, Chinese counterparts reiterated China's  conventional stand, saying: "Nuclear weapons are solely for  self-defense. Inflation is the major reason for an increase in  defense expenditures."    At the end of last year, security talks were held between  officials of the foreign ministries of the two nations. This  time, uniformed officers held the security dialogue for the  first time. They included Toshimasa Fujiwara (major general),  chief of the Joint Staff Council's 5th staff officer section,  from Japan and Zhan Maohai (major general), deputy director at  the NDM's Foreign Affairs Bureau, from China. They exchanged  opinions for about five hours.</p>

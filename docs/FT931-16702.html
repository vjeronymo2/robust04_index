			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Puerto Rican telecoms sale approved by US THE US Federal Communications Commission has approved the sale of a majority holding in Puerto Rico's long-distance telephone company to Telefonica de Espana, 10 months after the island's government said it had concluded the deal. The sale of 80 per cent of Puerto Rico's government-owned Telefonica Larga Distancia for Dollars 141.6m needed FCC approval because it breached regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 40 per cent of any US telephone company. Puerto Rico is a Caribbean possession of the US and is subject to federal regulations. The FCC reported that its approval of the sale to the Spanish company was based on the Puerto Rican administration's failure to obtain reasonable offers from US companies, and because the privatisation of the carrier promised a more competitive service. The island's government is retaining a 20 per cent stake. Announcing the sale 10 months ago, Telefonica de Espana said it would invest another Dollars 50m in the Puerto Rican venture to upgrade its facilities. The purchase represents Telefonica de Espana's second venture in Puerto Rico. The company already owns 40 per cent of Telefonica Hispanoamerica, which manufactures telephones and other equipment on the island. Telefonica de Espana, which also has investments in telephone companies in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, said it would use its increased presence in Puerto Rico to develop the island as a hub for its operations in the Americas.</p>

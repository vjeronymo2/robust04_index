			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Proper bonus Sir, As a private shareholder I am fed up with company directors misappropriating my money. Inflated salaries and pensions are a scandal. Very few companies are justified in paying their chief executives base salaries over Pounds 250,000, and medium and small companies considerably less. There is, however, general approval of properly constructed performance-related bonus schemes in addition to base salary. These should require the bonus, after deduction of tax at the marginal rate, to be invested in the companies' shares and held by trustees for five years before being handed to the beneficiary. This would restore identity of interest between management and shareholders. On this basis good luck to management and may they prosper. David Acland, 24 Caroline Place, London W2 4AN</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Japan ready to come out fighting: Tokyo's attitude to its trade surplus JAPAN is braced for another potentially grim season of trade friction with the US. But this time there will be a difference: Japan seems set to come out fighting. There is a growing feeling among senior Japanese trade officials that the issue of Japan's trade surplus with the US needs a fundamentally different approach. It is an approach which could well be at odds with that of the Clinton administration. The US and Japan have a long history of trade talks to draw lessons from - from the initial measures to open the Japanese market to leather and tobacco imports in the late 1970s to the elaborate Structural Impediments Initiative in the late 1980s. The lesson drawn by some senior officials in the Clinton administration, such as Ms Laura Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is that there should be a renewed drive to open up specific Japanese industries to competition. The Japanese want to go in the opposite direction. Japanese officials reject an industry-by-industry approach. Instead they want to focus on the macro-economic causes of the trade imbalance, primarily Japan's sluggish demand for imports and the US fiscal deficit. This difference is not new. But what is unusual is the assertiveness with which Japanese officials are prepared to defend it. As director-general of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's international trade policy bureau, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu is one of the most senior bureaucrats to express publicly Japan's unhappiness with the market-specific approach favoured by the US. He argues that an attempt to correct the trade imbalance by insisting that US companies ought to attain a certain share of specific markets in Japan is not the right solution. If the US insisted on such an approach, the Japanese would talk, but with little enthusiasm. Mr Okamatsu said: 'We completely reject that sort of approach to set some market share. We do not want to proceed down that road.' He is careful not to label the new Clinton administration 'protectionist'. The imposition of US anti-dumping duties on steel imports, he says, was a procedure rather than a sign of US policy thinking. With only a handful of key US posts filled, it was too early to tell what the administration's approach will be. Nevertheless, as protectionist pressures mount on the Clinton administration, and with legislation before Congress to raise import duties on minivans and revive the Super 301 trade sanctions, Mr Okamatsu admits: 'Right now we have great concerns about the new administration in the US.' Japan's response to such measures would be more assertive than in the past, Mr Okamatsu indicated. If Super 301 was invoked to impose uniltaeral sanctions against Japanese exports to the US, Japan would retaliate. Japan would first seek a Gatt ruling on the Super 301 provisions and, if Gatt ruled in its favour, would withdraw tariff and tax concessions to US imports. As an alternative, Japan will propose a primarily macro-economic approach, with four main components: Later this year the Japanese government will introduce an emergency spending package to stimulate the economy and boost imports. Japan will help foreign businesses to promote imports more vigorously. The government is planning to ease the recycling of Japan's export earnings through higher overseas development aid and support for investment overseas by Japanese companies. The target will be more than Dollars 50bn over the next five years. Persuade the US to address its macro-economic position, particularly its fiscal deficit. 'We have asked the US, via the SII talks, to change the fiscal position.' Mr Okamatsu said. 'But the situation is getting worse and worse, and so it is impossible to affect the trade imbalance.' He adds: 'Resolution of the trade issue should be through mutual efforts.' Although Mr Okamatsu is too polite to say so outright, the underlying message is that, so far, it has been a one-sided affair. Certainly, US-Japan trade relations have appeared to consist primarily of fire-fighting exercises. 'The Japanese government is tired of asking the same things from the US that it has been asking for three or four years. In that sense we want a new approach,' Mr Okamatsu says. To break the sense of deadlock, Japan was likely to suggest that the long-running SII talks should be revamped. 'They became much more detailed than we expected,' he says. 'We wanted them to focus over larger structural issues.' Mr Okamatsu favours setting up a bi-partisan panel of experts to address the trade imbalance. Only if that were to conclude that importers into Japan faced obstacles in specific sectors would there be a case for more detailed talks. Japan also wants its talks with the US on the bilateral trade relationship to take place in the context of discussions on global issues such as measures to stimulate the world economy. It may be wishful thinking for the Japanese to hope the US will adopt the kind of approach Japan is likely to propose. Tokyo's new found assertiveness over trade policy is certainly an attempt to influence the shaping of the Clinton administration's policy. But it could be more than simply a signal. If the US does propose an industry-by-industry approach to trade talks, this could be met with a much firmer response than before.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Cost of theft claims rises to Pounds 3m a day A RISING TIDE of theft claims is costing insurers more than Pounds 3m a day, according to figures released yesterday. Both the cost and number of claims rose sharply in the first three months of this year, the statistics from the Association of British Insurers' indicate. The association blames some of the increase on the recession but says that consumers are increasingly likely to cheat on their insurance policies. In the first quarter of this year the cost of theft claims increased to Pounds 300.7m, a rise of 44.2 per cent on the same period last year. Over the year to the end of March the rise was even steeper, with claims rising 53.7 per cent to Pounds 999.4m. Although inner-city areas have been badly hit, the crime wave is affecting all areas of the country. The association estimates that fraud cost its members Pounds 400m last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 10 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As it is  difficult for government department-run economic entities to  make money, cadres who went into business last year "are  returning to their original posts."    According to the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce, 1993 saw the greatest number of government  department-run economic entities; all the licenses kept in stock  had been given away by July. In Shanxi alone, provincial-level  government departments set up 1,098 companies on a trial basis  last year, and a total of 3,000 cadres went into business. Of  this total, however, 50 percent have returned to their original  posts. Seven department- and bureau-level cadres went into  business last year, but all have gone back to their old  profession. Of the 120 county- and section-level cadres who  went into business last year, half have returned to government  departments. Of the 667 subsection-level cadres who went into  business last year, 427 have returned to their original posts.    A survey shows the main reason why cadres have been jumping  off the bandwagon like a swarm of bees is that it is difficult  to make money. Most government department-run economic entities  have failed to turn a profit. In Anhui, various companies run  by government departments suffered 7 million yuan in economic  losses in one year. These economic entities will face even  greater difficulties after their ties with government cadres  have been completely severed.</p>

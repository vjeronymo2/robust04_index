			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: No nasty surprises on exercise of warrants Sir, Serious Money: 'Robbing Peter to pay Peter' (14 May), discussed points raised in the latest Credit Lyonnais Laing Investment Trust yearbook. You added, however, your own point at the end on warrants. We feel it is important to clarify a recent, and unfortunately misinformed, view which seems to have arisen concerning warrants; namely that upon exercise of warrants the net asset value experiences an unforeseen fall, potentially catching investors unawares. Investment trust companies which have issued warrants publish two net asset values; one on an 'undiluted' basis, ie, a valuation of the existing portfolio, and the other on a 'diluted' basis, ie, a valuation of the portfolio assuming all warrants in issue have been exercised (increasing the assets and number of shares). It is standard practice in the investment trust industry to use the diluted NAV for valuing the company if warrants are 'in the money and dilution would occur', ie, if the undiluted NAV is higher than the exercise price of the warrants, making it likely that warrant holders may exercise. The AITC follows this practice in monthly information service as does the Financial Times in its London share service. Discounts published are based on the lower, diluted NAV. As a result, investors are not subject to a nasty surprise when the final exercise of warrants takes place. This is because the lower NAV has been used when applicable throughout the life of the warrant and discounts published have reflected this. The investment trust industry appreciates the importance of ensuring investors have accurate and meaningful figures on which to base decisions. The AITC has been careful to ensure best practice in use and publication of diluted and undiluted NAVs when valuing investment trusts.

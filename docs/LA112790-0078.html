			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> MURDER TRIAL BEGINS FOR IMMIGRANT, 17  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Mexican immigrant who allegedly stabbed a Thousand Oaks  nurseryman with a butcher knife last spring went on trial Monday on a murder  charge in Ventura County Superior Court.  </P> <P> Jose Luis Navarro is being tried as an adult because a Juvenile Court judge  ruled that he has been self-sufficient for more than a year.  </P> <P> Jose Narvaez, 49, died of deep stab wounds at the edge of a field in Thousand  Oaks on the night of April 19.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said in an opening statement that Narvaez  and Navarro lived in the same apartment building in the 800 block of Warwick  Avenue.  </P> <P> "Mr. Narvaez on previous dates had asked the defendant to have sex with him,  and apparently there was an agreement to do so," he said.  </P> <P> Holmes told the jury that autopsy evidence shows that Navarro sodomized Narvaez  that night, but he added that a brawl began when Narvaez wanted to reciprocate.  He said Navarro was struck several times, then stabbed Narvaez once in the  stomach and three times in the back with a 9 1/2-inch butcher knife.  </P> <P> The knife, later found at the scene, was stained with blood matching Narvaez's  blood, Holmes said. And a woman who saw Navarro punch Narvaez and run from the  scene described the suspect to the county sheriff's deputies who later arrested  him, he said.  </P> <P> However, Deputy Public Defender Steven P. Lipson argued in his opening  statement that Navarro was trying to protect himself from Narvaez's unwanted  advances.  </P> <P> Testimony is expected to continue today. MACK REED  </P></p>

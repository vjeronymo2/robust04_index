			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 16 Mar--Among 16 institutions in the Public  Opinion Research Centre [CBOS] league table, the army enjoys the  greatest confidence (79 percent) and the least disapproval (8  percent) among the respondents. We have least confidence in  private banks; nearly half of the respondents (47 percent) do  not trust them.    The CBOS poll was conducted between 11 and 15 February of  this year on a nationwide, random representative sample of 1,198  adult members of Poland's population.    Number-two in the table is the ombudsman, who is trusted by  71 percent of the public and distrusted by 11 percent. At  number three comes public television, for which approval was  expressed by 69 percent of the respondents and disapproval by 20  percent. The next place went to the state police, in which 66  percent of the respondents expressed confidence, while 27  percent expressed a lack of it.    The authorities of the respondents' towns (parishes) and the  church each enjoyed 54 percent of public confidence.  Disapproval was expressed by 32 and 37 percent, respectively.    More than half of the respondents (51 percent) expressed  confidence in the government, the Sejm, the courts, and the  Supreme Chamber of Control. The greatest disapproval among  these was expressed for the Sejm (35 percent) and the government  (33 percent).    Among the central institutions, the poorest appraisal is  given to the work of the president, who is trusted by 35 percent  of the respondents but disapproved of by more than half (55  percent).    In February, confidence in the activities of trade unions  went up. Approval for Solidarity (40 percent) went up 15 points,  while, for the National Trade Union Alliance, it rose by 10  percentage points. The improved position of the trade unions  probably resulted from the Warsaw demonstration by Solidarity,  as well as from the recently more frequent appearances by  representatives of these organizations in the mass media.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan cotton crop damaged by floods THE COTTON crop in the Pakistan provinces of Punjab and Sindh has been badly damaged by floods following last week's heavy rains. According to initial government estimates, up to 10 per cent of the crop may have been destroyed, though some officials believe losses may be up to 20 per cent. That would mean a sharp turnaround from a 35 per cent rise in cotton production, last year. Mr Zafar Altaf, chairman of Pakistan's Agricultural Research Council, said production may decline by 1.5m bales from last year's output of 13m. 'The damage to the cotton crop is going to be quite extensive', he said, adding 'You would have to shave off about 1.5 million bales'. The Southern province of Sindh, expected to produce 1.5m bales, has so far been worst hit. Punjab would have produced the rest. Initial estimates show that up to 60 per cent of the Sindh crop there has been destroyed. Officials fear further damage because flood water is expected to reach Sindh tomorrow or Thursday. The damage to cotton is expected to put pressure on Pakistan's economy. Up to 58 per cent of last year's export earnings were from cotton related products such as raw cotton, yarn, fabrics, garments, bed-wear and towels. In addition, there are concerns that the floods have also damaged rice and sugar-cane fields. The extent of the damage is not yet clear because assessments are continuing. Other damaged crops include chillies, tomatoes and onions in southern Sindh. That may raise the prices of vegetables for consumers, some officials add.</p>

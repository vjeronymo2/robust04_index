			<p>BFN     [Text] Over 200 employees of a factory are threatened with  unemployment in view of the grave fuel crisis being experienced  by the country for some months and the problem of power cuts.  Let us listen to a report by our correspondent for the [Les  Cayes] area, Henrisma Robert:    [Begin Robert recording in progress] ...the only one out of  10 vetiver essence factories in the Les Cayes area has decided  to shut down. Their fuel reserves have run out. The owners of  those factories...[pauses] We met, for example, with Mr.  (Eugene), who said he wanted to keep one of the three vetiver  essence factories he owns, located near (Ravine du Sud),  operating. This factory owner told us is he doing his best not  to shut down because he employs more than 200 heads of household  who have no other job. Moreover, said (Eugene), southern Haiti  alone produces over 80 percent of the vetiver essence on the  national market, so this product constitutes an important source  of income for the southern region. (Eugene) explained, however,  that given the difficulties he is facing because of the gasoline  and gasoil problem and the high cost of materiel that has broken  down or needs replacing, he is going to put an end, over the  weekend, to the operations of the only factory operating in Les  Cayes. The question many people are asking now is: When will the  Dessalines [sugar] Company follow suit?    This is Henrisma Robert from Les Cayes for Signal FM. [end  recording]</p>

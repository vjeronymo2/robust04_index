			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Nuclear inspectors fly to North Korea: First step this week in deal with Washington An international nuclear inspection team is expected to arrive in North Korea tomorrow as the first step under a deal concluded between Washington and Pyongyang at the weekend. North Korea agreed to allow entry to an inspection team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to examine seven declared facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. The North this week will also begin 'working level' discussions with South Korea on preparations for an exchange of presidential envoys by mid-March. This could pave the way for an unprecedented summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas. South Korean President Kim Young-sam offered on Friday to meet his North Korean counterpart, Mr Kim Il-sung, in an attempt to resolve suspicions about the North's nuclear programme. In return, the US agreed to hold a new round of high-level negotiations with North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid. The talks will begin on March 21, timed to coincide with the end of the IAEA inspections. The US and South Korea will also cancel this spring's joint Team Spirit military exercise if the North fully co-operates with the IAEA inspections and progress is achieved in the inter-Korean talks. The planned deployment of US Patriot missiles, meant to protect South Korea against the threat of an attack by North Korean Scud missiles, may also be delayed. Details of the package deal will be formally announced tomorrow as soon as the IAEA team arrives in North Korea. However, analysts in Seoul warn that the conditional nature of the US and South Korean concessions could provide a pretext for the North to raise last-minute objections. Pyongyang has consistently demanded firm guarantees on the suspension of Team Spirit and new US-North Korean talks in return for allowing the IAEA into Yongbyon. Disagreements over how the two sides would co-ordinate their actions delayed the planned trip of the IAEA inspectors to North Korea this month after Pyongyang agreed in principle to their visit. The IAEA will try to determine whether the North has diverted plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor since the last full inspections were conducted a year ago. But that examination will not end the controversy over the North's nuclear programme. The IAEA still wants to investigate two undeclared facilities, believed to be nuclear waste sites, at Yongbyon to determine if the North extracted more plutonium than it declared after it shut down its reactor in 1989. The North has repeatedly said it will not allow an inspection of these two sites. It threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last March and blocked regular IAEA inspections after the IAEA demanded to see the two undeclared sites. But officials in Seoul believe the North may be using this issue to win US diplomatic recognition in return for accepting the IAEA demand.</p>

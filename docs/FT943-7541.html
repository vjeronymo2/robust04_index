			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / S Korea's economy 'to grow 8.3%' South Korea's economy is expected to grow 8.3 per cent in 1994, but will slow slightly to a rate of 7.6 per cent next year, according to the state-funded Korea Development Institute, the country's leading economic policy group. The buoyant figures for gross national product represent a recovery after two years of sluggish growth: 4.7 per cent in 1992 and 5.6 per cent in 1993, the lowest in more than a decade. Renewed growth is based on higher exports, which have risen 12.9 per cent during the first seven months of 1994, as demand increases in the industrialised world and the Korean won weakens against the strong Japanese yen. The export boom has fuelled industrial investments in plant expansion as production capacity becomes strained, with the operation ratio for manufacturing companies reaching 83.3 per cent in June. Total industrial investments are expected to rise 72 per cent for the year, according to Barings Securities in Seoul. But the healthy economic growth is creating new problems for South Korea in terms of a current account deficit and inflation. Korea's dependence on imports of Japanese components and machinery, coupled with the strong Japanese yen, is likely to increase its trade deficit with Tokyo to at least Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) this year from Dollars 8.5bn in 1993. This will contribute to a current account deficit of Dollars 2.1bn for the year, despite increased capital inflows as Korea gradually opens its financial markets. The economic recovery is also increasing inflationary pressure, with prices threatening to exceed the government's inflation target of 6 per cent this year. Analysts worry that higher interest rates caused by rising credit demand and tighter monetary controls imposed by the government to curb inflation will cut short the economic recovery. The Korea Development Institute proposes that the government cut its budget and raise taxes to prevent the economy overheating, as an alternative to strict control of money supply. This would avoid the mistakes in the early 1990s, when a government-ordered credit squeeze led to the period of low growth in 1992-93. None the less, a rise in interest rates appears inevitable because of credit demand. Higher financial costs and the gradual appreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar will be the main factors behind the slowdown in GNP growth next year. The South Korean and US military began war simulation exercises yesterday, the Defence Ministry said, AP reports from Seoul. The annual 'Ulji-Focus Lens' exercises began despite North Korea's threats last week that the war games would strain inter-Korean relations. The exercise tests the combat capabilities of the joint forces, even though no actual troop movements are involved. Under computer simulation, the 650,000-member South Korean forces and 36,000 US troops face off against North Korea.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Norway drafts budget Norway's minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft 1995 budget which aims to slash the deficit and forecasts continuing improvement in the economy. It also shows optimism about winning the support of a sceptical electorate in a referendum on November 28 on joining the European Union. The draft reduces the deficit to NKr20.9bn (Pounds 1.95bn) from NKr32.7bn (Pounds 3.05bn), helped by an increase in petroleum earnings to be derived from a sharp rise in daily oil output to 2.6m barrels and a reduction in the state's direct investment in the sector. The deficit reduction would also be helped by an increase in a wide range of tariffs and taxes to raise NKr4.6bn. However, Norway's dependence on oil is underlined by the non-oil budget deficit of NKr52.6bn, against NKr58.2bn in 1994. Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 2.75 per, down from 4.5 per cent this year. Inflation is forecast to rise to 1.5 per cent from 1.25 per cent. Local analysts said the government's prognosis for the non-oil, mainland economy seems to assume a Yes vote in the EU referendum to substantiate forecast growth of 12 per cent in corporate mainland investment next year (up from 7 per cent in 1994), amid warnings about investment from the country's biggest companies if membership is rejected.</p>

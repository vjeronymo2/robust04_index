			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (5): Regional banking contrasts - Moves to counter an encroachment by the Carolina giants / The banks have benefited greatly from the robust health of the regional economy, which survived the 1990-1991 nationwide recession virtually unscathed To the dismay of some proud Georgians, three of the five biggest banks in the Atlanta region hail from North Carolina. Of the three out-of-state banks, two are based in Charlotte (Nationsbank and First Union) and one in Winston-Salem (Wachovia). The lone Atlanta banks are SunTrust (which owns the venerable Trust Company of Georgia franchise), and Bank South, the smallest of the big five. The supremacy of the Carolina banks is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1984, when the south-eastern compact - a series of agreements between states in the south-east to block takeovers of local institutions by banks from outside the region - was forged, Atlanta was the region's business capital, and its banks appeared well-placed to prosper accordingly. However, over the following decade while Georgia banks were stifled by the weight of cumbersome and antiquated state banking regulations, North Carolina banks were expanding rapidly through aggressive acquisitions made possible by a much more flexible regulatory environment. By the early 1990s, consolidation among banks in the south- east had created a new breed of 'super regionals,' and three such giants - NationsBank, First Union and Wachovia - were firmly encamped on Atlanta banks' turf. The largest Atlanta-based bank before consolidation was the C&amp;S Corporation. After a series of strategic blunders, it was taken over by NCNB of Charlotte in a deal that created NationsBank, now the biggest super regional in the US. First Union and Wachovia also bought banks from Georgia and other south-eastern states. The contrast between the development of banking in North Carolina and Georgia explains how the Atlanta banks lost their way, says Mr John Coffey, a bank analyst at the Atlanta securities firm of Robinson-Humphrey. 'North Carolina is almost a laboratory for banking, it's been so progressive. The state itself looks like what banking in the US will probably look like in 10 or 20 years. There are three big players who control 55 per cent of the market, and they are another 80 who control the remainder. In Georgia, there are 300 banks, yet it's a similar-sized market to North Carolina.' The encroachment of the Carolina giants, however, does not mean that Atlanta's two surviving big banks have languished these past few years. Quite the opposite. The conservatively-run SunTrust has become one of the most profitable banks in the country, and Bank South has performed a remarkable comeback from loan problems which at one point looked as if they might overwhelm the bank in 1991. Both banks, as well as the three from North Carolina, have benefited greatly from the robust health of the regional economy, which survived the 1990-1991 nationwide recession virtually unscathed, and which continues to post above-average growth. Mr James Williams, SunTrust's chairman, attributes a great deal of his bank's successes to the strength of the local economy. Under the stewardship of its safety-first management, SunTrust has achieved the remarkable record of never having reported a decline in annual earnings. In 1993, the bank earned Dollars 474m, 17 per cent more than in 1992, and this year SunTrust is on target to record earnings growth of 10 per cent. Although the bank's assets have grown from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 40bn in the past 10 years, Mr Williams says only half of that growth has come from acquisitions - the remainder has been derived from internal growth. Remaining true to its conservative philosophy, SunTrust sticks to what it knows best: loans to mid-sized companies; its long-established trust business, which serves the needs of many of Atlanta's richest families; retail banking and mortgage lending; and fund management. The bank also owns a big stake in Coca-Cola which it has held since helping the company go public in 1919, and which is now worth Dollars 1.2bn. Typical of the SunTrust strategy is its recent move into the mutual fund business. Since its entry last year, the bank has built up a stable of 19 mutual funds with assets of Dollars 4.5bn. The funds are proving popular and profitable, and the bank's chairman admits they were a bit tardy in exploiting the mutual fund boom - 'we should have been in earlier,' says Mr Williams, 'but we got in carefully. When we did it, we did it right, and we are now highly successful.' In sharp contrast to SunTrust's steady but unspectacular progress, Bank South's recent history resembles a rollercoaster ride. In 1991 the bank was close to failure, burdened by too many problem property loans, but new management arrived that year under the leadership of several former C&amp;S executives, including turnaround expert Mr Patrick Flinn. With Mr Flinn as chairman, Bank South cleaned up its loan book, and rebounded strongly, forging a name for itself as Atlanta's community bank. With more than 80 per cent of the bank's business in the Atlanta metropolitan area, it fully deserves that title. As Mr Coffey of Robinson-Humphrey explains: 'They're the local independent bank that is more willing to serve you than those Yankee interlopers from North Carolina. That's the way they position themselves.' An aggressive and innovative marketing campaign, some astute acquisitions in the metropolitan region, and several fast-growing businesses including mutual funds and discount broking, have all helped turn Bank South into Atlanta's premier retail bank. The successes of SunTrust and Bank South means they are regarded as juicy targets for takeover by larger banks in the region, or from outside the south east (the region's compact is in the process of being dismantled, and interregional banking will soon become the norm). For Bank South, the prospect of being taken over does not seem to have quelled its appetite for expansion - 'of all of them, Bank South is probably the most acquisitive,' says Mr Coffey. 'They will probably continue to cement their franchise in Atlanta. At the same time they are the most often-mentioned takeover target, just by virtue of their size. As a result, their stock price reflects it.' The analyst, however, does not think that anyone will make a move on Bank South soon - 'no one could buy them without incurring significant earnings dilution. Their (defence strategy) is independence through performance, rather than through size.' Size, however, may prove a good defence for SunTrust. That, at least, is the belief of its chairman Mr James Williams, who says the bank's size (assets of Dollars 6.6bn), plus the premium that any acquirer would have to pay, makes SunTrust too much for most banks too swallow. A merger of equals involving SunTrust is seen by analysts as a more likely outcome, and Wachovia of North Carolina is regarded as the bank that would make the snuggest fit. For the moment, however, SunTrust is concentrating on growing its earnings and completing a massive share buyback programme - it has already spent Dollars 300m on acquiring 7m shares and has the approval to buy another 5m - and shying away from talk of acquisitions and mergers. Mr Coffey says of SunTrust's management: 'I think they see more value in paying for their own stock than someone else's'</p>

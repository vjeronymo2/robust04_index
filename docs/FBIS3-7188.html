The UN in New York should be informed by letter about the  situation in Chanthaburi province, on the Thai-Cambodian border,  where about 30,000 Cambodians, many the families of Khmer Rouge  fighters, have fled, the source said.    UN agencies such as United Nations Border Relief  Organisation  and the International Red Cross should immediately help by  setting up safe areas on Cambodian territory. The United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is limited in its  function and can provide humanitarian assistance only on the  Thai side.    The source said Thailand does not want to shoulder the  burden  of caring for Cambodians fleeing attacks by their own government  and wishes that the fighting should end soon for the sake of the  people and the country.    "Thailand shouldered the burden of Cambodian refugees for  years before UN agencies and other organizations stepped in," he  said.    According to the source, Khmer Rouge troops may attack a  government military base in Cambodia's Battambang province  bordering Thailand's Sa Kaew province and the Cambodian  government troops there may seek help from Thai troops across  the border.    "An attack there would result in an additional influx of  Cambodians into Thailand. Thai authorities know of the  possibility and will soon meet to arrange a plan for the fleeing  Cambodians," he said.    The Foreign Ministry will raise the issue with Cambodian  Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut who will visit Bangkok  for two days, starting on Monday.    Cambodia will provide additional time to Thai loggers  hauling  logs out of the country on a case-by-case basis, depending on  payment, an informed source said. The present deadline for  removing the logs is March 30.</p>

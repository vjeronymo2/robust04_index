			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has evaluated the FDER's Soil Thermal Treatment Facilities rule for consistency with the Clean Air Act, EPA regulations, and EPA policy, and has found that these submitted rules serve to strengthen the Florida SIP. The addition of the State of Florida's Soil Thermal Treatment Facilities rule in the Florida SIP will result in emissions reductions by controlling soil thermal treatment facilities which emit VOC's and toxic air contaminants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recodification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 11, 1993, the State of Florida through the FDER submitted a recodification of the F.A.C., chapter 17&hyph;2. These rules were approved into the SIP in previous rulemakings. The EPA is now merely approving the recodification to make the SIP consistent with the numbering system currently used by the F.A.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not reviewed the substance of the recodified regulations at this time. These rules were approved into the SIP in previous rulemakings. The EPA is now merely approving the renumbering system submitted by FDER. The EPA's approval of the renumbering system, at this time, does not imply any position with respect to the approvability of the substantive rules. To the extent EPA has issued any SIP calls to the State with respect to the adequacy of any of the rules subject to this recodification, EPA will continue to require the State to correct any such rule deficiencies despite EPA's approval of this recodification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is approving the above referenced revisions to the Florida SIP. The revisions are consistent with EPA policy. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective December 19, 1994, unless, by November 21, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective December 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

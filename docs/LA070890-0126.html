			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE 1990 DOONESBURY STAMP ALBUM BY GARRY TRUDEAU (PENGUIN:  $8.95)  </P> <P> Unlike most contemporary cartoonists, Garry Trudeau has stubbornly resisted  attempts to merchandise his strip. The first "Doonesbury" license product was  created to raise money for "Writers' Voices," a national program that provides  accessible reading material to the 27 million American adults who are  illiterate or have only limited reading skills.  </P> <P> This spoof of a conventional stamp album allows Trudeau an opportunity to show  off his skill as a graphic artist. The cleverly designed pseudo-stamps include  images of his familiar characters (Zonker darkens like a roasting Thanksgiving  turkey as his tan deepens from "Gaucho Glow" to "Malibu Melt") and a series of  mordant lampoons of George Bush. A map showing the homes of the regular  "Doonesbury" cast includes special graphic symbols indicating Elvis sightings,  oil spills, Geraldo-free zones and Towns Without Pity.  </P></p>

As part of this program, each railroad shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Conduct spot checks daily at each location and during each shift where a qualified train brake system supervisor is regularly scheduled to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Conduct spot checks weekly at locations or on shifts where a qualified train brake system supervisor is not normally scheduled to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Conduct the spot checks randomly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Establish a means to document to FRA that spot checks are being performed as required. This documentation shall include a record of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The qualified supervisor's name.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The supervisor's current qualification status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The date, place, and time of the spot check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) What was spot checked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The findings of the spot check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The following requirements apply to cold weather operations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) After January 1, 1996, all new and rebuilt locomotives operating under cold weather conditions that do not meet any of the conditions contained in &sect;232.103(e) (1) and (2) shall be equipped with brake air system air dryers capable of a 30 degrees F. air dew point depression at a 100 cfm air flow rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) No chemicals shall be placed in the train air brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) A single car or single passenger-train-set test shall be performed whenever any part of the train brake system has been removed, repaired, or replaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Except cars equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke (81/2 and 10-inch diameters) brake cylinders, all cars shall be stencilled or shall be equipped with a badge plate with the permissible brake cylinder piston travel range for that car. The badge plate shall be located so that it may be easily read and understood by a person positioned safely beside the car or locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Train brake system brake shoes and disc pads shall have at least the minimum thickness necessary to safely travel the maximum distance the train is allowed to travel between Class 1 brake system tests. The following shall be the minimum thicknesses measured at any location on the shoe:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For 500-mile trains, 1/2 inch for cast metal and 3/8 inch for composition shoes/pads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For 1,500-mile trains, 1/2 inch for cast metal and 3/8 inch for composition shoes/pads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For 2,500-mile trains, 9/16 inch for cast metal and 7/16 inch for composition shoes/pads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For 3,500-mile trains, 5/8 inch for cast metal and 1/2 inch for composition shoes/pads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) Railroad or contractor supervisors shall be held jointly responsible with inspectors and train crew members for the condition and proper functioning of train brake systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.17  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Movement of cars or locomotives with defective brakes for repairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a railroad car or locomotive with one or more conditions not in compliance with this part may be used or hauled without civil penalty liability under this part only if all of the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The defective car or locomotive is properly equipped in accordance with the Safety Appliance Acts and the requirements of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The car or locomotive becomes defective while it is being used by the railroad on its line or becomes defective on the line of a connecting railroad and is properly accepted in interchange for repairs in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The railroad first discovers the defective condition of the car or locomotive prior to moving it for repairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The movement of the defective car or locomotive for repairs is from the location where the car or locomotive is first discovered defective by the railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The defective car or locomotive could not be repaired at the place where the railroad first discovers it to be defective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The movement of the car or locomotive is necessary to make repairs to the defective condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The repair point to which the car or locomotive is being taken is the nearest available repair point on the line of the railroad where the car or locomotive was first found to be defective or is the nearest available repair point on the line of a connecting railroad if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The connecting railroad elects to accept the defective car or locomotive for such repair; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Argentine debt deal 'put at risk': Resistance from some banks undermining Dollars 23bn package ARGENTINA'S chief debt negotiator said yesterday that resistance from a few banks in accepting a foreign debt reduction plan could threaten the entire Dollars 23bn (Pounds 13.3bn) package. 'It's take it or leave it. If the banks don't agree, there will be no deal,' Mr Daniel Marx said. However, he said banks were largely being won over and he was optimistic that the reduction mechanism would come into effect early next year, as originally planned. The problem arises from the sharp decline in US interest rates which has undermined the attractiveness of the package, piloted by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, under which Argentina would convert Dollars 23bn in commercial bank debt into two types of 30-year bond. At present Argentina pays no principal and only Dollars 70m a month in interest. Creditors could either take par bonds, which preserve debt principal but yield a low, fixed interest of 4 per cent a year, rising gradually to 6 per cent in the seventh year. Or they could opt for discount bonds which preserve only half the principal but pay floating interest rates of  13/16 of a percentage point over Libor. Low US interest rates have now made par bonds more attractive than discount bonds. The difficulty is that multilateral agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which are backing the package with Dollars 2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn in loans, would only lend if at least 35 per cent of the debt was converted into discount bonds. Argentina needs the loans, plus additional ones from the Japanese government, to buy US Treasury zero coupon bonds as collateral for its bonds. A banker in the US said that Mr Marx had his hands tied. 'Banks realise that if there is not a 35-65 mix, there can be no (debt reduction),' he added. Mr Marx said close to 30 per cent of the debt had already been converted into discount bonds, up from 25 per cent last week.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1982, Hawaiian air tour operators have experienced 15 accidents involving at least one serious injury or fatality where the lack of flotation gear, flying into bad weather, or flying low has played a role in the cause of the accident. These accidents have resulted in 48 fatalities and 30 injuries (16 serious and 14 minor). This evaluation divides these accidents into three categories: (1) Inadvertent air tour helicopter water landings without flotation gear; (2) air tour helicopter accidents related to flying into bad weather or flying low; and, (3) air tour airplane accidents related to flying into bad weather or flying low.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential benefits of preventing all potential sightseeing accidents of a similar nature over the next 3 years totals $36.8 million, with a present value of about $32.2 million, of which $13.7 million would be for the prevention of helicopter accidents and $18.6 million would be for the prevention of airplane accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) helps to assure that Federal regulations do not overly burden small businesses, small nonprofit organizations, and airports located in small cities. The RFA requires regulatory agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' A substantial number of small entities, defined by FAA Order 2100.14A, ``Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance,'' is more than one-third, but not less than 11, of the small entities subject to the existing rule. To determine if the rule will impose a significant cost impact on these small entities, the annualized cost must not exceed the annualized cost threshold established in FAA Order 2100.14A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small entities potentially affected by the final rule are small on-demand air tour operators in Hawaii using helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft. The FAA assumes that air tour operators will elect to have lifevests on board the helicopter rather than installing external flotation gear because the costs are dramatically lower. The FAA estimates that the annualized cost associated with acquiring lifevests for all helicopter occupants is about $127 per seat. This estimate incorporates the cost of purchasing the lifevests, maintenance, and the associated weight penalty. Also, the FAA estimates that the annualized cost of the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement is about $989 per seat. This cost incorporates the estimated lost profits for days when tour operations are prohibited due to inclement weather.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA Order 2100.14A defines small on-demand operators as those operating with a fleet of nine or fewer aircraft, which includes 37 (7 fixed-wing and 30 helicopter) of the 38 air tour operators in Hawaii. The annualized cost threshold for small operators is $4,700 in 1994 dollars. The FAA has determined that the final rule will have a significant economic effect on 6 of the 7 fixed-wing air tour operators and 25 of the 30 affected helicopter air tour operators. The final rule will impose costs greater than the annualized cost threshold of $4,700 for all affected operators except for six of the small air tour operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the significant economic impact of the final rule on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA examined an alternative minimum altitude requirement for the affected operators. The FAA evaluated various minimum altitude requirements including 500, 800, and 1,000 feet so as to reduce the annualized cost of the final rule on individual operators. The FAA has determined that a minimum altitude requirement of 500 feet will be necessary to lower the annualized cost of the final rule below the $4,700 threshold for most air tour operators. (Under &sect;91.155, pilots conducting VFR flights more than 1,200 feet above the surface in class G airspace must maintain a 500-foot vertical clearance below the clouds. Pilots operating VFR in class G airspace 1,200 feet or less above the surface must remain clear of clouds.) The FAA estimates that the annualized cost of a 500-foot minimum altitude requirement is about $81 per seat. Including the cost of the lifevests, the FAA has determined that the combined cost of the lifevests and the alternative requirement for a 500-foot minimum altitude will lower the annualized cost below the $4,700 threshold for all fixed-wing air tour operators and 26 of the 30 helicopter air tour operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

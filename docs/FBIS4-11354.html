			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Julio Lopez Campos] </F> <H5>  [24 March] </H5>   [Text] Above and beyond the political stance we take or the  economic situation we are in, we Sandinists ought to develop a  consensus about the key items on our agenda. As an activist, I  therefore suggest:    1. The first major point that we all ought to agree on and  the first major political accord that all groups ought to adopt  is: the decisions of the Congress must be honored by all.  Whether we like them or not. We know that the current makeup of  the Congress does completely satisfy anyone. Yet, this is our  Congress, and no one ought to leave the party because the  results do not satisfy them. We should all stay in the Front so  that we can continue to push the positions we hold inside it.    2. Without unity the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] has no chance of success in the 1996 elections. True, the  revolutionary struggle does not end with the next elections.  However, winning them, on our own or in an alliance, is  decisive, vital, and strategic. Without FSLN unity, any chance  of having a policy for victory becomes illusory and nonexistent.  <H5>  United Amid Diversity </H5>   3. At this Congress we must reaffirm the pluralistic nature  of Sandinism. United amid diversity must be our conviction.  Accepting internal pluralism means that it is not enough to  continue being revolutionaries; we will also have to become more  democratic. The culture of political tolerance must be developed  first in the party and then made compatible with the entire  society.    Each force has a legitimate right to seek predominance in  the  party, but this should not give rise to moves to exclude anyone.  Those who wish to leave of their own free will should do so. But  exclusion, ostracism, and expulsion cannot be political methods  of settling differences.    4. We must all pledge to respect our code of political  ethics  for debate. A steadfast defense of positions cannot turn into a  pretext for political attacks on individuals, factions, or  forums. Frank debates yes, personal attacks no. We must give  society an example of what we mean by discussion and ideological  political debate.    5. The FSLN needs a new identity. There have been many  changes in Nicaragua and the world. The FSLN has to define its  new revolutionary look in this new stage. The definition of this  new content cannot be targeted solely at internal party life.    In defining our new identity, we will also be defining  ourselves vis-a-vis society. The new face of Sandinism has to be  the appealing face of the nation's leading political force,  which can offer and insure peace, stability, the rule of law,  social justice, and economic well-being.  <H5>  Ruling Out the Armed Struggle </H5>   6. The FSLN does not give priority, a priori, to any one  method of struggle over another. Its policy in this regard ought  to be: the efficient combined use of all methods of struggle,  excluding only the armed struggle. The priority of one method  over another will be determined by the circumstances and  peculiarities of the struggle in question. The important thing  is to acknowledge the principle of efficiently combining all  methods.    7. The FSLN has a preferential social option for the poor,  who represent the majority in our nation. An approach that  excludes the other social sectors and classes does not follow  from this substantive principle, however. A priority means a  priority, not exclusivity. The FSLN attaches great importance to  all production sectors that are willing to work and invest to  rebuild and revive the national economy.    8. We acknowledge the existence of the struggle among  interests and classes in society, but we do not conclude, a  priori, from this that the national bourgeoisie will be our  mortal enemy. Those who are prepared to work for the rule of law  with political and economic democracy and social justice will  find in Sandinism a serious, responsible interlocutor and a  strong ally in opposing the capricious economic policies of the  current government, which are crushing producers, merchants, and  production in general.  <H5>  [25 March] </H5>   9. The governments of the United States have sponsored  interventions against and authoritarian, aggressive regimes in  our country. We cannot forget this. Nevertheless, the United  States is the most profitable market for the products that a  developing Nicaraguan economy would put out. The American people  are not and never have been our enemy. We are willing to work  consistently to hammer out lasting agreements with the U.S.  Government for a new type of relationship based on international  law and respect for the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan nation.    10. No sector of Sandinism is calling for the  nationalization  of the economy or the doctrine of the single party or communism  as Sandinism's ideology. What Sandinism opposes uncompromisingly  is neoliberalism, as we try to push an alternative economic  agenda based on actual conditions in Nicaragua. Accordingly, we  Sandinists propose the agenda of the new economic players as a  challenge to society.    Just as we respect private property, we demand the  progressive right to promote and encourage the democratization  of ownership. We promote and encourage all forms of associative,  communal, and cooperative ownership, the APT [Workers Ownership  Sector], and joint ventures as new elements in an economic  democratization that offers an alternative to the voracity of  brutal capitalism.    11. We Sandinists acknowledge the existence and legitimacy  of  individual leaders in our party at all levels. Above and beyond  personal merits, these leaderships, which have different degrees  and looks, are the fruit of the collective revolutionary  struggle of the FSLN. In this regard, our main leader is the  people and our party.  <H5>  Turnover of Leadership </H5>   We advocate the efficient turnover of leaders at all levels  and the right to recall leaders in accordance with the FSLN's  bylaws. However, a true turnover that goes beyond the necessary  replacement of individuals means an updating of our program and  forms of organization, innovative work methods, and above all,  creative methods of struggle.    12. The involvement of women in the struggle of the FSLN has  been unquestionable, but their presence in leadership bodies has  been stemmed. This situation must be resolved positively at the  Congress; in so doing, we will not only be serving justice but  also strengthening the Sandinist Front. In regard to this latter  point, young people are legitimately demanding their priority  place in the Sandinist agenda.    13. We Sandinists cannot remain indifferent to the obvious  signs of the renewed outbreak of Somozism. We cannot tolerate  any attempt to return to a revanchist, authoritarian,  neo-Somozist government. This would represent a return to  political instability, and we must call for the broadest  alliance to confront this number one enemy of the nation's peace  and stability.    14. The Sandinists Front's most important material asset is  the property in the hands of individual peasants, cooperative  members, retirees, and worker enterprises. The defense of this  asset is our main task. Nevertheless, this Congress will have to  clarify the status of the party's assets proper once and for all.    15. The FSLN must come out decisively and definitively for  the autonomy of the Atlantic Coast and the regulation thereof.  The wealth and resources of the coast must benefit those  communities first and foremost and must support a regional  government that acts to serve this purpose.    16. All of the above will not guarantee renewal unless the  FSLN truly begins to play its role as the main opposition party.  Consequently, anything that smacks of joint government must  disappear quickly and definitively from our political conduct.</p>

Cao Hengli, director of the Shanghai Customs Office, said  that imports via the Shanghai port, the largest of its kind in  China, shot up nearly 29 percent in 1993 to 16.95 billion U.S.  dollars, while exports through Shanghai climbed almost 17  percent to 13.98 billion U.S. dollars.    He described the growth in international container  transportation via Shanghai as the most "impressive." the port  handled a total of 901,000 standard containers last year,  roughly up by 58 percent.    For the first time, the number of people leaving and  entering  China via Shanghai topped the two million mark in 1993, at a  record 2.53 million, Cao said.    "We did everything in our power to assist the development  and  construction of the Pudong New Area and the Waigaoqiao Free  Trade Zone, to boost exports from Shanghai, and to accelerate  infrastructure construction and growth of new- and  high-technology industries."    For example, procedures for customs declarations and tariff  reductions and exemptions were simplified last year.    To date, Shanghai, China's leading manufacturing center, has  formed eight bonded enterprise groups, 187 bonded factories and  297 bonded warehouses, the director said.    Moreover, the Shanghai Customs Office continued to crack  down  on all kinds of smuggling activities in 1993, he said.    Last year, the office cleared up 526 smuggling cases  involving smuggled goods worth a total of 222 million yuan  (about 25 million U.S. dollars).    Cao Hengli pledged to step up reforms in passenger  inspection, ship inspection and bonded goods handling in the new  year.</p>

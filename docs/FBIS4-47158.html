			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Ginzburg, candidate of economic </F> sciences and vice president of the State Center Bank, by Vadim  Yuryev, VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent; place and date not  given: "Money Was the First To Withdraw"]    [Text] Well, finally, it happened--inflation went  into a slump in recent months. And according to May's results,  the government has every reason to celebrate yet another  record--according to data of the Center for Economic Conditions,  inflation amounted to only 8.1 percent last month.    Such a low indicator has not been seen in Russia since  August  of 1992. As a consequence of this, the Central Bank has begun to  smoothly lower the cost of centralized credits. There is, it  would seem, one more happy fact: Retail prices for consumer  goods in the first quarter increased by only 45 percent--the  lowest indicator for the last two years. But somehow there is no  desire to rejoice over this--these victories on the financial  front came at too high a price: Industrial enterprises are being  shut down, unemployment is increasing, and the purchasing power  of the population is dropping. Our correspondent asked Yakov  Ginzburg, a candidate of economic sciences and now the vice  president of the State Center Bank, to comment on the situation.  Before this he was the director of the scientific-consultation  and information center of the Association of Siberian and Far  Eastern Cities.    [Yuryev] Yakov Sadkovich, can the sharp drop in the rate of  inflation be considered an indication of approaching economic  prosperity?    [Ginzburg] No. What is more, this, possibly, is approaching  a  very grave crisis, when there will be a shortage of both money  and commodities. If we are talking about the situation in the  country as a whole, then it should be noted that no fundamental  changes have occurred yet. The level of inflation has been  reduced by artificial methods--the tactic of postponed  decisions. As before, the government is making decisions about  the issuance of large credits, but those corporations that  should receive them are including the promised money in  estimates, and, counting on it, they are drawing up programs and  plans, and sometimes they even take credits on the basis of  expected credits, but once the additional money supply feeding  does not occur, although the expenditure mechanism is  functioning as before, then the pool gradually begins to dry up.  I liked the expression of one of the television commentators: He  said that we have been observing the competition between the  amount of money and the amount of commodities for a long  time--what will come to an end sooner? Now we see: Money was the  first to withdraw.    But the requirement for money also fell--however strange  this  may sound. Because the rates for credits in banks were very  high: Even our most profitable industry--trade--can no longer  take money at 300 percent annual interest. And a paradoxical  situation arose. While money was in short supply, a surplus of  it developed--there was money in the banks, but they cannot give  it to anyone at such a high percent--at such rates, a real  return simply will not occur. (According to my data, the rate of  unrecoverability has already reached a colossal level--80  percent.) Therefore, in order to hold out in the system of  monetary circulation, nothing is left for the banks to do but to  make money more accessible; that is, to lower the cost of  credit, which is what is occurring now. Incidentally, the  situation on the interbank money exchanges is one more indicator  that money has become in short supply. Note that the dollar  exchange rate is increasing, but the volume of sales is  continuously falling. Inasmuch as there is no free money, money  is not coming to the currency market, either.    [Yuryev] But this situation in the financial sphere has most  of all hit not banks, but industrial enterprises--it is they  that are shutting down....    [Ginzburg] Yes, the most unfortunate thing is that this  situation could lead to a shutdown of industrial production; it  cannot live without money. And nothing in the economic situation  has occurred that would stimulate the development of production.  The system of voucher circulation, which has been talked about  so much for so long in the government, did not take root, and it  did not become the means of overcoming the crisis of the system  of nonpayments for various reasons.    [Yuryev] It turns out that the high level of inflation that  there was, for example, last year, is a lesser evil in  comparison with today's 8-9 percent inflation per month?    [Ginzburg] Yes, the spiraling inflation fed production at  least through trade. But now even this feeding is  disappearing--trade is becoming insolvent, and the volume of  supply of goods has become threateningly large--commercial  organizations are becoming overloaded with unsold commodities.  Therefore, many trade organizations are now beginning to prepare  in good time for the approaching crisis, which is forecast for  autumn.    [Yuryev] How are they preparing?    [Ginzburg] They are selling commodities and not buying new  ones. I judge this also because commercial banks have lately  been receiving more and more proposals from trade enterprises  about placing money into long-term deposits.    There is no sense in accusing our bankers, including  Ginzburg  as well, of a reluctance to support collapsing production. As  was noted by one Western economist, money is cowardly--it will  go only where there is a reliable legislative base, and it is  clear what kind--a taxation system, political stability, and the  like. But our country, from the standpoint of attractiveness for  the investor, according to the assessments of American experts,  is somewhere at the 150th place, yielding even to Vietnam.    For a resolution of all of these problems that scare off  "cowardly" money, obviously, large financial resources are  required. Where are they to be gotten? The answer to this  question must lie in the state budget. But the budget for this  year, it can be said, is already past, and it will not be able  to play the role of a main financial plan. Thus, a lowering in  the rates of inflation in the first half of the year, which,  unquestionably, is an economic success, will have a positive  effect only in the event that it is used for systemic  reorganizations. Otherwise, the successes of the beginning of  the year will turn out to be not more than a short pause in the  many years of inflation increases, the consequences of which  will be difficult to predict.</p>

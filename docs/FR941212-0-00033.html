			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the Commission incurs additional costs by carefully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing each tariff commodity description to make tariffs clearer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more accessible to the shipping public. This review goes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond what is required by the statutory tariff filing provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current practice of extensively reviewing commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> descriptions represents an additional cost and confers an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent public benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, it is not possible to quantify the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission costs in reviewing tariff and ET filings that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the provision of an independent public benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it appears that the approach urged by the commenters_that is, the even division of these costs between filers and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public at large_is the most equitable way of resolving the issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the Commission is reducing the proposed tariff and ET  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing fees by 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters have argued that the imposition of any tariff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing fee is an undue burden on the ocean transportation industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They point out that the proposed filing fees would be a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional cost to what they have already spent to convert their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tariffs to the ATFI system. Commenters also submit that the tariff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing fee could prompt carriers to file tariff information in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more generic manner, and could have a chilling effect on the filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of independent actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the Commission's own assessment and the broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry position that tariff and ET filing fees impose an undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on the industry, the Commission will seek an OMB exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for imposing these fees. Under OMB Circular A&hyph;25, an agency may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request that OMB grant the agency an exception from OMB's general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy of assessing fees, permitting the agency to forego assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees if conditions exist to justify an exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to those discussed above, respondents comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of other issues concerning tariff and ET filing fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JCG, PRMSA, and the Japan Conferences raise questions about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission's methodology in calculating the proposed fees. JCG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Japan Conferences question the Commission's methodology as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being less than thorough, and argue that the Commission was unclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in describing its time allocation methodology. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> JCG contends that it is premature to propose user fees based on services provided under a system,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  ATFI, that is still being developed and the costs now being incurred are probably not an accurate measure of what should be allocated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in the NPR, the Commission employed the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available data to calculate the proposed filing fees, employing inhouse surveys to determine the time and cost involved in providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular services. Extensive time and motion studies are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily required. See Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d at 736&hyph;37.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB Circular A&hyph;25 provides that the ``full cost [of a service] shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined or estimated from the best available records of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency, and new cost accounting systems need not be established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely for this purpose [setting fees].'' Section 6d(1)(e). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission need only provide ``some reasonable basis for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusions.'' Engine Manufacturers, 20 F. 3d at 1177. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology employed by the Commission satisfies this standard. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> National Association of Broadcasters v.

Cir. 1976), nothing that ``[t]he ability to recoup both direct and indirect costs to the Government does allow for some range and latitute in effecting a reasonable attribution of costs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to providing an extensive explanation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's methodology to calculate its proposed fees, the NPR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also indicated that a detailed summary of the data used to arrive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proposed fees was available to the public from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission. To our knowledge, only one commenter availed itself of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this opportunity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the comment that it is premature to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a user fee for ATFI, the Commission explained in the NPR that OMB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed the Commission to pursue establishing a tariff filing fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1994. Further, the Commission employed the best available data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to calculate the proposed fees. Moreover, the Commission intends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to periodically update tariff filing fees, adjusting for changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs as warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Japan Conferences question the Commission's calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of indirect costs assignable to fee-related services. They further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question why the Commission included the proportional costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several FMC bureaus and offices <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  that are only peripherally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved with tariff filing, suggesting that such expenses be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced by at least 50 percent. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Office of the Commissioners, General Counsel, Bureau of Administration, and Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Japan Conferences urge that the proportional cost of the Office of the Secretary be entirely deducted from the indirect cost calculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in the NPR, the FMC generally adopted the ICC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology for determining indirect costs because the ICC's fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule and methodologies have been reviewed by the courts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally deemed acceptable. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  See Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 722. Although we developed an indirect cost methodology based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the ICC's experience, we nevertheless deducted a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses to calculate the FMC's indirect costs. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICC employs an indirect cost item for operations overhead, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportions senior executive time across fee-generating activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we were able to account for senior executive time in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service item, a separate overhead item would be redundant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, this ICC component was not included in the FMC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations. Additionally, in calculating our indirect costs, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deducted certain expenses that have no nexus with any fee activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the office general and administrative component of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect cost calculation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  buying Census data).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Japan Conference also point out that the Commission's indirect costs, calculated at 99.5 percent of direct costs, is more than 50 percent higher than the ICC's indirect costs reviewed in Central &amp; Southern, supra 777 F.2d at 726&hyph;27. However, the Japan Conferences fail to take into account that the ICC's indirect costs cited in Central &amp; Southern were calculated almost ten years ago, and that the ICC's current indirect cost factor is 100.8 percent, slightly higher than that of the FMC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

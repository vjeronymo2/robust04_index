			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: MARLEY yesterday signalled further gloom in the construction sector by forecasting its first annual dividend cut in almost 20 years, in spite of higher interim profits. Sir George Russell, chairman, said the building products group had 'cut everything else . . . It is time the dividends take their share of the pressure.' About Pounds 20m had been cut from costs since 1990, including 3,000 job losses. Further costs savings of about Pounds 8m had been identified worldwide. Short of a 'miracle in demand', Sir George said, the total dividend was likely to be cut by a third to 4.2p. The interim is maintained at 2.1p, forcing the company to dip into reserves for the third consecutive year. Earnings per share fell from 2.2p to 2.1p. The dividend forecast will be grim news for the UK construction industry, despite the company's announcement of a small increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 9.4m) for the six months to June 30. Marley, which was the first to warn of recession in 1989, is considered to be the most likely candidate to spot any UK upturn. The bulk of the improvement came from strong growth overseas and lower interest charges. Sales fell to Pounds 280m (Pounds 282m), due to a 4 per cent decline in the UK to Pounds 160m (Pounds 167m). Net debt fell by Pounds 25m to Pounds 100m, with interest payments declining from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.3m. Gearing stood at less than 50 per cent. Strong demand in the former east German market for DIY plastics products and a significant improvement in the US bricks business helped boost overseas operating profits by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 10.9m. In the UK, profits fell by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.5m. The bricks and tiles businesses doubled losses to Pounds 800,000, due largely to difficulties in the UK market. Sir George said price cutting continued to put pressure on building product margins, with no sign of recovery. Property disposals were Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 1.7m. Plumbing and flooring contributed profits of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 11.3m), while automotive components rose by a third to Pounds 1.2m. The higher tax charge of Pounds 3.9m was due to irrecoverable advance corporation tax. In addition a Pounds 3.6m extraordinary charge was settlement of a dispute over a vehicle leasing business sold to T Cowie in 1987 for Pounds 17m. After Pounds 5.9m in dividend payments, Marley recorded a retained loss of Pounds 3.7m. Marley also announced the closure of two insulation brick factories - in Northumberland and Manchester - with 200 job losses. The factory closures alone would result in annual cost savings of about Pounds 4m, Sir George said. The shares closed 2p down at 78p. See Lex</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The methodology summarized above is applied to adjust the RQs of individual hazardous substances. An additional process applies to RCRA listed wastes, which contain individual hazardous substances as constituents. As the Agency has stated (54 FR 33440, August 14, 1989), to assign an RQ to a RCRA waste, the Agency determines the RQ for each constituent of the waste and then assigns the lowest of these constituent RQs to the waste itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Adjusted RQs for U408 and K140. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Waste U408 is 2,4,6-tribromophenol, an individual hazardous substance. It has been evaluated for four of the six primary RQ adjustment criteria_aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity, ignitability, and reactivity_and the secondary adjustment criteria (BHP). Based on this evaluation, the Agency today is proposing an adjusted RQ of 100 pounds for 2,4,6-tribromophenol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's evaluations of 2,4,6-tribromophenol for the other two primary RQ adjustment criteria (chronic toxicity and potential carcinogenicity) are not yet complete. If, when completed, these evaluations result in an RQ lower than the 100-pound RQ proposed today, the Agency will repropose the RQ for 2,4,6-tribromophenol at the lower level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other waste, K140, is a waste stream with only one hazardous constituent_2,4,6-tribromophenol. Therefore, in accordance with the RQ adjustment methodology described above, an adjusted RQ of 100 pounds is being proposed today for K140. Because the RQ for K140 is based on the RQ for 2,4,6-tribromophenol, any reproposal of the 2,4,6-tribromophenol RQ required by further evaluation will be accompanied by a corresponding reproposal of the RQ for K140.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), whenever an Agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) that describes the impact of the rule on small entities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions). No RFA is required, however, if the head of the Agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since EPA has determined the hazardous wastes proposed for listing here are not generated by small entities (as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act), and the Agency believes that small entities will not generate them in significant quantities, this regulation, therefore, does not require a RFA. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Compliance and Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 3010 Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, when new hazardous wastes are listed, all persons who generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose the newly listed wastes(s) are required to notify either EPA, or a State authorized by EPA to operate the hazardous waste program, of their activities pursuant to Section 3010 of RCRA. However, under the Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;482), EPA was given the option of waiving the notification requirement for persons who handle wastes that are covered by today's proposed listing and already have notified EPA that they manage other hazardous wastes and have received an EPA identification number. This waiver is being proposed because of the likelihood that persons managing today's proposed wastes already are managing one or more hazardous wastes that generally are associated with the generation of proposed EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K140 and U408 and, therefore, have previously notified EPA and received an EPA identification number. In the event that any person who generates, transports, treats, stores, or disposes these wastes and has not previously notified and received an identification number, that person must obtain an identification number pursuant to 40 CFR 262.12 before that person can generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose of these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Compliance Dates for Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed listings will be promulgated pursuant to HSWA. HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized States at the same time as in unauthorized States. Therefore, EPA will regulate the wastes being proposed today until States are authorized to regulate these wastes. Once these regulations are promulgated in a final rule by EPA, the Agency will apply these Federal regulations to these wastes and to their management in both authorized and unauthorized States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

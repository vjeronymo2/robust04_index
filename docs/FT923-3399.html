			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco line placed FOOD retailer Tesco had one of the busiest sessions in recent weeks after Hoare Govett, the London securities house, placed the large line of stock which has been hanging over the market for some time. Hoare placed the block of 5m shares with institutions at around 208p. The share price at first eased a penny on the placing but rallied to close 3 up at 211p on suggestions that Tesco might have been a beneficiary from switching out of rival Argyll Group, whose shares fell 7 to 325p. Turnover in Tesco reached 15m, just shy of the year's highest daily total. Argyll traded 3.3m. Food group rallies Food manufacturing group United Biscuits had a volatile but busy session after reporting interim figures below market expectations and issuing a warning over profits for the full year. The shares fell sharply in early trading on the news of profits of Pounds 70m, down from Pounds 84.4m, and compared with market expectations of around Pounds 75m; it also warned that profits will be lower at the year-end. At the day's worst the shares were down 13 at 222p. However an optimistic meeting with analysts at which confidence in a maintained final dividend was restored, coupled with renewed bid speculation, caused a turnaround in the shares mid-morning. They closed up 24 at to 259p on the highest daily turnover this year of 9.6m shares. Smith New Court reduced its full year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 170m but classed the shares on a 'short term buy,' suggesting they had been oversold and now offered an attractive yield. Nomura also trimmed its forecast, reducing its profit estimate from Pounds 186m to Pounds 170.5m. Arjo Wiggins weak Arjo Wiggins, the paper manufacturing and distribution group, was one of the worst performers among the Footsie constituents. The shares retreated a further 8 to 180p, the lowest level since January 1981; turnover was a hefty 2.2m shares. Dealers attributed the decline to nervousness ahead of the interim figures due next Tuesday. The group posted profits of Pounds 135.5m in the first half last year but several analysts expect pre-tax profits to dip below Pounds 100m this time. The big dollar earners powered ahead as the US currency appreciated against other currencies. Glaxo, also helped by a good Press response to its preliminary results, jumped 21 1/2 to 767 1/2 p, having touched 778p; turnover reached a hefty 5.5m shares. SmithKline Beecham moved up 9 to 489p on 3m, while Wellcome advanced 21 to 869p. Reuter put on 21 to 1117p. The oil sector, whose earnings stream is almost entirely priced in dollars, was among the market's best performers as the US currency surged higher against all the major currencies. Additionally boosted by the dividend increase announced on Thursday afternoon, Shell improved a further 7 to 474p on 3.4m while BP, bought aggressively by US investors, jumped 5 1/2 to 197 1/2 p on 9.2m. Enterprise Oil, back in favour after delivering better than expected interim numbers earlier in the week, pushed up 11 more to 328p on good turnover of 2.9m while a single trade of 1.9m Lasmo at 125 1/2 p early in the session triggered some big activity in the shares which settled 2 up at 126p. Burmah Castrol, a strong market since the increased interim dividend at the start of the month, marked their re-election-entry to the list of Footsie constituents with a jump of 12 to 585p. Bank shares, despite their recent good performances relative to the market, were among the front runners as dealers, thought to be running short books, hoisted prices to try to tempt sellers into the market. Dealers said institutions had focussed on 'safe' areas of themarket and settled on the clearing banks as offering good yields and safe dividends. Barclays attracted the heaviest turnover and 14 higher at 314p with 6m traded. Lloyds, given an additional boost by a 'buy' recommendation published by BZW, raced up 13 to 411p on 2.6m. The broker highlighted the probability that Lloyds would be able to pay above average dividend increases and still increase its net assets at well above the rate of inflation this year and next. NatWest gained 11 to 330p on 2.3m, while TSB put on 4 to 131p on 3.4m. Abbey National added 5 at 270p albeit in relatively thin trading of less than 1m. First National Finance tumbled just before the close, sliding 5 to 17p. Insurances attracted sustained support, with Commercial Union (up 17 at 492p) and General Accident (8 higher at 448p) prominent in the composites. Prudential, one of the best performers among the Footsie after excellent interim announced in midweek, added 4 more at 249p. Legal &amp; General jumped 7 to 315p with the market expecting the group to reveal interim profits in the region of Pounds 75m next Thursday but still concerned about potential losses in the domestic mortgage indemnity market. Willis Corroon, to be removed from the Footsie list next month, received a substantial boost from the upsurge in the dollar, closing 9 firmer at 165p. Turnover in British Steel rose to 23m shares as the shares improved 2 to 51 1/2 p, boosted by US buying. Demand for the stock from the US remains buoyant and a group of US analysts is at present in the UK visiting the company. The number of shares in the hands of US investors is now estimated to be around 21 per cent of total equity. Hopes of an early agreement on a new five year coal supply contract continued to drive shares of the generators higher. National Power added 4 more at 261p and PowerGen 3 to 273p. Kalon, the paint manufacturer which recently lost out in its bid to gain control of Manders, dropped 4 to 79 1/2 p despite a denial of market rumours of lost contracts. The building materials/contracting sectors put on a brave performance, after a week in which some of the sector leaders announced big losses and dividend cuts. The sector was also hit by downgrades and sell recommendations. Tarmac, after big cuts in its bricks division, rose 3 to 59p. Investors took on board advise from County NatWest to switch out of Granada Group and into Thorn EMI. The former shed 3 to 237p, as the latter firmed 2 to 671p. Brewers experienced a bumpy ride. Guinness shed 6 to 517p, on talk of a planned acquisition and a profits downgrade from the company's broker Cazennove. Volume reached 4.2m. Allied Lyons was also out of favour after two securities houses cut their forecasts. Lehman Brothers reduced the current year figure by Pounds 32m to Pounds 660m, and the following year's by Pounds 65m to Pounds 725m blaming current weakness of the economy in both the UK and the US and the weaker dollar for the cut. The shares ended a penny lower at 550p, after turnover of 2.5m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (13).

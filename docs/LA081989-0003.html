			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS HAVE GLASNOST, WE HAVE MOTLEY CRUE  </P> <P> How truly sad when the best that America can provide for glasnost at the Moscow  Peace Festival is the correct pronunciation of the F-word by the Motley Crue  rock group ("Moscow Marathon," by Robert Hilburn, Aug. 11).  </P> <P> One would have hoped that this tasteless collection of morons would have  followed the lead of Jon Bon Jovi in politely learning a few words of Russian.  </P> <P> Instead we in the United States must witness how certain bands fit very well  into the "Ugly American" mold.  </P> <P> R. GALLEGOS  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Policy Letter 93&hyph;1, Supplement No. 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subject: Management Oversight of Service Contracting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this supplement to Policy Letter 93&hyph;1 is to provide agencies with a more ``results-oriented'' approach to managing and administering service contracts by introducing the ``best practices'' concept. The Policy Letter was issued on November 19, 1993 and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63593). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following changes are being made to the Policy Letter: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Section 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Definition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The second sentence is revised to read: For purposes of this Policy Letter, only nonpersonal services obtained under contract are covered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Exclusions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The second paragraph is revised to read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services obtained under contracts below the small purchase threshold, through the use of interagency agreements, and that are incidental to supply contracts also are excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter. However, agencies should ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and use good management practices and contract administration techniques when using these contracting methods to obtain services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Good Management Practices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The second introductory paragraph is revised to read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following sections offer guidance to ensure that good management practices are being followed. Agencies should involve procurement and program officials when developing requirements for service contracts. Appendix A contains a series of questions to help analyze and perfect service contract requirements within these guidelines. If the guidelines apply, and if the response to any of the questions listed in the Appendix is affirmative, agencies should ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and use good management practices and contract administration techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Responsibilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraphs a., b., and d. are revised to read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Heads of Agencies. Agency heads (or their designees) should ensure that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Requirements for services are clearly defined and appropriate performance standards are developed so that contractor performance meets contract terms and conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Service contracts are awarded and administered in such a manner that will provide the customer its goods and services on time, and within budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Specific procedures are in place when contracting for services to assure compliance with OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental Functions (57 FR 45096 (1992), 91&hyph;2, Service Contracting (56 FR 15110 (1991), and 89&hyph;1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants, 54 FR 51805 (1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Implementation strategies are developed and necessary staff training is initiated to assure effective implementation of these policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Contracting Officials. Contracting officials should ensure that ``best practice'' techniques, such as those set forth below, are used when contracting for services: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The corporate experience section of a contractor's bid proposal should be reviewed to detect conflicts of interest. Usually, the corporate experience section contains the contractor's prior business clients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Monthly progress reports should be reviewed to detect whether the contractor may be performing inherently governmental functions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contracting officials should also seek other best practices techniques in contract management and administration that may be used within their own contracting activities or other agencies that will help to achieve excellence in contractor performance. OFPP will also be working to develop governmentwide ``best practices'' models in contract administration which will be issued as separate guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Inspectors General. The Inspectors General are encouraged to conduct vulnerability assessments of service contracting and, where warranted, include in their annual plans a review of service contracts to ensure compliance with the Policy Letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance in section 7 which refers to the questions in appendix A, and any resulting ``best practices'' models developed by OFPP should not be viewed as mandatory regulatory guidance for audit purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other provisions of the Policy Letter remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Information Contact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  For information regarding this Supplement, contact Linda G.

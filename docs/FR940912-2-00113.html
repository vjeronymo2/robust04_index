The planning review area encompasses 5,457 acres of BLM-administered public land in the Cody Resource Area of the BLM's Worland District in Big Horn County, Wyoming. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The planning review is being conducted to evaluate the management needs and issues associated with the discovery of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allosaurus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> skeleton in the review area. The discovery was made approximately 1 year after the approval of the Cody Resource Management Plan (RMP) and a review of the RMP is needed to evaluate the adequacy of existing management decisions for the management and protection of paleontological resources in the review area. Management actions being considered include designation of the review area as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) and closure of the area to the staking and development of mining claims and closure to entry under the land laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on preliminary analysis, BLM has established a temporary closure to the staking of mining claims in the planning review area. As part of the planning review, BLM has collected information and conducted analyses described in this Environmental Assessment to determine whether a long-term closure is necessary for the protection of paleontological resources. Based on the results, the Cody RMP will be amended, if necessary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received by November 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Tom Hare, Team Leader, Cody Resource Area, P.O.

Protective measures have been initiated and have been in effect pending completion of this planning review. This planning review includes opportunities for public participation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The steps followed for this planning review are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. An interdisciplinary planning team described and analyzed the existing management in the planning review area and described the affected environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  informing the public of known and anticipated issues and of opportunities for public participation and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Public contracts and meetings were held for scoping and development of the preliminary issues and alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. With the help of the public, management alternatives for the area were formulated and analyzed and the BLM's preferred alternative was identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The alternatives, including the BLM's preferred alternative, and their environmental consequences are described in the EA and the EA is now being issued for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A 60-day period will be provided for reviewing and commenting on the EA and for submitting protests on any proposed decisions to be added to or changed in the Cody RMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The EA will then be revised, as necessary, and a decision record will be issued. If necessary, this decision record will identify and include any needed amendment to the Cody RMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the public's input and analysis by the BLM interdisciplinary team, the following issues were identified:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Whether or not there is a need to protect important paleontological resources from being damaged by potential surface-disturbing activities in the planning review area, including closure to and withdrawal from possible mining claim and mining-related activities and from possible entry under the land laws (for example, Desert Land Entry).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Whether or not the area should be designated an ACEC with management emphasis primarily for research, public education, and recreation, associated with the significant paleontological resources in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The four alternatives analyzed in the EA are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. No Action (continuation of existing management).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Designating an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on protection of fossils for scientific research and public education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Designating an ACEC of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on protection of fossils for scientific research and public education, and with mineral location and land law withdrawals of the known fossil concentration area (120.9 acres).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Designating an ACEC of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on protection of fossils for scientific research and public education, and with mineral location and land law withdrawals of the fossil concentration areas and adjacent lands (approximately 4,182 acres). The BLM's preferred alternative is Alternative 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designating the planning review area an ACEC with a 120.9-acre mineral withdrawal under the 1872 Mining Law and withdrawal from operation of land laws represents what the BLM believes is the best balance between the public land and resource uses and environmental protection in the planning review area. The various impacts that would be expected from implementing each of the Alternatives is also presented in the EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the end of the comment/protest period, any of the decisions mentioned above or similar decisions based on public comment would amend the Cody RMP at the time a Decision Record is issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the analysis of potential environmental impacts contained in the EA, it has been determined that impacts are not expected to be significant and an Environmental Impact Statement is not needed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert A.

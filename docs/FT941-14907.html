			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Yeltsin 'to continue reform' without Gaidar President Boris Yeltsin yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian government's leading economic reformer, but said he would continue bold economic and political reforms in spite of widespread fears to the contrary. 'I would like particularly to stress the unchangeability of the president's course towards deep and democratic reform of Russian society, its economy and political institutions,' Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said. However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the other prominent reformer in the government, later announced he had been asked to stay on as finance minister but without his present rank as a deputy prime minister. He said he was still deciding how to respond. But the removal of Mr Fyodorov's other title appeared to bury suggestions that Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, would make every effort to retain him as a symbol of continuity for the country and for western creditors and aid donors. Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc led by Mr Gaidar, said yesterday that Mr Gaidar's resignation as first deputy prime minister would help place responsibil- ity for hyperinflationary policies and other 'dangerous' decisions squarely on Mr Chernomyrdin. Mr Fyodorov was also said to be considering leaving Russia's Choice. His resignation from either the bloc or the government would leave the field clear for Russia's Choice to go into open opposition while Mr Chernomyrdin attempts to woo Communists, some ultra-nationalists and an ill-defined centre ground. Mr Gennady Ziuganov, leader of the Communist party, welcomed Mr Gaidar's departure and said he would co-operate with any government which abandoned policies that had impoverished the nation. His reaction was echoed by the other powerful anti-liberal parties in the new State Duma, or lower chamber. Mr Yeltsin is due to meet Mr Chernomyrdin today to discuss the final shape of the government. There is now little doubt that it will be dominated by former heads of state industry whose priority is to pump money into ailing farms and industrial enterprises. The rouble fell to a new low yesterday in response to Mr Gaidar's departure. From Russia's Choice only Mr Anatoly Chubais, confirmed as deputy prime minister to complete a privatisation programme, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, who has adjusted his policies to growing nationalist sentiment at home, are likely to remain in government.

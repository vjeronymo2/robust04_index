			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Elections: Nine Upsets in Second </F> Round of Balloting"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 27 -- The second ballot (held  Sunday [26 June]) of local elections overturned the results of  the first ballot (on June 12) in nine out of twenty-seven  occasions.    In the runoffs for mayor, in six cases the candidate who  came  in second in the first round of balloting was elected in the  second. This was the case in Asti (where Bianchino won with 56.9  percent after gleaning only 28.7 percent in the first ballot  when Nosenzo took 34.4 percent); in Catanzaro (where Gualtieri  won with 55.1 percent after receiving only 31.8 percent the  first time around when Laquaniti took 40.9 percent); in Messina  (where Providenti won with 60.1 percent; 26.9 in the first round  when Carmona took 32.1); in Oristani (Scarpa 52.9 percent; 19.7  percent in the first round when Martinez took 30.1); and in  Siracusa (where Fatuzzo won with 54.1 pecent; 31.6 in the first  ballot when D'Ali took 36.1 percent).    The same thing occurred to candidates for provincial  president in three Sicilian cities: Agrigento (where Vivacqua  won with 51.2 percent after capturing only 25.0 percent in the  first ballot when Russello took 46.3 percent); in Enna (where  Galvagno won with 54.7 percent; 22.1 in the first ballot when  Villari took 26.3 percent) and in Trapani (where Spitaleri won  with 56.7 percent; 30.0 percent in the first ballot when  Mariscalco took 49.9 percent).</p>

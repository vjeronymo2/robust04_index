			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley profits drop 35% Morgan Stanley yesterday announced a 35 per cent drop in third-quarter profits to Dollars 118m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, as the Wall Street firm followed the rest of the US securities industry in reporting sharply weaker earnings for the latest period. Like the rest of Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's revenues from its investment banking and trading businesses have been weak this year because of rising interest rates and a severe downturn in the US bond market. Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley's chairman, said yesterday business conditions remained difficult, although he expressed confidence in the outlook for the firm's overseas businesses. Net revenues totalled Dollars 910m in the quarter, down from the Dollars 1.03bn recorded a year earlier. The bulk of that decline was attributable to a 36 per cent drop in revenues from Morgan Stanley's investment banking operations, which have been hard hit by the sharp drop in demand from corporations for securities underwriting services. The fall in investment banking revenues would have been worse, however, but for another strong showing from the firm's mergers and acquisitions department, which continues to benefit from the recent series of big deals among US and international corporations. On the trading side, Morgan Stanley posted a 4 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 297m, but the performance was not particularly impressive because trading in the same quarter of 1993 was hit by losses on mortgage-backed securities. In the second quarter a year ago, for example, the firm earned Dollars 517m from its trading business. Revenues from trading in the latest quarter were also hurt by a rise in the cost of financing the inventory of bonds Morgan Stanley uses for its customer and proprietary trading business. This rise was evident in the 14 per cent increase in interest expenses during the quarter. Among its other revenues streams, earnings from commissions were essentially flat at Dollars 104m, interest and dividend income was up 9 per cent at Dollars 1.7bn, while fees from asset management and administration services climbed 42 per cent to Dollars 95m. The slide in overall revenues helped reduce Morgan Stanley's compensation costs, which fell 12 per cent to Dollars 460m in the quarter. Other costs categories were mostly little changed in the period. Although the profits fall was expected, Morgan Stanley's share prices fell on the New York Stock Exchange, closing Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 61 7/8 .</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Investment trusts savings schemes jump 41% Savings through investment trusts savings schemes jumped 41 per cent in the first quarter of this year to Pounds 67.9m, compared with Pounds 48.1m in the first quarter of 1993, Gillian O'Connor writes. In the financial year 1993-94 as a whole they rose 91 per cent to Pounds 259.4m. This was in addition to the Pounds 293.7m invested through personal equity plans in 1993-94. The rise in purchases of investment trusts by private investors mirrors recent strong growth in sales of unit trusts, another popular way into the stockmarket. Net unit trust sales rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2,531m in the first quarter of 1994, with Peps accounting for the majority of retail sales. New issues of investment trusts have also been very strong this year. So far 22 new issues have raised a total of Pounds 2.26bn.</p>

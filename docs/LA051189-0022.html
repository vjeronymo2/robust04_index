			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM?  </P> <P> Harold and Candance Thorp have joined the line-up of families trying to get the  government, the tobacco companies, the auto manufacturers, and so on into the  night, to pay for their own bad judgment. Like the people who tried to stop  smoking, but couldn't, Candy Thorp went to alcohol treatment programs, but  couldn't, or wouldn't, stop drinking. Is it possible that two adults in this  society thought that drinking a quart of bourbon a night was an OK prenatal  diet?  </P> <P> The Thorps should be charged with filing a frivolous lawsuit. Candy Thorp  should be charged with reckless child endangerment.  </P> <P> Our courts are overcrowded as it is, and criminals are out on bail because they  can't get a speedy trial. In the meantime, people like the Thorps are in court  trying to get rich on the misfortune of their son, who had the bad luck to be  born to a couple of irresponsible drunks.  </P> <P> DIANE SILVER, Arleta  </P></p>

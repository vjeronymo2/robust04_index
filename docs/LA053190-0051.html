			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> TEACHERS PLAN TO FIGHT NEW RULES ON ABSENCES  </P> <P> Teachers in the Compton schools said they will mount a legal fight against a  resolution passed by the school board Tuesday night requiring employees to  provide written proof of the need for any absences.  </P> <P> The resolution is an attempt by the board to thwart incidents of the so-called  blue flu, the one-day "sick-ins" that teachers have staged since March to  protest stalled contract negotiations.  </P> <P> Under state law, the board cannot pass measures on topics that are covered by  the contract, said Wiley Jones, executive director of the Compton Education  Assn., which represents the district's approximately 1,000 teachers. The  contract, Jones said, does not require teachers to bring written proof for  one-day absences.  </P> <P> The vote on the resolution, which was 4-2, came after the board went behind  closed doors for more than three hours. Board members Kelvin D. Filer and Lynn  Dymally Lee voted against it. Trustee John Steward was absent.  </P></p>

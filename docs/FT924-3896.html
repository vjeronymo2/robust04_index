			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec fails to talk up oil price TELEPHONE DIPLOMACY briefly talked up the oil price yesterday as ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to restore oil traders' faith in last week's agreement. But futures traders remain sceptical that Opec can stop the slide in world oil prices, which have lost over Dollars 1 a barrel since last week. In volatile trading, the price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery closed at Dollars 18.15 a barrel, a drop of 25 cents. Brent prices had recovered slightly after a weak opening, following strong statements from Opec, but the market lost its gains at the close of trading. 'The Opec agreement is all right under the circumstances but with a surplus in product stocks, it was just not enough,' said Mr Andy LeBow, a trader at ED &amp; F. Mann in New York. Prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange weakened after a report by the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday that US crude stocks rose by 1.08m barrels last week to 325.15m barrels. The January crude futures price slipped 33 cents yesterday to Dollars 19.12 a barrel. Opec is stressing that last week's agreement to cut output to 24.58m barrels a day will cover sales to the market and not just well-head production. This means the organisation will not release stocks on to the market if supply becomes tight this winter. However, oil companies are holding substantial stocks of oil products such as gasoline and distillates which could depress the market if colder winter weather does not increase demand.</p>

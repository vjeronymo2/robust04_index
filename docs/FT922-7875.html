			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Fox ousts Onslow on 1922 committee AN assertion of independence by new Tory MPs largely explains the ousting last night of Mr Cranley Onslow as chairman of the Conservatives' influential 1922 backbench committee. Sir Marcus Fox, the Conservative MP for Shipley, upset forecasts to become chairman of the committee of 'men in grey suits' that keeps the prime minister informed of backbench opinion. He is understood to have won the overwhelming support of the Tories who won seats on April 9. They were unimpressed by discreet pressure from government whips to support Mr Onslow or by his eight years' experience. One new MP said: 'I think that we felt it was a rather stuffy organisation which needed a breath of fresh air.' Sir Marcus, 64, is an affable Tory who will not shy from media interviews. He described his victory as 'another step in the process of change which has taken place since the general election'. He said that with the Tory majority cut to 21 it was crucial that backbenchers' views were conveyed to the prime minister and chief whip. 'I will be knocking on the doors of 10 Downing Street from time to time.' Mr Onslow, 65, the MP for Woking, had promised he would not stand for re-election next year but said it would be wrong to rush to replace him. But he faced criticism for being a low-profile, taciturn chairman and for failing to stop a Labour MP becoming the Commons' Speaker after the general election. He was also attacked for not conveying backbench opinion to Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the run up to her resignation as prime minister in 1990. Sir Marcus is regarded as a populist rightwinger who campaigned discreetly but actively, particularly among the new intake. His victory coincided with a strong performance by the right wing Conservative '92 group in elections for the 1922 executive committee. Among the successful candidates was Mr John Townend, Tory MP for Bridlington and Euro-sceptic. Mr Onslow was a old-school Tory, happy with traditional procedures. The votes in the 1922 elections are not published, for instance. One minister agreed that he was, 'good at the frosty answers'.</p>

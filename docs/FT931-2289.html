			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Peps will also suffer - The Budget and You PERSONAL equity plans have become less attractive relative to other non-equity investments as a result of the tax change. As the table shows, Pep investors should suffer a drop of around 6.25 per cent in income, unless companies increase their dividends to compensate investors for the change. But the result will be to reduce the return on a Pep which currently yields 5 per cent to 4.69 per cent. This particularly reduces the relative attractions of Peps for basic rate taxpayers, since their dividend income outside a Pep will not be affected. The benefits of a Pep for many basic rate taxpayers were already marginal for those plans with extra charges. If a fund yields 4 per cent gross the tax saving to a basic rate payer in 1992-93 was 1 per cent, or Pounds 60 on a Pounds 6,000 investment. Some Pep managers make an initial charge of 1 per cent plus VAT, more than wiping out the tax saving. The change in the tax system would reduce the saving on such a fund to Pounds 45, and may tip some plans below the break-even point for basic rate investors. They should concentrate on Peps with no extra charges. This is true of nearly all unit trust Peps; it remains the case that if you are prepared to buy the unit trust, then you might as well buy it in Pep form. However, remember that most unit trusts have an initial capital charge of Pounds 300 on a Pounds 6,000 investment. The lower this charge the better. Higher rate taxpayers will also see a fall in the gross yield on Peps. However, since their dividend income outside a Pep will drop by 6.25 per cent, their tax saving will remain at 40 per cent. Furthermore, they are more likely to benefit from the capital gains tax exemption Peps provide. Nevertheless, Peps will still be less attractive, compared with other investments such as gilts, than they were before. Pep managers spoken to this week dismissed the effect as 'marginal'; they maintain a Pep is still attractive to both basic and top rate payers. Certainly, equities remain the best long term investment and provided the investor is able to hold on to a Pep for 10 years or so, the advantages should still be clear. Those who should reconsider a Pep are basic rate payers in funds with additional charges. Investors who are in low-charging plans should have no reason to give up their plans; and a Pep still remains an excellent way of saving to repay a mortgage. In the short term, the change may increase the popularity of bond-equity plans. Since bonds are unaffected by the tax change, yields on such Peps will be less affected than pure equity plans and may even gain. Fidelity says the yield on its mixed Pep will rise.</p>

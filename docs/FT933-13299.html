			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Carsberg threatens Abta with legal action over rule SIR BRYAN Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has threatened to take legal action against the Association of British Travel Agents unless it allows tour operators which are not members of the association to sell their holidays through Abta agents. Sir Bryan's threat came in a letter to the Association of Independent Tour Operators (Aito) which wrote to him complaining that some of its members had had difficulty joining Abta. As a result, they had been unable to sell their holidays through Abta-affiliated outlets because an Abta rule stipulates its agents should sell only foreign holidays provided by association members. The rule, known as Stabiliser, was introduced in 1965. In 1982, the Restrictive Practices Court ruled it was in the public interest and could be legally enforced as it ensured customers were protected provided they bought holidays from Abta members. The legality of the Abta rule was thrown into doubt, however, by the introduction at the beginning of this year of new EC rules on package holidays. These require all providers of package holidays, whether Abta members or not, to ensure customers' money is adequately protected. Sir Bryan made it clear in his letter to Aito that he believed Abta's Stabiliser should be abolished now that the new rules had come into force. He said: 'Abta are aware that I am concerned about the continuation of Stabiliser, which is effectively tying your members who wish to sell overseas package holidays through Abta agents to (the association). If Abta do not end it, I may apply to the court for leave to have the court's earlier decision which upheld Stabiliser reviewed.' Aito says its members have been told they can only join Abta if they arrange Abta bonds for their road and ferry holidays. Air holidays are bonded by the Civil Aviation Authority. Aito says it has its own bonding arrangements which cover members' surface travel holidays and these should be sufficient. In his letter, Sir Bryan agreed, saying he thought Abta should be prepared to accept the financial protection of any company which complied with the new regulations. Abta said yesterday it was not prepared to accept Aito's financial guarantees because it was concerned about the adequacy of back-up arrangements if the bonds proved insufficient. Abta's national council agreed last month that Stabiliser would have to end. As this would require an extraordinary general meeting, it did not believe it could happen before September.</p>

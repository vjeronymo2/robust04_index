Section 34.46 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;34.46  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Supervision of radiographers' assistants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever a radiographer's assistant uses radiographic exposure devices, uses sealed sources or related source handling tools, or conducts radiation surveys required by &sect;34.49(b) to determine that the sealed source has returned to the shielded position after an exposure, the assistant shall be under the personal supervision of a radiographer. The personal supervision must include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The radiographer's personal presence at the site where the sealed sources are being used;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The ability of the radiographer to give immediate assistance if required; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The radiographer's watching the assistant's performance of the operations referred to in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37.

At permanent radiography installations where other appropriate alarming or warning devices are in routine use, the wearing of an alarming ratemeter is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Pocket dosimeters must have a range from zero to 2 millisieverts (200 millirems) and must be recharged at the start of each shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each film badge and TLD must be assigned to and worn by only one individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Film badges and TLDs must be replaced at least monthly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) After replacement, each film badge or TLD must be promptly processed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Pocket dosimeters must be read and the exposures recorded at the beginning and end of each shift, and records must be maintained in accordance with &sect;34.83.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Pocket dosimeters must be checked at periods not to exceed 12 months for correct response to radiation, and records must be maintained in accordance with &sect;34.83. Acceptable dosimeters must read within plus or minus 30 percent of the true radiation exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If an individual's pocket dosimeter is found to be off-scale and the possibility of radiation exposure cannot be ruled out as the cause, the individual's film badge or TLD must be sent immediately for processing. In addition, the individual may not work with licensed material until a determination of the individual's radiation exposure has been made. This determination must be made by the RSO or the RSO's designee. The results of this determination must be included in the records maintained in accordance with &sect;34.83.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If a film badge or TLD is lost or damaged, the worker shall cease work immediately until a replacement film badge or TLD is provided and the exposure is calculated for the time period from issuance to loss or damage of the film badge or TLD. The results of the calculated exposure and the time period for which the film badge or TLD was lost or damaged must be included in the records maintained in accordance with &sect;34.83.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Reports received from the film badge or TLD processor must be retained in accordance with &sect;34.83.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Each alarm ratemeter must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Be checked to ensure that the alarm functions properly (sounds) before using at the start of each shift;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Be set to give an alarm signal at a preset dose rate of 5 mSv/hr (500 mrem/hr); with an accuracy of plus or minus 20 percent of the true radiation dose rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Be adequate to alert the individual regardless of the environmental conditions (e.g., high ambient noise levels).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Require special means to change the preset alarm function; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Be calibrated at periods not to exceed 12 months for correct response to radiation.

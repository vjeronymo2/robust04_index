			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Ambulance inquiry sought THE Commons health committee was urged by Nupe, the public-service union, yesterday to conduct an inquiry into the funding and management of the London Ambulance Service. LAS, the biggest ambulance service in the country, has faced increasing criticism recently for delays in handling incoming telephone calls and attending some emergencies. Nupe, which has been among the most vocal critics, accuses the service's management in a document circulated to London MPs yesterday of using the capital as 'an experimental playing field' for the use of rapid-response paramedic units and a helicopter. They are, the union says, soaking up resources and contributing to the inability of LAS to provide a strong basic service. The Nupe report says the service's management is 'obsessed with economic considerations'. LAS was 'slowly disintegrating into an expensive lame duck with the frantic 999 caller becoming its least important customer'. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, responded to the report yesterday by writing to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, asking her to set up an inquiry into LAS. He said the document was a 'damning indictment' of the present state of the service. It revealed 'serious risks faced by Londoners because of the underfunding and inadequate staffing which is undermining the service'. The inquiry, Mr Blunkett said, should include an examination of the impact of commercial and financial pressures on the service. Mr Blunkett also wrote to Mrs Bottomley yesterday asking her to clarify the position in relation to the supervision of the West Midlands Regional Health Authority. Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of the National Health Service board, has been asked by Mrs Bottomley to help to strengthen the authority's management after a critical district auditor's report into the handling of a contract. Mr Blunkett said there appeared to be significant difficulties within the regional authority, and it was 'in everyone's interest that the whole picture is in the public arena as quickly as possible'.</p>

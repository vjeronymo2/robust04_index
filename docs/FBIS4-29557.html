			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The ugly color of the  traitor Kim Yong-sam who stoops to any infamy in harming fellow  countrymen was fully revealed during his tour of Russia early  this month.    During his trip, he was closeted with Yeltsin over the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, the problem of timber workers, the  sales of parts of weapons and the establishment of a peace  arrangement. It was a criminal dealing down to the slightest  detail for doing harm to the DPRK.    During his trip, he fully revealed his true color as a  traitor to the nation and flunkeyist who seeks a permanent  division of the country and the nation.    His criminal act culminated in entreating Russia to "join"  in  taking "UN sanctions" against the DPRK over the fictitious  "nuclear issue."    It is intolerable that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is  hastening nuclear arms development, not content with the  deployment of huge quantities of U.S. nuclear weapons in South  Korea, entreated Russia to "cooperate" in "sanctions," branding  the DPRK as a "nuclear criminal." What is ridiculous, however,  is that he threw a bait of "economic cooperation" to yeltsin in  return for that.    The traitor promised Russia to reschedule debt service,  taking advantage of its difficult situation under a heavy debt  burden and asked Russia to help South Korea in kidnapping and  taking away timber workers of the North from the far east region  in return for that. This is an intolerable insult and challenge  to the North.    This is a sinister political intrigue to satisfy his own  interests, improve his image under the cloak of  "humanitarianism" and drive a wedge between the DPRK and Russia.    While massively introducing latest weapons of mass  destruction including the Patriot in reward for rice market  opening to the United States against the interests of the South  Korean farmers and frantically staging nuclear war exercises,  Kim Yong-sam asked Russia not to sell parts of weapons to the  DPRK. This is an open revelation of the criminal plot to  internationally isolate and stifle the DPRK.    The traitor also let loose a string of ridiculous remarks,  slandering the DPRK's proposal for establishing a peace  arrangement and crying for the maintenance of the armistice  system, though South Korea is not a signatory to the armistice  agreement and has no real power and no say. This clearly shows  that the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam is a war servant  outdistancing the preceding military dictators and the very one  increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula.    Facts show that his visit to Russia was a criminal trip to  beg Russia to "join" in "sanctions" of the UN against the DPRK  over its "nuclear issue" and a never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist  treacherous trip to leave the interests and existence of the  nation to the gamble of outside forces.    It is only too natural that the despicable perfidious acts  committed by Kim Yong-sam, the political prostitute, during his  Russian trip have encountered strong criticism from the Korean  nation and the progressive people of the world.</p>

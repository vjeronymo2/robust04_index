			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source has explained to the Yemeni News  Agency, SABA' that in a desperate, hysterical, and cowardly  attempt the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] fired a missile on Ta'izz at 2030  yesterday, targetting defenseless citizens. But God's  providence ordained that this missile fall on Sadr Mountain.    The source said no human losses were sustained, but that  children, women, and elderly people in the city and the nearby  villages were scared and there were some cracks in the houses of  the citizens from the explosion of the missile.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marianne Merten] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- An average of five  security force personnel will be deployed at each of about 9,000  voting stations in this week's elections, Electoral Commissioner  Zac Yacoob said on Monday [25 April]. He told a press briefing  at the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] Midrand nerve  centre 10 to 15 people would be deployed at voting stations in  some areas, including the Western Transvaal. On average, two  people would guard each voting station at night. Security force  members might "not be apparent" at the stations, he said. A  total of 65,000 security force members would be deployed.    South African Defence Force [SADF] Communications Chief  Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said the response to a Citizen  Force call-up had not been as good as expected. On the  reporting dates of April 15 and 22, only about 43 per cent of  those expected turned up. This meant those who reported would  have to serve 60 days instead of the planned 30 days. "We are  thinly stretched," Gen Opperman said. However, about 80 SADF  companies would be deployed to support police, he added.    Mr Yacoob said bomb blasts since Sunday would not prevent  the  elections. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said the  blasts would not prevent the elections being free and fair,  although they might cause a low turn-out at the polls. The IEC  would declare the elections substantially free and fair on the  basis of franchise provisions.    These included the percentage of the electorate who voted,  the percentage of spoiled papers showing an inability of voters  to understand the procedure and the question of "gross societal  intimidation". Other factors were the extent of free and fair  electioneering and "how no-go the no-go areas were".    Gen Opperman said the security forces appreciated the  Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the elections. Mr  Justice Kriegler said the IFP's decision had minimised  opportunities for violence.</p>

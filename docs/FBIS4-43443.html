			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Morten Fyhn: "EU Clarification in Good Time"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- All the outstanding problems between  Norway and the European Union [EU] on the subject of  agricultural subsidies will be solved before the end of  September, the trade minister has said.    In good time before the EU referendum on 28 November, Norway  and the EU Commission will have reached agreement on the content  and size of all the support arrangements that will be given to  Norwegian agriculture in the event of EU membership, Trade  Minister Grete Knudsen promised in Brussels yesterday. In  concrete terms this means that everything must be on the table  before the end of September.    "Then we have both October and November to study everything  so that people will know what the issues are," the minister said.    In the absence through sickness of the agriculture minister,  who has had back surgery, Grete Knudsen yesterday met EU  Commissioner Rene Steichen chiefly to discuss "the splendid  map," as Knudsen put it. The map will show how large areas  south of the 62d parallel will be covered by a new support  system for so-called northern agriculture. All of Norway north  of the 62d parallel is covered by subsidies to northern  agriculture that faces difficulties.    "There is no great distance between us," the trade minister  said after the meeting. She stressed that the Norwegian side is  working on the basis of the existing subsidy zones in Norway,  because they "are known quantities and something that people  here at home are familiar with. The map must be seen as fair,"  she stressed.    According to the minister, there is not very much dividing  Norway and the Commission if you measure in percent or in the  size of areas. The problem is more to do with which areas. As  an example of the Commission's thinking in the past at least,  she mentioned two local councils -- Etne and Olen -- in her home  province of Hordaland that have always been covered by the same  support arrangements. Under the terms of the Commission's  proposals suddenly only one of them would qualify for support,  and that is something Norway will not have, she said.    The trade minister will have another meeting with the  Commission in mid-July. At this meeting the Commission will  respond to Norway's proposals.</p>

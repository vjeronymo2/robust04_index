			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: OMV warns of restructuring as losses continue OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, has reported a first-half operating loss of Sch552m (Dollars 49m) after a loss of Sch584m in the same period last time. The group, which had forecast a return to profit this year, has been badly hurt in recent months by low cost competition from eastern European refiners and chemical makers. It said it expected an operating loss of about Sch1bn in the full year, and was 'unlikely' to pay a dividend. It warned that large-scale restructuring measures were planned. These would involve the closure of chemical plants, the disposal of selected chemical and polymer processing activities, and the formation of business alliances in some chemical and plastics sectors. The bad news followed a week of turmoil in OMV shares - among the most liquid and widely held Austrian equities - in response to speculation about the results and the cancellation of a press conference pending approval by the supervisory board of restructuring plans. The shares tumbled from Sch797 on Monday to a low of Sch700 before recovering to Sch742 at the week's close. The group said its plastics division had 'an extremely difficult time' in the first quarter, while earnings in the petrochemicals, refining and chemicals businesses dropped sharply in the second quarter. The extent of the deterioration was emphasised by the fact that the loss was incurred in spite of cost savings of Sch1bn through earlier rationalisation programmes. The group said it did not expect any improvement in market conditions in the coming months. Turnover was flat at Sch40bn, and cash flow rose 8.7 per cent to Sch2.34bn. OMV said its exploration and production division improved operating profit from Sch20m to Sch260m, but mainly because of spending cuts and the sale of its Canadian subsidiary. The important refining business widened its loss from Sch300m to Sch380m, partly because of weak prices but also because of increased competition from low-cost eastern European refineries. The marketing division eked out a Sch30m profit after a loss of Sch80m, mainly because of the benefits of rationalising the petrol station network. Losses in the chemicals division doubled to Sch430m, as prices in western European industrial markets slid. Eastern European competition hurt fertiliser sales and prices. Plastics prices recovered slightly in the second quarter, but remained below previous year levels. The divisional loss expanded slightly to Sch710m from Sch690m.</p>

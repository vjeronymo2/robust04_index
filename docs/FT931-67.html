			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mozambique will become graphite producer in 1994 MOZAMBIQUE WILL join the world's graphite producers at the begining of next year because both the European Investment Bank and the Commonwealth Development Corporation have agreed to provide funding for the USDollars 11.5m Ancuabe project in the Cabo Delgado province. The CDC will also take a 10 per cent shareholding in the Ancuabe project company. Most natural flake graphite is used for refractory products such as refractory bricks, crucibles, retorts and so on and Kenmare Resources, the Irish company which owns 65 per cent of the project company, says it already has customers lined up in the US and Europe. The EIB, the world's largest provider of project funding, is providing ECU 2.9m of senior debt in the project on concessionary terms, representing half the required senior debt. The EIB is also to provide an additional soft loan to the Mozambique government to enable the government to pay for its 25 per cent share of the project equity. The CDC will provide the other half of the senior debt with a USDollars 3.45m loan. Kenmare says that it will produce 10,000 tonnes of graphite a year.</p>

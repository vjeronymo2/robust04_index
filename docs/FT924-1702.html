			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Share swap in Spanish oxygen producer BANESTO, the Spanish bank, is to take a 1 per cent stake in the French industrial gas group, Air Liquide, after a share swap, announced yesterday, which will leave the French group in almost complete control of Spain's largest oxygen producer, Sociedad Espanola de Oxigeno. Under the deal, Banesto's industrial corporation, which has a stake of 24.9 per cent in SEO, and Bestinver, an investment vehicle controlled by the Entrecanales construction family, which has a further 9.06 per cent of SEO, will transfer these shares to Air Liquide. The French group already has 58 per cent of the Spanish group. Under the agreement, Banesto will receive 0.99 per cent of Air Liquide's stock from Airliquide's US arm, ALIC. The stock is worth about Dollars 87m. Bestinver will receive 0.36 per cent of Air Liquide, also from ALIC, worth about Dollars 31m. It remains unclear whether Banesto intends to hold on to its Air Liquide stake.</p>

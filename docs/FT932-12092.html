			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Sweden to keep 25% in Celsius THE Swedish government will retain a minority stake of 25 per cent in Celsius Industries after this summer's privatisation of the country's leading defence group. A further 21 per cent of shares are to be taken up by four Swedish financial institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign investors, Celsius employees and the general public, according to the government. The remaining 11 per cent will be held by Nobel Industries, which sold its defence electronics activities to Celsius for SKr1.55bn (Dollars 215m) in February. The shares have not been priced, but the group's value is estimated at SKr3bn. The new ownership structure ensures Celsius remains in Swedish hands. There are no formal restrictions on foreign ownership, but the state retains the right to block hostile foreign bids. The government said Celsius would be able to take a more active part in the broader restructuring of the European defence industry if it is was in private hands and had access to external risk capital. It is was hoping a number of new industrial owners would subscribe to the share offer. Celsius shares are to be listed on the Stockholm stock exchange with effect from June 23. The privatisation prospectus will be published on May 10, and the offer period runs from May 17 to June 4. The Celsius privatisationis part of the government's privatisation programme embracing 35 state-owned groups.</p>

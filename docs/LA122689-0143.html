			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HERSHISER'S SUMMER OF '88: THE BEST SHOW OF THE DECADE  </P> <P> The record stood for 20 years, 58 2/3 scoreless innings, a tribute to Don  Drysdale's pitching dominance during the summer of 1968.  </P> <P> To break it would require a level of pitching consistency rarely achieved --  six straight shutouts and then some. Orel Hershiser, ace of the Dodgers,  figured old Double D's mark was safe, especially from him.  </P> <P> "I never thought I would break the record," Hershiser said. "I thought nobody  would break the record. But now I think somebody can break it, because I'm  nobody special."  </P> <P> He was wrong there. Orel Hershiser was more than special in September, 1988. He  bordered on the unhittable, throwing 59 consecutive scoreless innings -- 67 if  you include the playoffs -- to punctuate the Dodgers' rush to the National  League West title.  </P> <P> The achievement was voted Performance of the Decade in a poll of sports writers  and broadcasters conducted by the Associated Press, receiving 156 votes to far  outdistance the four gold medals won by Carl Lewis in the 1984 Olympic Games,  which had 77 votes.  </P> <P> Then came Wayne Gretzky breaking hockey's 200-point barrier (76 votes), Roger  Clemens' record 20-strikeout game (30), Steffi Graf's tennis Grand Slam (29),  Jose Canseco's 40-homer/40-steal season (26), Eric Dickerson's 2,105-yard  season (15), Dan Marino's 200 career touchdowns (14), U.S. Olympic Miracle on  Ice (12), Matt Biondi's seven Olympic medals (7), Butch Reynolds' 400-meter  record (6), Woody Stephens' five straight Belmont winners (5), Greg LeMond's  Tour de France victories (2), Greg Louganis' 1988 Olympics (2) and Jack  Nicklaus' last nine holes at the 1986 Masters.  </P> <P> Drysdale, a Dodgers broadcaster, got to watch Hershiser's streak up close and  marveled at the pitcher's consistency. "Orel's been in complete control,"  Drysdale said after the second 1-0 game. "He's in such a groove. He's worked so  hard. You just like to see him do well."  </P> <P> When the streak reached 58 innings on Sept. 30 at San Diego -- Drysdale's mark  had been amended by baseball's record keepers to eliminate the fraction --  Hershiser asked Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda to lift him from the game.  </P> <P> "I did it out of respect for Don," he said. "I think he's a much better pitcher  than I am. He's a Hall of Famer. I thought it would be a lot better if we were  both sitting up there on top."  </P> <P> Lasorda refused. Hershiser went back to work for one more inning, recorded  three more outs and claimed the record that ranks as the Performance of the  Decade.  </P></p>

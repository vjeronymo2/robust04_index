			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Viewpoint" column by Barzan al-Tikriti, half brother of </F> President Saddam Husayn and Iraq's representative to the United  Nations in Geneva: "The Burdens of Conflict, Regionalism, and  Prospects for 1994"]    [Text] Today, I will not discuss specific developments,  because such [future] developments can only be known to God. I  will, instead, refer to certain events that may, in one way or  another, influence the course of events. I will discuss two  basic tracks. If these two tracks meet, they can influence  events in a certain way, and if they clash, they will produce an  opposite result.    The first track involves getting tired of the conflict or  suffering, regardless of the form of that suffering. The second  is the growing drift toward regionalism as a result of what  happened in the Arab region, specifically in the Arabian  Peninsula and the Gulf.    Planes sometimes crash. Despite all the thorough  investigations they conduct, specialists fail to arrive at an  obvious or direct result for the crash. Specialists and experts  may say the crash is caused by "the fatigue of material," which  sustained constant stresses for years and then, at a certain  point in time, yielded to these stresses and failed.    Similarly, it seems to me that the world is now passing  through what we may call "yielding to fatigue caused by conflict  or other elements caused by conflict itself." Those who wish to  refute this remark cannot use any ongoing conflicts anywhere as  examples. Even in the midst of these conflicts, the eye can see  obvious signs of fatigue. This fatigue was probably the real  reason behind the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which is not  allowed to fail. That fatigue may also be the reason behind the  possibility of reaching peace in the Irish question, as well as  other chronic, or so-called traditional, questions.    If this statement or argument is considered valid, then we  can assume that several conflicts will come to an end in 1994.  Based on this, one can say that the civil war in Afghanistan  will end when a firm and final solution is reached; that peace  treaties will be signed by the Arab states directly involved in  the Arab-Israeli conflict; that the war in (former) Yugoslavia  will end with its partition into several ethnic, independent  states; and that the Somalis will emerge from the quagmire into  which they were pushed by the policies and conduct of Siad Birri  and the Somali factions that are trying to inherit him, not  because they love to serve Somalia and its people, but because  they lust for power and hegemony. One can further say that  matters between the two Yemens will not exacerbate and reach the  point of a civil war or a semi-regular war for reasons every  observer knows.    All these issues can be resolved if the decisive factor in  such conflicts and disputes does not interfere. That decisive  factor is regionalism, which, we can observe, is currently  growing as a result or what happened in the region.    It is noteworthy that the world undergoes cycles of events  similar to those of economy. We also note that some of these  cycles witness a trend toward localization with all its  characteristics and qualities. There is no room here to explain  this phenomenon which we had earlier discussed in some detail in  writings, some of which were published.    It seems that the world is currently passing through a cycle  of acute regionalism. It is easy for those interested in or  following up this trend to note that this cycle clearly exists  in the Arab world more than anywhere else, particularly in the  Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, including Iraq, in spite of the  fact that this region is historically known for its pan-Arab  feelings and orientations. We, however, reiterate that the  feeling of regionalism was the result of what happened in this  region--a region which endured more than its capacity. Some  felt that they gave a great deal, but none reciprocated by  giving them as much as they offered, not even a word of thanks  and appreciation. What is more ironic is that they were  destroyed by those for whose sake they gave and sacrificed.    Thus far, I cannot say there is any indication that this  trend is subsiding. What exists is the opposite. Therefore, I  can say that the new year will witness victories by the  supporters of regionalism everywhere. Hence, I do not believe  the Arab world will witness any serious attempt at unification  neither in a general manner nor on the level of the regional  entities. In the meantime, there are growing fears about the  possibility of maintaining Iraq's unity. My reply to these  fears is that Iraq will remain unified for several reasons. One  of them is that what applies to Iraq also applies to the  regional states for reasons known to all, unless these states  accept what others decide for them or are unaware of what is  taking place around them or inside their states.    There are certain facts which should be recognized by all  states of diversified demographic structure. They should take  the national, ethnic, religious, and other diversification into  consideration. I clearly say that from the demographic  perspective, Iraq, for example, should not live or behave as if  it were a 100 percent Arab country nor should Turkey act as if  it were 100 percent Turkish or Iran as 100 percent Persian.  What applies to these states also applies to a certain extent  to Syria and others. The regional conflicts afflicting Somalia,  Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan will not easily end. These states  will reach a degree of exhaustion which will make them accept a  solution even for a period of time.    As for the Arab region, it will most likely witness changes  in the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf states, and Egypt. The  extremist, fundamentalist current will get more severe, violent,  and widespread. The situation in Algeria will get more  complicated, and things could get out of hand in this fraternal,  struggling country. Also, the Libyan-Western crisis will get  worse. The result will be in favor of the West if no changes  and major positive developments take place in the Arab world.  These developments are unlikely to happen. This means that  Libya will regrettably stay on its own.    We are confronted then with a general feeling of fatigue as  a  result of protracted, bloody conflicts. This trend could lead  to the achievement of peace in many parts of the world,  including our region. This, however, depends on the courage of  the decisionmakers to let bygones be bygones and turn over a new  leaf by having a serious, realistic view of how things are  going, despite all the bitterness involved. The purpose of this  is to arrive at a new, sound framework that clarifies relations  and precisely spells out rights and duties. Otherwise, things  will take a different course, similar to what happened when we  had blood and destruction, especially since these events were  the outcome of what very brothers did even before more distant  relatives came into the picture. We should also not forget that  we have another trend that seeks to fragment the existing states  and turn them into smaller entities. Should such a trend  succeed, God forbid, it will spark new conflicts, especially if  force were used, and this is not unlikely. It is common  knowledge that force breeds violence, which is almost always a  means to settle disputes, particularly in the Third World. Here,  we lay special emphasis on the role of leaders and how much they  absorb changes. If the concerned leaders realize that regional  conflicts deserve much of their time and attention -- and as  such should be debated instead of having recourse to bullets --  then it will be possible for the two trends to live together in  peace. If, however, force has the final say, then the regional  trend will most likely defeat fatigue and thus reinvigorate  exhausted conflicts and disputes.    I sincerely hope that decisionmakers everywhere, especially  in our region, will heed this fact.    Geneva, 31 December 1993.</p>

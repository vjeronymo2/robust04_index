			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (26): Group E - Norway Egil Olsen, the Norwegian manager, complained when he saw the draw. What bothered him was not the presence of Italy but of Ireland. The two teams, he says, play the same game. The two managers play the same games too. Norway have even less of a football tradition than the Irish. But, as both Jack Charlton and Olsen have said, this can be an advantage: they are not bound by any history of stylish football. Wins are enough. Both have embraced the much maligned, largely misunderstood long-ball game. Their teams defend in numbers and harry opponents relentlessly. Their first attacking weapon is the long, usually high ball out of defence which they hope will yield a poor clearance or a corner or free-kick which they can exploit. This approach is regarded as crass in the more sophisticated soccer nations and Olsen and Charlton are happy to play the naive country cousins. Last summer Olsen, who claims to have earned more from poker than from football, lectured Graham Taylor, the England manager, about the long-ball game. Taylor picked an extra centre back to counter the threat and was astonished to find the Norwegians shuttling the ball quickly along the ground. What Olsen, like Charlton, wants to conceal is that he has a team full of good players, led by Rune Bratseth (Werder Bremen), a world class centre half. Even so Norway will not be pretty. Against England in their recent friendly, Norway spent most of the game in densely-packed, often robust defence. England had the ball for twice as long, but Norway managed more shots. Do not believe Olsen. His team are capable of going a long way.</p>

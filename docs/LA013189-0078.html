			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH IN VEHICLE FLEEING FROM OFFICER SHOT IN HEAD  </P> <P> A 17-year-old boy was critically wounded in the back of the head early Monday  when an off-duty police officer fired at the car in which he and a companion  allegedly were fleeing from an Eagle Rock convenience store with two stolen  cases of beer, detectives reported.  </P> <P> Investigators said the unidentified youth and Eddie Arzate, 20, both of  Highland Park, ran out of a 7-Eleven store at 1910 W. Colorado Blvd. with the  beer shortly after midnight as the clerk, Kurian Tharaikat, chased them.  </P> <P> A store employee who asked not to be identified said Monday evening, "Those  kids were making what they call a beer run. We have a strict company policy not  to chase them. That just makes me sick . . . getting kids shot over beer."  </P> <P> Tharaikat could not be reached.  </P> <P> Officer Robert Bain, 45, was driving into the parking lot with his 24-year-old  son, Brian, as Tharaikat shouted what the officer believed to be "I've been  robbed," authorities reported.  </P> <P> While his son followed the suspects on foot, Officer Bain drove after the  suspects and attempted to cut them off with his vehicle just as they got into a  car on Highland View Avenue, according to police.  </P> <P> Officer Bain, who believed "he was confronting armed robbery suspects," drew  his personal 9-millimeter pistol, got out of his car, identified himself as a  police officer and ordered the two to remain in their own vehicle, police said.  </P> <P> But the suspects' car allegedly accelerated, crashed into a parked vehicle and  then sped away. Bain fired once, police said, striking the driver's side  window.  </P> <P> Several residents of the block, however, said they distinctly heard two shots,  and one witness said he saw a flash from the officer's weapon on the second  sound.  </P> <P> About 1 a.m., Arzate drove to County-USC Medical Center with the wounded  teen-ager and two women, Rhonda Hicks, 23, and Angie Tovar, 22, police said.  The wounded youth was placed on a life-support system.  </P> <P> Arzate was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, a vehicle.  </P></p>

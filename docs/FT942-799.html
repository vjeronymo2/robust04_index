			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Italy reshuffle for crucial Mexico game Injury-weakened Italy face a must-win test against Mexico today while Ireland battle Norway to unlock Group E, the World Cup's most closely contested first-round group (see story left). 'It will be a game of life or death,' says veteran Mexican striker Hugo Sanchez, who describes the Italians as a powerful team with 'a beautiful soccer history.' The Italians have reshuffled their team after injuries to defenders Paolo Maldini and team captain Franco Baresi. In addition, goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was suspended for two games after being ejected from last Thursday's game against Norway. Baresi may be out for the rest of the tournament after arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage from his right knee-cap. Alessandro Costacurta will replace him as sweeper and Luigi Apolloni will play centre-half. Maldini, nursing a sprained right ankle, is doubtful for the game. If he doesn't start, Roberto Baggio will captain Italy. Baggio, considered Italy's most imaginative player and the key to the side's attack, was substituted in the game against Norway and failed to impress against Ireland. Mexico's Luis Alberto Alves isn't worried that Mexico has never beaten Italy in World Cup play. 'History is for museums,' he said.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Rise in jobless may bury French Socialists: Tensions grow between Paris and employers as unemployment total heads for 3m THE latest job losses at Peugeot set the scene for increased tensions between employers and a French government desperately seeking to save face before the parliamentary election at the end of March. The loss of almost 2,600 jobsat the French car maker this week is but the most recent in a grim series of industrial job cuts expected to reach a record 600,000 when the final toll for 1992 is counted. By the first 10 months of last year, the total had reached 436,000, 12 per cent more than the same period in 1991. Most of the big names in French business have been forced by the economic slowdown to take an axe to their workforces, including Aerospatiale, the aerospace group, Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truck maker, Bull and IBM France in computers and Usinor Sacilor, the steel group. All this could not have come at a worse time for the administration. The Socialists' inability to turn back unemployment, now just short of 3m, will be the big theme in the election, in which the latest polls indicate the government is set for a thrashing. The growing army of jobless, 10.4 per cent of the workforce at the latest count, is the one issue that threatens the cross-party consensus on the need to defend the franc and has been marked out by both right and left as the main battleground for the election campaign. 'I think nobody would dream of attacking social achievements,' said President Francois Mitterrand in his traditional new year address, a clear bid to hold the high ground on social policy against an incoming right-wing government. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, hit back by claiming that social achievements had been 'deeply called into question for the past several years,' and warned that he would fight to restore the balance. Both right and left feel uncomfortably short of answers to unemployment, their main political problem, on which fringe parties like the ecologists and National Front have capitalised. 'Companies are making job losses too soon, too fast and too hard,' complained Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister, on the day of the Peugeot job losses. She inflamed the Patronat employers' organisation by accusing it of being politically biased and calling on it to 'speak to companies which abuse the use of job losses'. Her plans for increased worksharing, reviewing high social charges and improved training have failed to impress employers. A related irritant in relations between the state and private industry has been the wrangle over who will bail out the Unedic unemployment pay system. It is jointly funded by employers and unions and designed to pay redundant workers for a period before they receive state benefits, but is nearing bankruptcy partly because of a sharp rise in the number of people coming off state-funded temporary work. Yesterday, Mrs Aubry unwillingly compromised by agreeing to contribute FFr3.25bn (Pounds 390m) to Unedic's FFr23bn deficit. The Patronat, already internally divided over the merits of the government's tough exchange rate policy, is deeply worried over just where the debate over unemployment will lead. Already the Socialists have taken practical steps to clamp down on lay-offs, by passing a law just before Christmas which significantly strengthened the employers' obligation to help redundant workers find new jobs or risk having the job losses overturned by the government. The Patronat argues that France has almost returned to the rigid old system whereby redundancies had to be cleared by the public authorities, abandoned by the last Gaullist government in 1986. 'It is a major step backwards,' said one Patronat official yesterday.</p>

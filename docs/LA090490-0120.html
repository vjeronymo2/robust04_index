			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL ' 90;  </P> <P> 'MANA WAKA' A LONG-BURIED TALE OF NEW ZEALAND'S MAORI;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE DEPRESSION-ERA FILM, RESTORED BY DOCUMENTARIAN MERATA MITA,  CHRONICLES THE BUILDING OF CEREMONIAL WAR CANOES. THE MAORI QUEEN WILL ATTEND  TONIGHT'S SCREENING AT UCLA.  </P> <P> Documentarian Merata Mita, whose film, "Mana Waka" screens tonight at UCLA's  Melnitz Theater, believes a movie buff of a higher order assisted her with her  project.  </P> <P> "It was all shot on old 35mm nitrate film," said Mita, who needed to  painstakingly assemble 20,000 feet shot in the late '30s. "The consensus was  that given its condition, the film would have deteriorated, but it was actually  all there -- intact. That we put down to the spiritual strength of the film."  </P> <P> The title means "War Canoe," and is a celluloid testament to the will of New  Zealand's Maori tribe. In 1937, Princess Te Puea Herangi endeavored to inspire  her people during the Depression by commissioning the construction of seven  majestic canoes.  </P> <P> R.G.H. Manley's hand-held camera recorded the felling of the great trees that  would eventually carry dozens of proud Maori across the waters. He captured the  thousands of man-hours expended and the workers' frustration before Princess Te  Puea's funds ran out. Only three vessels were completed.  </P> <P> "It wasn't received well," said Mita. "And the government wouldn't support it.  That's how the project fell by the wayside. It became the unfulfilled dream of  the Maori people."  </P> <P> Until now.  </P> <P> What makes "Mana Waka" an event is the presence of the Maori queen, or Te  Arikuni (the most high-born), and the elders during all screenings of the film.  </P> <P> Before the lights go down, traditional ceremonies are held in which the  audience participates. "They bless the audience," the director said, "and what  happens during the ceremony is the people become part of the film and the film  becomes part of the people.  </P> <P> "To a lot of people (in the United States) that is unnatural, but it's not  unnatural to our culture and the way we see things. Art is never disconnected  from the people."  </P> <P> Mita is known in her native land as an impassioned filmmaker. Two of her early  efforts in the '80s, "Bastion Point: Day 507" and "Patul," were sharp  commentaries on Maori injustice. Her reputation came in handy when trying to  locate craftsmen who toiled long ago on the war canoes. She found three of  them.  </P> <P> "We were able to have one of the three craftsmen sitting by us all the time,  and they would fill us in on the unseen stories of the whole thing," Mita said.  </P> <P> Te Puea died in the early '50s. The canoes, which each span more than 100 feet,  are still used during ceremonies and to carry training crews.  </P></p>

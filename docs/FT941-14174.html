			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Lords to the rescue Thank heavens for the House of Lords. We who would prefer the second chamber to be an elected senate cannot be comfortable with such a sentiment, but there is no escape. The ermined posse has cantered to our rescue, and not before time. Let me explain. The government, which falls short of perfection, is confronted by an ineffective opposition. When ministers misuse their powers, or attempt to take too much upon themselves - which believe it or not they do - the ordinary citizen is helpless. There is no recourse to the courts or a basic law, as in Germany. The checks and balances do not exist. One solution, as we have seen over the past year, is a strong, brash, intrusive and angry media. This is regrettable. Newspapers and TV, elected by no one, were not placed on earth to weaken the government or thwart its proposed legislation, or decide who shall and who shall not serve in the administration. Our trade is to report, analyse and comment. The House of Commons should be responsible for the rest. The lower house's failure to do its job has created a vacuum, which has drawn in the fearsome tribe of scribblers and questioners that has so damaged the Conservatives. The House of Lords has likewise been sucked in. It, too, was elected by no one, but it does contain individuals who from time to time pursue the noble aim of safeguarding fundamental principles, without thought of party or personal advantage. In this the upper house is possibly more blessed than the media. Graced by Lord Whitelaw, it is triply blessed. It is no coincidence that the deterioration in the quality of the Conservative government first elected in 1979 dates from 1988, when the affable gentleman universally known as 'Willie' stepped down. His role was that of purveyor of prudence and wisdom to the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher; without him at her ear, her fate was sealed. On Tuesday Lord Whitelaw challenged certain clauses in the police and magistrate's courts bill. The new law would give the home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, the power to nominate chairmen of police authorities. 'I ask him please to explain the reason for this major change in the whole history of policing in this country,' said the former home secretary, now dignified with the title of Viscount. The answer is that after the 1992 election yet another Tory home secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, proposed to pack police authorities with his nominees. If memory serves, half were to be party placemen and women. This was watered down to a third, plus the appointee to the chair. Mr Howard had doubts from the start. The government's ambition to grab control from local authorities remains undiminished, or did so until Lord Whitelaw's powerful intervention. As originally conceived, the bill would have taken us a step towards a national police force, something the English know in their bones should be avoided. Other clauses in current Home Office bills, notably the proposed removal of the accused's 'right of silence' in court, and the extension of management-mania to the running of magistrate's courts have been criticised by the Lord Chief Justice. He may get less attention than Lord Whitelaw, whose political strength is far greater, but the process is the same. The upper house is attempting to guard our civil liberties. Lord Whitelaw made one other point. 'A bill for the police,' he said, '. . . should command broad all-party support when it leaves Parliament . . .' In earlier, more decorous times, this would not have needed saying. Today the Conservatives are desperately afraid of Labour's successful assault on the traditional Tory lead on policies to reduce crime. A consensus approach may be beyond the imagination of the government. It is still tending the old Thatcherite machinery, churning out quangos by the score, chanting nonsense about efficiency, reading but failing to comprehend the manual left behind in the 1980s. The House of Lords could do us another service. It could train its sights on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill. Make no mistake. Deregulation is highly desirable. Not one single unnecessary rule should be left standing. Indeed, the government's boast about a bonfire of controls would carry more conviction if more substantial material was to be fed to the flames than the easy twiglets and grass cuttings listed in Mr Michael Heseltine's glossy brochure. The trade and industry secretary is doubtless proceeding gingerly, as might have been expected, but his first offerings are pretty timid. That said, the government is going about it the wrong way. It aims to give its ministers powers to do anything they please with existing regulations, on the ground that to ask Parliament to amend or repeal previous laws would be time-consuming and cumbersome. Would it really? The number of days the Commons sits varies with every session. It was 244 in 1979-80 and 160 in 1990-91. Better use of parliamentary hours has been suggested by many who have studied the timetable. If you reject that excuse for giving every minister the power to make law, try this one: before issuing an order the minister must consult 'such organisations as appear to him to be representative of interests substantially affected by his proposals . . .' In other words, he may choose to take lunch with the Burst-into-flame Furniture Manufacturers Association, but not the Keep Children Protected from Fire pressure group. To be fair, the bill provides for a 40-day delay before orders laid before Parliament can be confirmed by affirmative resolution. Parliamentary committees might exam-ine orders during that period, although the mechanism for this is not yet established. The Lords can hardly reject the entire bill. They could, however, improve it. As one example of many possible amendments, they could take out the words 'appear to him', which I have italicised above, thus making it easier for ignored groups to sue. They could insist on a predefined mechanism for public scrutiny, such as a special standing deregulation committee or, better, an independent body to represent the public interest as against those of business associations. If the one opposition - the Lords - keeps the spotlight on ministers who may misuse their new deregulatory powers, the other unelected opposition - the media - will do the rest.</p>

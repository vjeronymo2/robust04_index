			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 20 KYODO -- China has agreed to  cooperate with the United States on alleged "prison exports" in  an apparent appeasement to U.S. demands for improvement on human  rights issues.    The Thursday [20 January] announcement, made by visiting  U.S.  Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, comes four months before  the U.S. must decide whether China has made enough progress in  human rights to warrant a renewal of their most favored nation  (MFN) trading status.    "Our governments have agreed on measures to ensure more  effective prevention of the export of goods made with prison  labor," Bentsen told an audience of Chinese social scientists.  "China has also agreed to permit inspections of five prisons  alleged to be producing goods for exports."</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures spent a volatile day, trading within a range of no less than 37 points in medium volume that was nearly 4,000 lots down on Tuesday. At the close the FT-SE December contract was 3,018, against 3,046 a day earlier for a premium to the cash market of four points. The fair value premium was around 17 points. The contract opened comfortably higher at 3,052 only to drift lower throughout most of the morning session. Then Wall Street bonds opened in bleak mood and a number of big sellers moved in. The low point of the day - 3,015 - was touched just in front of the close and was enough to tempt a smattering of buyers to lever the contract off its bottom. Trading volume was not heavy as the day's price movements might suggest with activity extending to 13,799 lots, against 17,553 on Tuesday. In contrast activity, in traded options was almost match for the previous day at 37,003 lots, against 39,646. FT-SE volume accounted for more than half the total but Euro FT-SE business was a desultory 1,481 lots. The most actively traded individual stock option was British Steel with 2,600 lots, well ahead of Euro FT-SE. British Gas traded 1,069 lots and Sears 1,060.</p>

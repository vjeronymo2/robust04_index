			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EVEN THE PROS ARE FED UP WITH PROGRAM TRADING  </P> <P> There is one consolation for the small investor whose confidence in the stock  market might have been shaken by its volatility because of computerized program  trading. Wall Street professionals -- the guys who make their living trading  stocks -- aren't very happy with program trading either, and their confidence  is also shot.  </P> <P> "There is a high level of frustration right now regarding program trading," a  trader for one of Wall Street's top brokerages said on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange. "This type of volatility is not good for anyone." His  firm, incidentally, is one of the nation's biggest program traders.  </P> <P> It isn't quite true that program trading helps no one.  </P> <P> A volatile stock market, while it might do long-term damage to investor  confidence, can be a bonanza for quick and agile money managers and traders who  can instantly shift millions of dollars among stocks, bonds and equity futures  and options. If you are playing the arbitrage game, then this volatility is  perfect for you.  </P> <P> Said one Wall Streeter: "They like the volatility. It gives them a chance to  make money. It's the only way they can make money."  </P> <P> And there is another short-term benefit of chaos: Brokerages are likely to reap  extra commissions if small investors are scared into selling their stocks when  the market hits one of its sinkholes. And they pocket another commission if the  small investors decide to buy the stocks back, as they did on Oct. 16, once  prices have fallen. But most Wall Street pros realize, after the tremors of the  past week, that something has to change to keep the stock market from  degenerating into the biggest gambling hall outside Atlantic City.  </P> <P> "Even the pros have really had it. If they don't put an end to this, I don't  know what will happen," another irate trader said.  </P> <P> That opinion was widely shared last week. While many traders were willing to  express their opinions, they all asked for anonymity. Their bosses, they  assumed, still like program trading.  </P> <P> This disdain for program trading among professionals is new. Most Wall  Streeters have been tolerating program trading in much the same way that New  Yorkers put up with slow traffic. If you can't do anything about it, why  complain?  </P> <P> Professional traders still may not be able to do anything about program  trading, (especially now that the New York Stock Exchange is adding a program  trading instrument of its own), but after this week, complaining about it makes  them feel better.  </P> <P> Kemper Financial Services, a Chicago-based company that manages about $57  billion in assets, took its protest one step farther. It stopped doing business  with four brokerages that use program trading for their own accounts. Late last  week, Hartford, Conn.-based Phoenix Mutual Life, which manages more than $8.6  billion in assets, said it refused to do business with firms using program  trading. And Paine Webber said it will not execute program trading orders for  customers; the Wall Street brokerage has not used program trading for its own  account since May 1988. If you had to pinpoint when the pros' tolerance for  program trading turned to hate, it was probably between 10:30 and 11 last  Tuesday morning, when the Dow Jones industrial average started rallying from an  unexpected 85-point deficit. The index ended that day at a loss of just under 4  points, in what was one of the most volatile and perplexing sessions anyone  could remember.  </P> <P> "This industry is in a sad state of affairs," said yet another trader, who  added that he, personally, isn't buying or selling many shares these days.  "We're out of the market," he said. Why? He answered that it's too dangerous  even for him.  </P> <P> Here's what happened last Tuesday that got traders so upset:  </P> <P> Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Bros., two of Wall Street's biggest  investment houses, that morning began selling bushels-full of stocks in  asset-allocation programs, according to sources. An asset-allocation program  uses computers to decide how much should be invested in stocks, bonds and other  financial instruments. By allocating assets, Goldman Sachs and Salomon, for  whatever reason, were simply deciding that it was time to sell stocks and buy  bonds.  </P> <P> That burst of selling, along with the price of UAL stock going into another  free fall, put the entire stock market on its ear and had even the coolest pros  thinking that another crash was coming.  </P> <P> Then, suddenly -- and mysteriously -- the selling stopped.  </P> <P> Goldman, Sachs; Salomon and other brokerages turned on a dime and started  buying huge volumes of stock through trading programs. The word on Wall Street  was that regulators had warned the brokerage firms that they must "cease and  desist" using computerized programs to unload stocks. But whether there was  such a warning or this was simply Wall Street gossip, an attempt to explain the  unexplainable, could not be determined.  </P> <P> The change in direction Tuesday morning was so abrupt that even fleet-footed  professional traders got caught by surprise. And with that, the pros all of a  sudden could understand what small investors have been going through these past  few years.  </P> <P> The pros, almost in unison, started murmuring under their breath that they  despised program trading as much as the next guy.  </P> <P> "I hate the market," said a trader. "We are doing virtually nothing. The market  is a big casino. If that's what they want to convey to the public, they should  continue program trading."  </P> <P> This sense of ire over program trading comes at an odd time. A strong case  could be made that there is nothing keeping the stock market at current levels  except programmed buying that kicks in whenever stock prices fall.  </P> <P> The market will decline in time, anyway, but without an assist from the  computers, stock prices would be falling right now, in reaction to the nation's  weakening economy.  </P> <P> By now even the most stubborn optimist realizes that companies aren't doing as  well as they have been in recent years. But just how much has their profit  performance deteriorated?  </P> <P> Boston Co. has been keeping track of third-quarter profit reports during the  past few weeks, and it thinks that if the current earnings trend continues,  profits will be up a modest 6% this year.  </P> <P> By comparison, profits risen around 20% a year for the past few years.  </P> <P> That 6% growth this year, however, is mostly thanks to strong profits in the  first quarter. Profits have been sliding all year, and third-quarter profits  will probably be down 5% to 8% from last year's third quarter.  </P> <P> Earnings-per-share performance looks even worse, although in calculating  earnings on a per-share basis, the figures are often skewed by extraordinary  occurences such as one-time charges against earnings.  </P> <P> Boston Co., meanwhile, thinks the worst is yet to come. Allen Sinai, its chief  economist, says that "with the economy slowing down and labor costs still high,  the squeeze on profits will continue. The outlook for corporate earnings in  1990 would be flat to somewhat higher, at best."  </P> <P> "That's a symptom and a possible cause of some sort of recession," he adds.  </P> <P> Lower corporate profits, of course, should mean a weaker stock market. And the  worse the profit picture gets, the harder the market is going to fall.  </P> <P> Last week was the first time in a long while that the market started reacting  to weak earnings. While the bond market rallied on the prospect of lower  interest rates early last week, stock traders realized that borrowing costs  would only fall because the economy is in bad shape.  </P> <P> The stock market could soon be bothered by something else. According to the  investment firm Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, the profits being reported by  corporations are lower than Wall Street had expected.  </P> <P> Often, the stock market will ignore poor earnings if it was expecting them, but  it doesn't like to be surprised with bad news.  </P> <P> Did you know that the estate of Elvis Presley earns $41,095.80 on an average  day? President Bush earns $547.95. Those facts are from a strange but  interesting new paperback full of tidbits, "On An Average Day" (Fawcett  Columbine). . .  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Prescott tipped for shadow promotion MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, is being widely tipped for promotion to an important economic portfolio after the parliamentary Labour party's annual election of members of the shadow cabinet on Wednesday. Mr Prescott - fifth in last year's poll - is one of a number of front-bench spokesmen from the party's soft left who are expected to attract more support from their fellow MPs than in the last such election in July 1992. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, are also expected to win more votes. Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, and Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, are thought the most likely to be voted out. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, is also expected to see a decline in her support after a lacklustre year. But she stands to benefit from a new requirement obliging MPs to include four women in their 18 nominations, up from three last year. The 18 MPs securing the most votes in this week's ballot are each guaranteed a shadow cabinet place, but Mr Smith has full authority in the allocation of portfolios. There is greater uncertainty than usual about the election outcome because the 69 Labour MPs who entered parliament in 1992 will for the first time be voting after prolonged exposure to those standing.</p>

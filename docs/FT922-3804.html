			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Observer: Designer Labels Not all public relations material is utterly useless. London design company Davies Baron has come up with a clever means of self-promotion. It has sent Observer its lavishly produced slim volume of 12 pithy quotes on Europe, in this year of European single-marketedness. The playwright Tennessee Williams is there: 'That Europe's nothing on earth but a great big auction, that's all it is' - along with the equally robust DH Lawrence: 'One realises with horror, that the race of men is almost extinct in Europe. Only Christ-like heroes and women-worshipping Don Juans and rabid equality mongrels.' Yet it must surely be scraping the barrel to quote Senator Schall 'of Minnesota', who apparently said in 1953: 'To hell with Europe'. Davies Baron could easily have got a similar view from any number of more memorable, contemporary government figures.</p>

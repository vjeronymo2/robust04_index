			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by staff reporters Zhou Jianmin (0719 1696 7044) </F> and Lu Junjun (7120 8823 8823): "Keeping Faith Is the  Foundation and Departure Point for the Consultations Between the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and  Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] started their fourth  round of routine consultations on 25 March. After several days  of argumentative negotiations, the two sides could not reach the  expected agreement on three routine matters, including the  "repatriation of personnel entering the opposite regions in  violation of the relevant regulations and related issues." Under  the pretext that no progress had been made in their  consultations on the three routine matters, the SEF unilaterally  canceled the prescheduled agenda reached between the ARATS and  SEF leaders during their Beijing talks on exchanging opinions or  holding consultations at the fourth round of consultations on  three topics, including "making joint efforts to curb maritime  smuggling and robberies and other crimes," as well as on several  economic, scientific, and technological issues listed in the  "Wang-Gu talks agreement."    These consequences have arisen from many factors, but the  most important one is whether or not the ARATS-SEF consultations  should abide by the principle of keeping faith and should take  this as the foundation and departure point for their  consultations.    As everyone is aware, after the "Xiamen consultations" and  the "Taipei consultations," the leaders of the two organizations  made breakthrough progress during their Beijing talks in  February, and reached a high degree of common understanding on  three topics, including "repatriation of personnel entering the  opposite regions in violation of the relevant regulations." The  two sides' ideas were tending toward a consensus on the  "standard clauses" to be applied, on the "ships to be used by  the two sides," and on "not repatriating Taiwanese hijackers to  the mainland" proposed by the SEF. According to these ideas,  the ARATS raised suggestions fully absorbing the SEF opinions  during the ongoing consulations. We should say that the common  understanding reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders during  their Beijing talks created excellent conditions and laid a  solid foundation for resolving the three routine matters. If  the current consultations can make further progress on this  basis according to this common understanding, the pending  problems and differences will not be difficult to resolve, and  reaching an agreement can be expected soon.    Prior to the current consultations, the ARATS had made  further efforts so that an agreement could be reached. On each  side, concerning the formation of a fishing dispute coordination  organization and enabling the results of mediation to have a  binding force, the ARATS and the relevant mainland departments  studied the existing law and regulations and worked out a  practical method, whereby the results of mediation are to be  changed into a financial claim document with a mandatory binding  force entrusted by a notary office according to the law. At the  current consultations, the SEF raised some opinions concerning  the issues on which the ARATS and SEF leaders had reached a  consensus during their Beijing talks. The ARATS expressed its  willingness to discuss this problem and seek settlement methods  acceptable to both sides.    Comments from Taiwan press circles on the achievements of  the  Beijing talks were good, and Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs  Committee" also issued a statement confirming these  achievements. However, while when these acclaims were still  resounding in the ear, in mid-March the "Mainland Affairs  Committee" and the relevant departments in Taiwan partially  renounced the consensus reached at the Beijing talks. A Taiwan  press report said: "The special group panel decided that the  agreement plan on the three topics, including the repatriation  of hijackers, will abide by the Taiwan side's principle  clarified at the `Taipei meeting'; in other words, our  government and the relevant departments have renounced the high  degree of common understanding reached at the `Chiao-Tang  meeting.'" Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that  no achievements have been made during the current consultations.    Meetings between the ARATS and SEF leaders are important,  high-level meetings held according to the "two organizations'  meeting and relation system," and the opinions and consensus  they express are solemn. Indiscreetly renouncing the consensus  reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders is an act of  disrespect to the leaders of the two organizations. These  people's sincerity for routine consultations and development of  relations between the two sides is doubtful. Recently, Mr. Li  Tenghui has indicated repeatedly that this year "is one for both  sides to form mutual trust." The most important point in  forming mutual trust is keeping faith. If what is agreed today  is renounced tomorrow, and if a consensus reached between the  ARATS and SEF leaders can be denied or neglected, how can  consultations proceed normally and achieve results? How can we  talk about sincerity or forming mutual trust?    Since their establishments, the two organizations have  conducted many rounds of consultations on routine matters  involving the interests of the people on both sides of the  strait, and also have reached two agreements. A review of past  experience enables us to easily understand that as long as both  sides abide by the spirit of mutual respect, equal  consultations, practicality, seeking common ground while  reserving differences, and accumulating common understandings,  it will not be difficult to achieve results and reach an  agreement. Consultations on routine matters should proceed with  the aim of resolving problems and gaining mutual benefit.  Sensitive political issues absolutely can be avoided. The  attitude of making simple problems complicated and politicizing  routine matters is not commendable, and also runs counter to the  fundamental interests and expectations of the people on both  sides of the strait.    The people hope that the leaders of the two organizations  will take keeping faith as the foundation and departure point  for their routine consultations, and on the basis of the  agreements they have reached, will make further efforts for an  early consensus and the happiness of the people on both sides.</p>

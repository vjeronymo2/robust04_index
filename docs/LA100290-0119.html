			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER FOR ACLU LOSES IN RIGHTS CASE  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a precedent-setting damage award  against a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer charged with violating  the rights of a Newport Beach policeman by ejecting him from a public meeting  on police surveillance practices.  </P> <P> The court, ruling without comment, rejected arguments that ACLU lawyer Rees  Lloyd of Los Angeles did not violate Officer Richard Long's rights when he  ordered him to leave a 1980 ACLU meeting that was open to the public.  </P> <P> The case marked the first time that the ACLU, for decades a champion of  individual rights, or one of its lawyers has been held liable for infringing on  the rights of others. The ACLU has already paid Long $35,000 as a settlement.  Lloyd, who was also named as a defendant in the suit, was assessed $10,000 in  damages and $36,000 for Long's legal fees. It was not known if the ACLU will  pay any of the money assessed against Lloyd, who is now in private practice.  </P> <P> For Long, now a sergeant who supervises the Newport Beach police  robbery-homicide squad, the end of the 10-year-old case came as a pleasant  surprise.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to have it behind me. For me, this lawsuit was a matter of  principle," said Long, who said he took personal exception to his ouster from  the meeting.  </P> <P> "I didn't have a problem with registering at the meeting as a police officer,  or having a policeman attending an ACLU meeting," Long said. "But to eject you  out of the meeting and make a spectacle for the purpose of embarrassing you as  an individual, or embarrassing a police department, was just inappropriate, and  it didn't reflect favorably on their support of individual rights."  </P> <P> Long, who had registered as a police officer at the conference in Newport  Beach, was secretly tape-recording the meeting and taking notes on what was  said, according to court documents. He contended that as a community relations  officer, he had a right to attend and learn the ACLU's opinion of his  department's activities.  </P> <P> Lloyd's attorneys had challenged a California Supreme Court decision last April  that let stand a lower court's ruling that Long's removal from the conference  was discriminatory under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  </P> <P> ACLU lawyers had vigorously defended the officer's ejection, saying the right  of free association allowed conference organizers to turn away someone they  believed was an undercover "government agent."  </P> <P> Hugh R. Manes, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Lloyd, said the lower court  decision would have set a "dangerous precedent" by lowering the safeguards for  freedom of speech.  </P> <P> "It says basically that you can't throw a police officer out of a meeting who  is spying on you," Manes said. "This is a freedom of speech issue and freedom  of association (issue), and the right to protest."  </P></p>

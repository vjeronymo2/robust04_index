			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Rabin adopts new tack to win friends and influence people: The Israeli leader's more aggressive approach to foreign policy will have an airing in the US MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, yesterday left for the US on a visit expected to rekindle Israel's relationship with Washington. Underlying the trip will be a broader shift in the Jewish state's approach to foreign policy. Mr Rabin is hoping for an agreement to release Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees denied to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, because of a refusal to freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. President George Bush and Mr Rabin, who meet on Monday, are also likely to smooth out differences over Middle East peace talks, launched in Madrid last year and due to resume in Washington on August 24. The Israeli leader will stop in New York on his way to Mr Bush's home in Kennebunkport, to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. The visit to the US is a chance for Mr Rabin to chart a wider foreign policy course, well away from the isolationist path followed by Mr Shamir. He made this shift clear during his inaugural speech to parliament last month when he said: 'No longer is it true that the whole world is against us.' Within Israel, the government believes there is a willingness to consider compromise on the issue of land for peace. Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister, says the experience of last year's Gulf war, when Iraqi missiles fired from beyond the occupied territories hit Israel, is largely responsible for this shift in opinion. A further factor is the disappearance of Soviet backing for hostile Arab states in the region. 'More and more people believe the territories are not a buffer zone, but part of the problem itself,' Mr Beilin says. 'People understand that if we need strategic depth it has to be much more than the West Bank. We must gain it not by conquering land but by peace agreements with our neighbours.' However, the internal obstacles to such policies were highlighted yesterday when an estimated 5,000 Jewish settlers brought traffic to a halt in West Jerusalem in a protest against restrictions on building in the territories. A further factor in the policy reassessment is the extension of diplomatic links with countries previously following Moscow's lead in isolating Israel. Russia, China, India, the eastern European nations, African countries and even the Moslem central Asian republics have established, or re-established, ties with Israel. Mr Reuven Merhav, director general of the Foreign Ministry until a year ago, says: 'We are no longer a pariah state. These countries have decided that boycotting us is not the way to solve our problems. This should help us to make better decisions also.' In this more open, less defensive approach to the world, Mr Rabin is seeking to re-tune, not reduce, links with the US. With mass immigration placing great strains on Israel's economy, the prime minister is acutely aware of the country's vulnerability to any cut in the annual Dollars 3bn aid from Washington. The collapse of the Soviet Union removed much of the raison d'etre of the strategic agreement, forged between Mr Shamir and President Ronald Reagan, which cast Israel as a buffer against Soviet influence in the Middle East. Then, in the Gulf crisis, Israel seemed more of a liability than an asset to the US as Washington strove to keep Arab nations in the anti-Iraq coalition. But Mr Beilin insists the foundation of the relationship remains secure and will be cemented if Israel can reach peace with its neighbours. 'I believe the fundamental importance of Israel to the US is as the only democracy in the Middle East which has a stabilising effect in a very unstable region. I do not believe this will diminish.' He cites the rise of Moslem fundamentalism as a threat against both Israel and the US. Mr Rabin's government has also signalled its desire for closer ties with the European Community, which has long been perceived in Israel as having a pro-Arab bias. While Mr Shamir's government tried to keep the EC out of any significant role in the peace process, Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, recognise that Europe's proximity to the region gives it a legitimate interest in negotiations. They also acknowledge the economic importance to Israel of close links with the EC, which is the country's biggest trading partner. The government is likely to allow the EC to participate in the multilateral regional talks on arms control - which Mr Shamir blocked. But in return Israel expects the EC to press Arabs to end their economic boycott of Israel.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Why democracy spells disaster in Serpukhov 'If the whole country's voted like our town, the result will be a disaster,' said Mr Alexander Kulakov gloomily. It was 3am yesterday and Mr Kulakov, deputy mayor of Serpukhov, about 100km south-east of Moscow, was surveying the growing piles of ballot papers. His fellow citizens, it was by now clear, had voted in large numbers for the Liberal Democrat party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, variously described as extreme nationalist or neo-fascist, and had put the Communist party in second place. In the referendum on President Boris Yeltsin's proposed constitution the Yes and No votes were neck and neck. Mr Kulakov, immaculate in brown tie, yellow shirt and brown but non-matching jacket and trousers, said he had been a German teacher for 23 years before taking to municipal politics. Although not a member of any party, he proclaimed himself a supporter of Russia's Choice, the party backing Mr Yeltsin and advocating faster economic reform. At Serpukhov town hall, that seemed a lonely thing to be. Serpukhov is in the heart of the belt of territory encircling Moscow that until last year was out of bounds to foreign visitors because many military bases and industries are sited there. Many inhabitants see themselves as having little to gain and much to lose from rapid political and economic change; and they had used the freedom of a new political system - multi-party democracy - to make that clear. Yet the scrupulous fairness with which local officialdom had embraced that system was undeniable. Mr Kulakov also stood out in the town hall by being one of the very few males in sight. Presiding over the proceedings was the secretary of the municipality, Mrs Zinaida Yakimenka, who gravely accepted the 'protocols' or returns brought in by the officials - also women - from polling stations. One of the last sets to arrive came from the nearby Palace of Culture, carried proudly in procession across the square by Galia Shornikova, the secretary, and Tatiana Suyarkova, the president of that polling station, followed by colleagues carring the actual ballot papers in sealed packages. Why was this work seemingly a female monopoly? 'Because men won't work for these wages,' was the good-humoured reply. All involved in the count were employees of a single 'construction' company, but became rather coy when asked what exactly it constructed. Mrs Shornikova gave her profession as 'quality engineer', Mrs Suyarkova as 'head of department'. Russians had voted in the referendum and in four different elections, only one of them (for half the seats in the state Duma or lower house of parliament) clearly pitting rival parties against each other. In the other three - for the regional assembly, the upper house or 'federation council' and for the half of the Duma elected in single-member constituencies - few candidates were identified with parties on the ballot paper. Candidates who did best in Serpukhov were people who had lived and worked in the area. Most of them either had no party affiliation known to those who were counting the votes, or were associated with quite different parties from the ones that did well in the vote for party lists. One could perhaps qualify Mr Kulakov's remark: if all of Russia voted like Serpukhov, the new parliament may be a disaster, but not because it is clearly dominated by one or two parties. On the contrary, it will contain many people with no clear party affiliation, but mandated to defend local interests. That should be a body wide open to presidential influence, if the president knows how to use it.</p>

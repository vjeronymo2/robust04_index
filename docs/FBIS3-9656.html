			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The War Within the Romanian </F> Intelligence Service"]    [Text] Since its creation in 1990, the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI] has enjoyed a rather quiet life.  This institution -- which was set up after the Targu Mures  events [March 1990] and out of the belief that somebody should  deal with would-be spies at work in Romania -- has not had too  many problems to cope with over the past four years. Foreign  agents do not seem to have tested its capability all that much,  since the only danger for our "national security" brought to the  fore by one of the SRI's leaders so far was the attempt of a  foreigner to find out the secret of the pollution smoke from  Copsa Mica by jumping over the fence of an enterprise there.  The only difficulties for the institution have come from the  independent press, which was worried by the possibility that the  SRI might bring back to life the glorious methods used by the no  less glorious former Securitate. However, even these  difficulties were no big deal for [SRI Director] Virgil  Magureanu's institution. The part of the press subservient to  the SRI (yes, there is such a thing in Romania!) took care to  present this concern as the expression of an attempt -- paid  from abroad -- to destabilize the country. Relative harmony has  reigned within the institution, since under the mask of a public  appearance of softness, Magureanu hides his true steel nature.    Consequently, there has not been too much dissidence or  rebellion against his absolute rule within the institution. The  few instances when people dared to utter a word against him were  dealt with in the purest Romanian style, by quietly removing the  naughty ones. However, the SRI seems to have lost its  primordial tranquility of late. This has happened not for  reasons lying outside the institution, since the situation there  seems to be good, even very good for the SRI now. After his  endorsement by Parliament, Virgil Magureanu is no longer being  challenged by the press or the opposition. His proverbial  ability has finally had its way. Nor are spies causing trouble  to the SRI any longer. According to Magureanu, they do not  exist, because they have all already been caught. The causes of  the disturbance come from within the institution. Some two  weeks ago, the public learned with stupefaction (from  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI) that Gheorghe Diaconescu, head of the SRI's  Counterespionage Division, had been dismissed. No sooner had  the upset created by this news evaporated than another piece of  news took its place, namely that the SRI plans to dismiss  Dumitru Cristea, one of Magureanu's prominent deputies. As is  the case with all the institutions of today's power in Romania,  the SRI did not condescend to give too many explanations about  these two events that have taken place inside the institution.  In these circumstances, it is hard for us to realize what is  actually going on in one of the basic organizations for  Romania's national security. Is there a life and death battle  being waged between foreign networks? Have the two events any  connection at all with the uncovering of a KGB spy within the  CIA? Does Virgil Magureanu want to remove the people of a much  stronger adversary, who is placed in the structures of the  current power? Are the various accusations that one hears  against Gheorghe Diaconescu and Dumitru Cristea true? Or are  they pure SRI fabrications? What is certain is that the SRI is  going through a crisis and the crisis is so big that it cannot  be contained within the institution and has quickly become  public knowledge. This is an indication that the confrontation  between Magureanu and some people within the SRI has become a  life and death affair. The sacked general Gheorghe Diaconescu  does not seem to have come to terms with his fate. Despite the  drastic measures taken by Magureanu, it is more than certain  that protegees of the dismissed general are still left within  the SRI. These are not people that give up easily. Even though  they are not doing so directly, they are probably acting against  the SRI director. Threatened with dismissal, Cristea is  fighting hard to prevent it. For the time being, the war is  being waged at the level of mere press statements. However,  nobody can guarantee that they will stay put at that level. The  struggle might also reach the stage of released documents and  compromising disclosures. Therefore, one can proceed from the  assumption that the SRI is undergoing a major upheaval, which  may seriously affect the ability to function of this vital  institution for the country. Who will put an end to this strife?  Looking at all the other bodies of power, we realize with  concern that there is nobody who can bring peace to the SRI.  Consequently, all that is left for us to do is to watch  helplessly the unfolding of this war, which currently poses a  greater danger for us all than the entire political and economic  crisis.</p>

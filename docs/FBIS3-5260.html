[passage omitted]    "Unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute  settlement rules of the World Trade Organization which were  established as a result of the conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay  Round are explicitly prohibited," said Masayoshi Takemura, the  chief spokesman of the Japanese government. Indeed Gatt rules  prohibit a country from unilaterally declaring a trade war on  another.    Without doubt, the Japanese themselves are very concerned  about the trade surplus with the United States because of its  effect on their own export markets. The pricing of these  exports in yen -- which currently is high -- is affecting the  sales of big export products like cars and electronic goods --  which makes them less attractive on world markets.    This in turn is causing hardship to Japanese companies which  have to meet production costs or go bust. Certainly the $59.3  billion trade surplus is also causing problems within Japanese  industry.    When U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor talked about  taking retaliatory action against Tokyo, he did not state in  specific figures what he considered a fair trade balance between  the United States and Japan would be. But if the American side  insists on zero, the Japanese reply of course would be a prompt  "impossible". By insisting on zero, the United States would be  expecting each Japanese to spend twice as much on U.S. products  as each American spends on Japanese goods, because the US  population is twice as large as Japan's.    Simply charging that certain U.S. products do not sell well  in Japan while they do well in other countries or regions, and  using that as evidence that the Japanese market is closed, is  akin to publicizing one's insufficient knowledge of how business  is conducted. Corporate marketing efforts determine the trade  balance between two countries, and politics and diplomacy merely  provide the stage props. This is elementary business logic.  Lifestyles differ from country to country. So do customer  preferences and customs.    The Hosokawa government is pushing ahead with deregulation  to  make its market more free. Japan has shown seriousness in  reducing its trade surplus with the US in its latest economic  stimulus package worth some US$200 million to get the Japanese  economy moving. Coupled with the high value of the yen, U.S.  products will certainly be more attractive to Japanese consumers  when Japan pulls out of its current recession. Are some U.S.  firms trying to reverse this direction by imposing managed trade  controlled by the bureaucracy just for the sake of corporate  profit?    Obviously, Clinton was pressured by domestic concerns to  resort to the Super 301 action on Thursday. According to an ABC  News/WASHINGTON POST poll released before the U.S. President  made the decision, a record number of Americans now favor  imposing sanctions on Japan. The U.S. President himself realizes  that Super 301 provisions can be a thorn in diplomatic  relations. When Super 301 was last in use in 1989, Japan,  Brazil and India were all targeted but sanctions were never used.    Since the Hosokawa government is making conscientious  efforts  to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States, Clinton  might be wise to look back to 1989 and drop the threat of  sanctions. Excessive U.S. pressure can delay Japan's economic  recovery, which will also have an impact on the Asia-Pacific  region, and trade retaliation is not the way to gain access to  Japanese markets.</p>

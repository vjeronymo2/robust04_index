			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lending to consumers up sharply Net lending to consumers rose to its highest level for almost five years in March, while new borrowing reached a record. This indicates that consumer confidence remained high before last month's tax rises began to bite. The net level of consumer borrowing recorded in credit-card transactions, building society loans excluding mortgages, and finance-house lending, was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 516m, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. This compares with Pounds 336m the month before and Pounds 217m in March 1993. The total level of consumer lending for the first quarter of 1994 was Pounds 1.08bn, slightly up from the Pounds 1.04bn recorded in the last quarter of 1993. New credit extended rose to Pounds 5.21bn in March, of which Pounds 3.04bn was accounted for by credit-card purchases. This is the biggest monthly rise in consumer lending ever recorded by the CSO. However, economists yesterday warned that the surge in the credit-card figures, which record only credit-card purchases in the Visa and Mastercard systems, was caused partly by seasonal factors and shifts in consumer spending. The Credit Card Research Group, which compiles data on credit-card transactions, said its adjusted figures suggest that the real growth in credit-card borrowing was Pounds 2.91bn. Meanwhile the CSO said comparisons with earlier periods of recovery were difficult because of the increasing popularity of credit cards. Nevertheless, the result for net lending was better than previous market expectations, which had centred on a rise of around Pounds 350m. The Treasury welcomed the figures. But it pointed out that the broader measure of consumer credit, which includes lending by banks on personal accounts, insurance companies and retailers, had fallen slightly in the past two quarters. Taken together with the rise in credit card and finance-house lending, this may suggest consumers are seeking to pay off previous debts as the recovery gathers pace. Economists warned, however, that the indication of the impact of April's taxes was only likely to be revealed once they had an effect on pay packets. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'The really big issue is what happens in later months. There is a pretty good chance that April's sales will be shown to be down.'</p>

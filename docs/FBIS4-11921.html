			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Acknowledgement and the Required </F> Practical Steps"]    [Text] Through its secretary of state, the United States  has reiterated the acknowledgement that the unfair siege to  which the Port of al-'Aqabah has been subjected for some time  has damaged and pressured Jordan and its economy.    Certainly, such an acknowledgement does not relieve the U.S.  Administration of its prime responsibility for the outcome of  this siege of Jordan's only port. It even doubles the U.S.  responsibility for this siege, because the U.S. Navy is the  party that carries out acts of harassment and inspection, and  because the U.S. Administration is the party that controls the  international decision that is supposed to be made to end  Jordan's suffering and the pressures on it as a result of this  unfair siege.    By addressing this message directly to those concerned and  by  dotting the i's and crossing the t's by requesting the parties  concerned to halt their pressure and lift the siege, Jordan is  asking each party to assume its responsibility if this part of  the world is to be stable and if peace based on justice,  comprehensiveness, and durability is to be established.    Jordan has never failed to comply with international norms  and laws. Likewise, it has never departed from its policy on  abiding by the UN resolutions. In return, the international  community is supposed to champion Jordan's just demands by  safeguarding its legitimate rights, understanding its  constructive pan-Arab and regional role, and fairly examining  the burdens Jordan is shouldering due to its position in the  center of a region rocked by catastrophes and events due to  international reasons, regional interpretations, and continued  Israeli aggression after the Zionist entity was established on  the land of Palestine.    Having realized that it is mainly behind many of the reasons  for the suffering Jordan is facing and for the repercussions  Jordan is enduring, the United States must move from sweet words  that indicate it is aware of Jordan's suffering as a result of  the siege to making a decision. Such a decision should not only  lift the unfair embargo, but should also prove, by deeds, that  the U.S. Administration is in the process of addressing the  repercussions resulting from the series of injuries and mistakes  committed against this country. Everyone should be confident  that Jordan will not yield to pressure, change its positions, or  relinquish its constant principles to suit circumstances or  occasions.</p>

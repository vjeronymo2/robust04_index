			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Rights and responsibility: The rethinking of the black agenda in the US We have locked arms and our circle will not be broken,' proclaimed the Reverend Benjamin Chavis, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People this week. He was speaking at the end of a three-day summit in Baltimore of more than 100 civil rights activists, church dignitaries, academics and businessmen, which had ended with pledges to follow a united black agenda. Mr Chavis's ringing tones echoed the proudest years of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, but the gathering drew scepticism from many black commentators and politicians: this was a summit of leaders whose credentials have been called into question. Memories revived from three decades ago did not dispel the impression that the leaders were still fighting 1960s wars and are not equipped to tackle 1990s problems - such as economic disparities and urban violence, the causes of which are not only racial discrimination. The prominent civil rights era activist, Mr Andrew Young, who was President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to the United Nations, once argued the role of the black leader is to lead whites more than blacks. 'Black people are the victims of economic inequities in our society and, to change those, the people we really have to change are white,' he said. But while there is still much to be done to educate white Americans about continuing racism and discrimination, many African-Americans feel the time has come to look inward for help. 'Let's stop begging. Let's start doing it for ourselves,' commented one black urban activist. That will require considerable change in many of the organisations represented at the Baltimore meeting, notably the NAACP itself. The NAACP is the oldest US civil rights organisation but, even in the 1960s, it was to a great extent bypassed by more energetic movements such as Dr Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Its great achievements came mostly in influencing civil rights legislation, and litigation against discriminatory laws, at a time when it seemed that if legal segregation of blacks and whites could be banished, everything else would follow. 'The world was simple then; our enemy was an easy target,' says Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, chairman of the department of Afro-American studies at Harvard University. Today, with most legal obstructions to equality removed, the NAACP seems to many blacks a less relevant organisation, and its membership has halved to about 500,000 from its peak. Mr Chavis, a 46-year-old firebrand who took over the NAACP leadership last year, has tried to make the organisation more relevant, particularly to younger blacks: for instance by organising meetings with inner-city gang leaders. Yet these steps have alienated some older NAACP members, not to mention corporate sponsors. Other groups represented in Baltimore have also seen their influence decline. Church ministers, though they still hold sway among many lower income groups, are not the dominating voices they were, and have lost much of their hold over better-educated, middle-class blacks. Two groups were glaringly absent at the Baltimore summit. First, black politicians. Although black political influence is disproportionately small in relation to the US black population, the number of black elected officials continues to grow rapidly, climbing in the past decade by 43 per cent to more than 7,500, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington think-tank. There are now 40 African-American members of Congress and increasing numbers of black mayors. The second group poorly represented at this week's summit was the urban, black young whose violence, low life expectancy and dismal economic prospects are among the most pressing problems facing the African-American community today. In the past, the Reverend Jesse Jackson could legitimately claim to speak, at least sometimes, on behalf of this disaffected group, but his career peaked with his campaign for the US presidency in 1988. One delegate at the Baltimore meeting who does reach today's angry black youths was Mr Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist movement whose anti-white rhetoric has made him, for whites, the most controversial figure in black America today. But even those blacks who denounce his hatred of whites acclaim the more positive side of Mr Farrakhan's message: that blacks must build their future for themselves and not wait for whites to give it them - an argument which has more in common with the 'empowerment' agenda of right-wing Republicans. It is partly because white groups continually call on black leaders to denounce Mr Farrakhan that his appeal has grown so much. But the anger of Jewish groups and the discomfort of some black politicians at Mr Farrakhan's presence at the Baltimore summit diverted attention from other issues confronting African-American leaders: gaping economic disparities and inner-city violence. Professor Cornel West, professor of religion and director of Afro-American studies at Princeton University, also argues in his book, Race Matters, that a pervasive nihilism is 'the most basic issue now facing black America'. The statistics are grim. Black unemployment is more than 12 per cent, nearly twice the national rate, according to the National Urban League, the civil rights group. A third of black Americans live below the official poverty line. Homicide remains the largest cause of death for black males aged 15-34. Suicide, once half as common among blacks as among whites, has climbed, for black men, to white rates. There is a consensus among black intellectuals that to solve this morass of problems requires a less dogmatic approach by both black and white leaders than has been the case over the past few decades. The white dominated government, and society, need to improve opportunities and remove inequalities but blacks need to take greater responsibility for their future. 'The liberal notion that more government programmes can solve racial problems is simplistic - precisely because it focuses solely on the economic dimension. And the conservative idea that what is needed is a change in the moral behaviour of poor black urban dwellers highlights immoral actions while ignoring public responsibility for the immoral circumstances that haunt our fellow citizens,' writes Professor West.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Persona valued at Pounds 20m Persona Group, a Surrey-based distributor of personal computer networking products, is coming to the market by way of a placing which values the company at about Pounds 20m. Some Pounds 9m is being raised of which about Pounds 2.5m will be available to the company to cut debt and strengthen the balance sheet. The group lost money in 1989 and 1990 and was then reorganised. Between 1991 and 1993 sales rose from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 22.9m, while pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 1.75m. Mr Wayne Channon, chairman and managing director, said the company distributed products mainly of US companies. Persona is a direct competitor to the larger Azlan Group which came to market earlier this year. The two companies have similar product and marketing strategies. Azlan's striking price was 230p. It is now trading at 264p. Persona is in one of the fastest growing parts of the personal computer business as customers seek to tie their machines together in local and wide area networks. Persona distributes products from companies including 3Com, Mountain Networks and SynOptics directly to resellers. Sponsor to the flotation is Beeson Gregory. Impact day will be March 28.</p>

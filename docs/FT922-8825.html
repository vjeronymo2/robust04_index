The agreement by Sappi, the country's largest pulp and paper group, to buy a 90 per cent stake in Hannover Papier of Germany, the fourth-largest woodfree coated paper business in Europe, is significant for a number of reasons. Not only is it Sappi's second major step into the international arena in less than two years, but it also marks the first time since financial sanctions were introduced in the mid-1980s that a South African company has used its own paper to finance a large acquisition. Sappi, advised by Morgan Grenfell, says the deal, which is subject to various regulatory approvals, enhances its position as an international forest products group. In future, around two-thirds of group turnover and profits will be generated by exports and from non-South African subsidiaries. The deal also forms an important early part of Sweden's privatisation programme. Sappi is buying 80 per cent of the stake from Ncb, the Swedish state-owned loss-making forestry group which put Hannover Papier up for sale last year. CS First Boston and Handelsbanken Investment Banking advised Ncb. One company's non-core disposal is another's strategic purchase, as illustrated by a number of deals. German consumer products company Joh. A. Benckiser agreed to buy the Coty cosmetics and fragrance business from Pfizer of the US, which wants to focus on the business strategy of its main healthcare operations. UK electronics components group Unitech sold its Rathdown payphones subsidiary to GN Great Nordic Group, the Danish telecommunications company, as part of its plan to concentrate on its main business in power supplies, connectors and control products.</p>

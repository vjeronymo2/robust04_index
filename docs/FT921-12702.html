			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: BCE turns in record figures for full year BCE, the telecommunications group that controls Northern Telecom, reported higher fourth-quarter earnings despite the recession and reduction in long-distance rates. Net income was CDollars 346m (USDollars 298m), or Dollars 1.11 a common share, up 7 per cent from CDollars 322m, or CDollars 1.05, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 5.2bn, against CDollars 4.8bn. The contribution from Bell Canada, the telecommunications subsidiary, was stable at 74 cents per BCE share. For the full year, BCE lifted earnings to a record CDollars 1.23bn, or CDollars 4.01 a share, up 16 per cent from CDollars 1.06bn, or CDollars 3.50, in 1990. Revenues advanced to CDollars 19.9bn, up 8 per cent from 1990's CDollars 18.3bn. BCE credited the strong results to a continuing high level of investment in technology and to expense controls. It said its results in the latest quarter were helped by lower borrowing costs. For the full year, Bell Canada contributed CDollars 2.97 per BCE share, little changed from 1990, Northern Telecom 97 cents, against 89 cents, Montreal Trust 7 cents compared with 14 cents, and TransCanada PipeLines 13 cents, against 22 cents. BCE Mobile Communications suffered a loss of 6 cents, against 5 cents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The highlight of this morning is the resumption of  the consultations between the government and the labor unions.  The meeting was convened to present the government's responses  to workers' demands contained in the memorandum submitted to the  prime minister by the labor unions on 1 May. Here is Braimah  Ouedraogo with a report.    [Ouedraogo] A pay rise is out of the question. According to  the explanations of the budget minister, an increase of 40 to 50  percent will result in a budget deficit of 93 billion and 97  billion respectively. Therefore, there are no funds to finance  such a pay rise. Fuel prices cannot also be reduced since they  are no longer standardized.    The commerce, industry, and mines minister, who was present,  talked about the establishment of a market street which would  enable small traders to obtain cheap stalls. He also talked  about the National Grains Office [OFNACER] and the Faso Yaar  [state-owned marketing organization]. OFNACER has already been  liquidated and the minister assured consumers in high-risk areas  that cereal shortages could be covered by SONAGES [expansion  unknown]. However, the Faso Yaar could not be rehabilitated  despite the unions' demands. This is a sector that the state  has transferred to the private sector in order to make it more  efficient. The state is reported to have lost more than 6  billion CFA francs in organizations such the Faso Yaar.    Finally, concerning pharmaceuticals, the health minister  outlined a number of measures taken to protect people's pockets.  These include negotiations with the French Pharmaceutical  Producers Union for the latter to reduce wholesale prices. With  the 2 billion granted by France as post-devaluation subsidy for  pharmaceutical imports, there are plans for price cuts of 20 to  25 percent in the next few days. The health minister promised  to reduce the number of pharmaceutical importers, which should  lead to a considerable reduction in retail prices for the people.</p>

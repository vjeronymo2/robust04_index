			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Turning the tide for Tyneside jobs: Chris Tighe on the area's employment prospects after the death of traditional industry Interconnection Systems, one of Tyneside's successful businesses, keeps a list of people wanting to join the company. The list has more than 1,000 names. The company, Europe's biggest producer of printed circuit boards, is an interface between the old and new Tynesides. Based in South Tyneside - Britain's highest unemployment travel-to-work area with nearly one man in four jobless - it has been recruiting men from Tyneside's last, now closed, coal mine and its last, dying, shipbuilder to join a workforce of 850. Among the lucky ones is Mr George Cook from Jarrow, a former Swan Hunter boilermaker. Mr Cook is delighted with his new job after 19 years in shipbuilding - the production-line work is clean and his weekly flat wage for a permanent night shift is Pounds 250 gross, Pounds 31 more than at Swans. But, he says, some former Swans recruits at the company would return to shipbuilding tomorrow for the companionship it offered. Tyneside's traditional industries also once offered regular wages for men, a sense of identity and a formidable world role. David Dougan wrote in his History of North East Shipbuilding: 'The labour flowed in and the work flowed out and the north-east became just about the richest part of the richest country in the world.' The problem for Tyneside is that this description was of the last quarter of the 19th century. Between 1970 and 1990 Tyne and Wear, a county with a labour force of 523,000, lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs - half the total - and 25,000, of its primary jobs - two-thirds - mostly in mining and energy. It gained 50,000 service sector jobs. Today, its proportion of manufacturing employment is slightly below the national average. According to a recent Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit report mid-1990s prospects for the county's manufacturing sector, underpinned by a growing motor industry centred on Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, look good. But it warns of 'much more problematical' prospects beyond then and predicts some decline in manufacturing employment due to strong productivity growth. Inward investment has been vital in diversifying the local economy and offsetting the decline of traditional industries. Indigenous Tyne and Wear companies are also strong performers in world export markets. Yet in spite of decades of effort, Tyne and Wear still has the fourth highest county unemployment rate in mainland Britain with 65,413 people  - 12 per cent - unemployed. The loss of Swan Hunter and probably of shipbuilding compounds other worrying trends. Other cornerstones of the Tyneside economy - turbine generator maker Parsons, tank builder Vickers, Northern Electric and British Gas - have all recently announced significant redundancies. Professor John Goddard, head of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies, said: 'What is particularly worrying about the present time is that the job losses are in the managerial, professional, R &amp; D area.' In a region already deficient in substantial locally controlled companies, Newcastle, the north-east's capital, has also suffered a spate of losses of regional offices to the Leeds area. Prof Goddard said big companies and decision-makers in a local economy were vital to the success of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Tyne and Wear is also having to fight to improve low levels of entrepreneurship and low post-16 rates of staying in education - both legacies of its heavy-industrial past. Mr Ian Taylor, Tyne and Wear sponsor minister, estimates the number of new jobs created locally by SMEs, high technology companies and inward investors is equalling the losses in long-established companies, but he adds: 'They aren't equal in terms of job function.' For many former Swans employees this means that they are job-hunting house husbands while their wives go out to work. 'It's total role reversal,' says 38-year-old Mr Graham Gibson, whose typist wife works a six-day week in two jobs. A former blacksmith who worked his way up to an operations control job at Swans, Mr Gibson was made redundant after receivership. He tries to maintain his morale while seeking full-time work - 50p saunas for the jobless and spending more time with his children have been the pluses of being out of work. And he is now a better qualified unemployment statistic, thanks to a college computer course. 'I can do CVs for other lads now on my word processor,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME-FRONT WATCH;  </P> <P> FOREIGN TAKEOVER?  </P> <P> It's finally possible to start compiling a list of those things and places that  Americans treasure. Office buildings -- even venerable digs like Rockefeller  Center and its skating rink -- don't make it.  </P> <P> Neither do golf courses like Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> But at the very top of the treasure list is Yosemite National Park, high in the  Sierra Nevadas, whose tall trees and rugged slopes were spared by John Muir,  California's pioneer environmentalist.  </P> <P> This tidbit of cultural anthropology has emerged as a sidelight to the  negotiations on a possible takeover of MCA Inc. by Japan's Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co.  </P> <P> Among MCA's global holdings is the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., which has the  hotel and restaurant concession in Yosemite. And according to the National Park  Service, the idea that a Japanese company might wind up running things at the  park has provoked a deluge of angry mail from Americans.  </P> <P> We suspect public reaction would be negative to the "sale" of a place like  Yosemite to any foreign interest, but certainly the fact that a Japanese  company is involved feeds the anxiety some Americans feel. Imagine the Japanese  reaction if an American fast-food company were to announce plans to put a  hamburger or pizza parlor at the base of Mt. Fuji. That probably wouldn't go  over too well, either.  </P> <P> But there are some indications that Matsushita is sensitive to national  treasures and would not be interested in the Yosemite concession. Storms pass  swiftly in Yosemite. This one probably will be no different.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: Traps for the unwary VINDICATION by Frances Sherwood Phoenix House Pounds 14.99, 435 pages HOTEL PASTIS by Peter Mayle Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 313 pages THESE TWO novels share three features: they are both first novels  - one written by a seasoned writer, the other by a relative novice; neither is good; and both are not good in a remarkable way. Braving the hazards inherent in fictionalising real life characters, Frances Sherwood based her novel on the life and times of Mary Wollstonecraft. A strong-headed woman of humble social background, Mary Wollstonecraft developed into a formidable champion of women's rights. She experienced London at the end of the 18th century, witnessed at first hand the destructive convolutions of the French Revolution, had lovers  - including the writer William Godwin, whom she eventually married  - and friends among the leading literati of her time, and herself left a considerable literary legacy which, for her time, was audaciously provocative. Her story offers many traps to the fiction-maker. Ms Sherwood manages to fall into most of them. Her recreation of 18th century England and France is freshly vivid. Her sense of place and time is evocative in the right way. Where she fails is in breathing life into her characters, Mary Wollstonecraft in particular, who comes across as rather doughy. In an author's note Ms Sherwood admits that she had allowed 'many deviations' from the actual historical life of her heroine and her contemporaries. 'I wanted to popularise Mary, to make every woman in America know about her,' she writes. 'The biographers have always been perplexed about the discrepancy between Mary's personal life and what she wrote  - emotion and chaos versus emancipated rhetoric. But I could understand this perfectly from my own life.' The notion offers an interesting approach, but this discrepancy is not demonstrated and Mary, in spite of Ms Sherwood's contrived portraiture of unconventionality, remains conventionally dull. The demerits of Hotel Pastis are the converse. The hero, Simon Shaw, a rich successful advertising man in London is stung by an expensive divorce and exposed to the creeping mid-life ennui that comes with too much money and success. As the going gets rough Simon decamps for Provence, choosing 'the most relaxed of his three cars for the trip, the Congo-black Porsche convertible'. As luck would have it, Congo-black Porsche breaks down in a village near Gordes, where Simon meets beautiful Nicole, who persuades him to convert a derelict gendarmerie into a luxury hotel. Simon quits his advertising business and does just that. While the hotel gets under way, along with romance between Simon and Nicole, a group of small-time local crooks are planning a caper. A happy and prosperous end is effected through the agency of an old-fashioned Texas tycoon whose large amiable son, staying at the hotel, is kidnapped by the gang. The plot and characters are the stuff of an up-market comic book, if there is such a thing. But the writing sustains a glib, cheerful zip even through the many banal situations. The assured style admits no literary pretensions  - a redeeming factor. Mr Mayle  - of A Year in Provence fame and fortune  - carefully sticks to a well-defined aim. To borrow a phrase  - only slightly modified  - from a Provencal character in the novel: 'il ne pete pas plus haut que son cul'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President Received"] </F>   [Text] On Friday [28 January] President Thomas Klestil  received Qiao Shi, president of the Standing Committee of the  PRC National People's Congress, who was accompanied by a  high-ranking delegation from Beijing. In the presence of  Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer, the Austrian president and  the Chinese parliamentary president held a talk, lasting about  one hour, discussing the developments in the Asian area and on  the territory of the former Soviet Union as well as bilateral  relations. The president also expressed Western concerns in  connection with the human rights situation in China and with the  situation in Tibet. In his answer, President Qiao Shi expressed  the conviction that the different assessments of the human  rights issues can be explained primarily by the differences  between the history and traditions in Europe and those of the  Chinese people. Tibet has always been part of the Chinese  territory, but the government in Beijing is willing to  "negotiate about all issues" with the Dalai Lama -- "with the  exception of Tibet's independence." The Dalai Lama, with whom  there have been indirect contacts, is, however, not willing to  do so. The Austrian president and his guest extensively  discussed the instability in the successor states of the Soviet  Union, which, in the Chinese view, has developed mainly because  political and economic reforms "are not synchronous" and that  additional hotbeds of danger have arisen from the great number  of ethnic conflicts.    The president of the Chinese parliamen, who also was asked  by  the Austrian president about the topical discussion about North  Korea's nuclear potential, expressed satisfaction about the  initiation of talks between the North Korean Government and the  United States -- obviously, progress has been made there.  China's central position is the desire for stability in  Southeast Asia. Thus, the process of reunification between the  two parts of Korea and between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan  must be achieved in peace and not by war or tensions. Beijing  is trying to make rapprochement easier through direct airline,  post, and trade contacts with Taiwan. President Qiao Shi also  reported on the state of affairs and the problems in the process  of Hong Kong's reintegration in the PRC. It is Beijing's firm  will to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the  current British crown colony along the principle of "one  country, two systems." Both sides emphatically stressed the  desire for even closer economic cooperation, which has been put  on a new basis as a result of Chancellor Vranitzky's visit to  China. According to the Chinese guest, Austria is "a country  that we can take as a model." In this connection, the president  of the parliament renewed the invitation to the Austrian  president to visit the PRC and conveyed personal greetings from  Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>

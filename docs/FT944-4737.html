			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: An alternative 'Nutcracker' - Ballet Even before those dread wailings at the door - Marley's Ghost? No: Carol singers - the festive season announces itself with a first Nutcracker. Happily, Adventures in Motion Pictures' irreverent re-working avoids most of the care-worn elements of the story - one more smirking stage-tot registering delight at the sight of a Christmas tree and I take seriously to drink - and turns the tale jokily upside down. No cosy Biedermeier household but a grim children's home; Drosselmeyer as Himmler; Clara in danger of losing her Nutcracker beau to a skating sex-bomb. AMP's staging is, we are told, in its last season. Which is a pity. I reported with pleasure on its Edinburgh Festival creation two years ago, and on last year's revival. It is still entertaining on its current outing at Sadler's Wells, and stage successes being as rare as they are for modern dance, I would urge mothballs rather than the knacker's yard. Matthew Bourne's production cocks snooks in the best fashion, sending up the ideas of a Victorian orphanage, Dickensian merriment - I love the way the pauperish decorations are whisked away as soon as benign visitors leave the orphanage - and the dire and sugary divertissements of Ye Olde Nutcracker itself. This year AMP again fields some of its original cast. Etta Murfitt is a touchingly tough Clara, and Andrew George looms large as the Nutcracker of her dreams (and just what those dreams are we surmise from his ultimate occupancy of her bed). I also enjoy Barry Atkinson's vicious Dr Dross with his bruise-a-kiddie philosophy. The staging is polished, speedy, well performed, and includes a neat complement of snide jokes, not least the boy orphan who wants a doll and gets a football. Bourne's dances are bright, clever for the generality of the action - he maintains a brisk pace - but he is defeated by Tchaikovsky's greatest moments. To make sense of the sublimities of the adagio after the mouse-battle, of the snowflake waltz and the great pas de deux, needs stronger dancers and more searching dances. (The score, in a skilled reduction, sounds well with the New London Orchestra under Ronald Corp). It is, all in all, a jolly evening, and can be seen as an inoculation against the conventional Nutcrackers that are massed on the dance-horizon, rich with menace and sweeties and optimistic choreography and performance. More, I suppose, of all that anon. Staging sponsored by The Kobler Trust. At Sadler's Wells until December 10.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NORTH ISLAND WORKER LAYOFF PROPOSAL PLAYED DOWN BY OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Officials downplayed a Pentagon proposal Thursday to cut costs by shutting down  the Naval Aviation Depot at North Island Naval Air Station, which would force  the layoff of 4,500 civilian employees.  </P> <P> A report in the San Diego Tribune warning of the possible loss of 4,500 jobs  caused "much concern" Thursday, said local Navy spokesman Mike Hammond, who  added that the announcement was premature.  </P> <P> In Washington, an aide to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) said the option to  close the depot "is absolutely the least likely to be implemented."  </P> <P> Both Hammond and Hunter aide John Palafoutas said the proposal is part of a  broader Pentagon plan being considered to cut military spending. Pentagon  officials are expected to announce the cuts next month, said Palafoutas.  </P> <P> A wide variety of options is being considered, but the chance of the depot  being closed is slim, he added. The option involving North Island would have  Navy planes flown to the Air Force's Logistic Center in Sacramento for  maintenance.  </P> <P> "The Department of Defense is spending $25 million to upgrade the facility at  North Island to accommodate nuclear carriers and the 90 to 100 planes they  carry. It doesn't make sense to take the Navy planes and fly them all the way  to Sacramento," Palafoutas said.  </P> <P> He added that Pentagon officials have assured Hunter there is nothing to worry  about.  </P> <P> "We've got 4,500 employees asking, 'What am I going to get in my stocking for  Christmas?' We're saying that it's not going to be a cold Christmas," said  Palafoutas.  </P> <P> He said another option being studied is combining a similar facility at Alameda  in the Bay Area with North Island, and turning the depot here into a hub for  some ships and planes of the Pacific fleet.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: ONE FLEW OVER THE TURKEY NEST  </P> <P> I suspected it might happen. By mentioning cat-sacrificing at Halloween and  turkey-eating at Thanksgiving, I have incurred the wrath of animal activists  within my readership zone.  </P> <P> They have gotten up off their knees, where they have been praying for wounded  sperm whales and the souls of dead dogs, long enough to telephone and call me  names.  </P> <P> One of them, who said she was a member of Compassion for Animals, asked angrily  how would I like to have my head cut off and be served, roasted and stuffed,  for dinner today?  </P> <P> I had to reply I would not like that at all.  </P> <P> "I knew it!" she said triumphantly, and hung up.  </P> <P> The column that got them riled made only passing reference to the fate of  turkeys on Thanksgiving and to the ritual of sacrificing cats on Halloween.  </P> <P> My main concern in the essay was for the human wreckage on Skid Row and all  those others who drift through life without hope of moral redemption.  </P> <P> The animal activists who called didn't even mention them. Let the fools shuffle  by as best they can, I guess, but please, God, save the turkey.  </P> <P> I am not a cruel person. I do not advocate the random killing and eating of  rhinos and bald eagles, of which there are too few in the world, and you will  not find me slaughtering elephants on the Masai Mara.  </P> <P> But we are, after all, omnivorous creatures, and as such will eat anything that  doesn't eat us first. The turkey, alas, falls into a category of delicacies  consumed with impunity.  </P> <P> On that subject, one animal activist who telephoned called my attention to a  letter that appeared in The Times several years ago.  </P> <P> The letter challenged the term "Turkey Day" and suggested that since we do not  eat our mothers on Mother's Day, why do we eat turkeys on Turkey Day?  </P> <P> We should honor the bird, it concluded, instead of "twisting off the dead  animals's neck and breaking its bones while swallowing pieces of the corpse."  </P> <P> Powerful stuff.  </P> <P> The caller was particularly concerned about the care and treatment of turkeys  before their deaths. If we insist on eating them, shouldn't we at least provide  adequate housing during their short and anguished lives?  </P> <P> Turkeys, the caller said, lived in "cramped wire cages" and had their beaks  ripped off to avoid pecking each other "in the often cannibalistic panic  brought on by their crowded living conditions."  </P> <P> I learned later he was getting his information from a press release issued by  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an organization whose members wear  T-shirts that say, "I don't eat my friends."  </P> <P> Each to his own epiphany.  </P> <P> "Turkeys live a lousy life," the caller said, his voice rising, "and you're a  part of their torture!"  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> After a day of harassment by angry people, I telephoned the National Turkey  Federation in Virginia to ask if the cruelty charges were true.  </P> <P> "Nonsense," said Eddie Aldrete, director of public affairs for the federation.  </P> <P> "Turkeys are not raised in 'cramped wire cages' but in expensive,  scientifically designed, environmentally controlled buildings as big as  football fields."  </P> <P> He made it sound like a Club Med for turkeys.  </P> <P> Eddie went on to say that a turkey requires only 2.7 square feet of living  space to be happy but is given 4 square feet.  </P> <P> "That's more than the Japanese get on their little islands," I said jokingly,  but Eddie is not one to joke about turkeys.  </P> <P> Later he would point out that his license plate reads EAT TRKY and his boss'  plate reads GOBBLE.  </P> <P> "What about the charge that you rip off their beaks in a cruel and unusual  manner?" I asked.  </P> <P> Eddie sighed. One could almost see him shaking his head, weary of answering the  same old accusations.  </P> <P> "You clip your toenails, right?" Eddie asked. "Well, each turkey gets the top  of his beak clipped once in its lifetime. The process is about as painful as  manicuring your toenails."  </P> <P> That is done out of compassion, he said, so that the little darlings don't hurt  each other.  </P> <P> Eddie added: "Turkeys are happy and well-treated. We do not thrive on tortured  birds. Stressed turkeys produce tough meat."  </P> <P> Now you've heard both sides. If you are inclined to eat turkey today, eat it  knowing its last days were spent in a kind of Grand Turkey Hyatt, with wine and  laughter.  </P> <P> If you don't believe that, eat tofu, as Eddie said, and bean sprouts. I respect  your right to dine as you like. Please respect mine.  </P> <P> We're having dolphin.  </P></p>

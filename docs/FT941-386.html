			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson buys PosTel properties Hammerson, the UK's fifth largest property company, yesterday unveiled the acquisition of a Pounds 143.3m property portfolio from Postel, in a deal that leaves the pension fund with a 12.3 per cent stake in Hammerson. The acquisition is Hammerson's first big deal since its Pounds 199m rights issue and change of management last year. Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said the purchase was in line with the company's new strategy of rebalancing its portfolio and adopting a more active investment policy. The portfolio, which includes the Queensmere Shopping Centre in Slough and the HMV store in Oxford Street, is expected to give Hammerson scope to improve values by redevelopment and more active management. Postel's sale of the portfolio is the result of a long-term plan to liquidate the properties held in one of its funds. 'This is a way of staying exposed to the property market while the cycle is still positive, while enjoying the benefits of more entrepreneurial management,' said Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive. Payment for the six properties, which comprise 563,000 sq ft of retail space and 231,000 sq ft of offices generating rental income of Pounds 10.9m a year, takes the form of Pounds 25.3m cash and 31.9m new shares at 370p each. Although the deal was well received by the City, Hammerson's share price fell by 8p to 354p as investors reacted with disappointment to the company's 1993 results, which revealed a greater than expected fall in net asset value from 384p to 343p. Hammerson's portfolio declined by 5.1 per cent in value to Pounds 1.46bn, after a 13.6 per cent decline in the company's properties in continental Europe, North America and Australasia and a 9.1 per cent increase in its UK properties. Its UK office portfolio increased by 14.2 per cent in value; its UK retail portfolio rose by 4.5 per cent. Hammerson's pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 39.8m. Operating profits, excluding exceptional items relating to provisions and investment sales, were flat at Pounds 96.4m (Pounds 96.8m). Net rental income dropped by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 117.6m. Hammerson warned pressure could continue on the company's rental income until there was a widespread improvement in tenant demand. Earnings per share rose to 13.9p, compared with a loss per share of 2.7p; after excluding exceptional items, earnings remained constant at 10.2p. A final dividend of 6.5p makes an unchanged total of 10p for the year. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / HGV test sites to be sold off THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced plans to privatise the annual testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches by selling the 91 testing stations of the Vehicle Inspectorate. A flurry of announcements on Civil Service reform issued as parliament rose for the Whitsun recess included the sale of two transport agencies, a new agency to run the law courts and a review into further commercialising Her Majesty's Stationery Office, one of the most profitable agencies. But there was an unexpected reprieve for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea, where 3,000 staff process information on 24m vehicles and 35m drivers. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said that he had rejected its privatisation for the next three years. The sale of Vehicle Inspectorate testing stations will affect the jobs of about 900 civil servants. The stations will be sold where they are profitable, initially with sole testing rights for their area. After a transitional period other companies will be allowed to compete for the business. Unprofitable stations will be contracted out to the private sector. The government plans to specify the maximum fee which can be charged, and hopes that profitable testing stations will compete by charging less than the maximum. Mr MacGregor also announced plans to sell the Transport Research Laboratory and DVOIT, the transport department's information technology arm. The research laboratory, based at Crowthorne, Berkshire, employs more than 600 staff on research into road safety, highway construction and traffic management. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, told the House of Lords yesterday the agency to run the court service would be created in April 1995. It would be headed by a chief executive who would be responsible for the management and administration of all the courts in England and Wales except magistrates' and coroners' courts. Magistrates' courts are managed locally. The review of Her Majesty's Stationery Office will consider whether it should be allowed to compete for business in the private sector. HMSO is at present restricted to selling its services to the public sector. The government moved to cut red tape for road transport operators yesterday by proposing that goods vehicle operators' licences should be required only for vehicles weighing 6 tonnes or more and should no longer need to be renewed at five-year intervals.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Forecasts of mergers boom borne out by deals PREDICTIONS of a post-election mergers and acquisitions boom in the UK were borne out by some of last week's international deals, writes Brian Bollen. Two of the UK's biggest names featured for different reasons. Corporate clearing house Hanson sold the Ever Ready battery manufacturer to US foods group Ralston Purina in what was described by a financial adviser as a tidying-up exercise before making a larger acquisition. The latest stage in ICI's restructuring involves the sale of its two salt businesses in a transatlantic management buy-out led by major US salt producer D George Harris &amp; Associates. The offer by German components group Robert Bosch for Worcester Group, a UK central heating boiler maker, is thought likely to turn up the heat in the ongoing debate about corporate governance. While management has recommended the offer, some shareholders were not happy, arguing that the price should have been much higher and that the group's directors would receive a different offer from outside sharehold-ers. There was discord too at engineering group Cronite, where most of the board recommended the cash offer from AFE, a French engineering company.</p>

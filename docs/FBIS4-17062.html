			<p>BFN     [Text] The third round of talks between the presidents of  North Ossetia and Ingushetia Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev  will be decisive, head of the temporary administration in the  state of emergency zone Vladimir Lozovoy said in an interview  with Interfax in Nazran.    The leaders of the two neighboring republics are expected to  meet in the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, Nalchik, next week.  At the previous round of talks the two sides agreed only on the  preamble to the treaty on the implementation of the Russian  president's decree on the return of refugees and forced migrants  in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.    "If this time talks bring no concrete results, there is no  sense in wasting time further," Lozovoy believes. In his  opinion, the Russian Security Council and the Federal Assembly  will then have "to clearly indicate what the temporary  administration and the presidents of both republics should do."  Lozovoy noted that he had established normal working contacts  with Galazov and Aushev. But in resolving problems he adheres  only to the policy of the center. "Precisely from this position  I would like to state that all of us should work for the sake of  accord in Russia," Lozovoy said.</p>

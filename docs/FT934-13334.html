			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Coal mine closure talks set to start BRITISH COAL is expected to propose a maximum of four pits for closure when it starts formal talks with unions on colliery prospects, scheduled for the first week of November. During the following six months up to a further 14 pits will be named for closure. British Coal at present operates 30 pits. The closures will be announced in small groups at local level, partly because of the government's desire to minimise publicity. Details of British Coal's likely timetable and tactics emerged yesterday as the Labour party gave notice it will launch a full debate on coal in the Commons on Wednesday. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who has forecast that the workforce will be cut to barely 10,000 by next spring, will lead the assault. The government was still undecided last night about the role to be played by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who has only just returned to Westminster following his heart attack and a subsequent bout of flu. He confined himself to a watching brief when Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, informed MPs about the latest developments in the industry on Wednesday. Labour leaders have also secured a debate on Tuesday on new regulations on mine safety. Neither debate is likely to result in a government defeat. Similarly, local union officials say there is little stomach in mining communities to fight the closures. Under the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, the industry consultation procedure revived by British Coal on Wednesday, a series of appeals can delay shutdowns for up to nine months after they have been announced. In practice, few closures have involved such lengthy procedures. British Coal said yesterday that since the procedure was introduced in 1985 only seven mines of a total of 86 eligible to go to final review had done so. All seven had closed eventually. Formal negotiations under the procedure are likely to begin the week after next. They will take place at group level at the northern and Midland groups, where the bulk of deep mines are located. It then allows for matters to be referred to pit-level negotiations. If no agreement is reached, the issue is referred to the group and then to national headquarters. A final appeal can then be lodged to an independent review panel.</p>

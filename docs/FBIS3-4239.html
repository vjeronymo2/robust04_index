			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Ceiling Is Set To Curb Rising </F> Raw-Silk Prices"]    [Text] China has imposed a cap on soaring prices for raw  silk, which threaten production stability and curtail exports.    From Friday, March 25, the maximum purchase price for raw  silk was set at 200,000 yuan ($22,989) per ton. The measure was  taken in concert by China National Silk Import and Export Corp  and 31 local companies to encourage production and exports.    So far this year, the price of raw silk has jumped 25  percent  to 230,000 yuan ($26,438) per ton.    To a large degree, analysts say, the price spike has held  back silk exports. Last year, exports of raw silk declined from  1992 but the precise figure was not available.    Soaring domestic prices for raw silk add another burden to  the sluggish international silk market, analysts say. They add  that this year silk consumption will not rise in Europe or  Japan, the major markets for Chinese silk products.    The unchecked spiral in prices for raw silk has fueled a  rampant increase in the nation's production of mulberry, whose  leaves are fed to silkworms.    Over time, though, the production expansion will force down  prices for raw silk, eventually hurting mulberry producers.  This will unsettle farmers in China's hinterland and minority  regions, whose livelihood depends on mulberry.    The price gyrations resemble those of 1988, when the country  was caught off guard by fierce competition among growers of  silkworm cocoons. Cutbacks in cocoon production led directly to  price hikes.    At the same time, booming domestic silk enterprises demand  more raw materials, making the shortage of raw silk even more  acute.    In addition, many manufacturers raised prices following the  recent revision of tax regulations and the unification of the  dual exchange rates.    In fact, such increases are considered unwarranted because  the value-added tax introduced this year imposes no extra  burdens on major domestic enterprises.    In contrast to raw silk exports, silk garment makers  anticipate a buoyant overseas market this year.    Last year, they exported more than 310 million pieces,  compared with 70 million in 1990. The garments accounted for 70  percent of all silk exports last year.    Chinese silk production last year ballooned to 32.7 billion  yuan ($3.76 billion), or 22.26 percent more than in 1992.    Silk production is the country's third largest textile  sector  after cotton spinning and artificial fibre.    China is still the world's leading producer of silk  products,  accounting for more than 65 percent of the total. In 1993,  China was responsible for some 70 percent of the world's output  of silkworm cocoons.</p>

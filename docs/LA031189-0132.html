			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL SENDING EXECUTIVES TO MOSCOW TO EXPLORE BUSINESS POSSIBILITIES  </P> <P> As the U.S. government considers relaxing controls on computer exports to the  Soviet Union, Western Digital Corp. of Irvine is dispatching several executives  to Moscow next week to explore ways to do business with the Soviets.  </P> <P> Three Western Digital representatives will meet with officials of several  Soviet government agencies "to get a better understanding of what their  requirements might be," said Joseph Pleso, Western Digital's vice president of  international sales.  </P> <P> Western Digital manufactures a wide variety of components that are used to  build personal computers. Pleso said the company hopes to learn more about the  Soviet Union's plans for increasing the use of PCs throughout its society and,  possibly, setting up its own PC manufacturing industry.  </P> <P> "If the Soviets intend to build their own personal computer, we'd like to be  able to sell them our products," Pleso said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considering Change  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the federal government is considering loosening controls on the  types of PC products that American manufacturers can ship to Soviet Bloc  nations.  </P> <P> Michael Liikala, director of the Newport Beach office of the U.S. Bureau of  Export Administration, said the government is reviewing whether to allow  exports to the Soviet Union of PCs that use a microchip first introduced in the  United States in 1982. The particular technology under review involves  so-called 286-based computers powered by Intel Corp.'s popular 80286 microchip.  </P> <P> "There's an assessment being done in Washington as to whether 286-based  computer technology is currently available in sufficient quantity and quality  from other (Western nations) to the Soviet Union," Liikala said. "If we  determine that's true, then we're required by Congress to decontrol these  products and allow them to be shipped to the Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> "It's not state-of-the-art technology, and that's why we may decontrol it," he  added.  </P> <P> Personal computers using the Intel 80286 chip are widely available from foreign  manufacturers in Japan, South Korea and other nations. The most advanced  personal computers manufactured in the United States and other Western nations  use more sophisticated chips such as the Intel 80386, which came to the market  in 1985.  </P> <P> A lifting of a ban on 80286 technology would not only affect personal computer  makers but also producers of medical, oceanographic and other electronic  equipment that use that type of microchip, Liikala said.  </P> <P> Western Digital has already had some business dealings with the Soviet Bloc.  Last July, the company announced a contract to sell more than $1 million of  computer components to a Bulgarian company.  </P> <P> But 8 months later, the Irvine firm has yet to ship its first product to  Bulgaria because the Department of Commerce hasn't yet approved an export  license.  </P> <P> Western Digital's Pleso said the company still expects government approval for  the Bulgarian order, and isn't sure what is causing the delays. "They (the  Commerce Department) just keep saying, 'We're still working it.' "  </P> <P> Liikala said the Commerce Department is often slow to approve export licenses  to the Soviet Bloc, partly because they sometimes also require approval by the  Defense Department and other agencies. But he said the average time for  processing licenses to the area was 50 days last year. He could not explain why  the Western Digital application is taking so much longer.  </P></p>

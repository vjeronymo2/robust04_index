			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Appointments: Clive Discount Michael Walker has moved up as the new chief executive of Clive Discount following the resignation of Nic Chamberlen, who becomes non-executive chairman. Clive, one of the UK discount houses, has been owned by the Prudential Insurance Company of America (PIC) since 1986. Until recently it had functioned as part of the UK arm of Pru-Bache, the securities house, but the latter has severely cut back its London activities. Clive is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of PIC Holdings and Walker consequently moves on to the main board of the American company. Chamberlen, 53, had been chairman of the European corporate finance section of Pru-Bache Capital Funding, and had been less involved in Clive in the past couple of years, leaving Walker, 43, largely running day-to-day operations from his position as managing director. Hence, while Chamberlen's other activities have been wound down, he has not returned to an executive position at Clive.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Conservative MPs back tax incentives on equities MOST Conservative MPs and City professionals agree that the government should provide further encouragement through the tax system for individuals to invest in equities and unit trusts, according to a survey. However, the study of politicians and senior City staff shows Labour MPs as very negative about such encouragement - more than three quarters (76 per cent) opposing it and only 14 per cent in favour. The survey, conducted by Access Opinions, shows that while the views of Labour MPs towards private pensions have softened, they retain suspicions of the stock market, and by implication its involvement in the pensions industry. The survey aimed to test the change in attitudes on the left in favour of private economic activity, and among Tories on whether Britain's marginal propensity to save is too high to maintain healthy consumption levels. The responses of Tory MPs on the panel of 100 politicians were almost the same as those of a panel of stockbrokers, bankers and representatives from insurance, accountancy and the law. Three quarters of the Tories favour more tax encouragement for investors while 23 per cent oppose them. That highlights the fact that most do not agree that the current marginal propensity to save is too high. Both Conservative and Labour MPs support the principle of pension contributions being wholly excluded from taxable income, as does the City. Nearly nine out of 10 Tories (89 per cent) support that proposition, compared with 77 per cent of Labour MPs. No Labour MPs oppose it strongly. Similarly, most MPs would support a proposal to tax different forms of savings in the same way wherever possible, but there is significant opposition in both parties. Taxing Savings.

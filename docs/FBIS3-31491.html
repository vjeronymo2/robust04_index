			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The frozen discussions  between the World Bank and the Czech Government concerning loans  of $225 million for aid to North Bohemia are not connected to  the fact that state guarantees, being able to amount to not more  than eight percent of the state budget, have already been  exhausted for this year, said Premier Vaclav Klaus after today's  cabinet meeting.    He said that the government had accepted by no means all of  the World Bank offerings, and added that regardless of whether  the Czech Republic should or should not accept loans offered by  the World Bank, or whether or not they complied with the aims of  the country, scores of meetings would have to be conducted.    Klaus stated that the government was aware that the  possibility to cover loans with state guarantees had been at its  limit for a few years, but that this limit had never been  breached.    The government carefully followed the provision of  guarantees, he said. Nevertheless, during consideration of the  provision of a guarantee for construction of the  Decin-Praha-Breclav railway link, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik  had been requested to put forward data on the provision of state  guarantees for previous years.</p>

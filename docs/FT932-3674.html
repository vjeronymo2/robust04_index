			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Motoring: Small but perfectly formed MOTORING correspondents do not, as rumour would sometimes have it, spend all their working lives driving supercars at high speed from one luxury watering hole to another. At least, I do not. The reason is simple. For every potential buyer of a Ferrari or V12 Jaguar, there are thousands of motorists to whom small - in size and price - has to be beautiful. So, as a wine writer might put it, one has to go to Tesco's tastings as well as those in the first-growth Bordeaux chateaux. And it is not a bad experience. Recently, I spent two mainly wet and windswept weeks in a Daihatsu Mira. Next, I drove its bigger brother, the new Daihatsu Charade, followed by the Mazda 121. My mini-tour ended with the latest European baby car, the Fiat Cinquecento. The Mira, a tiny five-door hatchback, only an inch or two longer than a Mini, is a microcar. These are the only kind Japanese in congested cities can buy without first proving they have somewhere to park. The Mira is tall and thin. Though I am well over 6ft, my head did not touch its roof. I could reach the back seat without contortion and sit there uncramped. Hip room was limited and with four people on board, luggage space minimal. But two-up, with the back seat folded, the Mira passed my 'two sets of golf clubs in their trollies' test easily. The 847cc engine was so smooth I forgot it had only three cylinders. Using the slick five-speed gearbox freely, the Mira was quick off the mark in town and nimble across country. A gentle driver should average at least 50 mpg (5.65 l/100 km), with 65 mpg (4.34 l/100 km) possible on a long, unhurried journey. Because all Charades - they are the Pounds 6,395 Mira's bigger brothers - have power steering as standard they are even lighter to park. There are six models: a starter GSe at Pounds 7,995, four more 1.3 litre versions with manual or automatic transmission at between Pounds 8,795 and Pounds 10,200, and a warmed-up, 1.6-litre GSXi at Pounds 10,850. For town use the best Charades are the GXi and GLXi automatics (Pounds 9,645 and Pounds 10,200 respectively) because there is nothing like a small, lively two-pedal car for taking the stress out of urban motoring. The transmission is a three-speed plus overdrive which makes motorway driving as relaxed, but not quite so economical, as in the five-speed manual. These felt livelier on Scottish moorland roads, the sporty GSXi even more so, but I would go for the two-pedal versions every time. The multi-valve engines are so refined the main noise source is tyre roar, and this is a problem only on really coarse surfaces. When Mazda introduced the new-shape 121 it was an automatic without the option and could not be had with power steering. Now it comes with power steering but two-pedal control is not available. Instead, buyers get a huge, power-operated fabric sunroof which makes it feel almost as open as a cabriolet with the side windows up. The dumpy yet attractively curvy 121 could never be mistaken for anything else. It is easy to enter and leave through four doors and has a good boot. Mazda is pitching the Pounds 9,800 121 at young drivers. They probably will not mind that it has not a single flat surface inside, so that one's shopping list or letters for the post end up on the floor. Finally, Fiat's Cinquecento. This carries the banner first raised by the Fiat 500 in 1936 when it was the first really small car to offer the sophistication of much larger ones. The new Cinquecento looks not unlike a scaled down Fiat Uno. Though very small - only 10ft 7in/317cm long - it has lots of headroom and really does seat four full-sized people in fair comfort. It rides better than one has any right to expect of such a small car. There are no power steering or automatic transmission options and the standard five-speed gearbox has a rubbery sort of change. But the good news is that it feels as if the robots in Fiat's Polish factory have screwed it together properly and the price starts from Pounds 4,995.</p>

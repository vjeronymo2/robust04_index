			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: A trend towards the multinational approach - Sponsorship This will not be an easy year for arts sponsorship in the UK. Some large companies, such as Shell, are cutting back on their help for the arts; others, such as BP, are freezing their expenditure. Few are actually axeing what are still minute sums of money in the corporate budget, but the years of expansion are over. Even well-established and successful arts projects, such as the annual regional tour by the Royal Shakespeare Company, are on the point of cancellation because no sponsor can be found. The tour has been livening up parts of the UK other arts institutions never reach since 1978, with Hallmark, NatWest and most recently BT picking up the bill in return for hospitality and promotional opportunities. But, in January, BT told the RSC that, after four years, it was switching its support to Northern Ballet. The RSC has quickly approached the 40 most likely sponsors, but without success. The sponsorship costs Pounds 185,000, but for that a company gets 33 weeks, including seasons at Stratford plus touring with Richard III, visiting small towns from Cornwall to Scotland. There is only a month left for a sponsor to be found before the arts suffers its first major casualty of the recession. ***** Arts sponsorship may be freeze-framed in the UK - although the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts reports that all the money available under its Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme is still being snapped up by keen new sponsors - but there is growing interest in multinational initiatives. Funding a European tour by an orchestra, or a visiting arts exhibition, gives sponsors wonderful opportunities to meet key politicians and business contacts in potential export markets. Nomura Securities picked up important commissions from the Czech and Hungarian governments thanks to introductions forged from its support of the National Theatre's recent tour to those countries. Now CEREC, the organisation representing national arts sponsorship associations and based at ABSA's HQ in London's Docklands, has come up with the first guide to the tax situation for sponsors in 17 leading European countries. The 62-page booklet Business Support for the Arts in Europe is available from CEREC or from the sponsors, and authors, accountants Arthur Andersen. The quick summary reference offers the eye catching facts that Greece is the only country reviewed where sponsorship is not a deductible business expense and that in Spain (because of the Olympics, the Expo in Seville, etc), there is a 30 per cent tax deduction for donations during 1992. The booklet estimates expenditure on arts sponsorship in various countries, ranging from Pounds 57.2m in the UK to FFr650m-700m (Pounds 66m-71m) in France and DM250m-300m (Pounds 87m-104m) in Germany. The figures for the Netherlands are Fl 150m (Pounds 46m) and for Ireland, IPounds 2m (Pounds 1.8m). The variations in tax assessment between sponsorship and donations are outlined and the position of foreign companies mentioned. This wealth of information is essential for companies considering pan-European sponsorship campaigns. Some sponsors fail to take advantage of tax breaks on their expenditure. They are doing themselves, and the arts, no favours in foregoing such benefits. This free booklet, nicely timed before 1993, when a surge in pan-European sponsorships is anticipated to celebrate the single market, should be an essential aide-memoire. CEREC has also commissioned research into why companies undertake European sponsorship. Not surprisingly, it concludes that most companies sponsor on a haphazard project-by-project basis, with the main advantage reckoned to be the kudos gained by being seen by peer businesses as a 'European' company. Then comes the ability to gain access to overseas politicians, in particular the influential executives at European institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg. ***** Our television detectives seem to have taken to drink recently. Inspector Morse keeps going thanks to the sponsorship of Beamish stout and Maigret is supported by Kronenbourg lager. Both brands are marketed in the UK by Courage, which has committed itself heavily to film sponsorship. Its television links are close to advertising, but it is also prepared to invest in film as an art form. It stumped up Pounds 30,000 to enable Nomad Pictures, formed by two young marketing men with film school links and using young actors and student technicians, to produce Augustine, about a young mental patient in a 19th century French asylum. As well as seeking brand awareness from its credits on the film  - and encouraging young talent - Courage used the inexpensive project to test the waters of the film industry. It is now contemplating investing Dollars 3m in a full length movie, House of America, in which it will have an equity stake as well as a promotional spin-off. ***** Kallaway, the sponsorship consultant, has picked up two new assignments. It will manage for Morgan Furze, part of IDV, its Baileys SummerStage series of 12 open air classical music concerts in the grounds of English country houses, and it will also look after the Munch exhibition at the National Gallery in November, which is being sponsored by Norsk Hydro to the tune of Pounds 250,000 plus. ***** The Cleveland Orchestra will be playing at this year's Salzburg Festival, and the London Proms, courtesy of the communications company, Ameritech, which is putting up Dollars 1m over the next three years. This also brings the orchestra to Salzburg in 1994 and perhaps 1995. Ameritech's subsidiary Ohio Bell has long been a supporter of the orchestra, but this is the first time that it has attracted a major backer outside of Cleveland. Its biggest local sponsor is BP America. ***** IBM is behind one of the largest arts sponsorships ever seen in Ireland  - IRPounds 450,000 to enable the National Gallery in Dublin to take a show of Old Master paintings from its collection to the US.</p>

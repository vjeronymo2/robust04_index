			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: Paradise of birds - In Hauraki Gulf, off Auckland, Michael J Woods visits islands being returned to nature A STRANGE green blob on the green screen had been bothering Warwick Murray for some time. Then we burst through the dense grey curtain of fog into a few acres of sunshine gleaming on the bright sea. And there was our green blip - a large container ship, a sheer steel cliff, foghorn bawling, plugging gently through the water. Warwick eased back the throttles and the inflatable settled sluggishly in the water and stopped almost on the spot. We had barely skirted the vessel when we were enveloped by fog once more. Now a much longer green line showed on the boat's radar screen - a line of islands. We were almost upon it and already in radio contact with Ray Walter, the resident warden, when the mist cleared abruptly and a steep green hillside reared up in front of us, topped by a red-and-white lighthouse. We motored gently to the end of the wooden pier and climbed on to the island of Tiritiri Matangi, just one of some 47 islands in Hauraki Gulf maritime park, directly off Auckland, New Zealand. Few big cities have such beautiful areas of wilderness as close to their centre and as directly accessible as Auckland does. While Tiritiri Matangi is not quite as easy as some of the islands to reach, it is an open sanctuary and has been at the centre of an initiative by the Department of Conservation over the past decade to preserve native wildlife. When New Zealand originally split from the ancient super-continent of Gondwanaland, it possessed only two mammal species, both of them bats, so its wildlife was able to develop without fear of ground predators. An array of flightless birds such as the kiwi, and a large green ground parrot called the kakapo, emerged. Although Tiritiri remained free of predators, pastoral farming reduced the original native forest cover to scattered remnants in a few steep gullies: too small to support indigenous wildlife. But once acquired by the DoC, agriculture ceased and re-afforestation began. A range of organisations - sports clubs, schools, youth organisations, walking groups - volunteered to visit the island and plant young trees. Over the past nine years, more than 200,000 saplings have been planted and already the 550-acre island is reverting to natural bush, enabling many threatened native birds to be re-introduced. Along the shore I found breeding boxes for blue penguins and, by opening the trap doors in the roofs and peering through the grubby glass ceilings, I could see the small but chubby silvery birds within. A board-walk nature trail leads to the top of the island past a small pond containing a pair of brown teal, the fourth most endangered water fowl in the world. From thick shrubs I heard the warbling notes of tuis, or parson birds, and spotted several saddlebacks picking through the leaf litter. The DoC has already brought a number of bird species to the island. I came across the feeding holes left by the long slender beaks of the nocturnal little spotted kiwi and saw several brilliantly-plumaged takahes courting. I followed another board-walk back to the boat, winding through a remnant of natural bush, dense dark woodland dominated by huge sprawling pohutakawa trees with tatty bark. In the gloom we saw one of the 24 rare North Island robins imported to the island a year ago. Buoyed by its success on Tiritiri Matangi, the DoC is about to undertake a much more ambitious scheme in the gulf, the replanting of the island of Motutapu. Motutapu and the neighbouring island of Rangitoto are connected by a short causeway. It is hard to believe that two islands so closely linked could be so different. The 3,750 acres of Motutapu are green farmland, full of echoes of the Dorset countryside: steep dells, wonderful views and a nearby sea. Rangitoto might as well be the moon, for it is an island of lumps of tumbled black basalt, great bare deserts, touched and crusted here and there by a few daring, flaky grey lichens and the occasional bold moss. But small areas of woodland are becoming established, the tree limbs hairy with lichens. Rangitoto is a mere 600 years old - a volcano which last erupted 200 years ago - and its colonisation is of international interest. It is a favourite destination of Aucklanders, with a regular boat service from the city. Runners trot up to its 800-ft summit, and Sunday walkers enjoy its paths and the magnificent views from the top where the crater is now thick with native bush. From here the vehicular track led me down to the causeway which I crossed to wander over Motutapu's green acres, enriched by the fertile ash erupted from its neighbour, before returning along the shore path to the ferry landing on Rangitoto. The unfamiliar evergreen trees overhanging the water have a strange resemblance to the gnarled and twisted oaks on the north-west coast of Scotland, and this similarity was reinforced by the fluting call of a blackbird whose predecessors were brought here by acclimatisation societies in order to make new immigrants feel more at home. The DoC's project to replant Motutapu is not only ambitious in terms of size. There are other problems to be overcome. Introduced herbivores - possums and wallabies - confined to the wild areas by farming operations had almost destroyed the natural vegetation both there and on Rangitoto. So helicopters were used to spread over Rangitoto a poisoned bait palatable to mammals but not to birds. The work is continuing, but the number of feral animals has been greatly reduced and native tree species are showing promising signs of recovery. From the summit of Motutapu it is possible to see right down the gulf and pick out the distant form of Tiritiri. Its prefabricated lighthouse was made in London last century and carried to the island in sections by ship - one of the better things exported from Britain to New Zealand. Rangitoto and Motutapu are accessible from Auckland. The visitor centre (tel: 09-366-6888) has details of all services, but Fullers Rangitoto Ferries (09-771-771) provides the most frequent service. Check times of return ferries as alternative transport is expensive. Tiritiri Matangi can be reached by a twice-weekly ferry in the summer. The DoC in Auckland will help (09-307-9279). You can stay in the bunkhouse on the island, though you need to take your own food and bedding (09-479-4490).</p>

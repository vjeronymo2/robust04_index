			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter issued by Iosif Syaredich, editor in chief of </F> NARODNAYA GAZETA: "NARODNAYA GAZETA Will Always Be With Its  People!"]    [Text] Only several issues of NARODNAYA GAZETA failed to  appear. This also applies to SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA,  and MINSKAYA PRAWDA. The paper received numerous bewildered  phone calls: Are the authorities unable to help the media  during these difficult times?    As for NARODNAYA GAZETA, it expects fair relations with the  state, its founder -- the Supreme Soviet -- and the government,  rather than help. The Presidium adopted a resolution obliging  the state to pay for the printing of laws, decrees, and other  legislative acts on supplementary pages. Normally, it would  have to provide the newspaper with necessary materials and  funds. But what really happened? Until now, our newspaper has  not been paid for the second half of last year and the first  quarter of this year. When a question came up about purchasing  paper for supplementary pages for the rest of the year, a  declaration was issued, saying: "The Supreme Soviet has no  money..." The newspaper had to secure a bank loan of more than  1 billion rubles [R] to buy paper for those pages, ordered by  the newspaper's founder. We hoped that this issue will be  eventually resolved.    Unfortunately, after almost two months, the paper has not  yet  received the money back. If it were a matter of  R100,000-200,000, one could forget this sum, but the state owes  the paper nearly R2 billion.    This is why, dear readers, we were forced to suspend the  publication of our newspaper. Beginning today, its publication  -- and that of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA  PRAVDA -- will be resumed. Serious talks were held with the  founder and government structures. There is every reason to  believe that the attitude toward NARODNAYA GAZETA will be more  fair.    On 4 May, chief editors of the above papers met with Prime  Minister Kebich. We upheld the interests of both our newspaper  and the entire Belarusian press. From the state reserves, two  tonnes of paper have been allocated and will be distributed  among publications commensurate with the size their circulation.  Publications whose leadership refused to join the action of  solidarity will certainly receive their portion. Well, life is  always easier behind someone else's back...    Although the paper will not be given by the state free of  charge, the most important thing is that it has been provided  and there is no need to deliver it from Syktywkar or Kandapoga.  One more thing: As V. Kebich promised, future paper purchases  will be carried out on a centralized basis. Newspapers will  receive financial assistance in the form of cheap credits. A  possibility arose that taxes and tariffs on printing services  might be lowered. Most importantly, the state will subsidize  the postal service which, in turn, will relieve the papers from  covering delivery and distribution costs. Also, some other  proposals were accepted which were intended to protect openness  by stabilizing the situation of the press.    True, neither M. Hryb nor V. Kebich have so far signed any  official documents confirming the compromise reached between the  newspapers that were forced to suspend their activities and the  authorities. However, let us hope that the high-ranking  officials will make good on their promises. We would so much  like to put the crisis behind us and never see it happen again.  We decided not to wait until all legal matters are handled  because we know that readers look forward to receiving NARODNAYA  GAZETA and other papers every day. So, the editorial staff will  do its best to ensure that NARODNAYA GAZETA is always with the  people. We want to thank all those who cared for the fate of  our paper and who would give anything for the freedom of speech,  democracy, and the revival of their native Belarus.    We would like to assure you that those cases of "truancy,"  which did not happen through any fault of NARODNAYA GAZETA,  SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA, will be  compensated for by the end of this quarter. We will keep our  word, esteemed readers! We hope that our friendship will become  even stronger, more sincere, and fruitful. This is why we trust  that subscriptions for the third quarter, which began yesterday,  will bring good results. Let me note that the price of almost  all national publications newspapers will reach R9,000. The  papers accepted this low amount based on the assumption that,  like bread, newspapers should be affordable for all social  groups -- even though there are people for whom even this price  is too high. This is why we call for the leadership of  enterprises, institutions, collective and state farms, and other  people to help those who have found themselves in a difficult  situation. NARODNAYA GAZETA should really be in every house,  with every family.    [Signed] Iosif Syaredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA editor in chief.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Both India and Pakistan claimed victory  after the deliberations at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights  Commission on the Pakistani resolution on human rights  violations in Kashmir.    Pakistan withdrew the resolution hours before it was due for  a vote on 9 March after high-level contacts between Pakistan,  China and Iran and an appeal by the delegates of developing  countries for its withdrawal. While Indian officials were  euphoric in claiming "stunning diplomatic victory" for the  "unconditional withdrawal" of the resolution, which they say has  now "lapsed," Pakistani officials were adamant that the  resolution has only been "deferred" after what it described as  "singular diplomatic victory" after India came under  international pressure to allow a fact-finding delegation from  Muslim countries to visit Kashmir.    While the Indian press was near unanimous in hailing the  outcome as vindication of the Indian position that the Kashmir  issue could only be solved bilaterally, and in predicting  increasing domestic political pressure on Bhutto for her "Geneva  rebuff", reaction from Pakistani media was mixed, with some  papers even going to the extent of describing it as a "loss of  face" for Pakistan.    Within hours of the Geneva vote, Delhi All India Radio in  English at 0245 GMT on 10 March described it in its news  bulletin as "vindication of India's principled stand" and  broadcast a statement by External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh.  Singh thanked China and Iran for "prevailing upon Pakistan to  withdraw the resolution." He also expressed the hope that  "Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the Simla  Agreement and desist from misleading the international community  through false allegations of violations of human rights in  India."    A radio commentary that morning urged Pakistan to "accept  defeat." The commentary said: "Will Pakistan learn a lesson  from the humiliation it suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the  conference shows that while rhetoric as resorted to by the  Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it  does not yield results. India believes in peaceful coexistence  with its neighbors and has consistently reiterated its  commitment to bilateral dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having  traversed the path of defeat -- will now realize that there is  no substitute for peace, truth and honesty."    In its prime-time 1530 GMT news bulletin on 10 March, Delhi  Radio broadcast Foreign Secretary Srinivasan's statement. The  statement affirmed that "Pakistan's withdrawal of the resolution  is unconditional and there is no question of linking it with  sending of a fact-finding mission to Kashmir." At the same  time, Srinivasan ruled out Iranian mediation on Kashmir.    In its 1230 GMT and 1530 GMT bulletins on 10 March, Delhi  Radio reported the reaction of Indian political parties. The  ruling Congress-I Party described the development as "a  diplomatic success for India as Pakistan found itself totally  isolated in the international community." The statement added:  "The clear message to Pakistan from Geneva is that it must go  back to the Simla pact." The Communist Party of India hoped  "good sense will prevail on the Pakistan Government now that it  has withdrawn its resolution at the UN Commission on Human  Rights at Geneva. Pakistan should make an honest effort to  solve it within the framework of the Simla Agreement." The  opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, while hailing the outcome,  urged the government "to take firm action to curb the militancy  in Kashmir." BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee wanted  "consolidation of the gains of Geneva vote by taking concrete  steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley." The Communist  Party of India-Marxist, while expressing satisfaction, called on  the government "to find a political solution of the Kashmir  issue."    The Indian press was unanimous in praising what it described  as Pakistan's "failure" and the "rebuff" it received. It also  contended that the Geneva failure may create domestic political  pressure for Benazir Bhutto. The anti-establishment INDIAN  EXPRESS said in the editorial "Returns From a Hard Line" on 11  March: "Islamabad is trying hard to cover up its debacle at the  UN Human Rights Commission session by claiming that its purpose  of internationalizing the Kashmir issue has been amply served.  Why does it imagine that the chancelleries around the world are  not already fully aware of the Kashmir dispute after three  full-scale wars and four years of low intensity proxy conflict?  In point of fact, the ridiculous strategy of internationalizing  Kashmir has more to do with internal pressures of successive  Pakistani regimes than with gaining external support. This is  why Benazir Bhutto may well face the most daunting domestic  challenge of her career following the Pakistani misadventure in  Geneva."    An article by HINDUSTAN TIMES columnist M.K. Dhar said: "The  rebuff Pakistan suffered at Geneva, where its concerted efforts  to internationalize the Kashmir issue failed miserably, deals a  severe diplomatic and political blow to Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto whose anti-India rhetoric is expected to become more  strident in the coming weeks. Having queered the pitch for a  showdown with India and having forced to retreat under the  impact of adverse international opinion, she has made herself  vulnerable to a renewed attack by her political adversaries.  She will find her position further weakened, precariously  poised as she is as the head of an inherently unstable  government."    The first Pakistani report came in an Islamabad Radio  Pakistan Network Urdu news bulletin at 0200 GMT on 10 March.  While announcing the "deferment" of a vote after India agreed  to allow Muslim fact-finders to visit Kashmir, the report said:  "A three-point package has been worked out out after high-level  contacts among Pakistan, Iran and China. Sixteen countries  supported the formula." The same news bulletin included Foreign  Minister Sardar Asif Ali's statement saying: "Pakistan has  achieved its objective to awaken world opinion about the plight  of the Kashmiri people. Despite the deferment of the  resolution, the Kashmir issue will be raised at other world  forums."    The 1100 GMT bulletin that day included Information Minister  Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal's statement echoing the foreign  minister's remarks. Kharal said: "Pakistan has not withdrawn  the resolution, but it has only been deferred at the  intervention of its Chinese and Iranian friends." In its  prime-time 1400 GMT bulletin, Pakistan Television in English  broadcast a recorded statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ali defending Pakistan's decision to withdraw the resolution.  The statement said: "The package deal is that a resolution has  been tabled. It has not been withdrawn. It remains in its  original form without any amendment whatsoever, but it has been  deferred. So, the Kashmir resolution is now on the world  agenda." In its 1500 GMT Urdu bulletin on 10 March, Islamabad  Radio referred to Foreign Secretary Sharharyar Khan's statement  that India should include the Islamic Conference Organization  secretary general in the Muslim delegation allowed to visit  Kashmir under the package deal.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's reaction was reported by  Islamabad Radio at 0100 GMT on 13 March. Bhutto told foreign  correspondents in Islamabad that "Pakistan will now consider  presenting a resolution on the issue at the United Nations." On  the Geneva vote, Bhutto said: "India had promised us through  Iran that it would allow the ambassadors of Islamic countries to  visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen countries expressed concern  over the people of Jammu and Kashmir and violation of human  rights when the voting on the resolution was deferred." In its  1400 GMT English bulletin on 16 March, Pakistan Television  referred to Bhutto's interview with Voice of Germany Radio  defending the Pakistani decision to withdraw the resolution.  She said: "Voting on the resolution was not important as it is  not a game of numbers, rather it is a matter of conscience."    State-run media gave scant coverage to reaction by  opposition  parties not satisfied with the government's explanation. At  0200 GMT on 11 March Islamabad Radio broadcast an under-minute  report saying that Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, chairman of the  National Assembly Kashmir Committee, was "not happy with the  deferment of the voting on the resolution on Kashmir at the  Human Rights Commission in Geneva." The radio said main  opposition leaders Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and Maulana Mohammad  Ajmal Khan have also "criticized the deferment of the voting on  the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir."    The press, however, widely published opposition criticism.  Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Group leader Chaudhary Shujat  Hussain described Geneva as a "fiasco" and said "it is a black  day in the struggle of Kashmiri people, who are rendering  unprecedented sacrifices for their rights and have been stabbed  by an unpopular government." Gauhar Ayub Khan, deputy  opposition leader in the National Assembly, was more critical,  saying "the prime minister should immediately step down as she  had brought an embarrassment to Pakistan, which had no parallel  in the history of the country." He added the negative vote  outcome was due to the "criminal negligence on the part of the  government." Mian Shahbaz Sharif, opposition leader in Punjab,  condemned the government decision and accused Bhutto of  "patronizing" India. He said: "She is not prepared to lose any  single opportunity to please India by playing with the national  interests of Pakistan, which are in no way dear to her." He  appealed to the people to stand up against the "pro-India"  government.    Editorial reaction was mixed. The pro-government THE  PAKISTAN TIMES said in the 11 March editorial "A Successful  Move" that "Pakistan has achieved the basic objectives  underlying the move" to table the resolution in Geneva.  Insisting that Pakistan has succeeded in highlighting the  Kashmir situation for the world, it claimed: "Thus, while on the  one hand Pakistan has succeeded in putting India on the  defensive on the human rights issue in held Kashmir, on the  other, it retains the diplomatic initiative in the matter." The  Urdu-language Rawalpindi daily JANG published an editorial on 11  March supporting the government move in wake of "pressures from  China, Iran and 15 other friendly countries" by saying: "the  foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the resolution  Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is correct to a  great extent."    The English-language daily THE NATION, however, took a  different view. In the 11 March editorial "Loss of Face in  Geneva" it said: "Whether it was an outright foreign policy  debacle, as the Opposition would insist, or a tactical retreat  dictated by the compulsion of circumstances as is likely to be  offered as an alibi by the Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the  least, has been guilty of gross miscalculation in Geneva. And,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be made accountable for  misleading the government and the people about the success of  our campaign to win the international support." The paper  added: "whether we like it or not, New Delhi has scored a major  propaganda victory."    The Rawalpindi Urdu-language daily NAWAI-I-WAQT said in a 17  March editorial said "This indicates the weakness of the  government's foreign policy. The withdrawal of the Pakistani  resolution at a time when the United States, United Kingdom and  most other countries of the world are acknowledging that Kashmir  is a disputed territory, and when they are realizing that  serious violation of human rights are being committed in  occupied Kashmir, is quite amazing." The Islamabad  Urdu-language daily KHABRAIN said in its 11 March editorial:  "The decision will also affect the Kashmiri struggle negatively  and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of frustration."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Cabinet of the Slovak Republic has held an  extraordinary session to discuss the president's address at the  National Council. The Cabinet adopted a statement expressing  its great alarm and distress regarding the president's speech,  which it considers to be an outrageous attack on the fundamental  institutions of our young state that have been formed on the  basis of democratic elections; the attack damages the name and  status of the Slovak Republic abroad and significantly  destabilizes the internal political situation, which is already  rather complex.    The Cabinet on principle rejects the president's speech as  confrontational and unprecedented, contradicting European  political standards and human ethics and going beyond the  constitutional powers of the president of the Republic, even  more so because this Cabinet deserves credit for the formation  of the independent and sovereign Slovak Republic and bears main  responsibility for its development.    The Cabinet will submit the speech by the president of the  Republic to a thorough analysis and will inform the citizens  about its outcome.</p>

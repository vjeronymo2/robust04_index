			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bibby's bid for Spanish monopoly disallowed THE SPANISH stock market commission yesterday disallowed a Dollars 133m (Pounds 75.1m) bid by J Bibby for control of Finanzauto, the country's monopoly Caterpillar distributor. The bid will have to be resubmitted in mid-May. The commission said Bibby, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate which is 79 per cent owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, had not presented proof that its shareholders supported the bid. The UK group will have to call a shareholders' meeting to confirm their support. Bibby's advisers, Baring Brothers, said yesterday that the meeting would take place on May 14. Meanwhile, the commission said trading in Finanzauto, which has rejected the Pta 1,300 (705p) a share offer as too low, would resume on May 4. It seems likely that the share price will rise sharply from the Pta 1,075 at which it was suspended last week. Before the market watchdog stopped the bid, analysts in Madrid had almost unanimously welcomed it.</p>

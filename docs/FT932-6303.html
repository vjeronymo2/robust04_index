			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatPower pleases The market gave the thumbs up to a solid set of profit figures from National Power but was much more enthusiastic towards the 16.2 per cent increase in the dividend total, boosted by the proposed 1.5p final dividend. Dealers were pleased with the not unexpected final dividend, which followed the second interim payment made after the budget changes. Much of the latest bout of buying interest in NatPower was said to have come from overseas, with Salomon International a big buyer. Mr Michael Sayers, utilities analyst at Salomon, acknowledged that Salomon clients had been aggressive buyers. 'The figures were in line but the 16.2 per cent dividend increase is an indicator of dividend growth prospects moving on to a higher plane after the coal contract,' he said. At the close NatPower was 11 ahead at 346p after heavy turnover of 6.3m. PowerGen added 11 1/2 at 358p with 4.4m traded. The Scottish generators also performed well, Hydro- Electric moving up 6 to 341p and Power 6 1/2 to 321p.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bombardier forecasts profits improvement BOMBARDIER, the Canadian-based aerospace and transit equipment group, has predicted that higher aircraft deliveries would bring improved profits this year. Bombardier's total backlog of firm orders had reached CDollars 6.2bn (USDollars 5.21bn) and will approach CDollars 7bn by year-end, Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said. The backlog would approach CDollars 8bn in a year. About two-thirds of the total is for aerospace products. In the first quarter to the end of April, Bombardier earned CDollars 32.7m, or 21 cents a share, up 28 per cent from a year earlier. Sales for the period were CDollars 938m, against CDollars 658m in the same period last year. The latest results include contributions by two recent acquisitions. Mr Beaudoin would not comment on analysts' estimates that earnings for fiscal 1993 would be between 90 cents and 95 cents a share. However, he said he expected the group's results to show an improvement over fiscal 1992 figures. The chairman said defence products accounted for only 10 per cent of Bombardier's CDollars 4bn annual sales. But missile and surveillance systems developed by its Short Brothers and Canadair units were projects with a long-term future, he added. In civil aircraft development, a Bombardier engineering-marketing team is currently working on the 70-passenger regional aircraft. Mr Beaudoin said the model would be lighter than the proposed Fokker 70 and that it was designed for a more specialised market. About 20 potential customers have put down deposits for the Global Express super business jet now being studied as a derivative of the 50-passenger regional jet. Learjet, the Kansas-based aircraft subsidiary, was offering a new model against the backdrop of a business jet market which was showing signs of recovery in spite of the persistent recession, Mr Beaudoin said. Bombardier stock has been weak recently because of problems with its Belgian transit equipment unit; speculation over aircraft certification delays; and lay-off notices at Short Brothers of Northern Ireland. The company blamed the recent 90-day lay-offs on the winding-up of two older aircraft programmes, foreseen when Bombardier bought the unit in 1989. Bombardier has reorganised its British, French and Belgian rail equipment units into a new holding company, Eurorail, which will continue to be financed by the parent in Montreal. BN, the Belgian unit, is expected to return to profitability by year-end after a reorganisation. 'Despite many design changes and technological problems, we're pushing to deliver the first Channel Tunnel rail set by year-end. Only then can we get some idea of the margin we may make on the total CDollars 650m rail car order,' Mr Beaudoin added. Bombardier's UTDC unit in Ontario is negotiating a CDollars 350m underground rail order with the city of Toronto. Bombardier's contracts to develop new generation underground trains for New York and Paris have reached the evaluation stage. A prototype nine-car train set is scheduled for delivery to New York this summer, and Bombardier's ANF unit in France will deliver a similar set of prototypes to the Paris transit system this autumn. Eight pre-production sets will follow next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat </F> 'Abd-al-Majid following meeting with the ambassadors of the 15  member-states of the UN Security Council in Cairo on 6  March--recorded]    [Text] I have expressed my dismay and sorrow at the  Security Council's delay in adopting a resolution about the  terrible Hebron massacre even though 10 days have already passed  since the incident. This is politically and morally  unacceptable. We hope that the Security Council will hasten to  issue a resolution implementing the rules of the Fourth Geneva  Convention in order to provide international protection for the  Palestinians, disarm the settlers, and dismantle the  settlements. We believe that this massacre has had a profound  effect on the peace process. We wish to preserve the peace  process. If you look at paragraph six of the resolution before  you, it says that the two countries sponsoring the peace  conference will urge earnest action to ensure the success of the  peace efforts by halting Israeli procrastination. Regrettably,  Israel's procrastination has gone on too long and is  intolerable. Therefore, it is necessary to point out how  dangerous this procrastination is. Doubtlessly, the whole world  welcomed the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on  13 September 1993. The Arab League regarded it as an important  step on the path to peace, but we later heard Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin say that some of the deadlines in the declaration  are not sacred. Of course, you have heard these remarks. The  first step in the agreement should have been implemented on 13  December; now we are approaching the 13 April deadline, the date  set for the troops' evacuation and the establishment of  autonomy. Will anything be implemented on this date or is 13  April also not a sacred date? If nothing is sacred why is it  mentioned in the agreement? I am surprised at this. There is no  need to specify dates if we are then going to say they are not  sacred.    Of course, I drew attention to this point today. I asked the  ambassadors and envoys of the 15 Security Council members to  inform their governments of all this. I believe they will do so  today in view of the fact that the Security Council is due to  meet again on Monday morning. We still have ample time for  contacts because of the six or seven-hour time difference  between Cairo and New York. Over there they have not yet woke up  today. This gives us enough time to make contacts and enable  the envoys to call up their capitals, who can contact UN  headquarters. We hope that when this happens a resolution will  be adopted very quickly.</p>

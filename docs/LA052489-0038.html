			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'TWISTED SPRING' SERIES COMES TO A CLOSE AT LACE  </P> <P> Oddly paired works completed the "Twisted Spring" programs of  choreographer-composer collaborations Friday at Los Angeles Contemporary  Exhibitions (LACE).  </P> <P> Sarah Elgart's "Blind Faith" resembled an MTV video. Emphasis was on striking,  high-gloss production values (14 trunk-size blocks of ice, moodily lit). The  dancers wore military-chic costumes, nattily torn and expertly tailored. The  choreography consisted of bite-sized bits of movement, often amplified into  depersonalized chorus-line unisons.  </P> <P> Ideas were arresting -- seven "blind" dancers with white-tipped canes  staggering around the stage -- but even at 40 long minutes, went unplumbed,  undeveloped.  </P> <P> Ed Tomney created the serviceable musique concrete score.  </P> <P> By contrast, Nancy Lee's "From Grace," for all its clumsiness and obscurity, at  least had the virtue of psychological probing, tracing the progress of a  modern-day pilgrim (a secure Sara Wolf) toward some kind of illumination.  </P> <P> But who or what were the three gymnastic ladies (Suzee Goldman, Sun-Mi Jin and  Jane Real)? Muses? Graces? Norns? Antagonists? Disciples? Maybe all of the  above.  </P> <P> Though not closely tied to the music, the work also had the benefit of Andrew  Picken's attractive, Irish folk tune-inspired score, played sensitively by  violinists Jolianne Von Einem and Sue Giordano, violist J. Lee Graham an  cellist Susanna P. Reilly. CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Rothschild Bank 'safety measure' Rothschild Bank, the Zurich-based private bank controlled by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, has dissolved its hidden reserves to make provision against possible loan losses. Sir Evelyn Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild, said the bank had decided to dissolve hidden reserves of SFr63.5m (Pounds 24.3m) as a safety measure. 'The bank is very conservative and we feel that it is right to make the transfer from reserves as a safety measure,' said Sir Evelyn. He added that Rothschild Bank was doing well and had had an exceptionally good 1991-92 year. Rothschild made a net profit of SFr24.4m in the 12 months to March 31. Depreciation, provisions and loan losses rose to SFr99.8m (SFr24.3m). The decision to make provisions followed a review of the bank's credit exposure at its recent annual general meeting, which found that some credits were not fully covered.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (1): Poised for more growth - After 30 years of unprecedented growth, the former railway town, which drew its inspiration from Brunel, appears to be slowing down. In the face of the recession, it is not clear whether this is by design or because it has reached its limits. Stewart Dalby speculates on its future in the 21st Century SWINDON, as a centre for relocation, is like an old variety artist who has continued pulling in the audiences in spite of the emergence of brasher new attractions. In the past 30 years, Swindon has been one of the most outstanding success stories of all towns along the M4 corridor. Its population has grown from around 70,000 in the 1950s to 178,000 today. Although there is criticism by business that the Thamesdown local authority has halted growth on greenfield sites, Mr Jim D'Avila, the deputy leader of the council, has outlined development which will take Swindon well into the next century. Companies began moving to Swindon in the 1960s and continued to flock there until the economy started to go into recession at the end of the 1980s, even though other areas such as south Wales and the north-east were able to offer grants and subsidies. The Japanese car maker, Honda, chose Swindon in the late 1980s, and will eventually employ 2,000 at its site at the old Vickers airfield on the outskirts of town, even though it is unusual for a Japanese manufacturer of this size to select the south of England. Japanese companies have tended to go to Wales or Scotland and other old industrial areas, where the land is cheaper and government grants have been available, or to new towns such as Telford or Milton Keynes. One obvious reason for Swindon's continuing success is its position on the M4 close to Heathrow airport and London. The M5 and M25 are also close by road, and London is only 55 minutes away by train. But, it is also due to the foresight of local government leaders, who in the 1950s and 1960s bought up thousands of acres of land at agricultural prices. Men such as the late Mr David Murray John, who today would be called the chief executive of the borough council, was the town clerk for most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s. Swindon was asked to take overspill population from London, after the Second World War, and he realised that, with the population growing, the economy would have to be diversified away from the dependence on its principal employer - the railways. Swindon Old Town and New Town were incorporated into the borough of Swindon in 1900. The Old Town was a small market centre, on a hill catering for the agricultural hinterland, while Swindon new town, at the bottom of the hill, was the result of the growth in the middle of the 19th Century of the Great Western Railway, which made the town its main engineering base and workshop. Today, Swindon itself is part of the borough of Thamesdown. After the Second World War, when the Great Western was nationalised with the other railway companies to form British Railways, some 14,000 people were employed by the railway - but by then the seeds of the subsequent decline in numbers, as facilities were rationalised and maintenance simplified, had already been sown. Armed with the substantial land bank, the local council (which has been Labour-controlled apart from a small spell in the 1970s) set about attracting new employers. The borough council could not give subsidies or sell land cheaply but its ownership and planning powers meant it was well placed to play an enabling role for private developers. With the railways shedding jobs, skilled labour was available for incoming companies. Agressive marketing by the council and a favourable location, meant that companies flooded in. By 1986/87, when the last British Rail engineering workshop (Brel) closed, throwing some 2,000 on to the labour market, the population had grown to 168,000 from 70,000 in the 1950s. It is now 178,000, and, before recession struck, Swindon claimed to be the fastest growing town in Britain. A wide range of companies have been attracted: in financial services Allied Dunbar and the Nationwide Building Society; in dist-ribution WH Smith, Reader's Digest and Book Club Associates; in engineering, Honda and Rover; in electronics National Semiconductors, Motorola, Intel, among others. The boundaries of Swindon are not tightly drawn, so that although there is a central business district in and around the new town and a central shopping and leisure district, most of the 22 business parks are on the periphery. The houses that have had to be built for the growing workforce are also spread around the town. Until recently, Swindon had not experienced the kind of congestion seen in other fast-growing centres. By 1989, however, Swindon, too, was showing signs of overheating, with unemployment down to 2.5 per cent. Mr Tony Mayer, the leader of Swindon Borough Council, says: 'It was not just a question of pressure on the environment, traffic congestion, parking problems and the like. Economic pressures were also starting to occur. Unem-ployment had fallen virtually to nothing and many com-panies were finding it difficult to find the kind of workers they needed.' The council decided it was time to consolidate. Specifically, it decided to oppose the development of any new greenfield sites. This, in turn, led some sectors of the business community to feel that the council had become anti-development. Mr Lorne Barling, the editor of Swindon Business News, says: 'The move to oppose new greenfield sites, together with the decisions by a couple of big companies like BMW and Coca-Cola not to come to Swindon, created the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that council was no longer interested in developing the town.' Mr David Griffin, of estate agents J P Sturge which acts for some of the big developers, says: 'I wouldn't quite say the council turned anti-development, but running a town is like running a business. Unless you continue to develop, then you go into decline. After the recession there will be a demand for greenfield sites and if they are not here, the institutions and owner-occupier businesses will look elsewhere.' Suggestions that the council has turned against the bus-iness community are vigorously denied by Mr D'Avila. 'Developers have misrepresented what we plan. We have given consents which take us well into the next century. Our structure plan envisages 30,000 jobs being created by the year 2001. The northern township devel-opment alone will mean 10,000 houses and nearly 100 acres for industrial use. 'There is the Tarmac site by the railway which is 150 acres and plenty of empty office space in the city centre. We are not putting the shutters up. There is as much development in the pipeline now as there has ever been, but our parks and leisure facilities are at capacity, and many companies were complaining to us about labour shortages. 'We have to make sure there are enough homes for people who want to come here, to ensure there are enough schools and to sort out the city centre, both in terms of traffic, and refurbishing the shopping in the centre. Around 80 per cent of the people we asked in a survey we undertook wanted us to consolidate before we had further industrial devel-opment.' The recession has taken the heat out of the debate for the moment, since little housing development is taking place either in the northern development at Hayden or on the Tarmac site although a lot of infrastructural work has taken place. Once the economy improves, however, the pressure will be on again for headlong growth.</p>

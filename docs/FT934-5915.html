			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / MPs accuse ministers over energy efficiency 'failure' The government has made little progress in encouraging energy efficiency, the Commons environment committee said in a highly critical report yesterday. Mr Robert Jones, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'We are one of the most complacent nations in the world on energy efficiency.' The report is particularly sceptical about the likely effectiveness of the Energy Saving Trust, an organisation set up to promote household energy efficiency, which has been one of the central planks of the government's strategy for combating global warming. The committee reports that it is 'concerned that the trust will not achieve the funding levels needed to meet its target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions'. The government wants funding for the trust's projects to come from the gas and electricity utilities, which would pass on the costs to customers in their bills. The report said, however, that it had found 'a huge discrepancy between what the trust considers it needs and what it is likely to receive'. The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide, largely produced by burning fossil fuels, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Government figures suggest this would mean a cut of about 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected annual levels, or about 6 per cent. The government has said it expects the trust's schemes to save 2.5mtC, a quarter of the total. The controversial imposition of value added tax on domestic heating fuel, announced in the spring Budget, will save a further 1.5mtC, it has said. The MPs report, however, that 'a great deal of scepticism and disagreement among witnesses as to the impact VAT will have on energy consumption patterns'. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, estimated that the UK would have to invest Pounds 1bn for every million tonnes of carbon emissions it averted. 'This is the ninth parliamentary report in the past decade on this subject and they have all said we need to pull our finger out,' he said. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday: 'I have acknowledged that the trust's targets are extremely challenging, and it will only be able to achieve them with considerable support from the utilities and their regulators'.

			<p>CSO     [Text] Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. and Professor Naomasa  Nakajima of Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo  jointly developed a basic technology to fabricate freely three  dimensional ceramic or metal micro parts. It was considered a  difficult process. Desired three dimensional shapes are formed  by first mixing ceramic or metal fine powders with photosenstive  liquid polymers, irradiating laser beams for solidification, and  then heating to evaporate the polymers. With wider selection of  materials and structures, much more flexible designs and  manufacturing can be available for micro machines, thus its  R&amp;D  is expected to make a big boost.    The new technology employs the `photoforming method.'  Ceramic  or metal powders are mixed as much as possible with ultraviolet  sensitive liguid polymers. Then, optical beam is irradiated  using the design measurement data of the parts intended for  production.    The laser beam is irradiated through the glass window  located  at the bottom of the container to solidify the mixture in the  small space between the substrate, which is immersed in the  liquid, and the bottom of the container. When the  solidification takes place as the substrate is being pulled up  slowly, the desired three dimensional parts containing plastics  are built. When heated at 300-500 C, the plastic  evaporates, leaving the metal or ceramics behind. Then it is  sintered at high temperatures of above 1000 C.    The research group conducted an experiment by mixing 2 kinds  (averaging 0.25 microns and 3 microns in particle diameter) of  oxide aluminum powders with ultraviolet sensitive polymer and  irradiating helium/cadmium laser beams for solidification. At  the time of mixing, ultrasonic vibration was applied for the  liquid mixture for several hours, so that oxide aluminum will  avoid coagulation and be evenly dispersed in the polymer.    As a result, they discovered that the smaller the particle  sizes are and the more the amount of oxide aluminum is contained  in the liquid mixture before irradiation, the higher the  viscosity. Laser beam irradiation produced the parts with high  precision-only a few microns discrepencies.    The research group will acquire the optimum processing  condition based on the basic data collected through these  experiments, so that they can evaporate polymers and start  producing ceramic or metal micro parts for actual use.  <H5>  Production of Micro Machine Parts Using Composite Materials </H5>   [Commentary] The new technology is quite useful for the  production of micro parts by improving conventional methods.  However, there are still problems to be overcome before it  proves to be practically useful.    Parts for micro machines were at first produced using  silicon  substrates, a part of the semiconductor processing technology.  Gears and motors were produced instead of transistors, but  those parts had to be flat. Later, the LIGA process using x-ray  which has shorter wave length than ultraviolet for the light  source was introduced, theyreby the depth of the structure of  the parts was much improved. However, this method also was  limitted to use light exposure for producing parts, therefore,  it was difficult to build perfectly three dimensional structures.    The photoforming method is free of such limitation and able  to produce combination of multiple parts all at once. R&amp;D on  this method is at present actively under way. Due to the base  material of plastics, it was considered impossible to make  ceramic or metal parts which are superior in strength and  resistance.    The new technology can use either plastic, metal, or  ceramics  and has an advantage of being able to use the photoforming  method. Research on evaporation of polymers out of the  solidified parts will continue, focusing on the heating  condition and the parts design in order to accomplish high  precision measurement.    Actually, evaporation of the polymers is not necessarily  required. Polymer ceramic or polymer metal composite materials,  which are much stronger than pure plastic parts, can be  adequately useful.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (11): Exports must grow faster - Foreign trade perks up, but there's more to do INDIA has increased its exports too little; it has traded too little of its output; and it has traded inefficiently. These have been the three historic failures that reform of the trade policy regime has to remedy. The policy changes made so far are dramatic by Indian standards. The question, nevertheless, is whether they will prove enough to bring about the required transformation. India's trade performance has not been that dreadful. True, its share in world exports fell sharply between independence and the mid-1970s, but it has stabilised at about half a per cent since then. The average growth in the volume of India's exports between 1980 and 1991, at 7.4 per cent, was not only greater than that of Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil (see chart), but considerably faster than the 4.3 per cent India achieved in the 1970s. Again, the weight of trade in gross domestic product, though far lower than in other developing countries, is comparable to that in large advanced countries (see chart). Nonetheless, India could and should have done better. Other developing countries, notably in east Asia, have achieved faster export growth and a greater presence in world trade. In 1991, for example, India offered only the 35th largest import market in the world, just below Ireland and far smaller than Hong Kong, Korea, China or Thailand. Export growth was insufficient to finance the imports required by the country's improved, but still modest, economic growth of 5.4 per cent a year during the 1980s. This helps explain India's balance of payments crisis in 1991, notwithstanding a panoply of exchange and import controls and import-weighted tariffs then averaging close to 90 per cent (see chart). The country evidently needs still faster export growth. India also needs to increase exports and imports in relation to GDP. Its economists and policy makers often argue that such a large country should be no more trade dependent than the US. True, India has a huge population, but it has a small modern economy. In 1990, for example, India's manufacturing value added was only 70 per cent of Korea's, 40 per cent of China's and 6 per cent of Japan's. Such a modestly sized manufacturing sector ought to enjoy great opportunities for increased specialisation in trade. The required policy changes have included lower protection against imports, which would itself shift incentives towards exports, and a devaluation of the rupee, which would enhance the incentive to produce tradeable goods and services. This has been precisely the direction taken by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, under the intellectual leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. In July 1991, the maximum import duty was reduced from 300 to 150 per cent. Then, in early 1992, emergency import controls were abolished and import licensing and quotas were eliminated for most capital goods and raw materials. A single negative list, consisting mostly of consumer goods, remained. The maximum tariff was further reduced to 110 per cent, tariffs on most capital goods fell from 80 to 55 per cent, and to 25 per cent for capital goods used by exporters. Some export restrictions were also removed. In the budget of February 1993, the maximum tariff was lowered to 85 per cent, while tariffs on project imports and many capital goods were reduced to 25-35 per cent. The rupee was devalued by 18 per cent in July 1991, export subsidies were removed and exporters received tradeable import licences for 30 per cent of their export receipts. In March 1992 the rupee was made partially convertible on trade account and a dual exchange rate was introduced, giving a further effective devaluation of 9 per cent. Finally, in March 1993 the finance minister took the bold decision to unify the exchange rate and float the rupee, which has since remained at 31.2-31.4 to the US dollar. Between June 1991 and September 1993 the cumulative devaluation was close to a third. These changes have met with success. However, the dynamism of exports had been masked by the collapse in trade with the rouble zone, from the equivalent of Dollars 3.1bn in 1990-91 to a mere Dollars 671m in 1992-93. Yet, in fact, merchandise exports in convertible currencies have been growing rapidly for years. Growth seems now to be accelerating, with total exports in April-July 1993 27 per cent more in US dollars than during the same period of 1992. Meanwhile, merchandise imports are running at 3 per cent below their value in April-July 1992 and well under their peak of Dollars 24.1bn in 1990-91. In consequence, the merchandise trade deficit has shrunk from Dollars 5.9bn in that year of brewing crisis to only Dollars 438m in the first four months of 1993-94 (an annual rate of Dollars 1.3bn). The risk now is renewed onset of complacency. Far more needs to be done if India is to enjoy an efficient trade policy regime. The Chelliah committee on tariff reform recommended a reduction in the average tariff rate from 47 to about 25 per cent by 1996-97 or 1997-98. This proposal has been accepted by the government.(1) Yet even that level of protection would be far higher than in Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey today. The committee also recommended a tariff structure in seven slabs, ranging from zero for basic foodstuffs to 50 per cent for finished products. Yet as two Oxford University economists, Vijay Joshi and IMD Little, note, the view that 'higher stages of manufacturing should have higher rates of nominal protection than lower stages  .. is a totally unprincipled principle, for it has no foundation in economic principles(2). The government is also committed to eliminating most exemptions from tariffs and duties, except for inputs into export production and, more radically, to rationalisation of duties and import restrictions on consumer goods(3). It has long been an anomaly of Indian policy that those goods deemed too inessential to import also receive the greatest incentive for domestic production. So long as imports of consumer goods remain banned, this absurdity will remain. Also important is elimination of export restrictions, particularly on agricultural products, such as cotton. Last but not least, tardy, sometimes corrupt, administration remains a concern, notably over the provision of still important export incentives, such as duty-drawbacks and advance licences. Enough has changed in the Indian trade and exchange rate regimes to make probable an upward jump in export performance. But so large has been the devaluation and so modest the reductions in nominal protection that little, if any, economic restructuring is likely to occur. The government should not only go far further, but must make its determination to do so as credible as it possibly can. (1) Tax Reforms Committee chaired by Raja J.

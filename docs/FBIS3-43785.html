			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Specific principles concerning the future national  police force are now being discussed in Lusaka. Yesterday saw  the approval of general principles. The relevant public  announcement did not please UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye, but there was nothing to be done other than  instruct the two sides to observe greater secrecy about the  talks. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in Lusaka, reports on the  peace talks today:    [Begin Ligio recording] (?This afternoon), the principles  [words indistinct] were discussed [words indistinct] legal  framework of the future national police force, its  organizational structure, its [words indistinct] consensus  [words indistinct] national constitution [words indistinct]  plenary [words indistinct] exploratory contacts, by summoning  the two sides, thereby forcing them to be on constant standby  [preceding word in English]. It might be said that there are no  fixed working rules. Beginning with the [words indistinct] the  meetings were held separately. The mediators met the Angolan  Government team during the morning and the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team in the afternoon.  While that went on, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye  would meet the side that was not involved in talks.    Observers close to the talks say that UNITA has already  signed several documents, even though it continues publicly to  deny having done so. Such documents reportedly include its  waiver concerning the scrapping of the riot police, the  regionalization of the police command, and UNITA's integration  in the police corps.    Those observers have also said that at this stage the two  sides are probably trying to bridge the gaps between the  amendments that have been made so that a final document can be  drawn up. A report came out yesterday saying that discussions  had wound up concerning the general principles that will govern  the future national police force, but that has not changed the  mediators' position that secrecy must continue to surround the  talks. The UN special representative has once again asked the  two sides to abide by the infomation blackout [preceding word in  English]. Such was the emphasis placed on this request by the  mediators that this morning officials in the two negotiating  teams were even quieter than usual and increased their distance  from the media. Their behavior should ensure that, even more  than before, the gods alone will know. [end recording]</p>

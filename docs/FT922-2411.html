			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: HK to allow full listings for Chinese units THE Hong Kong Stock Exchange is to allow companies incorporated in China to obtain full, primary listing status, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. Mr Paul Chow, exchange chief executive, did not provide a timetable for the move. Although some minor, unidentified 'accommodations' may be necessary before Chinese companies could list, he said they would provide investors the same level of protection as do shares in Hong Kong companies. Mr Chow ruled out the establishment of a special listing board set aside for Chinese companies or the creation of a secondary type status. A research paper produced by the exchange recently set out other possibilities for Chinese companies to gain access to the Hong Kong market other than direct listings. These suggestions have apparently been shelved.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Stalwart Spain suffers sense of 'betrayal' AT SOME point during the crisis talks on the future of the European exchange rate mechanism in Brussels over the weekend, the Spanish representatives threw six years of hard monetary battle to the wind and asked for the system to be suspended. The anger, frustration and desperation of a strongly pro-European government which has had to swallow three devaluations since last September (one in the middle of a general election) was being openly spat out over the negotiating table. Perhaps the call for a suspension of the system was just a threat but it was, for Spain, an extreme one. Spain has traditionally been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of political and economic union. But more than one Spanish minister has in the past expressed dismay at the support given to the French franc by the Bundesbank while the peseta has been left to suffer at the hands of speculators. By late last week, with the peseta again under attack, the Spanish were showing clear signs of pique. 'We don't want to leave the system but if we do they might as well stop calling it European,' snapped an official in the prime minister's office. But for all the irritation, Spain was not going to walk away from the ERM on its own. Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, always hard put to change his mind about changes of policy or personnel, has invested practically all his political credibility in first taking Spain into the EC in 1986 and then locking it in there by joining the effort to achieve monetary union. Circumstances may yet force the issue, but it is hard to imagine Mr Gonzalez suddenly expounding the virtues of a free floating peseta and monetary independence should the ERM truly collapse. But Spain also fears a free float because it distrusts its own capacity for price and exchange rate discipline. Madrid has been able to use the discipline imposed by the former tight fluctuation bands in the ERM to attract billions of dollars of new investment. At the end of last year the country had external debts of about Dollars 78bn and its economic managers see every tumble of the peseta (now trading some 28 per cent lower against the D-mark than it was a year ago) as a new rung on the repayment treadmill. 'We need capital to develop,' says the boss of one of the country's biggest companies. 'We have to keep the cost of that capital down as low as possible.' Not all the voices reaching Mr Gonzalez say this. While most continue to press for fiscal virtue next year and for only slow cuts in interest rates, some cabinet colleagues want growth even at the expense of inflation. 'What the decisions in Brussels (widening the currency fluctuation bands) mean for Spain is that we have delinked from the anti-inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank,' says Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief of research at the merchant bank, Santander Investment. 'The Spanish monetary authority will now have to go and earn that credibility on its own.' That is the one side of the argument - that interest rates should fall only slowly (and certainly not at today's regular Bank of Spain auction of certificates of deposit) and the 1994 budget, due in late September, should be restrictive and credible. Public spending cuts would deepen the recession but could rapidly improve both the current account and public sector deficits. Mr Gonzalez has already promised big cuts and, although he is also trying to sweet-talk the trades unions into signing a long-term wages deal, he has refused to exclude social services from fiscal surgery in next year's budget. The intention is good but this year's budget was also supposed to be tight and spending is currently more than Pta1,000bn (Pounds 4.8bn) over target. Then there is the other argument. If interest rates fall sharply, the dramatic growth in unemployment - currently a record 22.2 per cent - might be brought to a quick stop. Mr Jose Borrell, the minister of public works, is said to favour growth over the fight against inflation and is a favourite of Mr Gonzalez. Whatever happens Mr Gonzalez will have little trouble imposing his will. Since winning the general election on June 6, he has cleared his cabinet of left-wingers and placed his trusted and combative former finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, in charge of the parliamentary party. He has also replaced his left-wing chief of staff with the former chief of the revenue service, Mr Antonio Zabalza. The consensus is that the cautious voices will prevail and that Mr Gonzalez will agree to bring down interest rates slowly and not rush for growth. For now, he is his own man.</p>

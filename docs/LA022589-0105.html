			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD GROWTH POLICY OFFERED AS REGIONAL MODEL  </P> <P> A blue-ribbon committee charged with developing a regional approach to the  county's growth issues heard a plan Friday that would establish a county  planning board and require each city to adopt a growth-management plan.  </P> <P> Carlsbad Councilman Mark Pettine presented his proposal to a committee formed  by the San Diego Assn. of Governments. The group is in charge of implementing  Proposition C, an advisory measure approved by voters last November supporting  a regional agency to draft and oversee a growth-control plan.  </P> <P> Using Carlsbad's growth-management plan as a model, Pettine suggested that each  city in the county require the construction of public facilities to keep pace  with development.  </P> <P> Under such a plan, each city would be allowed to maintain local land-use  authority and evaluate its own needs for schools, police and fire service,  sewage systems and open space, Pettine said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regional Issues  </P> <P> In addition, Pettine said, a special county board should be formed to deal with  regional issues that are beyond any one city's ability to solve. Guidelines on  how to deal with air quality, water availability, transportation, solid-waste  management and energy would be established by the county board, Pettine said.  </P> <P> To ensure that management plans in neighboring cities are not in conflict,  Pettine recommended that the county be divided into five regions, each with its  own planning group.  </P> <P> "If two border cities are trying to upgrade a road, and one city wants to have  six lanes and the other city wants two lanes, you're going to have problems,"  Pettine said. "The subregional planning unit would bring leaders from both  cities to the table to work out the differences."  </P> <P> Although plans to implement Proposition C are only in a preliminary stage, some  county officials expressed support for parts of Pettine's proposal.  </P> <P> "It's got a lot of merit," said Supervisor Brian Bilbray, the committee  chairman who also authored the ballot measure. "Some of his considerations we  need to take a serious look at. One point in particular, the subregional  planning concept, is something we may be able to use."  </P> <P> Whether at the local or county level, Pettine said, the underlying principle  behind growth-management plans is to set and comply with "performance  standards."  </P> <P> A city, for example, would set a traffic volume limit for a road. If a proposed  development would generate traffic exceeding that standard, it could not be  approved unless the road is improved to accommodate the increase.  </P></p>

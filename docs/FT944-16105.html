			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (2): Towards global awareness - Environmental issues Black South African families in the Johannesburg township of Soweto are buying their first electric fridges. As the Soweto electrification programme proceeds, they are joining the consumer boom, and no-one is going to stop them. Certainly not anyone who has experienced the consequences of having a mesh-wire cupboard on legs as the sole aid to preserving perishable foodstuffs in the heat of an African summer. First-time consumers, along with many others across the world, probably do not have environmental matters high on their shopping list. But that will change, according to Mr John Kean, vice-president for technical management for the International Organisation for Standardisation (Iso), who is also chief executive of the Canadian Standards Association. 'There has to be education. The new consumer, just coming into electrification for the first time, may not look for the same level of standards that experienced users take for granted. But I think the global communication we have today - such as instant television, and so on - is ensuring a higher level of education about this issue. 'People want a say in things, and this is going to be just as much the case in third world countries. I think it may be surprising how quickly awareness spreads. People are on the global information highway: they really do have instant access to information. A TV watcher in Soweto can see programmes on a manufacturing problem in Birmingham, or anywhere else in the world.' In the UK, the consumers of the future - the present generation of schoolchildren - take a close interest in environmental issues. They nag their parents as never before about using aerosols, recycling packaging, and buying eco-friendly products. Consumer awareness of the environment and its well-being has never been so high in developed countries, aided by the publicity surrounding such events as the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. Retailers and manufacturers are experiencing a pincer movement, from consumers at one end, and regulators at the other. Yet the majority of dangers do not come from the products visible on the supermarket shelf. 'Environmental issues are business issues,' declares Mr Lawrence Eicher, secretary-general of Iso. 'The environmental standards that we develop internationally will not only affect corporate profitability and world trade, they will also affect the livelihood and health of millions of people.' Policing is not enough, argue those concerned in environmental matters. Environmental concern has to be designed into the entire life cycle of products and, just as important, services. Nowhere is the rule of 'what can't be measured can't be delivered' more difficult to apply. Replying to the sceptical, Mr Eicher points to Iso 9000 and its remarkable success as a quality measure in manufacturing, industry and commerce in more than 50 countries. Spreading the Iso 9000 principle to environmental issues is the aim of Iso 14000. The starting point is a set of rules for managing environmental issues, which will create a worldwide yardstick. Iso has been developing environmental standards since 1947, when one of its first published standards dealt with acoustics. The issue of 'sustainable development' has been on its agenda for more than 20 years. 'Environmental problems are by their nature international, and can only be solved at international level,' reads an Iso bulletin from 1972. 'All laws, regulations and standards concerning air and water should repose on the same scientific and technological base. By developing the appropriate international standards, Iso can provide that base.' Already there are more than 350 international standards with environmental relevance on the Iso's books. They include Iso/TC 22, Road Vehicles, which has developed numerous standards related to exhaust emissions, and other Iso/TC (Technical Committee) standards on nuclear energy, plastics biodegradability, heating efficiency and emissions, and solid waste management. More recently it has risen to meet the challenges of setting environmental standards with a number of initiatives. The committee Iso/TC 207, on environmental management, was set up in January 1993 following two years of work by Sage - the Strategic Advisory Group on Environment. Sage was the result of co-operation between the Iso and the IEC, the authority responsible for global standardisation in the electrical and electronics fields. Both organisations have spent years developing voluntary standards as guidance for industry and regulatory authorities on environmental issues. The IEC had its own Advisory Committee on Environmental Aspects to promote and co-ordinate efforts. Sage's job was to examine the problems and potential solutions afresh, and come up with co-ordinated strategies. The result is TC 207, a committee whose brief includes co-ordination and co-operation with international and regional governmental bodies, including the European Union, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and many others. The TC 207 sub-committees cover management systems, auditing, labelling, performance evaluation and life cycle assessment. Early work includes a guide for the inclusion of environmental aspects in product standards, and standards for environmental management systems. Mr Kean is an evangelist for Iso 14000. 'The environment is something we're all part of, and we have to protect it for future generations. By focusing on management, we're trying to get people to think ahead; address issues so that they are thinking about the environment on a day-to-day basis. It has to be pro-active rather than reactive.' The standards should prompt designers to think about a product's impact on the environment. The checklist of design requirements covers how an item will be produced, used, and eventually disposed of, and what effects all stages of the process will have on the environment. 'It has to be a systems approach, involving the whole process, from conception to grave,' adds Mr Kean. 'We can never be 100 per cent sure of effects, but we can be better equipped to ask the right questions.' There are drawbacks. At last month's Iso conference on the environment, in Nice - and entitled 'A challenge for international standardisation'  - the president of the French movement Generation Ecologie, Mr Brice Lalonde, pointed out that countries whose industries applied the standards could find themselves disadvantaged if built-in environmental standards resulted in higher costs than those of less careful competitors. Having a measure might encourage participation by some of the companies who have been watching the process nervously from the sidelines. So thinks Gib Hedstrom, who, after 20 years in environmental auditing in the US recently took up an appointment as vice-president of the the environmental health and safety practice at Arthur D Little in Brussels. 'A standard takes some of the fear away,' he says. 'If we have a measure, we can start to manage. Then we can move away from the litigious, defensive position that what you can't measure, can't be used against you, to a caring and sharing situation where former competitors and adversaries co-operate and share data on emissions.' Standards focus attention on the issues, and fuel investment in the development of alternative technologies. Consumers react to environmental issues, whether at the level of buying eco-friendly washing powder or investing in ethical funds. But 'green' environmentalists argue that standards are based on what is possible, rather than what is necessary. Even so there is a catch: the long-term effects of our efforts can hold unpleasant surprises. Clean, efficient nuclear power brought about the Chernobyl disaster. Asbestos, once thought a boon for insulation, has proved to be a killer in human lungs. Many environmentally-aware people have in recent years espoused diesel engines in their cars. But a recent report from the Ashden Trust indicated that the rise in childhood asthma in the UK was directly attributable to high levels of emissions from such car engines. Many schoolchildren take for granted the car rides to and from school: two-car families are on the increase. It is a sad example of environmental irony if the youngsters who campaign so fervently against acid rain and lecture their parents about global warming are also condemned, by well-intentioned consumers and retailers, to wheeze into inhalers.</p>

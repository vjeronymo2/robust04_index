			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] prime minister, Paias  Wingti, on a visit to New Zealand has said the situation on the  troubled island of Bougainville was returning to normal.  Speaking on the first day of his visit after talks with New  Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, in Wellington, Mr. Wingti  said that reports of a PNG blockade were not correct. He said  there was no blockade, the problem is of getting services and  reconstruction programs moving on Bougainville.    The Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] has been fighting  a  five-year campaign for independence. Mr. Wingti said the number  of rebels on Bougainville had diminished, and the people there  and in the rest of PNG were now getting to the situation where  they wanted normal lives to be restored.    He said PNG was one nation and to give independence to  Bougainville would divide that nation, so it was not an issue.</p>

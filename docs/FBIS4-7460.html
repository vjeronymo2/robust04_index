			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "joe, ctk": "Most Foreigners Are Employed in </F> Prague"]    [Excerpt] Prague--In December 1993, 28,281 foreigners  worked legally in the Czech Republic. This means that the  statistics of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MPSV)  registered only a small decline from September of the same year,  when it showed 28,392 valid work permits for foreigners.  Approximately 15,500 are individual workers, and 12,600 are  employed on the basis of contracts. Only 166 of them were people  with refugee status. From the point of view of profession, the  largest group are laborers (about 21,500 people). Approximately  2,000 foreigners working in the Czech Republic are high-school  graduates. Almost 4,700 foreigners are university graduates;  these are mostly representatives of foreign firms. [passage  omitted]</p>

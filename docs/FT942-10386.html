			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Pressure grows on minister to resign Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, was under growing pressure to resign from the government last night after he admitted misleading the Commons during a debate on rights for the disabled, James Blitz writes. Following angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, called for Mr Scott's resignation after the minister admitted that his department had helped Tory backbenchers to wreck the passage of a private member's bill that would have required employers to provide facilities for disabled people. Mr Scott appeared determined to ride out allegations that he misled the Commons last Friday when he stated that that his department had played no part in drawing up the amendments. Downing Street officials made clear that Mr Scott enjoyed the prime minister's full confidence, and had cleared up any misunderstandings. But Labour intensified pressure on the minister, seeing the row as a test of the accountability of members of Mr John Major's government. In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith said Mr Scott's statement was 'wholly unsatisfactory'. He had 'confirmed that his department, with his authority, had been involved in the preparation of the amendments'. The Labour leader quoted a letter from the prime minister to a Labour MP, in which Mr Major had said ministers should 'relinquish their positions' if they knowingly failed to give truthful information the House. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, announced that she would rule soon on whether Mr Scott had been in 'contempt' of the House.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK retailers hit by Pounds 2bn cost of crime last year Crime cost UK retailers Pounds 2bn last year and knocked about a quarter off their profits, according to the first comprehensive survey of the problem, published yesterday. The British Retail Consortium said retailers lost Pounds 560m through recorded crimes in the financial year 1992-93, based on a survey of 54,000 shops accounting for almost half of all UK retail sales. The figures do not include police, court and other costs. Retailers also lost Pounds 1bn of goods through unrecorded crimes, and spent Pounds 370m on anti-crime measures. Shops apprehended 1.2m customers in connection with crimes - of whom more than 700,000 were referred to the police - and some 28,000 of their own staff. 'External' crime, including customer theft, burglary, arson and robbery, comprised 54 per cent of the total cost, while 'internal' crime such as staff theft accounted for 27 per cent. Crime prevention accounted for 19 per cent. The problem of retail crime was highlighted last year by Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, who said shops were having to adopt 'vigilante' tactics. Mr Keith Ackroyd, chairman of the consortium, said the problem was growing. 'Crime is one of the most serious and costly problems faced by the industry, in terms of direct losses of product, of the cost of preventative measures and in the increase of violence and injury to staff,' he said. 'Ultimately it is the consumer and society at large that bears these costs.' The BRC will use the data to develop a programme to counter crime. Morale and profit hit, Page 8</p>

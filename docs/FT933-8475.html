			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Rebuff for Pasqua over foreigners MR Charles Pasqua, France's hard-line interior minister, yesterday criticised the constitutional council for its decision to block some of his proposals to curb illegal immigration. The council, which vets all legislation passed by the French parliament to ensure it conforms with the constitution, on Saturday vetoed eight of the 52 measures proposed by Mr Pasqua on the grounds that foreigners would be denied the basic rights available to anyone on French soil. The rejected measures include banning foreign students from bringing their families to France and allowing local mayors to try to postpone, or forbid, suspected marriages of convenience between foreigners and French citizens. The council also opposed Mr Pasqua's controversial proposal to extend the detention periods of foreigners who can not be deported because they have no identity papers. Mr Pasqua, renowned in France for his draconian views and forthright manner, said the council's decision was 'politically motivated' and that 'it does not correspond to the wishes of the majority'. However, he said he would comply with its request to revise the vetoed measures and would present new proposals to parliament when it reconvened in autumn. Immigration has emerged as one of the most controversial domestic issues in France since the centre-right Balladur government took power in March. There are now about 4m foreigners living legally in the country and up to 1m illegal immigrants. Economic recession and the influx of emigres from eastern Europe has heightened concern.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK pensions Besides a Pounds 2.5m rescue scheme for Maxwell pensioners, the government yesterday agreed to implement legislation ensuring that any deficiency in a wound-up pension fund becomes a debt on the employer company. Industry experts had previously expected Ministers to delay this provision of the 1990 Social Security Act on the grounds that the issue of equal pension benefits for men and women remains unresolved, and that calculating a final deficiency therefore is impossible at this stage. The equal pensions point was specifically addressed in the Maastricht Treaty, but given recent events may now not be resolved in the European Court until next year. Mr Lilley's gesture is not to be sniffed at. But there is arguably no great comfort anyway for pensioners in ranking alongside ordinary trade creditors, who seldom get much in a liquidation. The alternative would have been preferential status; and that, no doubt, would have been too much for the banks.</p>

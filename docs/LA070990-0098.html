			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> ARTS DISCUSSION SCHEDULED TUESDAY  </P> <P> A discussion on the importance of the arts in the city has been set for Tuesday  in the Founders Room of the Community Meeting Center.  </P> <P> "There's been a lot of discussion about the role of the arts in the image of  the city, but we want to look at the economic role," said Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi,  general manager of the Garden Grove Symphony, who organized the discussion.  </P> <P> In recent years, the question of city support for the arts, especially the  Grove Shakespeare Festival, has been controversial, and public funding has been  reduced.  </P> <P> Panelists for the discussion will include Rick Stein, Laguna Playhouse  executive producer and former Grove Shakespeare Festival managing director, and  Judith Peterson, director of the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton;  Dvir-Djerassi.  </P> <P> Also, Greg Devereux, Garden Grove's housing director; Barry Zander, marketing  director for Garden Grove Hospital, and a representative of the Garden Grove  Shakespeare Festival. The moderator will be Dr. Frank Benest, city manager of  Brea.  </P> <P> "We will use models of other cities like Brea, Laguna Beach, Fullerton and  Ashland, Ore.," home of the well-known Ashland Shakespeare Festival, "where an  entire community lives on the arts," Dvir-Djerassi said.  </P> <P> Business, government and arts leaders have been invited to the discussion at  7:30 p.m. at 11300 Stanford Ave. JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

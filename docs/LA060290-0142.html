			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> DRILLING FOES MISS 1 PETITION DEADLINE  </P> <P> A group promoting an initiative to ban oil and gas drilling in central Garden  Grove has missed one deadline for qualifying the measure for the November  ballot.  </P> <P> City Clerk Carolyn Morris had set a May 31 deadline to allow Garden Grove GOO  (Get Oil Out) to submit petitions to get its initiative before the voters this  fall, but no petitions were turned in Thursday.  </P> <P> Two city councilmen, J. Tilman Williams and Robert F. Dinsen, along with  businessman Bruce Broadwater, submitted a proposed initiative in late April  that would "prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells within 800 feet of any  church, school or residential property." Those restrictions would effectively  bar Chevron Oil USA from drilling on its site at Nelson and Pearl streets near  the downtown area.  </P> <P> Last summer, Chevron sought drilling permits from the City Council but was  turned down on a 3-2 vote. Opponents of drilling, however, claimed that an  initiative was needed because a new City Council could reverse the earlier vote  and grant the permits.  </P> <P> According to Morris, valid signatures representing 10% of the registered voters  in Garden Grove, or about 5,700, need to be submitted.  </P> <P> "We said May 31 because of the various time frames that the (different  agencies) can take," she said. "For instance, the county can take up to 30 days  to certify the signatures. The City Council can take up to 30 days to study the  initiative."  </P> <P> The process could take less time, but meeting the May 31 cutoff date would have  guaranteed a spot on the ballot. In any case, "everything must go to the county  by Aug. 10."  </P> <P> With one deadline missed, the fate of the initiative is uncertain.  </P> <P> "Well, I don't know," Williams said. "I'll have to meet with the other two guys  (Dinsen and Broadwater) and see what their thoughts are." JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

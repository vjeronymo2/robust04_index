			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Letters Home - Theatre Sylvia Plath killed herself 30 years ago in London. She put the children to bed, blocked herself in the kitchen, and turned on the gas. She was 30. She had warned: 'Never commit suicide, because something unexpected always happens.' Her reputation flourished posthumously with Ariel (1965) and the Pulitzer prizewinning Collected Poems (1981). After leaving her middle class Boston home for a scholarship at Smith in 1950, Plath wrote 700 family letters - most to her mother, Aurelia - which were gathered and published in 1975. They form a quasi-public diary, the basis for Rose Leiman Goldemberg's dramatisation, Letters Home. It makes fine reading, potentially wonderful radio, but poor theatre. First, Letters Home lacks the poetry that redeemed Plath and which excused the indulgent misery. Second, the play fails to admit that other people's depressions are not intrinsically dramatic; and third, it fails to make written letters live as voices and interactions between two people. The acting is intimate and sharp, with fast cutting between Hildegard Neil as Aurelia and Daryl Back as Sylvia. Sometimes the accent of north-east America evades them, but they conjure a community and history out of the material, moved along by Ian Rimington's swift direction. However, much can be learned of Plath, the poet who kept bees. Her depression prompted her to write home frequently: of a missed date or a fall science course at Smith, of the heady meeting and marriage to Ted Hughes in Cambridge, of babies and of the looming divorce. All facets of Plath's relations were underpinned by a desire for oblivion. She had attempted suicide in 1953, and she spent the summer in therapy and undergoing electro-convulsive treatment. She returned to college to write about Fyodor Dostoyevsky. During a period of depression in the winter of 1962-63, Sylvia Plath produced what many consider to be her best work, putting her alongside the other great modern American writers who also suffered from depression: Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton and John Berryman. On the one hand, Letters Home offers nothing consolatory, and on the other, nothing to show that in Plath's case, reformation was necessary and despair criminal.

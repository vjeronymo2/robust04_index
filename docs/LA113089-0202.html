			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WITH VETERAN LINEUPS ALL AROUND, SUNSET RACE SHOULD BE TIGHT AGAIN  </P> <P> Last season, Huntington Beach, Ocean View and Edison high schools tied for  first place in the Sunset League basketball race.  </P> <P> Well, Sunset League basketball fans, get ready to kiss your sister again  because the race doesn't figure to be too much different this season.  </P> <P> "Any of five teams can finish in the top three," Marina Coach Steve Popovich  said.  </P> <P> The reason? Popovich says the league has more returning players than ever  before. Edison, Marina, Ocean View and Westminster each has three starters  back.  </P> <P> With all the parity, successful teams will have to stay healthy and be  consistent, Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said.  </P> <P> "It's going to be like the ACC or the Big East where every night is a major  game," Harris said. "If you're not ready to play, or you have a guy hurt, or  you have health problems, or just an off night . . . It's going to be very  interesting. You have to be up twice a week, for sure."  </P> <P> Marina and Edison have the edge on paper. Marina, with the state's best big man  -- 6-11 junior center Cherokee Parks -- is a league front runner. So is Edison,  which has the height to contend with Parks.  </P> <P> The Chargers can go 6-10, 6-5 and 6-4 across the front line. The big man is  senior Bill Martineau, who averaged 12.8 points and 7.6 rebounds last season.  </P> <P> Don't count out Huntington Beach. With four starters gone, who should drop into  Coach Roy Miller's lap but transfer student Mustapha Abdi, a 6-4 forward. Abdi  averaged 17.7 points for Savanna last season, but increased that to more than  30 points in Savanna's two playoff games. He was the only sophomore to make the  Times' all-county basketball team.  </P> <P> He teams with senior Stephen Lucas (6-7) to give the Oilers height and power up  front.  </P> <P> Ocean View has the league's best guard in 6-2 1/2 Greg Evans, who has signed  with Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley figured to have experience at both guard spots. But new coach  Gordon Billingsley will be without guard Doug Weaver for the entire season.  Weaver, one of the county's best football receivers, had knee surgery two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> Forward Mike Merli (6-4), who led the Barons last year with 16.4 points a game  and 7.3 rebounds, returns for his senior season, along with guard Derek  Corcoran.  </P> <P> A look at the teams:  </P> <P> EDISON -- If you want to find Edison this year, look above the rim. The  Chargers have exceptional height and experience at all positions.  </P> <P> "This could be the best team I've had at Edison," said Coach Jon Borchert, who  is starting his seventh season at Edison. His team will be strong on the  boards, but it remains to be seen how well the players will work together,  Borchert said.  </P> <P> Martineau and 5-11 guard Tom Tyler, all-league selections last season, are  back.  </P> <P> Martineau, a force inside, has developed some moves but has been bothered by  back trouble. "He is one of those kids who has just steadily improved through  high school," Popovich said. "If he can solve his injury problems, he is a real  factor."  </P> <P> Steve Thobe, a 6-5 forward who averaged more than six points and six rebounds  last season, is the third returning starter.  </P> <P> Borchert says Brandon Jessie, a 6-4, 200-pound sophomore forward, has the  potential to be an all-county player. Dan Lovelady (6.8 points), a 6-2 senior  guard, and Todd Smyser, a 6-3 junior, are returning lettermen.  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY -- The Barons have some size but not much experience or depth.  Merli and Corcoran will form the team's nucleus. There are no other returning  lettermen. Merli, a senior forward, averaged 16.4 points and 7.3 rebounds last  season.  </P> <P> Joining the varsity are forwards Erik Zellmer and Kevin Volpe, and 6-5 center  Adam Ziebarth. Team strengths are speed and perimeter shooting. Billingsley,  who spent 11 years as a varsity assistant at Fountain Valley, replaces Dave  Brown, now the athletic director and boys' basketball coach at Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH -- The league's surprise team last season, Huntington Beach  will be in contention again because the Oilers have two of the strongest  forwards in the county -- Abdi and 6-4 senior Stephen Lucas.  </P> <P> Lucas, who averaged 11 points and seven rebounds last season, is the team's  only returning letterman. Still, Coach Miller is confident he can go nine deep.  </P> <P> "Last season we played a power game and relied heavily on inside play," Miller  said. "This year will require more motion in the offense and we should have  more consistent shooting from outside."  </P> <P> MARINA -- Last year, Parks was a hub with few spokes, but this season Marina  has some experienced players to complement him.  </P> <P> Travis Boyd, who transferred from Mater Dei and was eligible for the last three  games, returns for his senior season. A good shooter, Boyd (6-0) will provide  leadership as a point guard, Popovich said. Starters Darren Fields (6-3) and  Thi Nguyen (5-10) also return, along with lettermen Sean Haselrig (6-2), Brant  Shelor (6-5) and Tuan Nguyen (5-10).  </P> <P> The Vikings are quick, can use big and small lineups and are counting on the  experience gained from last season's tough schedule.  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW -- The team's scoring powers, guard Mike Frohn and Times' all-county  center Todd Norman, have graduated from a 19-9 squad. Their supporting cast  returns, however. Point guard Evans should improve upon last season's 10.6  scoring average. Starters Darren Ernst (6-6) and Jim Gwaltney (6-4 1/2) also  are back. Together with junior letterman Marcel TenBerge (6-7 1/2), they give  the Seahawks some size up front. But don't mistake TenBerge for Norman. His  game is still developing.  </P> <P> Injuries have hampered the Seahawks so far. "We haven't had a day where all 11  guys were healthy -- ankles, broken noses, flu, walking pneumonia," Harris  said. "I hope it's not characteristic of the team. I hope we get it out of the  way early."  </P> <P> Jim Harris III, the coach's son, was one of the team's top eight players, but  he broke his foot in a scrimmage this week and will miss at least six weeks.  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER -- What kind of squad will the Lions' have this season?  </P> <P> First clue: The five projected starters are all three-point shooters. Second  clue: only one of them is taller than 6-1.  </P> <P> Westminster is going to have trouble improving on last season's last-place  league finish.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Coach Dick Katz is confident in his team's shooting ability and  thinks his squad could be a spoiler.  </P> <P> Guards Mitch Okur (5-5) and Mike Murphy (6-0) and center Eric Wilkins (6-3)  return. Of the three, Okur was the leading scorer with a 7.6-point average.  Katz is expecting strong contributions from seniors Dave Rall (6-1) and Eden  Yawata (5-9).  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEW '89SUNSET LEAGUE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Overall, League Records in Parentheses  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:4.97IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> SCHOOL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '89-'90 COMMENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Edison (15-13, 7-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Height, maturity and more height  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fountain Valley (19-7, 6-4)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Solid nucleus returns for  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> new coach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Huntington Beach (13-12, 7-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> All-county forward Mustapha Abdi  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> a big addition  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marina (10-15, 3-7)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Has state's best center:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 6-11 Cherokee Parks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ocean View (19-9, 7-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Has league's best guard: Greg Evans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Westminster (3-18, 0-10)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No starter over 6-1, a 3-point  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> shooting team  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Friday: Small Schools  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] What is the current situation in Kigali? The  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is now fighting groups of  Presidential Guards and a few government soldiers who support  the groups. They will soon be defeated. Most of the government  troops do not want to fight, nor do they want to support the  small group of killers.    Meanwhile, in Kigali, the 600-man battalion which went there  on (?28) December last year is not alone. Their colleagues have  relieved them. They left the former RPF positions in the north  to go to Kigali and they have now linked up with those in Kigali  and are fighting together. That alone is a sign of the  impending victory.</p>

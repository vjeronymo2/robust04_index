			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG PLUNGE: VIEWS FROM THE TREASURY TO HARRY'S BAR  </P> <P> Some comments on the causes of Friday's stock market plunge and predictions for  what will happen Monday:  </P> <P> Nicholas F. Brady  </P> <P> Secretary of the Treasury:  </P> <P> "Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the  condition of the economy. The economy remains well balanced, and the outlook is  for continued moderate growth."  </P> <P> John McGillicuddy  </P> <P> Chairman, Manufacturers Hanover:  </P> <P> "Any time you have the market drop 190 points and you're not concerned, there's  something wrong with you."  </P> <P> Kenneth R. French  </P> <P> Finance professor, University of Chicago business school:  </P> <P> "My view is the market is taking (the failure of the proposed buyout of United  Airlines' parent) as a strong signal about the prospects about future LBOs and  takeovers. That's what we're seeing -- a revaluation based on that lower  probability. The market didn't have a lot of time to think this one out. My  belief is when it reacts, it gives us an unbiased estimate. It's as likely to  have a correction upward as a correction downward Monday.  </P> <P> "They gave their best shot, and now they're going to go home and sit back and  think about it over the weekend. Sometimes when they do that they discover  they've overestimated, and sometimes they go home and discover they've  underestimated. I'm quite surprised by the magnitude of the response."  </P> <P> James M. Benham  </P> <P> Chairman, Benham Capital Management Group:  </P> <P> "There's a huge calendar of junk bonds that want to come to market before  year-end. And the marketplace has been very cool to recent offerings of junk  bonds. A lot of stocks in the stock market have been bid up in price in  anticipation of buyouts. When they stopped trading the ones that were in play  for merger, it caused a selloff in everything. I think that's what caused the  widespread panic in the last hour. People knowing they were going to get margin  calls had to sell something."  </P> <P> Harry Poulakakos  </P> <P> Owner of Harry's Bar, a favorite of Wall Streeters:  </P> <P> "When the market went down 500 points, we were full at 4:30 and it kept going  until two o'clock in the morning. Last time at this time, we had 10 television  stations here already. Today everybody took it a little bit easier."  </P> <P> Eugene Peroni  </P> <P> Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott:  </P> <P> "It's total emotional and psychological chaos. People are dumping everything. .  . . A great deal of money is being lost."  </P> <P> Jerry L. Jordan  </P> <P> Chief economist, First Interstate Bank, and member of President's Council of  Economic Advisers 1981-82:  </P> <P> "We've seen a succession of things in recent weeks. The Campeau deal came  unraveled, several of the (leveraged buyout) deals are now in trouble, the  MGM/United Artists thing came unraveled, and now United Airlines. And people  are seeing that the arithmetic necessary to justify these deals isn't there.  And the arithmetic is you've got to have either high inflation, raise the price  of your products, or you've got to have real volume increases or you'd better  be able to sell a bunch of assets to somebody and get your debt down. And if  you have a weak economy, you can't sell your subsidiaries and things and get  your debt down -- there are no buyers out there.  </P> <P> "We'll all be watching Monday morning. . . . What happened two years ago was  Friday, we got hit in New York, and then Monday, Tokyo opened very weak and  started falling all day. And then it hit Frankfurt, Paris and London. New York  just continued the process, and at the end of the day, 28 stock markets around  the world all got hit. So if this is a localized phenomenon, people changing  their view about the U.S. economy, or if it's strictly UAL, then there's no  spillover Monday morning. But if it was strictly UAL, there's no reason why the  bond market should rally or the dollar should fall. It's these sympathy moves  that you want to try to interpret for additional information, rather than  merely the stock market slump. I would not be surprised to see (a further  decline on Monday.)"  </P></p>

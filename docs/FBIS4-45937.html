			<p>CSO     [Text] Hyderabad, April 5--The Nuclear Fuel Complex near  here, which is solely responsible for supplying fuel bundles and  in-core structural components to India's nuclear power reactors,  is embarking on a big expansion and diversification programme,  reports UNI.    More than half of the Rs 355-crore programme, including  construction of new plants on the sprawling 500-hectare NFC  [Nuclear Fuel Complex] campus at Moula Ali near here, has been  completed.    With the commissioning of the new plants, the annual  production of fuel bundles would be doubled to 32,000 annually  by the end of 1995, the NFC chief executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, said.    The NFC now produces 16,400 fuel bundles--the most critical  components of reactors--besides zirconium alloy mill products.  It supplies to the country's nine operating nuclear power  plants, including two each at Tarapur, Narora, Kalpakkam and  Kota and one at Kakrapara.</p>

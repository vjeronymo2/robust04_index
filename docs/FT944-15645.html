			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Financial markets show their approval German financial markets opened yesterday with a positive reaction to the election result, but profit-taking and concern over the sharp cut in the government's majority left share prices slightly lower. Initially, the Frankfurt stock exchange gained nearly 2 per cent, measured by the DAX-index of 30 leading shares, later easing to close 0.7 per cent down at 2,091 points. Markets had already shifted last week from pessimism about a possible defeat for Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the expectation of a victory for the coalition his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leads. Thus the vote's outcome had been discounted, with the DAX up by 7.4 per cent over the week. The stock market also failed to draw any benefit from yesterday's firmer bond market, where prices continued last week's gains. Traders said higher bond prices reflected the strength of the D-Mark which yesterday stood at around DM1.50 against the dollar, a two-year high. Although the coalition's majority fell from 134 to 10, economists felt investors would be encouraged by the re-election of Mr Kohl's government, committed to making Germany more competitive through deregulation, privatisation and debt-cutting. 'The good news is that the government can continue,' said Mr Norbert Braems, Frankfurt-based economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. But, he added: 'The narrow majority does not make politics easier.' The first test would be the next budget; the government intends to reintroduce an income tax surcharge to help pay for east German reconstruction. The opposition would be strong, he said, particularly because of the Social Democrats' increased majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat - which can hinder legislation - thanks to its performance in Sunday's regional state elections. Economists said the Bundesbank would watch to see how decisively the government held back public spending. The bank has been concerned about the inflationary consequences of the cost of rebuilding east Germany. Yesterday's September wholesale price figures for west Germany, with a rise of 2.8 per cent on the year against 2.2 per cent in August, showed inflationary tendencies persist. The Bundesbank reported on a favourable trend in federal finances in its monthly report, however. It said the government had cash reserves of some DM11bn as a result of its capital-raising late last year. The federal cash deficit fell to DM15.3bn in the first nine months from DM38.7bn in the same period of 1993, partly as a result of a higher profit from the Bundesbank.</p>

For this reason, 33 soldiers have  been sent to Belet Uen to guard the German camp and the convoys,  it is reported in the Friday edition of BILD-ZEITUNG, citing an  internal situation report by the Defense Ministry.    "Isolated criminal acts and bandit activities" against the  UN  troops in Somalia have risen in the last few days, the newspaper  quotes the report as saying. There are ever more deliberate  provocations of members of the UN troop contingent. According  to BILD-ZEITUNG, attacks on the German camp were also  increasing. In the last two weeks alone there have been at  least five instances of Somalis trying to enter the German camp  and get onto the airfield. The Bundeswehr guards fired warning  shots on several occasions.    [Hamburg DPA in German at 0931 GMT on 31 December reports:  "A  spokesman for the Defense Ministry has rejected the BILD-ZEITUNG  report that the 33 additional soldiers were sent to Belet Uen  only because of the recent shooting at Bundeswehr soldiers in  Mogadishu. Within the framework of the exchange of German  soldiers in Somalia, 33 additional soldiers were sent as early  as 20 December to increase safety levels and to reinforce the  contingent for its withdrawal, the Defense Ministry spokesman  told DPA in Hamburg on Friday."]</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Court clears Pancontinental claim Pancontinental Mining, the thwarted suitor for Australia's Aztec Mining, has been given leave to go ahead with a legal action against Poseidon Gold, which outbid Pancon and seized control of Aztec via a ADollars 287m (USDollars 203m) cash offer earlier this month. A Sydney court has ruled that some elements of the Pancon claim have no foundation and should be struck out, but that other sections are legitimate. The mining group has alleged conspiracy to injure and a breach of the corporations law. It is seeking punitive damages for PosGold and other parties, as a result of the way in which PosGold gained control of Aztec. This was achieved when the bidder upped its cash terms and, the following day, quickly snapped up more than half its target's shares. Alumax, the US company which held a critical 37 per cent interest in Aztec and is also named in the action, led the selling wave. The mine, which contributed a loss of ADollars 700,000 to Renison's results in the first half of 1993-94, has been earmarked for closure for some time.</p>

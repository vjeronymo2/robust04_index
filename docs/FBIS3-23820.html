			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Two-part interview with economist Gavriil Popov by </F> unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent under the rubric  "Political Forecast"; held at the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY editorial  office; date not given]  <H5>  [No 7, Feb, pp 1, 3] </H5> <H5>  [Part 1] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  Where Will We Be in One Year? </H5>   The well-known politician and economist Gavriil Popov  recently visited ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. Today we are publishing the  first part of a conversation with him.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] At this time everyone expects inflation  to increase and is trying to salvage his small savings somehow.  As an analyst, do you allow for the further siphoning in of  currency and hyperinflation?    [Popov] There will be no hyperinflation. I believe the  concept of manipulating paper currency to be brilliant. On one  occasion, Keynes was asked to outline the essence of his  teachings in an easy to understand manner, and he narrated:  "Someone manufactured a counterfeit dollar and bought meat with  it. The butcher paid a greengrocer for carrots with his dollar.  The greengrocer paid a tailor. The tailor paid a watch  repairman. It reached a physician, who did not intend to spend  the dollar and took it to the bank. At the bank it turned out  that the dollar was counterfeit. Subsequently, everyone began to  return this dollar to one another, and it went back to the  manufacturer of the counterfeit dollar. He gathered together all  the participants, 15 people, and said: `It is true that the  dollar is counterfeit. However, each one of you got 10 cents of  absolutely real profit on this counterfeit dollar. In total, you  got 150 cents of absolutely real profit. Let us cover the  counterfeit dollar with 100 cents from these profits, and it  will become real. As far as the 50 cents is concerned, split it  among the 15 people and everybody will still have a profit.'" In  essence, if the circulation of deceptive, inflationary paper  money yields profits that exceed the volume of emission, nothing  horrible happens. F. Roosevelt carried this out in reality in  bringing the United States out of the Great Depression.  Therefore, even if emission increases, nothing horrible happens  as long as circulation together with profits exceed this  emission. Danger looms when, in conventional terms, two rubles  [R] are issued while only R1.5 in profits is generated; then  currency depreciation begins.    If even a deceptive instrument energizes the entire economic  circulation, it ultimately becomes something real. However, the  state should still control the volume of inflation. To this end,  we should have a cerebrating and wise government which is  capable of taking risks, that is, completely different people.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] A reader wrote to us: Let us collect  what  foreign exchange remains and buy a wise government abroad.    [Popov] A wise government for Russia cannot be found abroad.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To your mind, what is particularly  dangerous for our government?    [Popov] The pattern of forming the government that has been  accepted is the most dangerous. People allegedly representing  parties have become members. They belong to the government, but  they do not intend to be responsible for the actions of the  government. Everyone pulls his own way, like the swan, the  crawfish, and the pike in Krylov's fable. I believe that Chubays  may be a member of the government, but not as a representative  of Russia's Choice. The same is the case with Shokhin and  everyone else. There may also be a second variant: the  government consists of party representatives. Shokhin represents  the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], Chubays--the  Choice, but then it will be a coalition government rather than  Chernomyrdin's government. In this case, all the factions in the  Duma must be responsible for it. What is happening now? There is  a government, to which these people belong, and in the Duma they  intend to sign a collective document aimed against this  government! This is the most horrible thing. This cannot be  allowed to happen.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Still, if it were up to you, how would  you form the government?    [Popov] The government will not be able to carry out any  fundamental reform in the two years until new elections. This is  why from the very beginning I would consider our current  government to be transitional. It should prepare the  premises for the next four years. It should primarily cleanse  the country from the most scandalous consequences of Gaydar's,  Fedorov's, and Chubays' shock therapy and mainly resolve the  issue of taxation. Have you not filled out a declaration yet?  This is what it indicates: for example, workers must pay a tax  if an official bus takes them to work. A veteran who retires and  receives a benefit is also taxed. They have not yet resolved to  tax the voucher, but as soon as you buy shares with it, you are  taxed. Even if you do not receive profits from stock, changes in  the price of stock also constitute income and, therefore, are  taxed. If they got you a newspaper or magazine subscription at  work, this is income, and you pay tax. If a theater ticket was  purchased for you or if there was a collective visit, you pay  tax. One gets the impression that the impoverished officialdom  must fleece the country to the hilt in order to raise the  minister's salary by a factor of two. As far as people in the  creative arts are concerned, this is an outrage pure and simple.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Gavriil Kharitonovich, you are a radical  politician, but for some reason you did not support the shock  therapy of Gaydar's reforms (although Gaydar believes that he  has not yet reached the shock). Why?    [Popov] Shock therapy was in the interests of not only the  West but also the Russian bureaucracy. It would never have been  implemented here had this not been the case. If there is anyone  who did not agonize over the shock, it is Yegor Timurovich. I  think he was ready to go for the shock until the last Yeltsin  voter.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, as steadfast reformers are  trying to convince us, privatization has won, and a return to  the old times is not possible.    [Popov] Privatization as such does not resolve the main  issue. Private property has been present in the history of  humanity for 2,000 years. However, it became the driving force  of progress only in the environment of free  competition which was created by capitalism. Under  feudalism there was the feudal lord, who was also the landowner.  However, he did not have competition, and there was no incentive  to improve the state of affairs. Privatization should proceed to  the extent to which a competitive situation is created  thereafter. If you have one plant in the entire country, the  situation will not improve but will rather become more dangerous  because we proclaim it to be private. After all, when a  state-appointed director is ensconced, he is dependent on the  state; he has no great interest in maneuvering. Imagine now that  we have a private owner here. For example, can a state-appointed  director allocate R5 million for a bribe? No, he has to report.  The private owner may do so freely if this holds the promise of  R15 million in profit later. Monopolies with private owners are  a horrible thing. Please recall that antitrust laws have been  passed in the United States, whereas we left everything to its  own devices. We should abandon a monopolized structure. This  means very large expenditures. Enterprises must be converted  into joint-stock companies so that employees will share in the  profits and be better motivated. However, enterprises may not be  made private.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If we look a little ahead, how do you  see  our society precisely a year from now?    [Popov] There is a specific scenario. First: the president  makes a decision, but the Duma does not poll 50 percent of the  vote for it. Therefore, the decision is rejected. Or the Duma  makes a decision, the president fails to sign it, the proposal  is returned to the Duma and fails to poll two-thirds of the  vote--likewise, the decision is not passed. This adversarial  scenario must end in the dissolution of the Duma. Since by that  time the Duma will have been working for a year, the president  will have the right to do this (as early as January). A second  version: the Duma, the president, and the government begin to  operate making an effort not to get involved in conflicts among  themselves. I do not think that this is going to be very  effective because all structures feel uncertain. The president  and the Duma know that elections are coming in one and a half  years, and the government knows that a new president will need a  new Duma. Therefore, their entire activities will amount to a  game of "short-term gains." That is, they will implement a set  of measures so that their effect will be felt within three to  seven months. In this case, this may be used in the preelection  struggle. They likewise cannot do anything radically bad in this  mode because it will also be used in the preelection struggle.  From the point of view of tranquility, this is a normal  scenario. From the point of view of reforms, this means slowing  down the pace.    The third scenario: all of them will adhere to the same  strategy, but do work to be built on in the future. I would  consider this scenario to be the best.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Will Yeltsin still be president a year  from now?    [Popov] Of course. After all, he wants to be reelected yet  again. If we do not proceed from that, I cannot explain his  actions otherwise.  <H5>  [No 8, Feb, p 3] </H5> <H5>  [Part 2] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  The People Do not Want Any Shooting </H5>   The motion picture "Repentance" has a scene in which an  old woman asks whether this road leads to the temple, and she is  told: "No, this is Varlam Street, it cannot lead to the  temple."    The December elections showed that those who voted rejected  the version of reforms that was proclaimed following August  1991. Although until then the "top" had maintained that the  chosen model was the right one and that the people supported it.  But it became clear in a matter of hours here that the country  was opposed. To formulate it concisely, this was the road of the  post-August Boris Nikolayevich which also "did not lead to the  temple," just as that of Mikhail Sergeyevich had not. Is this a  tragedy or a success? A success, I believe. Had we dragged out  this process, the next stage of the conflict would have been  very grim.    In actual fact, whose election program, pray, contained  shock  therapy? It was in no one's. Whose program contained the  abolition of the USSR? No one's. Whose program contained the  fact that governors, mayors, and so forth, would be appointed  from the top? Again, no one had this. So that after August 1991  an entirely different concept of reforms, different from that  which had gained approval at the time of the presidential ballot  in June 1991, was put forward "on the quiet."  <H5>  Ideas </H5>   What ideas were, in fact, adopted after August? The  first idea was that Russia would pursue reforms  faster and better than the Soviet Union and that the Soviet  Union was a burden. We are feeding them all, they are like  stones around our neck.    Second idea. The West will give us big money so  that we might pursue the reforms. It was generally believed that  the West was simply dreaming of immediately rearing a new  competitor for itself.    The third idea was that it was possible to get by  with the current mechanism of power, having updated it somewhat.    The fourth idea: Instead of the transition to a  multiparty system, the idea of depoliticization was advanced.  Not only the CPSU but also all political organizations at  enterprises and in the army and the law enforcement authorities  were banned. The bureaucracy undertook to govern itself.    And, finally, the fifth idea: The national  structures, which Russia had inherited from socialism, needed to  adopt and conclude a federal treaty, in which there would be no  Russia but dozens of krays and oblasts.    But practice has shown that since the liquidation of the  USSR  the republics have been warring with one another and that wars  are being fought within republics among individual  nationalities. Thus the premise that by removing the USSR we  would be removing a delayed-action mine was not justified.  Economically either.    There are things that simply cannot be valued in terms of  money. One of man's basic instincts is self-preservation. People  feel surer and more composed in a big state. And this  compensates for both undernourishment and other inconveniences.    Why in April had the pro-president forces not yet lost, but  did so in December? First, because use was not made of the  results of the referendum. Second, because the people saw that  they were being governed by those who might shoot. And they  categorically have no desire for any shooting.  <H5>  Mistakes </H5>   Our movement, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms,  lost tactically on several counts. We believed that some bloc  could be formed. I did not think that the personal interests of,  let us say, Yavlinskiy, would be above common interests. We  hoped to create a bloc with part of Volskiy's Civic Union also.  There was one condition: I implored them to detach themselves  from Rutskoy, and this meant detaching themselves from  Lipitskiy. But they could not bring themselves to do so. We had,  therefore, to act alone, and this was a futile undertaking. But  I decided that it was better to lose but declare our  independence than to do as the Republican Party did: become  dissolved among the blocs.    But all the tactical mistakes in aggregate do not cover up  the main mistake--strategic. Yes, after August 1991 and the  choice of new policy I realized that the electorate would run  from the government fronts. That we needed to create the RDDR  [Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms] as a defensive line,  which would halt all these fugitives and attract them to itself.  I quit the office of mayor--this was all correct. But I made a  mistake. First, we erected this defensive line too close.  The people were running past, bypassing not only us but  Volskiy and Travkin and even the Russian Communist Party, and  running up to Zhirinovskiy. Second, I had assumed that  there would be both flight and confrontation at the presidential  elections. I was thrown off in my calculations by the April  referendum, and I underestimated the scale of the impact of  October on people's minds. I believed that the people would  still show patience--this purely Russian trait. Had we allowed  for the fact that there would be a confrontation with the  government model of reforms in December even, the RDDR would  have gone to the elections aggressively and on the offensive. We  proceeded, however, from the idea that the people would vote for  the presidential-government party and that we would remain, as  before, the opposition. But we should here, apparently, have  emphasized all along the line not opposition but confrontation.  That is, we should have played an entirely different game.  <H5>  Shock Therapy </H5>   It meant that we would start to live according to the plan  of  transformations formulated for us in the West. The West itself,  however, has not employed this plan, no developed countries have  ever resorted to it. It is what they have recommended for  export, to backward countries. We will admit you to our table  only as second-rate partners. But account was not taken of the  opinion of our people, who could put up with and agree to a  great deal more in order to remain among the leaders. This is a  particular historical feature of theirs.    Shock therapy did not come off for the following reason  also.  Power after August was a bloc of two bureaucracies: young  and old. At the first stage the tone was set by the young  bureaucracy. What suited the old bureaucracy in the shock  therapy, on the other hand, was the fact that property would be  shared out under the control of the apparatus. But when the  speed of the reforms increased, it transpired that the "old men"  were still not prepared for it. They (as distinct from the young  ones) are realists and had a presentiment that were they to  openly purchase a plant, the workers would kick them out of this  plant. They understood that, before buying the plant, they  needed to control the militia and the public prosecutor's office  and to have their own judges. But there was as yet none of this.  They were opposed, therefore, to the pace that had been imposed  by the shock therapy. Nor did the ideology of shock therapy rule  out the fact that the purchasers would be foreigners, who, with  the current value of the dollar and the ruble, would buy up many  plants here. This did not suit the old bureaucracy either.    And the final--social--aspect. Shock therapy proceeded from  the idea that the people should themselves pay in full for all  these problems of transition to the market. It was a plan  whereby a large part of the people would pay for the whole of  the past in full while the other part would at this time obtain  the privileges.  <H5>  Power </H5>   I consider the presence of stable power to be the most  important thing for the reforms. No one will invest money and no  one will work until stable prospects appear.    How was the stability of power in Germany and Japan secured?  Stability was secured by two conditions: there was in both  places the American Army. There were elections, but such that  Adenauer was in power in the FRG for 20 years, and in Japan the  Liberal Democratic Party has governed for 40 years. Things could  calmly be seen through to a conclusion. In South Korea or Chile  stability was embodied by a military dictatorship. In Spain, by  a constitutional monarchy.    None of these options would do for us. Military dictatorship  in a multinational state is an impracticable thing. We had an  opportunity to take the Chinese path, in the event of the CPSU  finding within itself the powers to reorganize. It would have  been a guarantor of stability. But we did not take this path.  American Army options would do even less. In my opinion,  we are left with just one option: seeking a version of a  coalition of political forces. This would be a center agreement.  And this coalition should agree within itself on the main lines  of the transitional period.    I believe that two categories of people should be a part of  the government. Those who are capable of creating a  long-term program (if Gaydar has been removed, and he was a  person of conceptual thinking, Yavlinskiy, who can create  long-term programs, needs to be brought in, consequently).  And those who can pull the cart.    I believe that the president needs to put some distance  between himself and the government. We have too big a country,  we cannot permit such a concentration of power--all for the  president. He should appoint the prime minister. And that is  all. He should not be involved with either ministers or  programs. He should remain aloof and be a guarantor of the  reforms. And replace in good time a government that has realized  part of the set of problems by another that could go further and  realize the next stage.</p>

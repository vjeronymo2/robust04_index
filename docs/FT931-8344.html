			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: VW to control importing of Skodas VOLKSWAGEN yesterday took full control of the import and distribution of Czech-built Skoda cars in the UK, following an agreement which ends months of friction with the previous Czech-owned importer. The agreement between Volkswagen-controlled Skoda Automobile UK and Skoda (GB), which had imported the cars for more than 20 years, releases the 222-strong dealer network from contractual obligations to Skoda (GB), allowing them to enter contracts with Skoda Automobile UK. The deal opens the way for Volkswagen, which now controls Skoda and is overseeing a Pounds 3.3bn investment programme in models and plant, to pursue its plans to quadruple Skoda's UK sales to 40,000 a year. The agreement means that Skoda (GB), owned by the privatised Motokov International Czech foreign trade agency, will have no role in the business. Skoda (GB) had been refusing to release dealers from their contracts while it sought a role as sub-contractor to Skoda Automobile UK, which appointed itself as the official importer/distributor in January. In particular, it was anxious to operate, on the VW company's behalf, the import and preparation centre at Kings Lynn, which had employed more than 100 people. Skoda Automobile UK has opted instead to import the vehicles through Southampton, which handles imports of cars built by SEAT of Spain - also controlled by Volkswagen. Preparation of both makes at the port has been subcontracted to Southampton Vehicle Terminals with Richard Lawson Car Delivery Group, which is based in Dundee and distributes SEATs from Southampton, taking on Skoda deliveries as well.</p>

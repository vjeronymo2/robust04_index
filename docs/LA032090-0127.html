			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FLOODED RIVERS SWAMP SOUTHERN CITIES  </P> <P> Military police officers guarded against looters in flood-ravaged southern  Alabama, where the town of Elba remained a muddy hole Monday, two days after an  earthen levee ruptured along the Pea River.  </P> <P> Storm-choked rivers surged further beyond their banks in southern Alabama,  Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, driving families from their homes to join  thousands who have fled from flooding that has led to at least 13 deaths  throughout the South.  </P> <P> Runoff from as much as 18 inches of rain last week was expected to drive the  Alabama River more than 20 feet above flood stage in the state capital of  Montgomery, authorities said. Downstream in Selma, the river was already 18  feet beyond its banks and was expected to rise another 2 feet before cresting  today.  </P> <P> The latest evacuations around the two cities Monday left as many as 800 people  out of their homes in the immediate area, authorities said. The total number of  evacuations in Alabama alone since last weekend exceeded 4,000.  </P> <P> Floodwaters that ravaged northern Georgia moved south Monday, forcing more  evacuations and traffic problems as rain-swollen rivers and streams left their  banks. The Chattahoochee River, which crested Saturday at its highest level in  44 years in the Atlanta area, was at 41 feet Monday, well past its flood stage  of 34 feet.  </P> <P> Authorities evacuated low-lying areas along the river near Columbus, Ga.,  including a trailer park, and the river level was expected to rise steadily  between Columbus and the Florida line, forecasters said.  </P> <P> The Ocmulgee River, with a flood stage of 18 feet, reached 29.5 feet Monday  morning and was nearing a crest of about 30 feet, said Russell Post, a National  Weather Service hydrologist.  </P> <P> The Flint River at Montezuma, Ga., was on its way to an expected crest of 26  feet today, which would be its highest since at least 1971, Post said. Some  residents were being evacuated.  </P> <P> In Florida's Panhandle, an estimated 1,000 people were evacuated. About 80% of  families in the town of Caryville, on the banks of the Choctawhatchee River,  were out of their homes, authorities said.  </P> <P> The Pea River crested in Elba on Sunday morning. Water was still up to the  roofs of some buildings, and it will be several days before most of the town's  3,000 evacuees will be able to return, authorities estimated.  </P> <P> An aerial survey by the Red Cross showed more than 600 homes in Elba swamped by  6 feet or more of water. Mayor Fred Moore said all but one of the town's  businesses were flooded.  </P> <P> Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt toured the flooded areas by helicopter Monday and asked  President Bush to declare Coffee County in the far southeast corner of the  state a federal disaster area. Coffee County was hardest hit by the flooding,  and Hunt said he would be adding other counties to the list as damage  assessments came in.  </P></p>

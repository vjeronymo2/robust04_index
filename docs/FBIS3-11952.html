It should be  pointed out that Senator Bernard Sansaricq has publicly refused  an invitation by Ambassador William Lacy Swing to participate in  the 29 March reception. The parliamentarian, who has reproached  the U.S. Embassy for its interference in Haitian internal  affairs, has declared that he is in solidarity with the  contested 18 January 1993 senators.    [Begin Sansaric recording] It is with good grace and with an  immense pleasure that we, senators of the Republic, are able to  answer this nice invitation. Unfortunately, today everything  regarding the schemes of the U.S. Government's representatives  in Haiti seems to reveal their firm determination to work toward  destroying cohesion between the authentic sons of the Haitian  homeland. Insofar as a foreign diplomatic representation  supposedly persists in encouraging us (?to move toward) the path  of discord on particular and international questions regarding  the sovereignty of our institutions, we remain sorry to be  compelled to refuse the honor of this invitation, even though it  is nice.

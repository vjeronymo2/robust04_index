			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: LSE right to move to County Hall Sir, I write in response to Mr Burt's letter (June 23) on the London School of Economic's bid for County Hall. We are not asking the government to give us County Hall. Rather we are seeking access to the site and to the information which we need in order to finalise a bid that will give us the space we need to expand (currently we have 25 per cent more students than the accepted university grants committee norms); to develop the research-led, post-graduate teaching activities which will be needed as the UK develops a mass system of higher education; to respond to demands for greater interaction with the commercial life of London by developing an 'International Social Science Park' and in other ways and to expand our post-graduate management education activities. We feel that this makes perfect financial sense and are confident that we can demonstrate this. We agree that our standing in the future will be a function of the quality of our teaching staff and students and it is to preserve that quality that we need more space. It is not the grandeur of the County Hall that attracts us, it is its location and its size. J M Ashworth, director, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE</p>

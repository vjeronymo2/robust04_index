			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Squeeze on zinc at LME is over, say traders THE WORST of the extreme squeeze on the London Metal Exchange zinc market is over, traders suggested last night, but some fears remain that the upheaval may have damaged the LME's image and drive zinc prices down to unnecessarily low levels. The issue is important because the LME became the dominant basis for world zinc pricing last year when nearly all the North American zinc producers switched to using the exchange as a reference point for contract discussions. Most big producers elsewhere in the world switched in 1989. Yesterday the premium to borrow zinc for immediate delivery for one day, which soared to more than Dollars 100 a tonne during on Monday afternoon, fluctuated between zero and Dollars 8 a tonne. This was well below the Dollars 20 a day maximum informally agreed between the LME executive and Metallgesellschaft, the German group which, with associates, controls most of the physical metal available for April delivery. MG's LME ring dealing subsidiary and its clients undertook to keep the market liquid by making metal available at reasonable cost. After the cost of borrowing zinc for a day collapsed to zero, there was talk among traders that a deal may have been done outside the market by MG and the main investment fund victim of the squeeze, said to be the Californian-based Mint Fund, which is 50-per-cent-owned by ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. An official said MG's trading subsidiary had not been involved in any such arrangement but he could not speak for other companies in the MG group. Some zinc market users said the LME executive should have taken formal action to limit the daily premium to Dollars 20 a tonne, rather than relying on diplomatic pressure. Producers expressed concern that the high price of metal for immediate delivery had encouraged a flood of zinc into LME warehouses. The arrival of nearly 15,000 tonnes was reported on Tuesday, taking LME stocks to 83,125 tonnes, little short of the highest level for seven years. Zinc for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,215.50 a tonne, down Dollars 67, while three-month metal was down Dollars 28 at Dollars 1,162. This meant that the backwardation (premium for cash metal over forward prices) narrowed to Dollars 53.50 a tonne having been as high as Dollars 240.</p>

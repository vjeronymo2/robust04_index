			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BASS BUYS, CUTS, DONATES HOUSE  </P> <P> Super-rich investor Sid Bass found a creative way to deal with an unwanted  mansion next door: buy it, cut it into pieces and reassemble it somewhere else.  </P> <P> Bass and his wife, Mercedes, plan to move their former neighbors'  6,600-square-foot house to the grounds of the Lena Pope Home, a facility for  abused, neglected and emotionally disturbed children.  </P> <P> Officials say the donated four-bedroom French-style house will be used as a  residence for eight girls and a married couple called family teachers.  </P> <P> The house is the former residence of the Mac Churchill family, who moved after  selling the property to the Basses about three months ago.  </P> <P> "Thank goodness the Basses are doing this," Churchill said. "Nobody else could  have thought of doing it."  </P> <P> Bass, whose fortune is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, is  remodeling his own red-brick colonial house.  </P></p>

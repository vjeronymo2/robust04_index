			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Brussels to fine steel groups over cartel The European Commission will fine leading European steel manufacturers tomorrow for operating a cartel in heavy steel sections and beams for the construction industry. Up to 20 companies in seven EU member states and three Nordic countries have been found to be distorting competition in European steel products, breaching the European Coal and Steel Treaty which bans price-fixing and the sharing out of markets, a senior Brussels official said. Brussels' action comes as the Commission steps up pressure on private steelmakers to cut production, as part of the restructuring plan agreed by the 12 just before Christmas. Among steelmakers facing fines are Arbed, British Steel, Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Fundia Norske, officials confirmed. The level of fine will be set at a meeting tonight of senior Brussels officials, which will take place at the same time as a Brussels dinner between Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, and leading steelmakers grouped in Eurofer, the industry association. An official said the competition directorate 'would like to have a serious fine' imposed, but that the level of sanction would be subject to 'a political appreciation'. Fines can be levied up to 10 per cent of annual sales in the sector, but an official said the normal level was about 2 per cent of turnover. The fines follow a three-year investigation. Officials do not deny that bringing the inquiry to a head now will put pressure on Europe's private steelmakers to accept the crisis measures adopted last year. In December, EU industry ministers approved Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in government subsidies for state-owned steelmakers, mainly in Italy, Germany and Spain, in return for capacity cuts of more than 5m tonnes. But as part of the deal, the Commission is looking for cuts of 25m tonnes from non-aided producers, provoking angry resistance from private steelmakers. The steel industry has until now escaped the heavy sanctions for competition distortion that Brussels has imposed in other sectors, such as chemicals and paper and board.

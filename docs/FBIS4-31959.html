			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Milutinovic: "New Story--Sad Ending"] </F>   [Text] By mid-May, the commercial banks had loaned to the  domestic economy about 800 million dinars of credit to  "invigorate" production. Thanks to that financial injection,  Yugoslav industry increased its output 12.4 percent in February,  21.3 percent in March, and another 3.4 percent in April. At  first glance, the authors of the program for monetary  reconstruction and economic recovery have reason to be content.  But at the same time there are also many reasons to be  concerned. In the first four months of this year industrial  production is all of one-fifth below what it was in the same  period of last year. Let us remind those who are forgetful: The  country's social product last year was equal to the one in  far-off 1963.  <H5>  "Overnight Coverage" </H5>   The commencement of Avramovic's program was characterized by  markedly "animated" credit activity of the banks, which recently  has essentially dwindled. Only here and there do you hear that  any of the more than 100 commercial banks has granted a new loan  to the economy. Faced with this development of events, the  National Bank of Yugoslavia [NBJ] has on two occasions tried to  get additional funds for new loans by reducing the legal  reserves (5 percent at the moment). But that effect melted away  in just a few days, so that many bankers are demanding more and  more loudly that the rate of the legal reserves be reduced to  zero, that is, be done away with. In that case, that is, every  dinar deposited could be loaned out.    The same objective is behind the demand to bring back once  again the principle of "overnight coverage," which would mean  that the negative balance of any bank could temporarily be  covered from the accounts of another bank. Up to now, it was  very expensive to go "in the red," and any negative balance had  to be covered through a sale of foreign exchange to the central  bank, and so the bankers were much more cautious. This,  unfortunately, did not last long, and the principle of mandatory  coverage of a negative balance with foreign exchange was very  quickly abandoned.    Government bodies and agencies are continuing to insist on  new bank loans in order to increase output. That is quite  understandable. It is in the interest of the state for as many  enterprises as possible to be in operation, because that also  means fewer unemployed workers, who have to be financed from the  garners of the state. At the same time, neither the federal nor  republic government nor the central bank really cares all that  much in the end whether and when any of those loans will be  repaid. The risk falls only on those who actually invest the  money in certain firms, and that means the bank and its  depositors. Because most bankers are aware that even the banking  sector will not be able to survive long without financial  rescue, none of them is really all that anxious to reproach  those who will later decide whether a bank is going to go into  bankruptcy or perhaps be rescued. That is why the present  situation might be described in just four words as "shut up and  give."  <H5>  Rescheduling </H5>   Incidentally, there is no other way to explain the fact that  many firms are coming for a second round of loans when they  still have not repaid the first loan. Even though the date for  repayment of the principal and the accrued interest agreed to  has already passed. Still more strangely, many banks are meeting  those demands more and more frequently and in that way turning  themselves into "wishing wells," and only the rare ones dare to  slam the door in the face of delinquent debtors.    The daily press has been writing about this quite a bit in  recent days. The example of the Motor and Tractor Industry [IMT]  in New Belgrade is a typical example: On 10 May, it applied for  a new loan from Beobanka, although it had not repaid the  previous loan of 19 million dinars. In order to improve the  chances of their management, the workers at IMT went on  strike--instead of asking the top management of their firm where  the millions obtained in February disappeared. The colleagues  from IMT were soon joined by trade union officials of IMR  [Rakovica Motor Industry] in Rakovica, 21 Maja, Precizna  Mehanika in Zemun....    It all inescapably reminds us of the old tried-and-true  formula. The only essential thing is to "channel in the right  direction" the anger of the workers, and the loan is certain to  be forthcoming. They are forgetting that this is the best way of  destroying the stabilization program for certain. If decisions  on the granting of new loans should be made by trade union  officials together with inept managers of large firms, this will  be a sure sign that the money is going into a bottomless hole.  And because there is no bottom, there is no source from which to  return what has been borrowed.  <H5>  Return of the State </H5>   In the present phase of realization of the program for  economic recovery, the bankers are supposed to forbid access to  their vaults to all those who still have not repaid old loans.    Otherwise, they will never again be able to say "no" to  anyone. Rescheduling automatically means that there will be no  money for projects for which credit support of the banks is also  indispensable.    In this connection, there was the rather symptomatic  announcement of the most responsible government officials that  some firms cannot be left hanging and must be provided new loans  although they have not repaid those already granted. This is  justified on the alleged grounds that production has still not  been rounded out. At the same time, it is not clear why this  state does not loose the strings of "its own purse" and finance  such programs from the budget, if it is so convinced that the  market will confirm their value.    Governor Avramovic himself has been mentioning Zastava in  Kragujevac more and more loudly, although it is clear to  everyone that the average Yugoslav does not have money for a  Yugo, and those who have managed to get rich in a short time  prefer a Mercedes. The state must decide once and for all where  its interest lies and then finance that itself, leaving  everything else to free competition on the market, in which it  will not be issuing any indirect orders as to who should do what.    It is clear to everyone that the growth of production is one  of the conditions for economic recovery. But people seem to be  forgetting that production is not an end in itself and is worth  nothing until it finds a customer on the market. What is more,  enterprises must discharge their obligations not only to the  state, which in spite of all difficulties, has been collecting  its tribute quite regularly, but also to the bank from which the  loans were taken. Incidentally, if all the loans granted so far  had been repaid with interest, nearly 900 million dinars would  very quickly build up once again in the banking system. Only  then could bankers freely decide how much of that money to lend  to whom in the future. This way, one can get the impression that  what has been borrowed is being repaid only by firms that have  no one of their own in the top government leadership or in the  management of the bank.  <H5>  The Credit Financing of Losing Operation </H5>   Attention should assuredly also be paid to the fact that the  commercial banks have begun to extend foreign exchange loans to  the NBJ. This has already been done by Jugobanka, Beobanka,  Investbanka, Union Banka, Komercijalna Banka.... Nikola Stanic,  M.A., NBJ vice governor, has even boasted in public that he has  had no time for anything except concluding contracts with the  bankers for foreign exchange loans. The basis for that is  contained in the law recently adopted for the FRY to borrow $300  million in foreign exchange and to use the foreign exchange  collected in that way as support for the new dinar. It has  already taken in several tens of millions of marks in this way,  and this is giving rise to new dilemmas.    Aggrieved foreign exchange savings depositors are wondering  how the banks have foreign exchange to lend to the state, when  at the same time they say that they are unable to pay them their  foreign exchange savings? The bankers justify themselves by  saying that this is the foreign exchange of their customers,  large socialized or government-owned firms, as though there is  writing on every mark, dollar, schilling, or franc saying to  whom it belongs and who deposited it in the bank. One gets the  impression that this justification does not really hold water.  But everything is possible here.    At the same time, the question arises of what interest the  bank has here, when we know that the repayment period for those  loans is two years, and there is a grace period of one year, and  the rate of interest is the rate of interest in the country from  which the currency comes? These conditions, which are not overly  attractive, give rise to the suspicion that this is some kind of  government "racket," so that certain bankers have no other  solution than to take the foreign exchange from their vaults and  "voluntarily" turn it over to the central bank, that is, to the  state.    This version becomes quite convincing when we realize that  many firms are ready to offer much more favorable conditions  than the state for foreign exchange loans. But for them there  simply is no foreign exchange. This suggests the conclusion that  it is not all as voluntary as they would like to portray it. For  the present, the story about those foreign exchange loans is  very much like what happened with the loans to invigorate  production. The media are overloaded with the numerous deals  that have been concluded, and almost no one asks how and when  those loans will be repaid? In what way will the state be able  to repay the interest and accrued interest in a period of two  years? If it does as it has done up to now--all those who have  given their money can say good-bye to it. By way of consolation,  there remains the hope that at some point the state might change.    Finally, the conclusion can be drawn that the public will  soon be confronted with a new form of credit financing. This  time they would have the principal role and would be using their  money to help to increase production and support stability of  the national currency. The idea of the new loan for "economic  rebirth" has been launched by Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, NBJ  governor, with a justification that sounds a bit naive, to the  effect that he did not even know about the previous loan and  what happened to it. New projects and programs that will compete  to use the money obtained by floating the public loan are to be  gathered over the next month or two. So, whoever wants to, let  them do it. In order to correct at least to some extent the  impression, the government would first have to force the  enterprises who have so far borrowed money from the banks to  repay those loans. Otherwise, the public will not be able to  expect its money back either. And that would then mean that  there is yet another story on the horizon with a sad ending.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Chemicals industry searches for safe CFCs substitute THE EC environment ministers' decision at the weekend to go for an earlier deadline on eliminating ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) comes as the leading chemical companies such as Du Pont and ICI are already well advanced in phasing out their production. The difficulty is in providing a safe non-ozone depleting substitute that will replace essential uses of CFCs. They are used in aerosols, refrigeration, air conditioning, insulation, fire extinguishers, and cleaning in engineering, electronics and computers. Yesterday Greenpeace renewed its call for a complete ban on production and use of CFCs. However, the chemical industry and the users of these substances say that this is impossible until safe substitutes are produced in enough volume to replace existing CFCs. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, are a substitute for many CFCs in refrigerators but still cause some damage to the ozone layer. HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), produced by ICI and Du Pont, do not destroy ozone but environmental pressure groups object to them on the grounds that they can contribute to global warming. In any case present production of HFCs is only large enough to meet about 5 per cent of demand, says ICI. ICI, which produces CFCs at is Runcorn, Cheshire plant, in the UK yesterday welcomed the result of the Estoril meeting. It will cease CFC production by 1995 and will stop producing the two big ozone depleters, CFCs 11 and 12, by 1993. However, it has arranged to buy in supplies of CFC 11 and 12 from Akzo, the Dutch chemical company, so that it can continue to supply a declining market until substitutes are provided. Meanwhile, in Germany, Mr Klaus Toepfer, the environment minister, is pressing industry to stop producing and using CFCs by next year.</p>

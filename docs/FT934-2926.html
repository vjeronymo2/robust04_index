			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Taiwan cuts GNP target Taiwan's cabinet yesterday cut its gross national product growth target in 1994 to 6.2 per cent from the original 7 per cent, citing a weak global economy and cuts in state spending, Reuter reports from Taipei. GNP is rising 6 per cent in 1993, the Council for Economic Planning and Development said. Taiwan yesterday lifted a four-decade-old ban on new radio stations as part of democratic reforms, Reuter reports. It approved 13 applications, including one from the main opposition Democratic Progressive party. The cabinet's Government Information Office would offer 29 more FM radio frequencies this month and eight AM radio frequencies next March, said Mr Hank Lo, its director of radio and television affairs.</p>

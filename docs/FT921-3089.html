			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (13): Ambitious programme of investment - The new Memorandum of Understanding has placed the oil industry on a more secure financial footing NIGERIA HAS two distinct economies: the oil industry, which constitutes the nation's economic core; and the rest of its manufacturing, agriculture and service sectors, which together form its struggling hinterland. More than ever, these two economies appear to be going in opposite directions. The non-oil economy is limping along, dogged by slow growth, low investment and heavy debts. But the oil sector, source of the bulk of tax revenues and foreign currency export earnings, is flourishing. Indeed, the outlook for Nigeria's oil industry looks better now than at any time in the past decade. The signing, last July, of the new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government and the foreign oil companies has placed the industry on a more secure financial footing. The MoU, replacing the original agreement signed in 1986, has restored the real value of guaranteed profit margins the foreign companies receive on their investments, and put in place a series of further fiscal incentives for new investment. The MoU also maps out a new five-year plan of exploration and capital investment designed to increase production and reserves. The government aims to increase the potential output of the industry from its present estimated level of 1.95-2m barrels a day to 2.5m b/d by 1995. It also plans to increase Nigeria's proven oil reserves to 20bn barrels from their present 18bn. Output last year averaged 1.893m b/d. The new Opec quotas, agreed recently in Vienna, would reduce Nigeria's production to 1.751m b/d. But the government and the oil companies are confident that if Nigeria can increase its production capability, its quota share will be increased accordingly. The foreign oil companies and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the majority partner in all oil ventures, have embarked on an ambitious programme of capital investment. Shell, the largest foreign company, plans to increase the average daily production of the joint venture it operates from 900,000 to 1.3m b/d by the late 1990s, and has increased annual capital expenditure from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1,500m a year over the past three years. Philip Watts, Shell's managing director in Nigeria, describes the government's expansion targets as 'entirely realistic'. Alfred Koch, managing director of Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN), agrees. He dismisses suggestions that NNPC will not be able to come up with its 60 per cent share of the necessary capital investment. Mobil plans to raise the crude oil production of its joint venture to 425,000 b/d by the end of 1995. It had already increased its average daily production to 310,000 barrels in January, displacing Chevron to become the second largest foreign producer in Nigeria. Moreover, Mobil's total production will increase by a further 100,000 b/d once its Dollars 885m project to produce a high-quality hydrocarbon condensate comes on stream in December. Condensate falls outside the definition of crude oil governed by Opec quotas. Financing for the plant was secured last year, and the plant is already 77 per cent complete. It should be running at full capacity by the end of March 1993. Chevron is determined not to be left behind. Having more than doubled capital expenditure between 1990 and 1991, it plans to do so again in 1992. Over the next five years, total gross capital expenditure will reach Dollars 3bn with the aim of increasing production to 320,000 b/d this year and 400,000 b/d by 1995. Nigeria, then, is a priority location for many of the world's largest oil companies, and their commitment to Nigeria is long-term. Both Mobil and Chevron have recently moved to smart new office complexes around Lagos, while Shell is planning to shift its corporate headquarters to Abuja, the new federal capital. Why Nigeria? The oil industry there is relatively young and undeveloped, the oil is light and of a high quality, the climate is relatively benign, keeping operating costs low, and Nigeria is not in the Middle East. The risks of political instability disrupting production appear to be low. This year's election, and the shift to civilian rule, might be expected to make foreign investors nervous. But the oil industry executives are nonplussed. 'If you review the history of the past 30 years,' says Mr Koch of MPN, 'every time there was a change of government there was not a substantial shift in oil policy. Our best guess is that that will continue.' This sentiment is shared by all the companies. The relationship between the Nigerian government and its foreign partners is clearer than ever before. Each company was required to sign a Joint Operating Agreement (JoA) with NNPC last year which documents, often for the first time and in precise detail, the rights and obligations of each party. The JoAs spell out, for example, procedures for making capital spending decisions and the foreign companies' obligations to train their Nigerian nationals. They are also believed to grant NNPC the right to become the operator of fields if and when it so chooses. Are the foreign companies concerned that their assets could be nationalised at any time? Apparently not. 'If the government decides it wants to take over operations, that is its prerogative,' says Donald Mahura, managing director of Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary. 'But I don't think that the JoA gives them any more or less right to do that.' The truth is that the government is dependent on the foreign companies for investment funds and technical skill. As Mr Koch of MPN points out, 'there is nobody in Nigeria who is foolish enough to nationalise the oil companies'. Far from taking a more active role in the oil industry, NNPC looks set to become less involved in day-to-day operations as a result of the government decision to shift away from the joint venture model that has dominated the Nigerian oil industry. In 1990, the government announced the largest round of licensing of new oil fields since the 1960s. A total of 136 blocks, covering 421,000 square kilometres of unexplored territory, were thrown open to bids due in November 1990. A number of new concessions have since been allocated, although the process is not yet complete. The new MoU will not apply to oil discovered or produced from these fields. Instead the government is offering production-sharing contracts which require foreign operators to undertake 100 per cent of all exploration and development costs. If oil is discovered, the foreign company then sells a portion of the output, known as 'cost oil', to cover its outlays. The remaining 'profit oil' is then distributed between the government and the companies on terms which compensate the operators for the higher risks they bear. The exact terms of the production-sharing contracts are still being negotiated. The advantage for NNPC is that the foreign company bears the initial capital cost and the up-front risk. NNPC only becomes involved once oil is discovered, which could be 10 or more years after exploration begins. 'With the fiscal terms in place in Nigeria there is not really a big incentive for the government to be a direct equity partner in the oil sector,' explains Mr Mahura of Chevron. Yet the foreign companies have not been deterred from bidding for the new acreage, either by the JoA or by these new financial arrangements. All the leading companies have been allocated new concessions, while some old faces have returned, notably BP. BP, and its Norwegian partner Statoil, have been allocated two off-shore blocks and have a preliminary investment budget of Pounds 250m over the next five years. BP is returning after an 11-year absence. In 1979, the company had its assets seized, notably a 20 per cent stake in Nigeria's largest joint venture, after allegations it was shipping oil to South Africa. NNPC has also made discretionary allocations to 18 newly-created Nigerian companies, although most are expected to enter into joint venture agreements with foreign partners. So, while the Nigerian macro-economy looks to be in a fragile state, and its politics face an uncertain few years, the oil industry continues to expand. The foreign oil companies do not seem worried by the domestic instability that surrounds them. Indeed, the suspicion is that the foreign oil companies secretly thrive on it. The more unstable the domestic political situation, the less likely it is that the government will try to interfere with its one dependable source of revenue. At least that has been their past experience.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Dutch toy workers fly in for protest Closing a plant in the Netherlands can be a notoriously complex and expensive process, but it does not normally involve all employees travelling abroad to demonstrate. Yesterday morning all 162 employees of the Hasbro toy factory in Ter Apel in the Netherlands arrived at the doors of the Hasbro International headquarters in Stockley Park, near London, to stage an orderly protest. The world's biggest toy company knew the visit was planned and had earlier turned down employee requests for a meeting with Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International. But when the Hasbro executives saw the Dutch workers - mainly members of the CNV general union and the FNV print union - shivering outside, they changed their minds. Mr Walker told the demonstrators he could not discuss the proposed closure until the Ter Apel employee works council produced its alternative plan. The employees of the nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover company feel aggrieved that Ter Apel has been selected for closure despite its being, on Hasbro's own admission, a modern, efficient, and profitable plant. The trouble, says Hasbro, is that worldwide overcapacity requires the closure of one of its three European plants and the Dutch plant is smaller than those in Spain and Ireland. Also, it is not equipped to produce games and toys. If this is the modern face of European industrial relations, it certainly seems civilised. The employees chartered a Boeing 737-300 on a public holiday, but a company spokesman said that Hasbro would have given them a day off to protest anyway.</p>

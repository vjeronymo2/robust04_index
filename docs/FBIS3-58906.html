			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The German Bundesbank has  made any further relaxation in fiscal policy dependent on the  behavior of wage negotiating partners and the public  authorities. The more stability-oriented their attitude, "the  more scope the Bundesbank has for interest rate reductions,"  Edgar Meister, member of the Bundesbank Directorate, said in  Cologne today. He attributed a "decisive role" to the  forthcoming wage negotiations in the public service sector and  the metalworking industry. "It must be hoped that the wage  negotiating partners will meet their special responsibility for  the overall economy and won't send any wrong signals."    The Bundesbank Council decision last week to reduce the  minimum reserve ratio for banks' sight deposits with the  Bundesbank from 1 March, according to Meister, will bring the  banking system additional net liquidity of nearly 18 billion  German marks [DM]. "This is accompanied by a corresponding  reduction in costs which should generally open up scope for a  further reduction in bank interest rates," Meister said.    Meister again rejected all demands for the Bundesbank to  pursue an accelerated policy of reducing interest rates to  revive the economy. That is not its task. Moreover, the  experience of many countries has shown that active use of  monetary policy to stimulate the economy has led "in the end to  higher inflation rates with by no means higher employment  levels." Accelerated interest rate reductions will also "have a  counterproductive effect" on the exchange rate and capital  market interest rates. Last year, for example, about two-thirds  of issues by public authorities were underwritten by foreign  participants.    Meister described the cuts in expenditure adopted to  consolidate public budgets as "the first important steps in the  right direction." In the future, however, a greater  concentration on "investment spending at the expense of  consumption expenditure" is unavoidable and will continue to  "require utmost efforts." With public debts at present standing  at nearly DM2 trillion, the state's room for maneuver is already  severely reduced. Interest payments are "now the second largest  item after social welfare expenditure" in the federal budget.  Meister said the demands on the national product must "be more  modest in the foreseeable future."    Meister assessed current economic developments in cautiously  optimistic terms. If oil prices continue to remain low and  exchange rates do not have any pronounced inflationary impact,  Meister believes that an inflation rate of around 2 percent "in  individual months" of the current year is "quite realistic."</p>

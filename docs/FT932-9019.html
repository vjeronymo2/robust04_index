			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Housing sales get a spring in their step - At a Glance Housing activity showed a strong year-on-year rise in April with gross sales up 13.3 per cent on April 1992, according to the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index. Compared with March there was a 4.1 per cent decline in gross sales, but this reflected the impact of public holidays. Gross sales are defined as the number of new sales agreed in the month, subject to contract and which normally have a completed chain, finance arranged and solicitors instructed. The number of deals where contracts were exchanged rose 8.3 per cent year-on-year and fell 5.5 per cent on March.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OHIO STATE'S WILLIAMS TO COACH AT MD.  </P> <P> Ohio State Coach Gary Williams today was named head basketball coach at the  University of Maryland, a once-prominent program riddled with turmoil for most  of the past three years.  </P> <P> Williams, 43, takes over the Terrapin program after three seasons at Ohio  State, where he had a 59-41 record. He replaces Bob Wade, who resigned under  pressure May 12 after completing three years of a five-year contract.  </P> <P> This will be Williams' fourth head coaching position in an 11-year career in  which he has amassed a 217-128 record. He coached at American University from  1978 to '82 and Boston College from 1982 to '86 before going to Ohio State. He  posted a winning record and recorded at least two 20-win seasons at each stop.  </P> <P> Williams, who was a three-year starter on Maryland's basketball team before  graduating in 1968, inherits a team that went 9-20 last year, the most losses  by a Maryland team since 1940-41, and won only one of 14 Atlantic Coast  Conference games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NCAA Recruiting Probe  </P> <P> Before the 1988-89 season, the Terps lost six players to transfers, academic  ineligibility, redshirting or suspension. In March, the program was placed  under investigation for NCAA recruiting violations.  </P> <P> The NCAA has yet to make public its findings or whatever penalties Maryland may  incur stemming from the investigation.  </P> <P> The Terps had losing records in two of the three seasons since the drug-related  death of Len Bias in June, 1986. From 1971 to '86, Maryland posted 10 20-win  seasons and two ACC regular-season championships under Coach Lefty Driesell,  who resigned under pressure weeks before the 1985-86 season.  </P> <P> Maryland's selection of Williams ended a monthlong search by a six-member  search committee that interviewed five candidates for the job last week.  </P> <P> The other four finalists for the position were USC Coach George Raveling,  Rutgers Coach Bob Wenzel; North Carolina-Charlotte Coach Jeff Mullins, and Ben  Jobe of Southern University.  </P> <P> Mullins withdrew his name from consideration last Friday, and Raveling did the  same Sunday.  </P></p>

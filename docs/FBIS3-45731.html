(BBC) documentary about  the life of Chairman Mao Zedong at their club on Monday. But  the board of governors of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC)  said they would go ahead with Monday's screening of "Mao Zedong:  The Last Emperor" -- and also ignore an unusual Hong Kong  government request that they secure a permit for the  members-only event.    FCC Vice President Carl Goldstein said China's demand was  presented to the board by two officials of the foreign affairs  department of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY,  Beijing's de facto consulate in the British colony. "We have  come to express our hope -- that is, to make a request that the  FCC takes measures to stop the showing of this film," Goldstein  quoted one of the officials as saying. "It villifies and  slanders our late chairman and hurts the feelings of the Chinese  people."    FCC President Philip Bowring responded that the club's  decision to organize the screening was not a judgement of the  documentary's accuracy. Goldstein added that XINHUA was welcome  to send a representative to the screening to give China's  opinion. The officials took note of the offer but were  otherwise non-committal, he said.    On Wednesday, the Hong Kong Government's Television and  Entertainment Licensing Authority got involved, telling the FCC  by fax that it must get a permit before the showing. It has  never before made such a demand for FCC film or video  screenings, and Goldstein said the club would send a letter back  saying the requirement would be ignored.    Ironically, the authority's demand came the same week  Governor Chris Patten told a US press rights group, the Freedom  Forum, that his administration would fight "uphill and down  dale" for press freedoms ahead of Hong Kong's return to China in  1997.    Last month Beijing unsuccessfully put diplomatic pressure on  London to block the original British telecast of the  documentary, produced on the centenary of his birth, which  alleged that in his later years he consorted with young women.  Sino-British relations are already at a low point over Patten's  decision to press ahead with electoral reforms aimed at  extending local democracy ahead of 1997.    Hong Kong's biggest television station, Television  Broadcasts  Ltd., has acquired rights to the documentary, but has yet to say  when it will air it. The video was already shown to about 50  local democracy activists at a private screening last weekend,  with permission from the television authority.</p>

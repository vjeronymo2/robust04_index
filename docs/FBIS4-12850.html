			<p>BFN     [Text] It seems the honeymoon between the Paris-based  AL-MUHARRIR and the Iraqi authorities is over.    In a dramatic development, Iraqi authorities decided to stop  printing the paper in Iraq after it had been printed there for  more than three years. The authorities decided to ban the entry  and distribution of AL-MUHARRIR in Iraq after the Iraqi  Information Ministry decided to seal off the paper's bureau and  to ban its correspondent Akram Tahir Hassan from sending reports  to the paper.    AL-BILAD's information emphasizes that the latest Iraqi  measures have been taken against the backdrop of the radical  changes recently introduced by AL-MUHARRIR. The Iraqi  authorities stress that AL- MUHARRIR has come under the control  of the Gulf regimes, except the great shaykhdom of Kuwait.    The deviation of AL-MUHARRIR from Baghdad's line has  deprived  it from selling thousands of copies in the Iraqi market, which  are printed at the expense of the Iraqi people who are still  suffering from the second Gulf war and from famine that the Gulf  shaykhdoms are imposing in cooperation with the new world order.</p>

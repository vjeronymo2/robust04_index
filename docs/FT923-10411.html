			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Non-core businesses behind 5% fall at Lloyds Abbey Life LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 5 per cent fall in profits before tax, from Pounds 149.5m to Pounds 142m, in the first half of the year. Several group businesses were severely affected by the depressed housing market. Earnings per share declined from 15.9p to 13.9p, and the interim dividend is maintained at 6.3p. Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, pointed out that results were weakest in the non-insurance areas of the business, making an increase in the final dividend unlikely. The share price fell, against the market trend, from 355p to 345p, after 340p. Mr Alan Richards, analyst at James Capel, pointed to particularly disappointing results from the German subsidiary, where sales of Pounds 6.4m compared with Pounds 15m previously. He was also disappointed by the results of Abbey Life, the direct sales force-led life company, where regular premium sales dropped 5 per cent, and single premiums rose by 9 per cent. Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 4m (Pounds 15.6m) after increased bad debt charges of Pounds 55m (Pounds 46.3m). It was particularly affected by first and second mortgages. Commission and fee income at the Black Horse Agencies chain of estate agents fell from Pounds 36.7m to Pounds 33m. However, the core business of selling insurance products to Lloyds Bank customers maintained growth. Black Horse Financial Services, which sells life and pension products, increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m (Pounds 38.7m) and Lloyds Bank Insurance Services, which sells general insurance, increased its contribution to Pounds 28m (Pounds 25.6m). In March the group disposed of its Irish insurance subsidiary for its book value of Pounds 20.6m. Sir Simon said yesterday: 'Selling life assurance and general insurance products to customers of Lloyds Bank remains very much at the heart of our strategy and again we have achieved an increase in sales in both areas. The development of our bank related life business and that of Abbey Life, together with effective cost control in all of our businesses, are still our top priorities.'</p>

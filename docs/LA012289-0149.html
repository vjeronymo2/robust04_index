			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX OPEN GOLF TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> HOT STREAK PUTS CALCAVECCHIA IN A FAMILIAR SPOT  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, in the same situation a week ago, let a title get away from  him.  </P> <P> "I learned something last week," Calcavecchia said Saturday after his late  burst of 4 birdies and an eagle gave him a 3-stroke lead after three rounds of  the $700,000 Phoenix Open golf tournament.  </P> <P> "I was playing so good -- just like I am now -- and I got the lead going into  Sunday and I had the feeling inside of me that I was going to win," he said. "I  really expected to win. And I blew it.  </P> <P> "I'm going into the last round tomorrow with a different attitude out there,"  the long-hitting Calcavecchia said after his brilliant run had produced a  6-under-par 65 for a 54-hole total of 199 and a 3-shot lead.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to expect to win," he said. "I'm going to try to win. That's  different."  </P> <P> Calcavecchia was three shots off the pace when he went to the 13th tee and  began a birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie string that vaulted him into the  lead.  </P> <P> Gary Hallberg and Mark McCumber shared second place at 202 going into today's  final round.  </P> <P> Hallberg made a 50-foot eagle putt in his round of 66, and McCumber shot a 69.  </P></p>

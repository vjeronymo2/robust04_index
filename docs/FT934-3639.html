			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Management: Prognosis for sick pay - Last week's Budget should inspire companies to explore new ways of reducing absenteeism Managements in the UK last week were given the sharpest of nudges to look hard at their sick pay policies. The prompt came in the Budget announcement that the government plans to abolish the 80 per cent reimbursement of large employers' statutory sick pay costs from next April. While some companies may choose to cut their sick pay benefits, most will probably do as the chancellor suggested and use the removal of SSP as an incentive to improve their management of sick leave and to take greater interest in the health of their employees. At present employers pay SSP for up to 28 weeks to employees who are sick for at least four days in a row. Two rates are payable. Employees earning Pounds 195 a week or more are paid at a weekly rate of Pounds 52.50. Employees earning between Pounds 56 and Pounds 195 are paid Pounds 46.95 a week. These payments will from next April be borne entirely from the company's own resources, although overall the reductions in employers' national insurance contributions should more than absorb this cost. Smaller companies got a better deal in the Budget. In regulations to be laid after the passage of the Statutory Sick Pay bill, companies with annual National Insurance contributions of less than Pounds 20,000 will be able to recover 100 per cent of statutory sick pay after four weeks of an employee's illness. In practice most big companies top up statutory sick pay. Some have schemes which pay three months' full pay and three months' half pay. Better schemes tend to give six months' full pay and six months' half pay. Some companies have introduced incentive and bonus schemes to try to cut absenteeism from sickness, which cost UK business Pounds 13bn in 1992 according to a report published in May. The report, 'Too Much Time Out?' by the CBI in association with consultants Percom, said each worker lost an average of eight working days because of sickness in 1992, representing 3.5 per cent of working time. The absence rate was higher among full-time manual workers, who lost twice as much time as full-time non-manual workers. This discrepancy has led to difficulties in harmonising sick pay schemes at some companies. Traditionally, clerical staff receive full pay from day one when they take time off for sickness but unless companies have a top-up scheme, blue-collar workers are not compensated for the first three days of absence before they can draw statutory sick pay. British Gypsum, which harmonised its schemes in 1989, saw absentee rates rise from 4 1/2 per cent among manual workers to 14 per cent at some sites. The company reverted to two schemes. But it introduced an incentive element to allow manual workers to cross over to the clerical scheme after a five-month qualification period. If they are absent for no more than two periods totalling two days each they will automatically be taken on to the staff scheme. 'The idea is that we are working towards full harmonisation but it has been better to do it gradually,' says the company. Now overall absence rates are down to 3 1/2 per cent. Vauxhall, the UK car maker, has reduced its sickness absenteeism from 8.8 per cent in 1986 to 4.5 per cent today. This was after the company introduced a negotiated incentive scheme which saved employees about Pounds 4 a week in contributions to the company sick pay scheme if average levels of sick leave could be kept at or below 5 per cent. Iveco Ford in Slough introduced an incentive scheme two years ago after sickness absence levels among hourly paid workers had reached 7 per cent. The company set targets for reducing rates across the workforce which would trigger the introduction of sickness payments for the third, second and finally the first day of sickness. 'For the five months up to the end of November the rate has been 2.8 per cent so it is looking like we might make the target at the end of December when the rate is reviewed,' says John Eskdale, personnel manager of the company's industrial operations. 'The big test will come when we start paying day one.' Many personnel experts believe that discriminating between hourly paid blue-collar workers and salaried staff is increasingly difficult to justify. One of the best ways of producing immediate improvements, according to Angela Baron, a policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel Management, is for middle managers to monitor absenteeism. 'The experience of companies that have started monitoring sickness absence is that the very fact that they have started paying attention to it is enough to reduce the absence rates in their companies,' she says. Experts believe fear of unemployment has contributed to declines in absenteeism in the UK, but there is strong evidence that management action can deliver results. An Audit Commission study of 10 London councils in 1990 found sickness absence was averaging more than two and a half times the national norm. A follow-up report earlier this year found that by monitoring and managing absenteeism the councils had succeeded in cutting days off from an annual average of 16.7 days per employee in 1990 to 11.5 days in 1991-92. Many factors underlie improved absence records, but whether it is knowing that someone in management cares or fearing that they are watching, both approaches seem more effective than the alternative of managerial neglect. Judging by the Swedish experience, government action can also be a powerful stimulus. Removal of state sick pay for the first two weeks of absence in Sweden this year led to shortages of flu vaccine as companies clamoured to instigate vaccination programmes in order to keep down costs. Driven partly by the rapid growth in unemployment Sweden's absenteeism has fallen in three years from levels where three out of 10 workers were on sick leave at any one time to less than one in 10 today.</p>

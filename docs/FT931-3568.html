			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Politicians start feeling downside of family ties THE CLOSE-KNIT nature of the Italian family is proving to have some disadvantages as the reputations of politicians and businessmen become damaged by close relatives caught up in the scandals. Take the case of Mr Francesco de Lorenzo, a member of the Liberal party who resigned on February 19 as minister of health. That morning his 89-year-old father, Ferruccio, had been arrested on allegations that he received an illegal commission of L1.7bn (Pounds 741,000) for a series of property deals. Mr de Lorenzo owed his political career to contacts of his father in his political fiefdom of Naples. His father, a prominent Naples doctor, has been three times a parliamentary deputy, a former under-secretary of health and for years head of the national medical association. The allegations of corruption centred on the property purchases for the doctors' health insurance association which Ferruccio de Lorenzo headed. Although resignation is rare in Italian politics, Francesco de Lorenzo, as minister in charge of the medical profession, was left with little alternative. The activities of Mr Michele de Mita forced his well-known elder brother, Ciriaco, to resign from his key post as head of the joint parliamentary constitutional reform commission on March 2. This followed Michele's arrest in connection with an alleged foodstuffs fraud linked to the 1980 earthquake at Irpinia, southern Italy. Ciriaco, a former Christian Democrat prime minister and heavyweight on the left of the party, is the local potentate around Avellino, one of the areas most affected by the earthquake and where misuse of disaster relief funds has been most keenly felt. Others have been more fortunate in limiting the damage caused by the involvement of some family members with the law. Mr Bruno Tronchetti Provera, head of Mariani, a company involved in a consortium setting up a gas distribution network in Milan, was arrested for allegedly paying a bribe of L1.6bn (Pounds 697,000) to a Republican party politician. Although Bruno is brother of Marco, chief executive of Pirelli, and although Mariani is linked by shareholdings to the tyre group, the two have managed to stay separate. On the other hand the higher public profile of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, has also brought his links with the Socialists under scrutiny; and he has had to make very clear that his Fininvest is no longer involved in Milan property dealings. Mr Craxi, who risks losing parliamentary immunity to face charges of alleged corruption, never ceases to castigate the press and the magistrature for singling out his family for vilification. According to Mr Mario Chiesa, a Socialist party functionary and the first person caught in the scandal and to confess to Milan magistrates, he helped 'Bobo' (Bettino's son) into politics using funds illicitly collected from contract kickbacks. 'Bobo' has now withdrawn from politics. Stefania, Bettino's daughter, has been portrayed by the press as unfairly benefiting from her father's influence and the Socialists' control of the second state television channel to set up a TV production company. Mr Craxi is also foisted with the plight of his brother-in-law, Mr Paolo Pillitieri, former mayor of Milan, who faces charges of illicit party financing.</p>

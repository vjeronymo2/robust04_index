			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / French urged to adopt limited PR A FRENCH multi-party commission yesterday suggested introducing some proportional representation into the electoral system, which currently gives large parties the lion's share of seats in parliament, Reuter reports from Paris. But small parties with little or no parliamentary voice - the environmentalist groups Generation Ecologie and the Greens, the Communists and the far-right National Front - called for more radical changes. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister who appointed the commission last June to look into reform, noted that no changes would be made ahead of parliamentary elections in March. The report should become a reference work for any government wanting to resolve the ongoing debate on the electoral system, he added. The 19-member group of parliamentarians and legal experts suggested that one tenth of the 577 National Assembly members be elected by proportional representation. The remaining deputies would be elected by the current system - by which candidates go to a second, first-past-the-post round of voting if they fail to win an outright majority in the first. The current system means parties such as the combined ecology list, tipped by opinion polls to take as much as 20 per cent of the vote, could win just a handful of seats in March.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Argos exceeds expectations - Retailer takes Pounds 12.7m exceptional hit on Chesterman closure ARGOS, the catalogue retailer, tried to put the disappointment of the failure of its Chesterman furniture store venture behind it yesterday, and announced annual profits ahead of City expectations. Although the outcome for the year to January 2 of Pounds 52.9m pre-tax represented a 15 per cent fall from last year's Pounds 61.9m, it included operating losses of Pounds 6.2m from Chesterman and exceptional costs of Pounds 12.7m to cover its closure. Stripping out all the Chesterman costs, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 71.8m, up 12 per cent from a restated Pounds 63.1m last year. The shares rose 10p to 315p, as the City welcomed a 9.4 per cent increase in the total dividend to 7p via a final of 4.8p. Earnings per share, however, fell to 11.7p (13.9p) including the Chesterman losses and provisions. Turnover rose to Pounds 1bn (Pounds 926.6m), and although this was boosted slightly by a 53-week rather than 52-week trading year, Argos said the figure represented a 'significant improvement'. Like-for-like sales growth in the second half of the year was 3.1 per cent, giving a total of 1.8 per cent for the year as a whole. Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said the improvement reflected management initiatives taken in the last two years, including integrating its superstore and traditional store catalogues, and abandoning its experimental limited-range Best Seller stores, converting them into traditional showrooms. 'The improved sales trend from the second half of last year has continued into the first quarter of this year. But it is too early to talk of a real recovery,' Mr Smith said. Textiles and DIY sales declined due to a reduced textiles range and the decision not to match the heavy discounting of other DIY retailers. But there was significant growth in the furniture range, as well as jewellery, watches and clocks. Many analysts upgraded their forecasts for this year's profits from the Pounds 72m to Pounds 75m range to Pounds 80m or more, but some said the closure of Chesterman might lessen the group's appeal to investors. 'These were good figures, there's no doubt about it,' one analyst said yesterday. 'But to us they fit in the worthy but dull category.' See Lex</p>

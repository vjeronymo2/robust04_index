For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a fee does not fail to qualify as a periodic fixed fee as a result of a single incentive award provision under which compensation automatically increases when a gross revenue or expense target (but not both) is reached if that award is equal to a single, stated dollar amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 80 percent periodic fixed fee arrangements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At least 80 percent of the compensation for services for each annual period during the term of the contract is based on a periodic fixed fee.

The term of the contract must not exceed 5 years, including all renewal options. The contract must be terminable by the governmental persons upon reasonable notice at the end of the third year of the contract term, without penalty or cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Per-unit fee arrangements in certain 3-year contracts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the compensation for services is based on a per-unit fee or a combination of a per-unit fee and a periodic fixed fee. The contract has a term, including renewal options, that is not longer than 3 years. The contract must be terminable, by the governmental person on reasonable notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the second year of the contract term. The amount of the per-unit fee must be specified in the contract or otherwise specifically limited by the government person or an independent third party, such as the administrator of the Medicare program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Percentage of revenue or expense fee arrangements in certain 2-year contracts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All the compensation for services is based on a percentage of fees charged or a combination of a per-unit fee and a percentage of revenue or expense fee. During the start-up period, however, compensation may be based on a percentage of either gross revenues, adjusted gross revenues, or expenses of a facility. The contract must have a term, including renewal options, that is not longer than 2 years. The contract must be terminable by the governmental person on reasonable notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the first year of the contract term. This paragraph (c)(3)(v) applies only to contracts under which the service provider primarily provides services to third parties (for example, radiology services), or service contracts involving a facility during an initial start-up period for which there have been insufficient operations to establish a reasonable estimate of the amount of the annual gross revenues and expenses (for example, a contract for general management services for the first year of operations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No related parties or common control.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service provider must not have any role or relationship with the governmental person that, in effect, substantially limits the governmental person's ability to exercise its rights, including cancellation rights, under the contract.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Strugovets: ``Is the Ocean the First To </F> Perish?'']    [Text] The first dumping of radioactive waste (RAO)  in the seas was performed by the USA in 1946 in the northeast  part of the Pacific Ocean, at a distance of 80 kilometers from  the coast of California. Since that time, the World Ocean has  become truly a storehouse of spent nuclear raw material...    Great Britain has dumped three-fourths of all the  world's RAO into the ocean, performing 34 burials of solid  radioactive fuel in 15 sites in the North Atlantic, The Minch,  the Bay of Biscay and in the region of the Canary Islands in the  period from 1949 through 1982. The mass of dumped containers  comprises 74,052 tonnes, with an overall activity of 949 kCi  [kilocurie].    The disposal of liquid RAO from atomic industry enterprises  by means of dumping through pipelines into the Irish Sea was  also widely practiced in England. And this too was a  considerable amount. From 1974 through 1982 the waste products  dumped annually exceeded an overall activity of 100 kCi. The  total scope of the dumping was so great that its effects were  seen as far as the Barents and Karsk Seas.    The Netherlands, in the period from 1967 through  1982, had 14 cases of RAO dumping at four sites in the North  Atlantic at a depth of 3,200 - 5,200 meters, with a mass of  19,162 tonnes and overall activity of 9.1 kCi.    France has had two cases of dumping RAO into the  Atlantic Ocean. The mass of dumped waste comprised 14,299  tonnes, with activity of 9.54 kCi. In 1979, waste from nuclear  enterprises was dumped into The Minch.    Switzerland has dumped RAO 12 times in the period  from 1969 through 1982 at three sites in the North Atlantic. The  mass of the materials dumped comprised 5,321 tonnes, and their  overall activity was 119 kCi.    The USA, in the period from 1949 through 1967, has  dumped 34,282 containers of RAO with overall activity of 79.4  kCi at 11 sites in the Atlantic. In the period from 1946 through  1970 it dumped 560,261 containers with overall activity of 15  kCi at 18 sites in the Pacific Ocean.    Moreover, during the period of operation of the nuclear  fleet, the U.S. naval forces have lost two nuclear  submarines--the ``Thresher'' (April of 1969) and the  ``Scorpion'' (May of 1968). Together with the first nuclear  submarine alone, there turned out to be around 270 kCi in  fission products at the bottom of the ocean. Plus the loss of a  number of nuclear weapons.    Japan performed dumping of RAO into the Pacific  Ocean near its shores in 1956-1969. It performed 12 disposal  operations at six sites, dumping 3,301 containers with overall  activity of 0.416 kCi.    Belgium has dumped RAO 15 times, in The Minch and  the Bay of Biscay, disposing of 55,324 containers with overall  activity of 57.24 kCi.    This list is rounded out by Germany, Korea, Italy, New  Zeleand and Sweden, through whose efforts the overall activity  of RAO dumped into the World Ocean has been brought up to 1,240  kCi. This, we will emphasize, is without taking into  consideration the waste from plants processing nuclear fuel,  lost nuclear weapons and other sources of ionizing radiation,  sunken nuclear submarines and radionuclides which have found  their way into the ocean as a result of underwater nuclear  explosions. However, a number of specialists maintain that the  real number is somewhat higher. Yet the main mass of radioactive  waste--over 98 percent--is buried in the Atlantic Ocean.    We will note that in recent years, as a result of the sharp  criticism of this practice, all the states have reduced or  discontinued altogether their dumping of RAO into the seas. Yet  in spite of this, they have reserved the right to dump  radioactive waste in the World Ocean. In Great Britain and  France the possibility of step-by-step dumping of RAO into the  sea has been officially granted--by the Convention on Protection  of the Marine Environment in the Northeast Atlantic--until the  year 2018.    And what about Russia? Or more precisely, the USSR, since it  is specifically from it that we have inherited the problems of  dumping radioactive waste in the seas.    And so, the first dumping of RAO in the USSR was performed  in  1959 and was associated with the testing of nuclear submarines  and the nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin.'' In September of that  year, 600 cubic meters of waste with overall activity of 20 mKci  were dumped into the White Sea. In 1960, 100 cubic meters of  liquid RAO with overall activity of 200 mCi were dumped from the  nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin'' near Gotland Island (Gulf of  Finland). That year marked the beginning of the practice of  regular dumping of liquid radioactive waste, and 1964 marked the  start of dumping of solid RAO into the northern and far eastern  seas.   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-006-49A>           Graphic </FIG>       Let us begin with the North. According to the report by the  governmental commission on questions concerning the dumping of  radioactive waste at sea, in the northern region of the USSR,  and now in Russia, there are four regions for dumping liquid  radioactive waste and disposal of solid radioactive waste. These  are located generally north of the 72nd parallel and west of  Novaya Zemlya. These regions were selected by the staff  headquarters of the Northern Fleet in 1960-1966 and approved by  the Naval Fleet Main Staff Headquarters. Up until 1986, the  Murmansk Steamship Line also performed such dumping of RAO in  the regions designated for the Northern Fleet.    The dumping was extremely non-uniform, and the maximal  values  of activity were noted in 1965 (northeastern part of the Barents  Sea, around 1,000 Ci), in 1975 (central part of the Barents  Sea--800 Ci and Karsk Sea--8,500 Ci), in 1988 (northeastern part  of Barents Sea, around 5,300 Ci), and in 1989 (as a result of  the accident of the nuclear submarine at Ara-guba, 2,000 Ci).    In a breakdown by seas, the level of overall activity is  distributed as follows: Baltic--0.2 Ci, White--100 Ci,  Barents--12,153 Ci, Karsk--8,500 Ci. On the whole, it is 24 kCi.    Is this a lot?    For comparison we may cite the following fact: Studies  performed by a scientific expedition in 1985-1986 showed that  the underwater current of the Gulf Stream in that year alone  from the North Atlantic--the site of constant dumping of RAO by  Great Britain and France--has brought us radioactive waste with  overall activity of around 24 kCi. As much as we dumped in the  northern seas over a period of 30 (!) years.    The Far Eastern region. Since 1966, the USSR performed  dumping of RAO in the Far Eastern seas in 10 regions. The  greatest amount of radioactive waste (by volume) was dumped near  the southeastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula. And the  greatest amount by overall radioactivity was dumped into the Sea  of Japan. The maximal amount of dumping in terms of  radioactivity occurred in 1975 and 1985-1987. The overall  radioactivity of the RAO comprised 18,565 Ci.    In the opinion of specialists, considering the huge water  area in the Far Eastern region, the RAO dumped by the Pacific  Fleet comprises no more than a few percent in the balance of  anthropogenic radioactive pollution, and therefore cannot cause  an ecological catastrophe. This is true in full measure also of  the Fall (1993) dumping of RAO by the ships of the Pacific  Fleet. ``The dumping in the Sea of Japan in October,''  emphasized the head of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Ecological Safety  Main Administration, Viktor Kutsenko, in a speech presented at a  recently held ``roundtable'' on problems of dumping RAO in the  seas, ``posed no danger to the environment. And subsequent  dumping, which will be practiced in this region until the end of  next year, will also not pose a hazard. We may even not consider  this waste as being radioactive.''    Nevertheless, according to Kutsenko himself, an ecological  threat really does hang over the Far East. But the reason for  it, as it turns out, is not the radioactive waste which has been  dumped into the sea, but that which is being stored in special  tankers of the Pacific Fleet. This problem is confirmed also by  specialists at the VMF Glavkomat [Naval High Command]. In the  opinion of one of them, Captain 1st rank Yevgeniy Romanov, the  TNT-5 and TNT-27 industrial tankers loaded with liquid  radioactive waste are in such a poor technical state that they  may sink at any time. Then the huge concentration--several  hundred cubic meters--of radioactive waste would really cause a  catastrophe. In order to avoid this, the decision was adopted to  begin dumping in the water basin of the Sea of Japan. The  dumping, I repeat, is caused by technical necessity. And even if  under the pressure of the world community we will have to  discontinue such actions in neutral waters, the specialists at  the VMF Glavkomat will insist on at least one-time dumping  within the limits of Russian territorial waters.    Of course, the dumping of radioactive waste in the World  Ocean cannot continue for long. Yet today, practically in the  entire world, the technology of processing radioactive waste  lags behind the demands. Here in Russia, one other problem is  added to this. Despite the fact that we possess sufficient  scientific and technical potential to create the necessary  conditions for processing liquid RAO into solid and for its  subsequent disposal, we cannot take serious steps forward due to  the shortage of finances. And a significant amount of these will  be required. According to preliminary estimates, around 10  billion rubles (R) would be needed to solve the problem of  radioactive waste in the Pacific Fleet. In the Northern  Fleet--approximately half that amount would be needed. For a  full resolution of the problem in the country--several hundred  billion rubles would be needed, and with application of Western  technologies--several hundred million dollars.    However, it is erroneous to think that this problem is  Russia's alone. The World Ocean is the cradle of life on the  planet, and all countries which consider themselves civilized  must apply their efforts to keep from destroying it.</p>

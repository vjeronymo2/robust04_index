			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg, May 5 SAPA -- Tokyo Sexwale gained  real political prominence ironically with the death of his  friend and colleague Chris Hani after the assassination of the  South African Communist Party's secretary general on April 10,  1993.    Pictures of Mr Sexwale weeping over the lifeless body of  Hani  flashed across the world and in many ways the days to follow  would gain him much support of the militant youth mourning their  leader Chris Hani.    Himself a former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] cadre Sexwale joined the African  National Congress underground structure in the 1970's and in  1975 he went into exile to undergo military training in the  Soviet Union, specialising in army engineering.    He returned to South Africa in the late seventies and was  arrested after a run-in with the South African security forces.    Together with 11 other activists he was charged with  terrorism and conspiracy to overthrow the government -- and he  was convicted and sentenced to 18 [years] imprisonment at Robben  Island maximum prison in 1978.    He served 13 years of his term before he was released in  1990  in terms of the Groote Schuur agreement between the government  and the ANC.    Four months after his release he was elected to the  Executive  Committee of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region.    In October 1991 he was elected as chairperson of the region  -- a post to which he was re-elected three times.    In 1994 he was elected unopposed and also stood as the ANC's  candidate for the PWV premiership in the April election.    Mr Sexwale was born on March 5, 1953 in Johannesburg where  he  lived and attended school in Soweto until his matriculation at  Orlando West High School.    He was also a member of the Black Consciousness Movement in  the late 1960's and seventies.    Mr Sexwale enjoys reading and listening to music and when  time permits watching soccer and playing tennis. He is also a  keen chess player -- although he claims he always loses.    He is married to Judy whom he met while on Robben Island.  They have three children.</p>

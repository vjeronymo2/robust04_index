			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 2ND MISTRIAL IN '82 MURDER CASE  </P> <P> A second mistrial was declared today in the case of a British citizen charged  with murdering four members of a Northridge family who disappeared in 1982.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin declared the mistrial after ruling that  Deputy Public Defender Mark Lessem had a conflict of interest and could no  longer represent Harvey Rader, 47.  </P> <P> The conflict involved a key prosecution witness, Robert Williams, who had  recently been represented in a drunken driving case by the public defender's  office.  </P> <P> Chirlin declared the mistrial on the second day of Rader's second trial.  Rader's first trial ended in a mistrial Aug. 31 after a Superior Court jury  deadlocked 11-1 to convict him in the murders of Israeli immigrant Shlomo  Salomon, 35; his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and  Mitchell, 9.  </P></p>

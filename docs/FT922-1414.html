			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Court authorises multiple professional practices - European Law Last week, the European Court of Justice added another judgment to those already guaranteeing the rights of EC professionals to operate in more than one Community country. A Luxembourg law preventing foreign doctors, dentists and vets from practising in Luxembourg, if they already do so in another EC country, was condemned by the ECJ as infringing the Rome Treaty rules on establishment and free movement of employees. The EC Commission brought infringement proceedings under its general Treaty enforcement powers against the Luxembourg law's blanket ban on foreign doctors, dentists and vets establishing secondary practices or accepting additional employment in Luxembourg. While the law recognises the freedom of foreign professionals to provide cross-border services, only Luxembourg professionals enjoy the limited exceptional rights to have second practices. This case reinforces the fundamental rights under the Rome Treaty of businessmen and professionals to establish or accept employment in more than one member country. Luxembourg argued that doctors, dentists and vets could not provide an adequate service to the public unless they operated from a single practice and were constantly available. The Court rejected Luxembourg's attempts to justify the restrictions on health and public policy grounds because other measures were available to safeguard these interests which interfered less with basic Treaty rights. For example, a 24-hour service could be guaranteed through substitutes and temporary employees rather than by a professional being on permanent call. Other professions, such as lawyers and accountants, may now be better placed to resist protectionist pressures from certain EC countries. Professionals may rely on the protection of the ECJ to operate from secondary offices or accept employment while maintaining their original establishments. Case C-351/90, Commission v Luxembourg, ECJ FC June 16 1992 Jurisdiction in non-contractual product liability cases In a decision that may limit the possibilities for plaintiffs to shop around for the best forum in which to bring product liability claims, the ECJ clarified the meaning of 'contractual matters' in the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments. The Court held that proceedings brought by a sub-buyer against a manufacturer do not concern 'contractual matters' when the goods subject to the proceedings alleged to be defective and unfit for their purpose were bought from a party other than the manufacturer in a chain of contracts. The question of interpretation arose in a damages action brought in France by a French plaintiff against a German manufacturer and French seller of a suction system bought to be attached to two metal polishing machines purchased from a Swiss company. The plaintiff claimed damages against all parties on the basis of alleged breaches of French health and safety at work rules and on the ground that the goods were unfit for the purpose for which they were bought. The French court ruled that while it had no jurisdiction over the Swiss company it did have jurisdiction over the German manufacturer and French seller under the Brussels Convention. The ECJ made what is known as an 'autonomous' interpretation of the Brussels Convention provisions, applying the interpretative approach laid down in previous cases. It interpreted the special rules for 'contractual matters', which allow a defendant to be sued in the place where the contract was to be performed, in accordance with the Convention's fundamental objective of ensuring legal certainty for business in the jurisdiction. The ECJ said that even though under French law the plaintiff was entitled to sue in the French courts, this deprived business of the legal certainty assured by the Convention's general rule that a defendant must be sued in the country of his domicile, unless one of the Convention exceptions applies. In the case of dispute between a manufacturer and a sub-buyer of his product, there is no direct contractual relationship. For this reason alone, the Court found the dispute could not benefit from the special jurisdiction rules applicable to 'contractual matters' because there was no obligation freely entered into between either party. The other reasons given by the ECJ for rejecting the broader interpretation, advocated by the Commission in its observations, illustrate the significance the decision may have in product liability disputes. First, the ECJ said that in a chain of international contracts, the contractual obligations accepted by a manufacturer in his agreement with the purchaser are not necessarily the same as those that the purchaser may agree with his own customer. Second, the principle of judicial protection of parties established in the Community excludes an interpretation of the special jurisdiction rules which deprives the defendant of certainty as to which court he may be sued in other than a court of his domicile. Finally, in the vast majority of member countries, including the UK, the liability of a manufacturer to a sub-buyer for defective goods is a tortious or non-contractual liability. Case C-26/91, Societe Jakob Handte et Cie GmbH v Societe Traitements mecano-chimiques des surfaces, ECJ FC June 17 1992. Looking Ahead The ECJ and the CFI will begin the summer vacation on Friday July 10 1992. In the next three weeks, several judgments are expected as the judges try to clear their desks, including decisions on tachographs in the UK and an appeal in a competition case involving fur breeders. Advocates General's opinions are also due in the first week of July in the Woodpulp and UK Sunday trading cases. On July 1, the first day of the UK presidency of the Council of Ministers, the oral hearing in the British drinking water case will take place in Luxembourg.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  suspend this year's "Team Spirit," the annual South Korean-U.S.  joint military exercise, as soon as the two Koreas meet on  exchanging special envoys at 10 AM Thursday (KST), officials  said. The inter-Korean contact is one of two preconditions for  the announcement on Team Spirit's suspension. The second is the  arrival in Pyongyang of International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) inspectors.    Last Saturday, Pyongyang agreed with Washington to allow  unrestricted IAEA access to its seven declared facilities and to  accept Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on an  exchange of presidential envoys. In return, Washington was to  suspend this year's Team Spirit and conduct high-level talks  with North Korea later this month.    The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension  of  the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North  Korea cooperated with the IAEA's nuclear inspections and agreed  to hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday.  But since North Korea postponed the contact until Thursday,  Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers'  suspension.</p>

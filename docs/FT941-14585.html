			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Impolite in the pub but fine on the train With an estimated one in 20 people now in possession of a mobile telephone, the network operator Cellnet yesterday attempted to address the urge felt by the remaining 19 to place the nearest mobile, if not its user, under the wheel of a passing bus. Mobile telephone etiquette, Cellnet recognises, is an underdeveloped field. In a booklet entitled Mobile Manners, Cellnet says: 'Many of the nuances of contemporary politeness - eating peas off the back of a fork, sending thank you notes, not smoking while eating - are steeped in a long tradition. The owner of a mobile phone who wishes to use it considerately and thoughtfully will be negotiating relatively uncharted territory.' Do not, Cellnet advises its customers, stop in the middle of the pavement to speak on your mobile. Switch off your telephone while at the theatre. Cellnet believes the rudeness of mobile users has been exaggerated. 'How many people can honestly admit to having heard a mobile phone go off in a restaurant?' Probably about 19 out of 20. But Cellnet, clearly with an eye to ensuring its customers remain in sufficiently good health to pay their bills, does have definite views about receiving calls in a pub. 'Best to switch off,' it says. So much for etiquette. The rest of the guide peddles the advantages of the mobile, as well as encouraging behaviour calculated to incite the squirting of Superglue on telephone earpieces. Persuading train travellers to retire to the connecting space between carriages before using their mobiles would have been a substantial contribution to the new etiquette. Instead, Cellnet trills: 'On British Rail, the mobile phone is accepted as the ubiquitous business accessory. As the train cruises effortlessly through the countryside, receivers chirrup gently, business people thrash out sales figures with those back in the office, examine financial projections and verbally re-run the previous night's inter-departmental football match.' And ignore fellow shoppers' glares as you phone home from the checkout queue to make sure you have remembered everything. 'They're waiting for the cashier to give them a 10 pence piece in their change so they can join the queue for a payphone.'</p>

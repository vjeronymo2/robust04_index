			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, some governments are taking steps to enhance their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines' position both by restricting the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new, competitive services and by trying to overcome, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government fiat, their carriers' cost disadvantages that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it difficult for them to compete against U.S. airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a free market. These efforts underlie many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disputes we face in international negotiations today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such countries are responding to the highly competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated and global air transportation market, in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their airlines may not be fully prepared to compete. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign airlines are only beginning to adapt to the more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive operating environment through such mechanisms as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streamlining costs and realigning their operations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve greater productivity and operating economies. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state-owned airlines, privatization is an important initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> step as it will lead those airlines to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-efficient operations and, in the longer term, to expand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their markets. These governments also may be reacting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S. airlines' recent operating successes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international aviation market, which are largely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the U.S. airlines' productivity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive gains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some national governments continue to give their national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines financial aid. Some also distort the marketplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by permitting their national airlines to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground-handling and other monopolies, by denying airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to necessary airport facilities, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by allowing user fees that equalize cost differentials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between carriers. These actions distort competition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deprive the aviation system and consumers of the benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that greater cost efficiency and lower prices would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage. In the long run, these efforts will work against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overall best interest of the world economy. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will be unsuccessful in providing long-term protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the developing global aviation systems because no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual government can control all facets of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines' marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have outlined above our expectations about the future of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the world air transportation industry and the role of U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines. We expect that international operations will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depend more on traffic flows from multiple countries. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light of our goals, recent developments in the market and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, and the positions and actions of our trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partners, we have designed our international aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy to meet the following objectives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increase the variety of price and service options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enhance the access of U.S. cities to the international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air transportation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide carriers with unrestricted opportunities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop types of service and systems based on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of marketplace demand: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _These opportunities should include unrestricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights for airlines to operate between international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gateways by way of any point and beyond to any point,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the discretion of airline management. Carriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be able to pursue both direct service using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own equipment and indirect service through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial relationships with other carriers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Service opportunities should not be restricted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any manner, such as restrictions on frequencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity or equipment, so that carriers may provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of service commensurate to market demand;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Carriers' ability to set prices should also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrestricted to create maximum incentives for cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiencies and to provide consumers with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of price competition and lower fares;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _These opportunities should apply not only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled services, but also to cargo and charter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities, because of their growing importance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the world's economy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Ensure that competition is fair and the playing field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is level by eliminating marketplace distortions, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as government subsidies, restrictions on carriers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to conduct their own operations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground-handling, and unequal access to infrastructure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, or marketing channels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Encourage the development of the most cost-effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and productive air transportation industry that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best equipped to compete in the global aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace at all levels and with all types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Infrastructure needs should be addressed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary regulatory barriers eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Privately held airlines have better incentives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce costs and respond to public demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as we have in the past, we will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supportive of governments wishing to privatize their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines so that their privatization efforts will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reduce barriers to the creation of global aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems such as limitations on cross-border  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments wherever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

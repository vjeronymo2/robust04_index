			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Showcase concerts for the BBCSO THE BBC Symphony's contribution to the Barbican's tenth-anniversary celebrations on Wednesday was to invite Pierre Boulez to conduct a showcase concert of Birtwistle, Stockhausen, Berio and his own music. All the composers have been the subjects of the BBC's winter series at the Barbican, which have become such a valuable fixture in the Centre's calendar; only Henze (featured in 1991, but a long-time Boulez bete noire) was missing from the roster. The concert was a typical Boulezian occasion. If the new Welsh National Opera Pelleas gives glorious evidence of the ever-deepening command of his interpretive powers, the performances here, with the BBCSO more willing and responsive to his direction than they ever appeared to be when he was their chief conductor, were a reminder that he still has no equals in the contemporary repertory. In Birtwistle's  ..agm .., of which he gave the first performance in Paris in 1979, the raw power and primitive lyricism of the score were made more pungent than ever before, and the case for the work as Birtwistle's finest achievement for the concert hall seems increasingly unanswerable. The programme ended with Berio's Sinfonia, which Boulez marshals and controls with enormous virtuosity, drawing out the luscious textures with magical clarity, making the famous collage movement an orchestral as well as a a compositional tour de force. Electric Phoenix were the vocalists, as deft as any incarnations of the Swingle Singers ever were. It was prefaced by a playback of Stockhausen's Gesang der Julinge, now sounding distinctly low-tech and drily pointilliste, yet somehow retaining its freshness intact. A distinguished occasion; they really don't make many contemporary-music concerts as good as this nowadays. A week earlier the BBC Symphony appeared with David Atherton in the Festival Hall for an accomplished double-bill of rarely heard Stravinsky ballets - an invigorating coupling of near-masterpieces, Orpheus from 1948 and Persephone, written to Andre Gide's text in 1933. When so scrupulously prepared and loving detailed, they are shown off to best advantage, and the neglect of Persephone in particular seems hard to understand. Caught on the cusp between the last rites of Stravinsky's neoclassicism and his rebirth as a serialist, Orpheus remains problematic, but the earlier work is a rich repository of finely-tuned gestures, a dictionary almost of Stravinsky's vocabulary of classical myths. In it one recognises many of the turns of phrase from other contexts - the choral implorations of Oedipus and its menacing ostinatos , the elegant cadences of Apollo - yet in Persephone they seem not at all tired or recycled but gain a fresh purity and directness. The solo tenor in the role of Eumolpus was John Aler, effective and unflashily rhetorical; the Persephone was Laurence Bouvard, who delivered the lines with an easy fluency which by-passed all the usual problems of making melodrama work.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETIN-A STUDY POINTS TO COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS  </P> <P> Preliminary results of the largest study of its kind have confirmed that the  active ingredient in Retin-A, the controversial anti-aging drug, can produce  modest cosmetic improvements in sun-damaged or aged skin, UC Irvine researchers  said Monday.  </P> <P> In the first six months of a two-year study, 68% of 657 patients nationwide  showed some improvement with wrinkles or sunspots using an emollient cream with  .05% retinoic acid (tretinoin). A control group showed only 38% improvement.  </P> <P> "This statistically significant dif ference reflects modest changes for the  average patient," said Gerald Weinstein, professor and chairman of dermatology  at UC Irvine College of Medicine. Weinstein presented the results Monday at the  annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Although the study proves that the tretinoin cream does have an effect, the  product will not replace plastic surgery, Weinstein said. The study was  sponsored by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which manufactures Retin-A.  </P> <P> Retin-A, federally approved only for the treatment of acne, has been prescribed  by some dermatologists for cosmetic improvement.  </P> <P> Retin-A, which usually has an alcohol base, produces temporary skin irritation.  Researchers had hoped that the cream used in the study would reduce that, but  90% of the patients studied reported some skin irritation, Weinstein said.  </P> <P> Previous reports on the beneficial aspects of tretinoin from the University of  Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan studied groups of only 48 and 30,  respectively. Their studies used a higher concentration of the drug and showed  greater improvement.  </P> <P> UCI is one of nine centers nationwide participating in the two-year study.  </P></p>

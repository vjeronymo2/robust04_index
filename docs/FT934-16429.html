			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Telefonica 'may lose 25% of home sector' TELEFONICA, the Spanish telecommunications company, stands to lose about 25 per cent of its domestic market within the next four years under new liberalisation guidelines, according to a report on the sector presented yesterday by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. British Telecommunications, which has formed an association with Grupo Santander, the Spanish banking group, will be bidding for a data transmission licence later this month, and at least three Spanish consortia, linked with international operators, are in the running for cellular telephone licences. These will be awarded by the government in the second stage of the deregulation process early next year. Price Waterhouse forecasts that independent companies will gain 15 per cent of the data transmission business, up to 50 per cent of the cellular telephone sector and up to 55 per cent of the value added network services that are currently provided by Telefonica. The businesses that are being opened to competition represented just 1 per cent of Telefonica's revenues in 1990 but had grown to nearly 15 per cent of the company's turnover by last year. Voice transmission and the basic Spanish network, which accounted for 82 per cent of Telefonica's revenues in 1992, will not be deregulated until 2003.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States and North Korea have resumed a  full-scale contact and have begun to iron out their differences  of opinion.    In a response to a message sent by Kang Sok-chu, North  Korean  vice foreign minister and chief of North Korean delegates to  U.S.-North Korean talks on 19 April, it was learned in the  United States that U.S. delegation head Galluci delivered a  reply to the North side last week.    The two sides exchanged basic proposals regarding the mutual  practice of additional inspections and high-level U.S.-North  Korean talks. It was learned that the two sides will begin  full-scale working negotiations to reach an agreement on these  items within this week.    A well-informed source on the nuclear issue said that North  Korea withdrew its previous stance stating it has kept all the  agreements reached with the United States by disclosing that it  was compelled to break the agreement last month because of a  precondition that the special envoys of the North and South  should be exchanged. The source said that this hints at a  positive change in the North Korean stance.    It was also learned that the United States, through  Gallucci's reply, informed the DPRK of its stance over the  suspension of Team Spirit and high-level U.S.-North Korean talks.</p>

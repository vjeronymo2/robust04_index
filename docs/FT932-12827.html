			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Radiation safety limits tightened LOWER LIMITS for the level of radiation that workers and the public can be exposed to are fixed today in a comprehensive set of standards from the National Radiological Protection Board. The guidelines are a response to revised estimates of fatal cancer cases among survivors of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. These showed that radiation risks were two to three times higher than previously believed. The recommendations are expected to make most impact on medical X-rays, the main source of man-made radiation exposure. Mr Geoffrey Webb, the board's secretary, says his target is to reduce average radiation doses by half over the next few years by persuading hospitals to avoid unnecessary X-rays and to reduce the level of each exposure. The guidelines provide a basis for new UK and European Community regulations to control radiation exposure. The maximum permitted annual dose is cut from 50 to 20 millisieverts for a worker and from five to one millisievert for the public. UK industry already complies with the new guidelines 'with very few exceptions', said Mr Webb. The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria 'should be able to comply, although it comes pretty close to the new limits,' he said. Occupational, Public and Medical Exposure.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / EU censured by carmakers over safety research Leading European carmakers yesterday accused the European Commission and EU governments of failing to meet financial and strategic planning obligations under an eight-year Ecu900m (Pounds 710m) collaborative research programme. The Prometheus research programme aims to halve the EU's 50,000 road deaths a year by 2010 through the greater use of in-car electronic information systems and other technological developments. Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot chairman, and Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, managing director of Fiat and president of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, warned that unless Brussels and the 12 EU member states made better progress in creating common standards and electronic languages for such items as roadside beacons transmitting information to receivers in vehicles this goal would be threatened. In addition, technology developed by Europe's vehicle and component manufacturers would be overtaken by the Japanese and North American motor industries. Also at stake were tens of billions of Ecus, which business loses every year through delays, wasted man-hours and other costs, industry leaders said. The warnings came at a Paris conference and exhibition at which 90 cars and commercial vehicles fitted with the technology developed under the programme, which started in 1986, were demonstrated. The cars could: illuminate long distances in the dark with infra-red and ultra-violet headlights; automatically avoid collision with radar; cruise 'intelligently' by automatically keeping pace with vehicles in front; stay within white lines, thanks to computer image processing; know exactly where they were on the Paris road network via satellite; and summon emergency services to the exact location of a breakdown or accident with or without any driver action. Mr Calvet and Mr Garuzzo sharply criticised 'budgeting problems' in Brussels and national governments, which have led to the 20 vehicle and component makers within Prometheus funding 70 per cent of the research programme.</p>

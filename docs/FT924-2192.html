			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Japanese Bonds: Tankan prompts hope of rate cut HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate re-emerged on Friday following the release of the latest tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business confidence. The report made it clear that the Japanese economy is facing one of the most severe post-war downturns. It could well prompt a further fall in short term money market rates and a steepening of the yield curve. The yield on the No 145 10-year government bond closed at 4.595 per cent on Friday. With most bond market participants on the sidelines ahead of the year-end, the yield has ranged between 4.58 per cent and 4.63 per cent over the past month. The central bank's report indicated that business confidence among 6,874 businesses fell to a 16-year low, with confidence among manufacturers falling to minus 44, its lowest level since 1976, and non-manufacturers minus 27, down from minus 13 in August. The sluggish economy was confirmed in third-quarter GNP figures announced earlier this month. Japan's economy fell an annualised 1.6 per cent from the previous quarter. Traders point out that while the next cut for the official discount rate is already discounted in bond prices, the move could prompt a rally in response to hopes of a further credit easing. Although the Bank of Japan denies the possibility of an imminent discount rate cut, some investors remain hopeful the central bank may repeat last year's move, when it eased credit on December 30. A further fall in short term rates would be favourable for the long bond market, and for corporate issuers, who need to raise funds as equity-linked bonds, launched at the peak of the market, come to maturity. Mr Marshall Gittler, fixed income analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, says institutions are facing a problem in finding low risk high yielding instruments to place funds, causing a lack of investors willing to sell. On the middle to longer term, however, a deluge of corporate issues could pose problems over the next year, where some Y10,000bn of equity-linked issues are expected to mature. Corporate registrations for issuances within the next two years with the Ministry of Finance have risen to around Y7,000. Most companies seem to be waiting for interest rates to bottom, and investors may face a surge in new issues during the first and second quarters of next year. According to Merrill Lynch, Japan's private sector debt is currently equal to over 200 per cent of GDP and the net return on capital is around the lowest level for ten years. Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan is expected to keep rates low to maintain low-cost short term financing.</p>

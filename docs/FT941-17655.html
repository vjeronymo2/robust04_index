			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Long View: The big dash from cash Remarkably powerful bullish forces have been gripping the London stock market during the past few weeks, climaxing in Wednesday's 50-point post-Christmas Footsie surge. It looks as though the coming year will see share prices sliding back after attaining a formidable peak; but although we are in dangerous territory the power of cash flows will not dissipate quickly. From the middle of last year the UK securities markets became strongly affected by investment flows from overseas, notably from the US where pension funds and mutual funds have been energetically diversifying around the globe. The recent renewed upsurge, however, has primarily domestic origins as the remorseless declines of inflation and short-term interest rates have generated panic buying of longer-term securities. The cash flow transformation was highlighted by the institutional investment statistics that came out last week. They suggested that UK institutional cash flows will have exceeded Pounds 50bn for 1993. In 1994 the total might easily be Pounds 60bn or more. Twelve months ago, institutional inflows did not appear likely to exceed about Pounds 35bn in 1993. But net issues of gilts were set to be well over Pounds 40bn and domestic equity issues by companies (including privatisations) also looked likely to have a bumper year (in the event, some Pounds 15bn net has been raised). The sums did not add up unless improbably large amounts were contributed from abroad and by personal investors. Well, improbably or not, the money arrived on a more than adequate scale. And now the prospective balance has been completely altered. In 1994 the government is expecting to borrow less than Pounds 30bn through net gilt sales, while corporate equity issues are, if anything, likely to be smaller in total than in 1993. Therefore a big surplus of cash will be seeking a longer-term home, a prospect that has sent long gilt yields tumbling well below 6 1/2 per cent this week. The desperate dash from cash is creating a financial asset price bubble in the UK, as future streams of income are radically repriced. A consequence is likely to be an increasingly rapid spillage of investment money overseas; moreover, foreigners will be taking profits and seeking less overvalued markets. In order to generate these outflows we should expect UK bond yields to go lower than US and most Continental European bond yields (while sterling will become weak). The UK is in the process of a normalisation of its savings markets after two decades of high inflation, high nominal interest rates and a distorted yield curve. In those conditions there was a concentration of wealth in equities, owner-occupied residential houses and short-term savings deposits, and an aversion from long-term fixed interest contracts. But in conditions of low inflation and a yield curve which may soon be running from 4 1/2 to 6 per cent the existing asset mix has become inappropriate. The danger is that although individual savers will see clearly enough that savings deposits are unattractive they will be drawn out of habit into equities (and, soon, residential property) rather than bonds which are still not a familiar or trusted form of investment for British savers. At a guess Pounds 50bn, maybe more, has to come out of short-term savings accounts over the next two or three years. Theoretically this could be achieved by refinancing a large chunk of the mortgage industry through the securities market. But unless savers can be persuaded to buy building society bonds there could be a crisis: equity valuations will be pushed to freakish levels while house buyers will continue to pay unduly high loan rates. Already the dividend yield on UK equities has been pushed down to 3.3 per cent, not far from the 3 per cent level which several times in the past (most recently in summer 1987) has marked danger point. At least, in 1987, dividends were rising fast. It is curious that over the past three years the All-Share Index has soared by 64 per cent while dividends in aggregate have risen not at all. Company profits are rising steadily, but in several recent cases they have disappointed expectations. In 1994 the British economy will have to tread a tightrope if it is not to upset investors - expanding rapidly enough to generate adequate profits growth but not so fast as to cause the government to panic about renewed inflation and raise interest rates again in a way that would burst the bubble. Still, this is how it seemed in the US a year ago, and the American economy - to Wall Street's relief - somehow managed to stay on the wire. Yet Britain's economic prospects are opaque, largely because of the dubious quality of the statistics. According to the latest figures, third quarter growth in GDP year-on-year was 2.1 per cent but 1992's GDP has been revised upwards, so that growth is 2.8 per cent on the basis of what was initially reported for 1992. Moreover the Treasury claims that underlying trend growth is 3 per cent; if you believe this, then because unemployment is falling actual growth must surely be higher than that - say, 3 1/2 per cent. On a more pessimistic basis you can argue that if the stated 2 per cent growth is pushing down unemployment the underlying growth of capacity cannot be more than about 1 1/2 per cent in which case the Treasury's projections for higher tax revenues and lower Budget deficits over the next few years will be blown spectacularly apart. Of course, the unemployment figures could be completely misleading anyway . . . What we do know about 1994 is that a great deal of money will be on the move and that much of it will be invested at the wrong price. We are in the late, panic buying, stage of the equity bull market which is likely to peak during the coming year. For the time being it may be painful to be out of the market, but UK equities are now only for the brave and nimble.</p>

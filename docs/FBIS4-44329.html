			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, has started his official visit to Spain with  an audience with King Juan Carlos. Elizabeta Gojan reports from  Madrid.    [Gojan] [passage omitted] Spain's interest in the peaceful  reintegration of the occupied Croatian regions, the situation in  the area, Croatia's contribution to the ending of the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aid extended by the European Union and  Spain to the concrete implementation of the agreement on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation -- these subjects were discussed  this afternoon by Minister Granic and Javier Solana Madariaga,  his Spanish counterpart.    [Begin recording] [Solana, in Spanish with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] As far as the Croatian regions  under Serb occupation are concerned, the Spanish side will meet  again this summer with high-ranking Croatian officials.    We wish to agree on influencing a possible renewal of the  mandate of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] before the autumn  session of the UN General Assembly.    Spanish-Croatian relations have significantly improved,  although they were not all that good in the past.    [Granic] Despite the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, there have  been no further negotiations with the Serbs. On the contrary --  the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are being practically integrated  into Serbia economically. Croatia refuses to accept this.  Croatia will try -- in a peaceful and diplomatic way -- to  resolve the issue of the reintegration of our occupied regions  by requesting the help of the European Union and the UN General  Assembly and Security Council.    As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, Croatia upholds  the Washington agreement and the Bosnian-Croat Federation --  including the future confederation between the Muslim-Croat  Federation and the Republic of Croatia -- as well as the Contact  Group's efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution. [end  recording]    [Gojan] The two ministers signed the first agreements  between  their two countries on road traffic and cooperation in the area  of tourism. [passage omitted]</p>

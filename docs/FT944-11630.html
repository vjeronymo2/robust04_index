			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Islamic activists shoot Pakistan deputy dead Islamic activists in north-western Pakistan, agitating for the enforcement of Sharia laws, shot dead a ruling-party member of the provincial parliament yesterday, government officials and witnesses said, Reuter reports from Peshawar. Mr Badiuzzaman, a North West Frontier Province Assembly deputy and a member of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, had been killed in the town of Mingora, said an official in the provincial capital, Peshawar. Doctors said an Islamic activist had also been killed and at least six people wounded in gunfire in the town. The armed Islamists had occupied several government buildings since Wednesday and taken several government officials hostage. They had also besieged the home of Mr Habibur Rehman, the provincial sports minister, and stopped him leaving to address a rally, witnesses said. Masked activists were roaming the streets, checking vehicles for police or militia. Groups of armed men took positions on nearby mountains to stop security forces entering the town. Some activists also occupied the control tower at the nearby airport, forcing a halt to flights. The agitators are members of the hardline Tanzim Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi (TNSM), which has campaigned for months for enforcement of Sharia Islamic law in the predominantly tribal Malakand Division area. Shortly after yesterday's shooting, provincial Chief Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao announced Islamic laws for the area would be published within a week and Sharia courts set up within a month. A provincial government spokesman called the agitators 'miscreants'. The government was taking every step to curb their activities, he declared, but did not elaborate. Government officials said paramilitary forces were heading for the area. Last May, at least 10 TNSM protesters were killed in a battle with paramilitary forces when the organisation assembled an estimated 25,000 tribesmen to press their demand. The demonstrators dispersed after the authorities issued a notification agreeing to their demand. But the TNSM said the Islamic law had not been enforced. F L Smidth, the engineering division of the Danish company FLS Industries, has won a DKr740m (Dollars 125m) contract to build Pakistan's largest cement mill with an output of 5,500 tonnes a day, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen. The order was placed by Chakwal Cement Co, with financing raised locally and a share issue managed by Union Bank of Switzerland. The plant, due to come on stream within three years and sited 100km south of Islamabad, is the sixth complete cement plant F L Smidth has sold to Pakistan since 1990.</p>

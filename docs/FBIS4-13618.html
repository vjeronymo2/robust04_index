			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sarah Honig] </F>   [Text] Former Health Minister Hayim Ramon will be formally  expelled from the Labor Party at midweek, it was decided at  yesterday's session of the Labor Political Bureau, prior to the  meeting of the Labor ministerial caucus.    Along with Ramon, MKs [Knesset Members] 'Amir Peretz and  Shmu'el Avital will also be expelled for joining Ramon in his  independent Histadrut [Labor Federation] list, challenging the  official Labor list.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday for the first time  put  his full political weight against Ramon, who was the minister  closest to him until recently, and who engineered Rabin's own  1992 electoral victory.    By doing so, Rabin staked his own political reputation  against Ramon's in what is expected to be a bitter,  no-holds-barred battle by Labor to retain its Histadrut hegemony.    Rabin told the political bureau members that there is "no  room for considering pros and cons and for making political  calculations. The party constitution could not be clearer.  Anyone who is a Labor member but nevertheless runs against a  Labor list in any election, is automatically ousted from the  party. We are dealing with the basics of democracy."    "The party conducts primaries and if some of the members  don't accept the results of a democratic vote, then they can  potentially wreck the entire democratic framework. They can  cause this party to crumble from the inside. There comes a time  when there are phenomena no party can tolerate. Party members  cannot both campaign against their own party and at the same  time continue to belong to it," Rabin argued.    Ramon is expected to formally submit his Histadrut list to  the elections committee tomorrow, though he has until the  Wednesday deadline to do so. The minute his candidacy is filed,  procedures in Labor will begin to expel him and his two allies.    Yesterday's ministerial caucus and bureau session marked the  total failure of the party moderates to prevail upon Rabin not  to ban Ramon, Peretz, and Avital just yet.    One argument was that Ramon's list might win, or at least be  able to form a coalition, which would oust Labor from its  73-year Histadrut hegemony, in which case it would do well for  Labor to claim Ramon as one of its own.    Another argument was that even if Ramon is expelled from the  party, he and his friends could still remain in the Knesset  faction, as the Knesset rules do not address themselves to a  situation in which a party expels a member, but only to walkout  scenarios.    Rabin was warned that if Ramon is expelled from the Knesset  faction as well, this could set a precedent for those who oppose  the government's dovish line in the peace talks. But Rabin, say  sources, not only refused to be swayed by these arguments, but  maintained that Ramon must be harshly dealt with as a deterrent  to other would-be "troublemakers."</p>

"This will have far-reaching consequences, because it is  clear now that it is the Muslim side which does not want peace.  The formal justification for the sanctions was the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus, the sanctions can no longer remain in  place, because the Serb side has demonstrated the maximum degree  of cooperation and its wish to achieve peace," Krajisnik  stressed.

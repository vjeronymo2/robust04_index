			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 'TIME TED BUNDY PAID FOR CRIMES,' FLA. GOV. SAYS, SIGNS DEATH WARRANT  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Martinez signed a new death warrant today for mass murderer Ted Bundy,  who lost his bid to have the Supreme Court overturn his death sentence for the  slaying of a 12-year-old girl.  </P> <P> "Justice has been on hold for a decade," the governor said after Bundy's final  appeal was rejected, "and it's about time Ted Bundy paid for his crimes."  </P> <P> Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die at 7 a.m. next Tuesday for the murder of  Kimberly Diane Leach, whose sexually abused body was found in a pigsty two  months after she disappeared. Bundy, whose case was the subject of a TV  miniseries, also received death sentences for the 1978 slayings of two Florida  State University sorority sisters who were beaten and strangled just three  weeks before the Leach murder.  </P> <P> Bundy also is suspected in the deaths of up to 36 other women, most of them in  the Pacific Northwest.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB;  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> Well, my triple streak ended at one in a row when none of my horses in the  seventh, eighth and ninth races could find the winner's circle, so it cost me  $20 of my bankroll.  </P> <P> However, I am going to stick with the triples, making a $15 bet on Warrior and  Circumsteller in the first to Ono Gummo and Superbe King in the second to Fire  Back in the third and a $10 straight triple Warrior-Ono Gummo-Fire Back.  </P> <P> Bob's Thursday Bankroll $1,921  </P> <P> Thursday's Loss $20  </P> <P> Current Bankroll 1,901  </P> <P> Break up the computer! For the fourth Thursday in a row and the fifth day in  the last six, the computer continued its winning ways, netting a $70 profit  from its $100 wager on Putting ($3.40) in the fifth.  </P> <P> For today, the computer will bet a $40 exacta from Tasteful T.V. to Dame  Rousara in the seventh and a $20 exacta reversing the two.  </P> <P> Computer's Thursday Bankroll $1,629.50  </P> <P> Thursday's Profit $70  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $1,699.50  </P></p>

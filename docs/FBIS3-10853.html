			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special NOTICIAS correspondents from Santiago, Chile] </F>   [Text] The United States has asked Paraguayan President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy to be "prudent" in handling peasant  problems, bearing in mind recent social outbursts in the  continent, as in the Mexican region of Chiapas. During his  meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for  inter-American affairs, Wasmosy acknowledged the situation but  at the same time lashed out at peasant leaders, stating that  they spend their time blocking roads but do not plant a single  square meter of cotton. Watson also asked the Paraguayan  Government to explain why U.S. troops and materiel were not  allowed to enter Paraguay.    The U.S. Government is closely following recent problems  with  Paraguayan peasants. These problems are a source of some  concern, given the social outbursts that have taken place in  Latin America, namely in Santiago del Estero Province in  Argentina, in Chiapas Province in Mexico, and in some Central  American nations to a lesser degree.    Assistant Secretary Watson clarified certain controversial  items that had caused some tension in Paraguayan-U.S. relations,  asked President Wasmosy for caution and prudence in dealing with  the demands of Paraguayan peasants, and advocated dialogue and  consensus between the parties involved.    Wasmosy admitted that the high-ranking U.S. official had  indicated that the peasant problem should be handled very  carefully, and reported that he explained to Watson that the  people blocking roads were not exactly peasants. "I told him  that the people who are blocking the roads are leaders who have  not planted any cotton themselves. There are, however, some  peasants who -- because of low productivity -- will not be able  to recover from three years of bad crops, even if the price of  cotton hits 850 guaranies per kilogram," Wasmosy said.    Wasmosy also reiterated his pet argument that in the  framework of a free market economy it was not up to the  government to set the price of cotton.    Asked about the U.S. reaction to the conditions that the  Paraguayan Government had set to admit U.S. troops, Wasmosy  answered that the doors are open to any joint exercise with the  Paraguayan Army and civilians, "provided it does not violate any  constitutional principles. I believe that we made this very  clear and he (Watson) was very satisfied," Wasmosy added.    President Wasmosy stated that the U.S. State Department  official wanted to know firsthand the official report on the  aborted military operation that the United States had asked to  be allowed to conduct in the area of San Pedro. It would seem  that Watson listened to this report carefully, as it may have a  bearing on any further U.S. military assistance to Paraguay.    Watson also reiterated that the U.S. Government is still  concerned over the evidence it has that Paraguay continues to be  a key link in regional drug trafficking. "I told him that we  need help, training, and resources, to fight drug trafficking,"  Wasmosy said. He emphasized that Washington's envoy heard out  the concerns of the Paraguayan Government and will relay them to  the appropriate U.S. drug enforcement officials.    Together with the other chiefs of state who have arrived in  Santiago, Wasmosy went to Valparaiso at noon on 11 February to  attended President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle's installation.    President Wasmosy will return at approximately 1500 local  time today together with OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente  Baena Soares. There is no official information on the agenda of  Baena Soares in Paraguay.</p>

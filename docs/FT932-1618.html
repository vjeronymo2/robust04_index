			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Lloyd's reserves rise sharply THE CAPITAL base of Lloyd's of London has been dented by the insurance market's record losses of Pounds 2.91bn, but a strong increase in the reserves held to pay future claims mean that the deterioration has been less marked than feared. Overall net assets fell to Pounds 6.09bn as at the end of December 1992, from the previous year's Pounds 6.54bn. The fall in the assets held by Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, was compensated for by a rise in the size of the central fund, which meets claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations, along with an increase in other reserves. Members' means declined from Pounds 7.30bn in 1991 to Pounds 6.38bn. These include so-called 'funds at Lloyd's' (deposits, personal reserves and special reserves) and other members' assets. The net assets of the central fund increased to Pounds 1.15bn from Pounds 445m. Net assets of the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administrates and regulates the market, fell from Pounds 263m to Pounds 252m. Premium income - after brokerage and commission - amounted to Pounds 6.4bn in 1992, compared with Pounds 5.01bn in 1991. An increase from Pounds 7.82bn to Pounds 10.85bn in reinsurance premiums paid by syndicates to close their 1990 year of account also helped swell income in the premium trust funds. Overall the US, Canadian and sterling premium trust fund plus some other monies held by Lloyd's to meet claims grew to Pounds 16.66bn from Pounds 12.26bn. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 2,915m was made up of losses of Pounds 1,328m (Pounds 2,063m in 1991) from business underwritten in 1990 and a further Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 396m) in reserves to pay future claims on business underwritten in earlier years. Personal expenses of Pounds 457m (Pounds 292m) include a levy of 1.66 per cent from each Name's 1990 premium income limit credited to the central fund. Provisions for current and future liabilities rose to Pounds 18.25bn from Pounds 13.72bn. Of the 388 syndicates trading during 1990, 115 produced a profit after personal expenses. The burden on Names of the special levy led to a sharp increase in market costs to Pounds 1.43bn from Pounds 921m. Syndicate expenses fell marginally to Pounds 671m from Pounds 673m. Names' subscriptions fell from Pounds 55m to Pounds 51m, central fund subscriptions from Pounds 62m to Pounds 4m, and agents' fees rose Pounds 2m to Pounds 129m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karl F. Wentzel: "Trees in Germany Dying Earlier </F> and Earlier; The Forest Supervisor: Now Beeches and Oaks Are  Hit"]    [Text] Tomorrow Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert will  present the eleventh report on conditions of forests. Last  year's report, with a slight increase of noticeable leaf loss by  2 to 3 percent, so far marks the climax of all studies. It is  noteworthy that the trend of damage continues from coniferous to  deciduous forests.    If one wants to know more, one must relate all foliage  findings between 1983 and 1993 to the up-to-date air quality  measuring results and compare those data to the research  findings and forestry experience of pollution effects. That  leads to the following conclusions:    --German forests have significantly sparser needles or  foliage than 15 years ago. One of every four trees shows a drop  in foliage of over 25 percent, thus being in damage categories  II to IV. Until 1985, this applied only to coniferous trees; now  it applies to almost all types of trees.    --Needle loss and treetop thinning occurred even centuries  ago near metal works and, since 1850, also in large areas of  industrial regions. But this old damage has disappeared in West  Germany since the building of high smokestacks as of 1964, and  the 1983 order on high capacity furnace installations.    --The large-scale forest death since 1960 at altitudes above  700 meters in the Erz, Iser, and Riesen Gebirge, caused by high  sulfur dioxide pollution, has spread in west Germany only to  border areas near the former GDR (Harz Mountains, Fichtel  Gebirge). In the area it is confined to the regions of the large  brown coal power stations in Saxony and Bohemia.    --In the eleven previous and present reports on forest  conditions, the emphasis of top thinning has shifted from  coniferous to deciduous trees. In 1983, it reached a first high  watermark with 23 percent of fir and pine trees, dropped to 14  percent by 1989, and then rose again to 24 percent by 1992. In a  scissor movement, defoliation of beech and oak trees rose from  11 percent (1984) to 32 percent (1992).  <H3>  "But the Forest Will Not Die as Long as Foresters Nurture it  Expertly" </H3>   --This change in vulnerability of tree types can only be  explained by the drastic change in air chemistry, i.e., the  increase in nitrogen compounds and ozone with a simultaneous  decrease in sulfur dioxide.    --For all types of trees, strong defoliation independent of  the pollution type is concentrated in forests over 60 years old;  in many forests it then intensifies to the dying of shoots and  treetop deformation, and finally ends in premature death of the  most sensitive individual trees and gradual forest dissolution.  Thus air pollution leads to early aging and senescence. Science  calls this `senescence acceleration.'    --The same trend is also indicated by the scarcely  acknowledged experiences registered again and again by some  50,000 foresters of Central Europe in their daily on-site work  in the less foliated and sometimes prematurely dying forests.  But wherever, however long, and however intensively pollution  has damaged forests and soils:    A new greening or reforesting of the areas is possible, even  with the highest soil acidity;    Ground vegetation becomes more profuse, thereby in many  places becoming an increasingly bigger obstacle to reforestation.    The analyzed facts and findings make clear that the present  widespread forest diseases are caused primarily by microchemical  interference with the metabolism of leaf organs. Acid rain also  leaches vital nutrients from the leaves and soil. Climatic  changes, weather extremes, and pests can also accelerate the  premature decay of the forest.    In regions particularly exposed to pollution, forests have  hardly any prospect of reaching the forestry-desired age (on the  average, firs reach the age of 100, oaks that of 180 years).  After 40 years of professional work on recognition, effect, and  prevention of pollution damage to forests, I consider "the age  loss" of trees the worst effect of the new, far-flung air  pollution on forestry and land culture. But the forest will not  die as long as foresters nurture it expertly, fertilize it  purposefully, and reforest immediately--be it the case after  only 60, or after 180 years.  <H5>  The Professor: Damage Through Environmental Protection </H5>   The environmental protection of past years has hurt rather  than helped the forest. That is the claim of Professor O.  Schenck, founding director emeritus of the Max Planck Institute  for Radiation Chemistry in Muelheim/Ruhr. His accusation: Since  the mid-1950's, filter installations increasingly hold back flue  ashes and flue gases--because they are considered pollutants  under the federal pollution protection law.    But the dust contains useful substances vital for trees:  minerals such as lithium and fluorine, sodium, potassium and  calcium, iron, phosphorus--and above all magnesium. It forms the  central atom of the green pigment, chlorophyll. For instance, if  magnesium is lacking, the leaves turn yellow.    Every year, 125 kilograms of Sahara dust fall on every  hectare of southern Italy. The minerals contained therein  neutralize the sulfurous gases emitted by the volcano, Mt. Etna.  In Germany, the annual amount of dust is 25 kilograms per  hectare. Observations in the surroundings of cement factories  showed: After filter equipment was installed, soil acidity  increased noticeably. Because: The emissions of sulfur dioxide  were not reduced to the same degree. So the percentage share of  sulfur increased in the air. Today, the proportion is about 1:8.  The smaller amounts of dust no longer suffice for complete  neutralization. As a consequence, acid rain results.</p>

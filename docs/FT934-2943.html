			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt gains despite profit-taking Bourses added to recent gains, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT paused to draw breath with the DAX index closing the official session 27.67, or 1.3 per cent higher at a new closing high of 2,175.80; but this incorporated an Ibis-indicated rise to 2,165.95 at Wednesday's post-bourse close, and followed a further gain to around 2,181 in the pre-bourse yesterday. It was followed, furthermore, by a fall to 2,162.90 yesterday afternoon. Turnover rose from DM10.4bn to DM11.8bn. Mr Werner Kahs at Bak Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that after the pre-bourse surge, profit-taking came in from London and kept gains among most senior blue chips within bounds. The best rises, he said, came among second line blue chip stocks. In banks, Berliner put on DM16 to DM462 on the official session, and Bayernverien DM10.50 to DM579. One of the biggest gains in the second-string blue chip category came in Schering, recovering from a flat day on Tuesday, and reflecting a dividend increase from DM13 to DM14.22 which, for German shareholders, would offset a reduced tax credit on dividend income. The shares rose DM39 to DM1,124. Volkswagen fell from a pre-bourse DM429 to a post-bourse DM423.50 after the carmaker said that it would post a 1993 group loss of DM2.3bn, following a DM2bn loss forecast late in November. ZURICH remained in record territory with liquidity continuing to be attracted by the outlook for interest rates, although an element of caution was noted ahead of Sunday's Russian election and the outcome of the Gatt talks. The SMI index rose 14.6 to 2,858.4, with the market also awaiting today's statement from the Swiss National Bank on the monetary outlook for 1994. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications company, surged SFr85 or 7.8 per cent to SFr1,170 as reports emerged that Mr Leonardo Vanotti, the chief executive, was about to be replaced. Sandoz bearers rose another SFr40 to SFr3,930, profiting from planned and realised options issues, together with this week's positive corporate announcements. Sulzer certificates added SFr18 to SFr792 on rumours of a forthcoming strong buy recommendation. A SFr100 rise to SFr3,950 by Electrowatt was attributed to positive press comment. MILAN was heartened by the success of the Credito Italiano privatisation and the Comit index rose 10.81 or 1.9 per cent to 584.27. Credito added L77 or 3.3 per cent to L2,435: the public offer of 840m shares was six times subscribed and closed two days early. BCI rose L269 or 5.7 per cent to L4,990 as the government pressed for its privatisation to be brought forward to February from April. CIR added L100 or 6.8 per cent to L1,575 in response to AT&amp;T's sale of its remaining 10.1 per cent stake. AMSTERDAM advanced into record territory during the session before a dull opening on Wall Street made investors more cautious. The CBS Tendency index ended off 0.4 at 140.4, having edged forward to 141.7. Royal Dutch was a big influence on the broad market, dipping Fl 4.70 to Fl 196.00 as the pice of crude continued to soften. Hoogovens added 10 cents to Fl 44.70 after announcing that unions had agreed a pay freeze for 1994/1995. PARIS inched forward with the CAC-40 index closing 6.09 ahead at 2,211.40. Turnover was FFr4.8bn. Trading in Rhone-Poulenc was halted briefly late in the session owing to extremely high volume in the stock. The shares closed 60 centimes higher at FFr150.1 with some 1.7m shares changing hands. Euro Disney came back into the news on reports that US hotel chains were to build accommodation near the resort, undercutting prices there. The shares dipped FFr2.15 to FFr34.80. STOCKHOLM noted another decline in Ericsson B shares, which closed off SKr25 at SKr331. The Affarsvarlden general index ended up 1.2 at 1,360.4. Turnover was SKr2.5bn. MADRID improved higher following its closure for public holidays earlier this week. The general index put on 3.17 to 308.09 in turnover of Pta30bn.

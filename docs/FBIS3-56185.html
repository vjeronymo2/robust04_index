Over the period 27 December through 4 January inflation was  6.3 percent. Such a high level for a week's inflation has not  been noted since the start of September 1993. Over the past  week the greatest increase was for tariffs for paid services to  the population -- nearly 18 percent. Food increased 7.4 percent  in cost while the smallest increase -- 2.4 percent -- was for  nonfood goods.    Last week differences in inflation rates for individual  economic regions of Russia was 5 percentage points. The biggest  inflation index was noted in the Central Chernozem region --  108.7 percent. An equal level of inflation (6.8 percent) was  recorded in the Central and West Siberian regions in which the  biggest price increase was observed for paid services to the  population -- 41 and 24 percent respectively. Inflation was  lowest in the Far East region -- 3.7 percent.    Over the past week prices for basic foods increased 7.4  percent. A higher weekly increase in food prices was last noted  only in early 1993. Over the past week eggs continued to  increase in cost more than other foods observed -- by 8.3  percent. Prices increased 6-7 percent for bread articles and  dairy products and vegetables and 5 percent for meat products  and fruit. Vodka increased in price most markedly -- by nearly  20 percent. At the same time prices for sugar did not change  over the week while fish products, vegetable oil, groats, and  pasta became 2 percent more expensive.    Over the past week there has been a considerable increase in  prices for food in unorganized trade -- 10.3 percent (6.7  percent in organized trade). Meat products increased most of  all in price on the markets over the week -- by 14 percent --  after having increased in price more slowly over the past four  months than prices for food as a whole. Over the week prices  for dairy products and vegetables increased 11-12 percent and  prices for fish products and flour increased 8 percent. In  unorganized trade, prices for vegetable oil, sugar, groats, and  pasta remained at virtually last week's level.    In the majority of economic regions prices for food goods at  the markets increased more rapidly than in organized trade. The  biggest differences were noted in the Central Chernozem and East  Siberian regions.    The average cost of a selection of the 19 most important  foods as of 4 January was R32,400 in monthly terms and increased  5.4 percent over the week. The cost of this election at  organized trade prices was R30,500 (an increase of 3.4 percent  over the week, R44,200 at unorganized trade prices (11.1  percent). The relationship between the prices in unorganized  and organized trade was a factor of 1.4 times.    The gulf between the maximum and minimum cost of the  selection in various cities of Russia increased to 3.9 times in  early January.    The Far East region remains Russia's most expansive region  (R57,700) and includes the most expensive cities -- Magadan  (79.9 percent), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (74.3 percent), and  Vladivostok (73.1 percent)    Among the Russian cities the selection increased most in  Saratov -- 25 percent.

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Del Monte Royal Foods beats first-year forecast with R208m Del Monte Royal Foods, established in October 1992 with the acquisition by Anglo American and the Imerman family of Del Monte Foods International (DMFI), has beaten maiden profit forecasts in reporting distributable profit of R208.5m (Dollars 60.9m) equivalent to 61 cents a share, and declaring a 21 cents a share total dividend. At the time of the acquisition, the group estimated first-year earnings of 60.1 cents a share and a total payout of 20 cents. Previous year figures are not comparable as they pre-date the transaction, but the group - owner of the Del Monte brand in Africa, the Middle East and Europe - bettered its forecasts only through unexpected reductions in its interest bill and tax liability. Mr Vivian Imerman, chairman, said a South African Reserve Bank ruling prevented disclosure of company details in the past year, but he hoped the release of new information would bolster the group's stock market rating in London and Johannesburg. He said the key to future earnings growth would be the development of new Del Monte and private label products, licensing agreements, and new market penetration in Europe and Asia. Adverse currency movements, particularly the devaluation of the Italian lira, and tough trading conditions associated with recession in Europe, responsible for 80 per cent of sales, depressed turnover which at R1.28bn compared with a forecast R1.82bn. Mr Enrico Sola, chief executive officer, said consumer spending was on the slide in most of the group's main markets. However, Mr Sola said Del Monte had maintained its share of the premium brand market, without cutting prices, as the proliferation of cheap brands and private label lines affected rival products. Pre-tax profit stood at R233.3m, well below the forecast R331.5m. Net interest payments of R32.2m were half the group's forecast reflecting lower interest rates in Europe and South Africa as well as a windfall gain from the strengthening of the financial rand through which DMFI was acquired, against sterling. The exchange rate gain cut the payment price by R192m to improve the debt-to-equity ratio and lower finance charges.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (11): Big four forge path to profits - Christopher Brown-Humes on prospects for the country's leading forestry companies FINLAND'S four big listed forestry groups have forged a path back to profitability despite high debt loads and the ravages of a severely depressed market. The turnround in their fortunes has driven Finnish forestry share prices sharply higher over the past 12 months. United Paper Mills (part of Repola), Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla expect to make a profit in 1993, after bouncing back into the black at the four-month stage. Kymmene will make a loss although it will be far lower than the FM1.36bn deficit sustained last year. Relative positions are outlined in more detail below: Market position: With so many factors in common, the performance of the four groups is being differentiated both by the extent of their exposure to the most depressed segments of the market and by the scope of their activities in France, Germany and other hard currency countries. Kymmene loses out on both scores: it is Europe's leading producer of fine paper, where overcapacity is particularly serious, and 50 per cent of its paper is produced abroad, mainly in hard currency countries. UPM has 30 per cent of its production abroad, with about half its newsprint capacity based in French and UK mills. Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit are less internationally-orientated: Enso has a fine paper mill in the Netherlands and a board mill in France, but these account for less than 10 per cent of production. More stable market segments have afforded some protection. Tissues have helped Metsa-Serla - it has 45 per cent of the Nordic market - and it has a strong position in corrugated board in Finland, Denmark and Greece. UPM has benefited from its paper converting, speciality papers and board activities while Kymmene has been helped by its plywood operations. Results: Nearly all divisions will be profitable in 1993. Kymmene, Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit will all see a loss from their fine paper divisions. Enso and UPM say that their pulp divisions will also record a deficit. Investments: Enso-Gutzeit has invested more actively than its rivals in the past 12 months. It bought 100,000 hectares of forest from Ahlstrom for FM926m; acquired Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe for FM3.6bn (including debt); and said it will build a DM800m newsprint plant, based on recycled paper, in eastern Germany. These moves will lift turnover from FM10.3bn in 1992 to an estimated FM17bn in 1995. Net debt will rise to FM13bn. A project to build a FM3bn pulp mill at Rauma in eastern Finland has been drawn up by Metsa-Botnia, a joint venture between Metsa-Serla, UPM, and Metsaliitto, but financing has still to be finalised. Annual production will be 500,000 tonnes a year, but it is unlikely to be in operation before 1996-97. Debt reduction: The four companies are highly geared and all have given debt reduction a strategic priority. Lower interest rates, positive cash-flow, reduced investment programmes, and, possibly, new share issues will all help achieve this aim. Exploiting strong international investment interest in Finnish forestry, both Metsa-Serla and Repola have launched successful share issues this year. Metsa-Serla raised FM543m (Dollars 100m) through an offer of 3.25m new shares while Repola raised FM445m by offering 8m shares held by subsidiaries. Mr Harry Piehl, Kymmene chief executive, speaks for many companies when he says: 'We can keep our investments low without sacrificing our future,' reflecting the huge modernisation programmes which Finnish forestry groups carried out in the late 1980s. Ownership: The ownership bases of the four companies are distinct and relatively stable. A spree of foreign buying in the last 12 months, following the devaluation of the markka and the removal of foreign ownership restrictions at the start of this year, has increased foreign share ownership. One big chunk which could find its way to the market at some stage is Metsa-Serla's 21 per cent stake in Repola, the hangover of an abortive bid in 1990. It has a current market value of around FM2.8bn, compared with a book value of FM2.1bn. Mr Timo Poranen, Metsa-Serla chief executive, says the stake is not 'essential for our co-operation' with UPM (in wood procurement and marketing) but says Repola is seen as a good investment. The Finnish government is also looking at ways to reduce its stake in Enso-Gutzeit, which, directly and indirectly, amounts to 58 per cent of the shares and 78 per cent of the votes. Jaakko Poyry, the international consultany group, and Goldman Sachs have been retained to advise on how the sell-off can be accomplished and over what period. The most likely development is a step-by-step reduction of the state's holding over the next few years. Market outlook: High export rates make Finnish forestry groups highly dependent on developments in countries where they sell. With the main European market expected to remain weak again next year, executives are cautious about predicting anything more than a modest upturn. 'Demand is growing slowly for all paper grades in central Europe because of very slow GNP growth,' says Mr Juhani Pohjolainen, executive vice-president of Enso-Gutzeit. However, the picture is brighter in south-east Asia, and in the US and Latin America. Most executives feel prices for fine papers and pulp are unlikely to fall further, but they warn that overcapacity will only fall away slowly. 'Low pulp prices are a disaster,' says Mr Poranen of Metsa-Serla. 'Weak pulp prices are behind weak paper prices. It is in everybody's interest that we have higher pulp prices.'</p>

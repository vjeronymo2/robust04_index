			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Political Notebook: Inelegant and inevitable U-turn made on Bosnia Two weeks ago the message was crystal clear. Britain had provided more than its fair share of ground troops for Bosnia. If the United Nations needed additional forces then it would fall to others - most notably the US - to do their bit. Just seven days ago the consensus within the cabinet remained opposed to reinforcing the 2,000-strong British contingent in the former Yugoslav province. Mr Douglas Hurd said so in untypically blunt terms in a newspaper article. Now the government has reversed itself. It has decided it must lead the international effort to give General Sir Michael Rose the additional 10,500 soldiers he wants to police the growing number of ceasefires in Bosnia. The cabinet is expected to approve later today the despatch of another 1,000 or so British soldiers. A few other countries will commit extra troops. But by its own yardstick the British government will be doing a great deal more than its fair share. It has been an inelegant U-turn. It is fraught with political risks. If there is anything approaching a consensus on the Tory backbenches it is driven by the instinct that Britain should avoid deeper military entanglement. Nor has the shift been without critics in the senior ranks of the government. No one in the cabinet - from the prime minister downwards - has been an enthusiast for an enhanced military role. But over recent weeks four distinct camps have emerged. One, led by the prime minister, has been convinced by the case for more muscular action on the ground to accompany the latest drive for a political settlement. A second, including Mr Hurd, has gradually aligned itself with that view. Mr Malcolm Rifkind has headed a third group of more cautious ministers arguing against extra troops until a broad political deal has been struck. Finally, Mr Kenneth Clarke and, to a lesser extent, Mr Michael Heseltine have put the case against further military involvement in almost any circumstances. The balance of power has been shifting constantly. But since Friday - when Mr Major took a decision in principle to commit extra troops - the initiative has passed decisively to the interventionist camp. The most important element in the change of heart was the pledge offered to Mr Major by President Bill Clinton to maintain US pressure on the Bosnian Moslems to reach a political settlement. With the Russians applying similar pressure on the Serbs and the Germans on the Croats, that held out a reasonable prospect of an eventual end to the civil war. It offered also a not-to-be-missed opportunity to draw a line under the acrimonious disputes with Washington that have poisoned British-American relations for more than a year. The change in the international environment coincided with the success of General Rose in gradually extending the ceasefire in Sarajevo to other areas. That in turn opened up the possibility of a 'bottom-up' peace process - with a series of regional truces providing additional momentum towards an overall settlement. Britain could hardly jeopardise the process for the sake of a few hundred troops. But the clinching factor in the new equation was the demand by General Rose for additional British troops. Though he couched his public demands in terms of the UN, he left no doubt that his first priority was for additional experienced British soldiers. Ministers, who had consistently stated that the government's military strategy would be guided by the commanders, could hardly ignore warnings that British forces were being 'stretched to breaking point'. For most in the cabinet - with the exception of Mr Clarke - the case for reinforcement has become irresistible. Mr Major will claim that Britain is taking an important lead. But it was the force of circumstance which made this latest U-turn as inevitable as it was inelegant.</p>

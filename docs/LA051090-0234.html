			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CHARLESTON TOPS MANNERS LIST  </P> <P> Executives once again declared this antebellum city by the sea the nation's  most mannerly city, capable of watching its p's and q's even when a most  unwelcome guest -- Hurricane Hugo -- dropped in.  </P> <P> "With the hurricane and the wonderful recovery you're making, everyone is in  love with Charleston again," etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart said.  </P> <P> Stewart bases her annual list on an unscientific survey of about 2,700  executives who have taken her etiquette courses during the last three years.  </P> <P> Ranked No. 2 this year is Council Bluffs, Iowa, followed by Atlanta, Chicago,  Los Angeles and last year's top choice, Portland, Ore. Tied for seventh are  Rock Island and Moline, Ill., and Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa. San  Francisco, Denver and Phoenix round out the top 10.  </P></p>

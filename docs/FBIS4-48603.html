			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on  Sunday night held discussions with a Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] delegation led by PAC leader Mr Clarence Makwetu on the  integration of the PAC's armed formation into the South African  National Defence Force [SANDF].    The newly-appointed chief director of communications in Mr  Mandela's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said the PAC was  interested in participation in an integrated defence force and  the ANC in principle agreed that the relevant legislation should  be examined.    Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had been part of Mr Mandela's  delegation at Sunday night's talks, and Mrs Patricia de Lille  part of Mr Makwetu's.    Mr Netshitenzhe said talks between Mr Mandela and Home  Affairs Minister Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi about the controversial  KwaZulu land deal would possibly not take place on Sunday night,  but on Monday morning before the Cabinet meeting.</p>

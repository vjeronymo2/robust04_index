			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Bashful but Rich Pioneers From </F> the United States To Visit Russia"]    [Text] It will be possible to judge to a certain degree  just how ready the United States is to support reforms in  Russia, not so much with words as with deeds, from the results  of the mission on which an unusually impressive delegation of  U.S. businessmen, headed by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown,  arrives in our country Monday, 28 March.    The list of delegation members reads almost like a "Who's  Who  in the U.S. Business World": presidents and chairmen of major  corporations like Westinghouse Electric, General Electric  Aircraft Engines, Dresser Industries, Texaco, and so forth.    In his parting address to the delegation -- which is to  visit  St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg in addition to Moscow -- the  U.S. President stressed that "a Russian economy moving toward  the market is vitally necessary for the economic security of the  United States and the world as a whole."    There have already been similar visits to Russia, albeit not  on such a scale. But they proved virtually fruitless: Neither  an active influx of capital, nor impressive joint projects, nor  qualitative development in bilateral trade ensued.    It is perfectly obviously that, even if accords are achieved  also on this occasion, it cannot be ruled out that many of them  will be left hanging -- if only because of the numerous  restrictions which are still being maintained in trade and  business relations between our countries to this day, and which  Washington is not in any particular hurry to revoke, thereby  blocking our products' access to U.S. markets. Ultimately, the  lifting of these restrictions depends less on U.S. businessmen  than on the U.S. Government.    Well, the main thing of course, is investments: A tough  decision is required from the Americans on whether they are  prepared to invest money -- and considerable sums at that -- in  our economy, or whether they prefer to continue waiting for  something. Sometimes the impression arises that the spirit of  pioneering and risk -- which, in point of fact, paved the path  to the prosperity and success of America itself -- has now  seemingly been lost. U.S. businessmen, it seems, are waiting  for almost ideal, hothouse conditions to be created for them in  Russia.</p>

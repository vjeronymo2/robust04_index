			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> VIDEO;  </P> <P> SO MANY VIDEO STORES, SO MANY LANGUAGES. . .;  </P> <P> LITTLE SAIGON'S VIDEO KICKS  </P> <P> Danh Pham is a tiny man with the slightly sour look of a hard-working  businessman who doesn't have time for nosy strangers. Arms crossed, he listens  as Tony Lam, restaurateur and man-about-town in Orange County's Little Saigon,  asks him to enlighten a reporter about his small video rental business.  </P> <P> After much talk in Vietnamese, Pham remains noncommittal, even suspicious,  behind the counter of Danh's Video, his shop in a mini-mall off Garden Grove's  Bolsa Avenue. Lam is emphatic, but Pham just watches his customers, who listen  bemusedly to the negotiations. Only when a Vietnamese-American teen-ager with a  pomaded horn of hair breaks into the conversation does Pham loosen a bit.  </P> <P> The young man all but shouts: "Kung fu movies, they are the best!" Pham, along  5with everybody else, laughs.  </P> <P> Pham adds in thickly accented but precise English, "Yes, kung fu is very  popular, very. Many of the young men come in for the fighting (movies), they go  for the action. Not like the girls, who all the time want romance. . . ."  </P> <P> With that, Lam shakes Pham's hand, and turns to the reporter: "He will help you  now. He is willing to trust you." The exchange is reflective of the Vietnamese  community and its wariness of the media and outsiders; it also underlines how  something as seemingly innocuous as video-rental preferences can open a little  window on that community's identity.  </P> <P> Pham now moves casually up the aisles, pointing to a crowded row of movies  starring a mix of Vietnamese, Chinese and Taiwanese actors. All are filmed in  Taiwan or China, usually in Chinese and later dubbed into Vietnamese. On the  opposite wall is a stack of major English-language releases. The shop's  interior is covered with posters, most touting the Vietnamese tapes. They are  common for the genre -- romantic melodramas with a beguiling hint of soft sex  or sword-fighting adventures featuring a hero rising up against evil.  </P> <P> Pham says video is important to many Vietnamese-Americans for the same reason  it is important to everybody -- easily accessible and inexpensive entertainment  to be enjoyed at home. But he also points out that their interest can be more  complex than most.  </P> <P> The dubbed tapes provide older Vietnamese with a nostalgic link to their  homeland, a catalyst for inspiring joyful and painful memories of a country  thousands were forced to flee more than 10 years ago. They are reminded of what  they were, and that helps to keep the old culture intact.  </P> <P> The English-language videos, especially American releases, tend to be most  attractive to the new generation -- for different reasons. Eager to assimilate  and already fluent in English, hip Southeast Asian youngsters wearing the  trendiest Western clothes find in these videos the world they know better. The  other tapes are for their parents, their grandparents.  </P> <P> "They come (and rent) for different reasons, many reasons," Pham says. "Some  remember and feel woe, others just want to enjoy (them) like anybody else.  There are many different choices here for many people."  </P> <P> Sitting in front of an animated restaurant in Little Saigon, Jane Serna and her  66-year-old mother, Muoi Pham, are like opposite bookends in a library of  changing cultural attitudes.  </P> <P> Serna, 32, crosses her legs under a black leather mini-skirt that is less  high-school sexy than Vogue fashionable. She announces that she is ready to  speak and does so in crisp English. Her mother, who speaks little English, is  friendly but a bit uncomfortable with the reporter's questions.  </P> <P> At first, the daughter is interpreter for the mother. "She says (she feels) sad  when she rents a (Vietnamese) video. She feels a heaviness from remembering her  life there. She doesn't watch them often because of that heaviness; she'd  rather watch nature (programs) or comedies on (American) TV. She has trouble  (with the language), but she still understands.  </P> <P> "But most of her friends, who are her age, get the dubbed movies; they want to  have an (emotional) experience; they want to remember what has happened to  them, what Vietnam is like."  </P> <P> But Serna, with a surprising staunchness, says she only watches big-release  English-language movies, whether in theaters or on video ("Die Hard" and "The  Last Emperor" are two of her recent favorites). She stresses that she has  embraced American ways and has found a happy life in Westminster; assimilation  has not been easy, but it has been valuable.  </P> <P> Inside the restaurant, Harold Nguyen, a 54-year-old insurance adjuster, is  merrily eating a large bowl of noodles crowned with pigs' feet. He agrees that  the younger generation tends to avoid most of the Vietnamese-language movies,  with one exception.  </P> <P> "Everybody goes for the kung fu, even my children," says Nguyen, who has a  young son and daughter. "They, of course, like all the action, which really  doesn't have anything to do with the language.  </P> <P> "But for the older generation, there is something (more significant) going on.  In the kung fu or sword movies, good always defeats evil (and) justice wins.  That is satisfying to us because we came from a country where everything is  unfair, where (you couldn't count on) getting justice."  </P> <P> The attraction also has a dark shade. Most Vietnamese are able to identify with  these films because of the non-stop violence. "We understand all that fighting  and danger because we had so much of it before we came here," he says. "That's  the unhappy part of it."  </P> <P> It's obvious that Danh Pham is proud of his store's inventory: more than 200  Vietnamese titles and close to 1,000 English-language releases. Gathering them  requires much work, but Pham insists that it is necessary because his customers  have varied tastes and demand what is current. He also has to keep up with the  competition from other Vietnamese video stores scattered throughout  Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Although major-studio releases are popular ("The Untouchables," "The Godfather"  films and "The Last Emperor" are current favorites), especially with the  younger crowd, Pham says more than 50% of the rentals are for dubbed tapes.  Like their English-language counterparts, most are about 90 minutes long,  although there is a thriving market for 30- to 60-minute cassettes featuring  Vietnamese folk songs, folk dances and lounge acts.  </P> <P> Scattered throughout the shop are a few X-rated tapes as well. Not sexually  explicit material, but soft-core movies with titles such as "Sexy Sisters."  Most are American-made and, according to Pham, not that popular among his  patrons.  </P> <P> "They like the (dubbed) movies because they have lots of kissing, lots of  hugging, but nothing too dirty. They don't like it too dirty," he says, then  pauses with a smile. "Well, most people don't like it too dirty; some do come  in and rent the dirtier ones, though."  </P> <P> This special issue was edited by David Fox, Sunday Calendar assistant editor.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report; last part of three-part series </F> entitled: "Moves Are Afoot To Streamline and Integrate U.S.  Military Bases on Okinawa": "Live Shell-Firing Exercises"]    [Text] The U.S. forces are currently studying a plan to  remove almost all functions of a training area on Okinawa, where  firing trainings are conducted across Highway 104, to the  Higashifuji Training Area in Shizuoka Prefecture. However, as  the U.S. forces have asserted, the plan is being considered on  the condition that Japan bear the cost for transferring troops  from Okinawa to Shizuoka. Under the current Japanese-U.S.  status of forces agreement, it is impossible for Japan to give  direct support to the U.S. forces in transferring combat troops.  The United States, however, is calling for the conclusion of a  new, special agreement, thus indicating its strong desire to  remove the functions of the training area to another site.    Lieutenant General Henry C. Stackpole, who commands all U.S.  Marine deployed in the Pacific, recently met with Okinawa  Governor Masahide Ota, who is currently on a visit to the United  States. He clearly said to the governor: "Although it is  difficult to abolish everything, military exercises on Okinawa  will be reduced in number as early as next year." Stackpole  made the remark prior to the start of negotiations between Tokyo  and Washington on the costs for transferring troops. However,  he was not clear about whether what he said implied his  expectation that Japan and the United States would reach an  agreement next year on the removal of the firing range area to  another site or that he just meant a decrease in the number of  live shell-firing exercises.    It was Lt. Gen. Stackpole who first proposed the plan to  transfer the functions of the training area on Okinawa to  Higashifuji. He disclosed this as his private plan at a news  conference held after his speech in Naha in March of last year.  At a later date (in July of last year), he granted an interview  to the OKINAWA TIMES at Camp Smith in Hawaii, which is the  headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command. During the interview,  he said: "We plan to transfer troops by air and to transport  weapons by sea for live shell-firing exercises to be conducted  at Higashifuji for two weeks to six months. We intend to ask  the Japanese Government to bear the expenses."    The U.S. Marine Corps calculates that the cost of one  transfer is approximately $1 million (about 100 million yen).    There are U.S.-owned barracks in the Higashifuji Training  Area, so technically speaking, it is not difficult to carry out  exercises there. Thus, compliance by the Japanese Government  with the U.S. call to bear the costs holds the key to removing  the functions of the firing range area on Okinawa to another  site.    It is predicted that citizens living near the Higashifuji  Training Area will oppose firing practices there. The  government is being urged to decide on whether it should agree  to bear the costs, and on how it should deal with the citizens  near Higashifuji.    U.S. military bases on Okinawa have become larger in size  through the U.S. occupation of the island and forcible land  expropriation. There is an opinion in Okinawa that the  government's active participation is imperative to resolving the  bases issue, which has remained unsolved for half a century  since the end of the Pacific war. Meanwhile, a difficult task  remains undone -- coordinating the opinions of Okinawans to make  progress on the bases issue.</p>

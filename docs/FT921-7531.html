			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major sets up election 'A-team' - Heseltine and Clarke drafted on to inner cabinet to advise on strategy MR JOHN MAJOR has set up a general election 'A-team', drafting in Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke to a tightly knit group charged with finalising preparations for an April 9 poll. In a move which underlines their growing authority within the cabinet, the environment and education secretaries have joined Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in an inner cabinet advising the prime minister on strategy for the general election. Its members, who have been working for much of this week on the Conservative manifesto, will be the most prominent spokesmen for the party during the election campaign. They will share most of the ministerial 'air-time' on television and radio and will join the prime minister in making wide-ranging policy speeches. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has joined the team to take a behind-the-scenes role in costing - and sometimes vetoing - any manifesto pledges which would commit the Conservatives to higher public spending. The Conservatives have not publicly acknowledged the existence of the group in order to avoid comparisons with the inner circle - first dubbed the 'A-team' - established by Mrs Margaret Thatcher before the 1987 general election. But Mr Patten is said to refer to them privately as the 'Big Beasts', reflecting their heavyweight status within the cabinet and their claim after the election to the most important jobs in the government. The group has held a number of Downing Street strategy meetings with the prime minister over the past few days to translate the broad themes of the manifesto - ownership, choice, opportunity and responsibility - into concrete policy proposals. Among the measures agreed are a promise of fresh incentives for saving and home and share ownership, further action to remove education from local authority control, a new programme to revitalise the inner cities, and a shake-up of the rented housing market. The group is meeting in parallel with the other team of ministers - led by Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip - which takes day-to-day responsibility for campaigning. Earlier this week Mr Heseltine underlined his personal standing among Conservative MPs with a bravura Commons performance. His participation in Mr Major's inner cabinet will reinforce expectations that he will head an expanded trade and industry department after a Conservative election victory. Mr Clarke, meanwhile, has combined a growing following on the right of the party with an increasingly close relationship with the prime minister. Colleagues say that Mr Clarke's commitment to the government's education reforms and his robust performances in defending them have greatly impressed Mr Major. He is seen as a future chancellor. Ironically, Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine would be the strongest contenders for the party leadership if a Conservative defeat at the election put Mr Major's position at risk.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Iljaz Ramajli, chairman of the assembly of </F> the republic of Kosova, by E. Azemi; place and date not given]    [Text] [Azemi] The old structure of the assembly of Kosova  is in exile. In the meantime, there have been multiparty  elections for the assembly and president of the republic of  Kosova. The new assembly has not been formed yet. How do you  explain this situation?    [Ramajli] As you said, multiparty elections in the republic  of Kosova were held on 24 May 1992. In those elections, in which  there was a massive turnout of citizens of the republic of  Kosova, the president of the republic of Kosova and the deputies  of the new multiparty parliament were voted for and elected. On  the basis of constitutional provisions, the president of the  republic of Kosova took office, in a legitimate manner, five  days after the elections, while the formation of the new  parliament was supposed to take place on 24 June of the same  year. For well-known reasons, the formation of the parliament  did not take place on that date and it has not taken place yet.    During this time many preparations have been made for the  formation of the new parliament but conditions and circumstances  have not been created for doing this or for radically changing  the situation in Kosova, that is, so that it will not lead to  open conflict in Kosova. On the basis of information available  to me, many of our friends from abroad have suggested that the  holding of the constitutive assembly for the parliament should  be postponed so that the situation in Kosova can be kept under  control and so that conditions can be created for starting the  discussions.    In my opinion, it is not good that we have not formed a new  parliament. However, we should have no doubt that we have  assured the continuity of action of the organs of power in the  republic of Kosova through the institution of the president of  the republic, who is legitimately carrying out his function on  the basis of constitutional provisions, through the activity of  the government and other organs of authority in Kosova which are  operating in many fields, wherever present conditions and  circumstances permit. From the formal constitutional and legal  viewpoint, this structure of the assembly, which I head, covers  the time up to the formation of the new assembly. However, the  new composition of deputies of the parliament of Kosova has  exclusive legitimacy to meet on and to decide any issue which is  in the sphere of the assembly's activity.    I understand the concern of many people that the failure to  form a parliament might cause us some damage! I believe that the  many comments that various individuals have made in regard to  this matter are well-intentioned; however, during their  political appearances, each person must be careful about what  they say, since any doubts about the legitimacy and legality of  the multiparty elections in Kosova, even if these criticisms are  unintentional, could pave the way for manipulations which our  adversary could use to attack the legitimacy of the  representatives whom the people of Kosova elected, with the aim  of diminishing their position in any future discussions on the  resolution of the issue of Kosova and its status.    [Azemi] It is almost four years since the proclamation of  the Constitution of Kacanik. This high-level legal act had a  profound influence on the political processes in Kosova since,  on the basis of this, a parallel system of education, health,  and social insurance was set up. It is possible that this system  will be extended ever further and that we will develop other  forms of institutional activity.    [Ramajli] After the proclamation of the republic of Kosova  and the promulgation of the Constitution of Kacanik on September  1990, the state organs of the republic of Kosova were  restructured and their activity was adapted to constitutional  provisions. The organization of these organs, from the  government of the republic down to the communal organs, was  adapted to the conditions and circumstances which exist in  Kosova. The field of education has been better organized, with  broader dimensions. In addition to carrying out its basic  function, education has been one of the most prominent forms of  resistance to the Serbian occupational authorities, and it is  also highly regarded by the outside world. In addition, the  fields of health, finance, culture, sports, social, assistance,  and other areas have been organized to a certain extent.    I think that the results achieved in these areas are not  satisfactory and that we have not done all that we could in all  spheres of life in Kosova, in light of the fact that the  citizens of Kosova and the organs of the republic of Kosova live  and operate in conditions of total occupation and in the  presence of the application of unprecedented police and military  violence by the Serbian authorities. I think that this work  should be continued in those areas which we have not organized  well so far. We must take action in the judiciary so that a  judicial system, as conditions and circumstances allow, will be  put in place. In my opinion, a vital, priority issues is the  preservation and expansion of institutional activity in Kosova  so that we can show that we are able to organize life in Kosova,  despite the situation of occupation which we have there. On the  other hand, I am deeply convinced that will win more respect  from the outside world if we develop forms of institutional  activity.    [Azemi] Sensitivities are being raised in regard to the  internationalization of the issue of Kosova. This matter has  also been discussed in some important documents. On the other  hand, the situation in Kosova remains the same. Has the fact  that they are talking about Kosova in the world made any  impression on the Serbian aggressor?    [Ramajli] It is true that the issue of Kosova, expecially  recently, is discussed at every meeting of the international  community and, one might say, it is present in every public  appearance of every statesman. This is understandable in light  of the fact that it is clear to all that, without the resolution  of the issue of Kosova, there is no solution to the problem of  the former Yugoslavia and there is no peace in the Balkans. The  international community is currently concerned with the Kosova  issue for the purpose of making it impossible for the conflict  to spread from the territory of Croatia and Bosnia to the south.  It is clear to all now that the conflict in Kosova cannot be  kept under control within a certain territory, as is the case  with the conflict in Bosnia and Croatia. This conflict would  immediately involve many other states bordering on Kosova and  the conflict would be expanded in the Balkans and perhaps even  further. Since the European Union and the international  community are not interested is seeing the conflict expand,  these groups have recently been bringing up the Kosova issue as  a problem which demands an immediate solution so that it will  not get any worse.    Much pressure is being exerted on Serbia to begin to resolve  the Kosova issue by means of discussions with the Albanians, and  it appears that this pressure has begun to produce its first  effects. This is evident in the fact that there are signs which  indicate that the current Serbian government wants to begin the  talks, under conditions and at a time when they will receive the  best response. The activity of the government organs in Kosova,  which rely exclusively on military police violence, gives the  impression, as you say, that the international pressure in  regard to Kosova is not making any impression on Serbia. In my  opinion, this is not true; this attitude and the nervousness of  this government give the impression that Serbia is not in a  strong position in regard to Kosova and it believes that it will  not be easy to keep Kosova under occupation for a long time.    There are other indications that the Serbs are calculating  that they might be losing Kosova in the near future. This is  seen, best of all, in the schemes that are being devised in  regard to Serbian Krajina in Croatia and the insistence that  there is a parallel between that area and Kosova. Now we also  have the public appearances of many Serbian intellectuals, which  were not characteristic earlier, who now are talking, without  hesitation, about Kosova as a lost territory for Serbia and  about the fact that it is better that this be understood now  instead of becoming true by means of a conflict which certainly  would be more fierce and more bloody than the one in Croatia and  Bosnia.    [Azemi] Recently there has been talk about some kind of  global plan for the solution of the problem of the former  Yugoslavia. Some people quickly called this plan very hopeful  while others expressed some skepticism about the resolution of  the issue of Kosova.    [Ramajli] Yes, it is true that there is talk about some kind  of global plan for the solution of the problem of the former  Yugoslavia. But I think that, despite the many preparations  which are being made by the international community for such a  plan, conditions have not yet been created for this plan to be  put on the table for discussion. In my opinion, a precondition  for beginning discussions of this plan would be the achievement  of a cease-fire in Bosnia which would end the armed conflicts.  If this is not achieved, it would be difficult to have  discussions on this plan. I think that the position of Kosova  regarding this plan has its good and bad aspects. It would be a  positive development if Kosova were included in this plan by  taking our position into consideration; Kosova, according to the  1974 Constitution, has been a constituent part of the former  Yugoslavia. In my opinion, a negative element would be the fact  that there is no doubt that this plan would try to draw a  parallel between Kosova and the Serbian Krajina in Croatia,  something which, basically, is not suitable for us. The drawing  of this parallel must be opposed to the very end.    In any case, although we have opted for the solution of the  problem of Kosova by means of discussions in the presence of an  international factor, which would guarantee the agreements  reached with the other side, the inclusion of Kosova in the  global plan for the solution of the problem of the former  Yugoslavia would satisfy, to some extent, our requirements in  regard to the size of the presence of the international factor  and the solution of the problem of Kosova; it would also rule  out the possibility that the Albanians would meet only with the  Serbs, which would mean that the issue of Kosova would not be  internationalized and would be regarded as an internal problem  of Serbia.    [Azemi] There is much talk in the media about a possible  Albanian-Serbian dialogue. Some diplomats who visited Kosova  recently talked about this possibility. On the other hand,  president Rugova denied that a group had been formed to discuss  the issues. Indeed, when would this dialogue be possible and  under what conditions?    [Ramajli] In response to an earlier question, I stressed  that there are signals that the Serbs would like to begin  discussions with the Albanians about the solution of the problem  of Kosova. They are doing this because of pressure from the  international community and because of the situation which  currently exists within Serbia. These signals, as you have said,  have been given recently through various diplomatic channels and  on the occasion of visits of foreign diplomats to Kosova. The  clearest signal was given on the occasion of the visit of  British Secretary Hogg to Prishtina. Other signals were given  through the media from Belgrade.    I consider the talk about the formation of a group for  discussions in Serbia with the Albanians, which president Rugova  denied, as preparing the terrain for discussions and preparing  opinion within Serbia for something which must happen soon. As  president Rugova said, there has been no official announcement  from the Serbian government about the beginning of the  discussions or the formation of groups by one or the other side.  The Albanian side has already proclaimed the conditions in which  the discussions will begin and they have been the same and  unchangeable from the very beginning. I think that the Serbian  side is not yet prepared for this dialogue and that the dialogue  will begin when the Serbian side believes that the conditions  and the time are most appropriate for this. However, it appears  that the dialogue on Kosova will more likely be imposed by  international factors and by the situation in the region than by  Serbia's readiness for talks.    [Azemi] After the democratization of Albania, a new quality  of relations among Albanians found expression. The appearance of  Albania in the democratic plane is redefining the attitude of  international factors toward Kosova.    [Ramajli] I agree with your statement. After the  democratization of life in Albania, especially after the victory  of the democratic forces in the recent elections, there was a  qualitative difference in the involvement of Albania in the  problem of Kosova and of Albanians on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia. Despite Albania's many domestic and foreign  problems, the country has been greatly involved in sensitizing  efforts to place the issue of Kosova on the international agenda  as a problem which demands a rapid solution, so that it will not  get any worse. Along with the involvement of the republic of  Kosova, Albanian diplomacy could be said to be the motivating  force in sensitizing the international community and raising the  issue of Kosova in all international mechanisms.    The clear position of the president of the Government of  Albania that Albania cannot stand aside in case of a conflict in  Kosova obliged the international community to consider the issue  of Kosova as a serious problem which requires an urgent  solution. In my opinion, Albania is doing exactly what it can  do, in accordance with its possibilities, so that the problem of  Kosova will be resolved in accordance with the interests of the  Albanians of Kosova. At this time and in the circumstances in  the international community and in the territories of the former  Yugoslavia, the support which Albania is giving to Kosova is  irreplaceable.    [Azemi] Kosova is bounded by neighbors which once were  members of the Yugoslav Federation. One of them is Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Can you  characterize the Macedonia-Kosova relationship in the current  circumstances?    [Ramajli] Currently, Macedonia, as an independent and  sovereign state which was part of the former Yugoslavia, despite  its international acceptance, is confronted by domestic problems  of the transitional phase and by foreign problems which  determine its position in regard to Kosova. The situation in  Kosova and the course of events in regard to Kosova could  involve Macedonia and other states in this part of the Balkans,  no matter how they might develop. In my opinion, Macedonia's  problem with Greece and the failure to accept Macedonia as an  independent and sovereign state by the so-called third  Yugoslavia are forcing Macedonia to maintain a neutral official  attitude on the issue of Kosova. The recent interview by  Macedonian President Gligorov with a foreign newspaper, in which  he stressed the need for the installation of peacekeeping forces  in Kosova so as to eliminate the possibility of an outbreak of a  conflict in the south, satisfies the demands of the  representatives of Kosova for such a thing.    [Azemi] In your opinion, what is the future of Kosova?  Concretely, can you state briefly the goals of the organs of  government in Kosova and other institutions?    [Ramajli] The goals of the organs of Kosova, beginning with  President Rugova, the assembly, the government, and other  organs, are stated in the documents which this assembly approved  and which have been put into force by the referendum which was  held in Kosova in which the citizens of Kosova defined the  status of Kosova as a sovereign and independent state.  Therefore, during the present time and in the future, all  representatives of Kosova and of its organs will be committed to  the realization of this goal. There has been no wavering from  this goal on the part of any political party in Kosova or any  individual who has a relevant influence on public opinion in  Kosova. I am aware that the road to the achievement of this goal  is difficult and long but the results will depend on the manner  of organization and our commitment, first of all, and on the  support of the international factor. For the achievement of this  goal, we have chosen the peaceful option and the solution of  problems by means of discussions which must be carried on, on  our part, by the legitimate representatives of the citizens of  the republic of Kosova who were identified by the multiparty  elections of 24 May 1992.</p>

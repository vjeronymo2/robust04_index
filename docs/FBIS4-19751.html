Asked about the strong social and  political impact caused by the cases uncovered by the press  concerning former Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan and former  Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio, Serra was direct and  emphatic: "I am absolutely weary of the topic, and I have been  devoting hours to it for days, because we cannot carry on like  this," he said. The deputy prime minister said that he feels  deeply "disturbed" and "doubly cheated" in this connection, and  reiterated several times the need "for it to be made clear to  the country once and for all that impunity is over," in order to  be able fully to restore confidence in the institutions.    Referring to the case of former Civil Guard Director Luis  Roldan, Serra stated, without concealing his indignation: "It  seems inconceivable to me that when you have rendered the  country services or attended dramatic occasions such as I have  experienced at funerals and so forth, you can reconcile that  work for the community with certain personal actions, and since  it seems inconceivable to me, I say so."    Narcis Serra went so far as to say that "if somebody has to  go to prison, then he has to go to prison," and came out in  favor of amending procedural law in order to shorten legal  proceedings and rapidly clear up this kind of case which creates  social alarm. In Serra's opinion, it is a matter not so much of  damage to the credibility and image of the government or the  ruling party as of grave harm to Spanish society's collective  morale, about which he expressed open concern. Emphasizing that  it is "an injury to the institutions, and hence to the country,  which could be very difficult to cure," the deputy prime  minister asked: "If neither our Civil Guard nor our Bank of  Spain is immune to that kind of conduct, who is going to believe  in the country?"    Serra emphasized that "this country needs more  self-confidence because it is emerging from the crisis, albeit  slowly, and the greatest factor which could help us is the  country's self-confidence, and this is a torpedo at the  waterline in this respect."    The deputy prime minister, who said that he was speaking in  complete harmony -- "beyond all doubt" -- with Felipe Gonzalez'  thinking and stance, concluded by asserting that the government  is gathering all the information needed to clarify these two  matters as soon as possible. Serra referred to the setting in  motion of all the tax inspectorate's machinery and to the  government attorney's office's activity initiated by the  government for the complete clarification of the facts.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian mine project cancelled HINDUSTAN COPPER has decided not to go ahead with the development of the Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine after failing to find a foreign joint venture partner. On its own, Hindustan Copper, an Indian government undertaking, is not in a position to mobilise Rs20bn (Pounds 470m) to finance the mine development and a 60,000 tonnes-a-year copper smelter. According to Mr Ved Leekha, the company's chairman, Hindustan Copper sought to interest Outokumpu of Finland, Codelco of Chile and Mamaco of Zambia in the project. Bishimetal Exploration of Japan has estimated in its feasibility report that up to 5m tonnes of copper ore can be extracted from the underground mine of Malanjkhand in Madhya Pradesh. The Malanjkhand reserves are estimated at 275m tonnes. The viability of the project, according to Mr Leekha, has also become somewhat doubtful as the copper content in the Malanjkhand ore is now found to be less than 1 per cent, with hardly any traces of silver and gold, compared with the 1.23 per cent thought earlier. Mr Leekha said that Hindustan Copper had now two alternatives. It might develop the mines 'with or without a cut-off grade' and go up to the copper concentration stage. The concentrates would then be smelted abroad. Alternatively, to keep the investment low, Hindustan Copper might opt for mining of 2.5m tonnes of ore. In either case, the company would seek a private sector partner, whether local or foreign. India's domestic production of copper will be 45,150 tonnes this year, while demand is estimated at 160,000 tonnes.</p>

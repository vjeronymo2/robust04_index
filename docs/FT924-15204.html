			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Observer: Olympic curse Has Lord Hanson, the predatory peer now stalking Ranks Hovis McDougall, spotted the Olympic connection? Observer thanks David Lang, Henderson Crosthwaite's veteran food analyst, for making the connections others ignore. It seems that every year in recent memory when there has been an Olympic games, there has also been a takeover of one of the grand old names of the British food industry. The 1980 Moscow Olympics coincided with Dalgety swallowing Spillers. Unilever gobbled up Brooke Bond the same year as the Los Angeles Olympics and Nestle digested Rowntree Mackintosh after the Seoul Olympics. This year it was Barcelona's turn and RHM is in the line of fire. On past Olympic form it would be surprising if RHM remains independent for long. Indeed, Lang and his team already have their eyes on 1996 and Atlanta, home of Coca-Cola. Could this be the year of the really big one? Cadbury Schweppes, or heaven forbid, Coke itself. . .</p>

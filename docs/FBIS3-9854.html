			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, March 30 (AFP) -- Croatia and rebel Krajina  Serbs agreed on a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces early  Wednesday [30 March], an official statement said. The ceasefire  would come into effect April 4, and withdrawal of forces would  begin the following day, it said. Heavy weapons would be pulled  back up to 20 kilometres (12 miles) and infantry 1,000 metres on  each side.    The statement was issued after a ceasefire accord was signed  at the end of negotiations that began Tuesday [29 March] in the  Russian Embassy here and lasted most of the night. "The parties  signing this document agree that all armed hostilities between  the parties should end immediately, and that a ceasefire on all  contact lines existing between the parties on 29 March 1994  (...) should be fully respected from 0900 hours 4 April 1994,"  it said. "Not later than 0900 hours 5 April 1994, all indirect  fire weapons shall be deployed out of range of the Lines of  Separation: mortars and AA-guns not less than 10 kilometres,  artillery and tanks not less than 20 kilometres. Not later than  0900 hours on 8 April 1994, all units on the Contact Line shall  be separated. The separation will be based on a mutual  withdrawal not less than 1,000 metres from the Contact Line to  their respective line of separation."    The ceasefire will be monitored by the United Nations  Protection Force for the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) and the  European Union Monitoring Commission, the statement added. The  talks, brokered by Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin, had resumed  here Tuesday after a week-long break. The first since the  conflict erupted two years ago, they had broken off on March 22  after failing to reach an agreement. The negotiations were aimed  solely at forging a ceasefire between the two sides, the  Croatian government and the rebel Serbs who have proclaimed a  separatist republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on  roughly a quarter of Croatian territory. The spokesman for the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia, John Mills,  said earlier the negotiators, armed with 35 detailed maps, were  working out sector by sector how to pull back their forces from  the front lines. They were assisted by senior officers of  UNPROFOR, which intends to send buffer units into the resulting  no man's land two kilometres (2,000 yards) across.</p>

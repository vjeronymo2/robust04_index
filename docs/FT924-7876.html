			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Money Markets: UK and France ease CASH rates in the sterling money market were virtually unmoved yesterday after the UK chancellor announced that the Bank of England will post a Minimum Lending Rate of 7 per cent today, writes James Blitz. This signalled a 1 percentage point cut in base rates, but the reduction had been accurately priced into the market and little trading followed the statement. In recent days, dealers had been punting on the possibility of a 2 percentage point cut in rates this week. But several hours before the speech, market rates firmed, with 6-month money moving back up to 6 3/4 per cent from 6 per cent. Three-month money, a key indicator of how the market thinks rates are moving, traded at around 7 per cent shortly before the chancellor stood up in the House of Commons, and closed at that level. Short sterling futures reflected slightly less optimism that base rates will be at 6 per cent by the New Year. The December short sterling contract closed down 14 basis points from its highs at 93.40, pricing 3-month money at 6.60 per cent by Christmas. As expected, the Pounds 1bn daily shortage forecast by the Bank of England proved difficult to remove in the run-up to the Autumn Statement. One commercial bank dealer suggested that today's shortage should be easily removed because there is little expectation of another rate cut for several weeks. 'We should have a quiet period until the next economic data come through,' he said. The Bank of France decided to cut its two key lending rates for the second time in ten days, but the move had been priced into the market and had little impact. The French authorities decided to lower the intervention rate by 25 basis points to 9.10 per cent and the five-to-10 day lending rate to 10 per cent. However, French cash rates were more-or-less unchanged on the news. The December French franc futures contract closed down 10 basis points at 90.94, and three month money closed at 9 3/8 per cent on the offered side. Three-month French cash is now 90 basis points above 3-month D-Marks. One commercial bank dealer speculated that the French authorities could bring French rates down to German levels if the franc appreciates further to FFr3.35 to the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 1 Apr (EFE) -- During a news  conference, Uruguayan Interior Minister Raul Iturria stated  today that the Uruguayan intelligence services have not  discovered any indications of terrorist activities in the  country linked to the Basque organization ETA [Basque Fatherland  and Liberty].    The minister indicated that he had only called the news  conference because of repeated media requests due to information  published in Madrid newspapers regarding those possible links.    He made it clear that in any case it was not a question of a  new investigation, that it is a question of an investigation  that was carried out due to the arrest of an alleged group of  Spanish ETA activists in May 1992, and that the current  investigation has come up with the same results.    The minister added that he understood the Spanish  authorities' concern regarding the delay in handing over the  three alleged terrorists. Uruguayan courts now have granted the  Spaniards' extradition because in a country with a strict  separation of the branches of government, such as in Uruguay,  that is an affair that pertains to the judicial branch and the  executive branch cannot interfere.    "No one wants this type of situation, but they must be  handled in a very balanced way if they crop up," Iturria said,  and he added: "Terrorism is a serious evil, as we Uruguayans  know, and we suffered a 12-year institutional rupture due its  activities."    Uruguayan intelligence services director Saul Claveria  indicated in a separate conversation that his investigation  regarding the charges of links between the ETA and the legal  Uruguayan Tupamaros Party has come up with nothing that  Uruguayan courts can term a crime.    Claveria also indicated that the presence of alleged ETA  members in Uruguay cannot be presupposed to be a reactivation of  the terrorism this country suffered in past decades, "because  the Uruguayan people and government are against subversion: We  Uruguayans have suffered to much because of terrorism and we do  not want a repeat."</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRE CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK WINS FIRST COUNTY TITLE  </P> <P> As expected, the Saddleback High School boys' cross-country team won the seeded  race at the Orange County Championships Saturday at Irvine Regional Park.  </P> <P> It was the team's first county title, but the victory was expected because the  the Roadrunners are top-ranked in Southern Section's Division I. But what came  as a surprise was La Habra, which finished in third place with 145 points.  </P> <P> Saddleback had 69 points: El Toro was second with 109. Dana Hills was fourth,  with 146 points.  </P> <P> Dana Hills senior Daniel Neidnagel, who is undefeated this season, won the  three-mile race in 15 minutes 19 seconds. Saddleback's Eddie Salinas put on a  last-minute surge to finish second in 15:36 and Villa Park's Danny Simon was  third (15:37).  </P> <P> La Habra, which was not ranked in the top 10 of the county coaches' poll, was  led by senior Mark Gonzales, who was second in last season's Division II state  meet.  </P> <P> Gonzales was expected to challenge Niednagel for the title, but after running  with the leaders through the one-mile mark, he dropped back, finishing ninth in  15:48.  </P> <P> "I went into this race real scared because I have never raced against Mark  Gonzales before, except at the Kinney regional meet last year," Niednagel said.  "But I was surprised -- I thought they (the pack) would go with me."  </P> <P> Niednagel led by at least 75 yards with a half-mile left and wasn't really  challenged.  </P> <P> Afterward, Gonzales said he never felt he was in the race.  </P> <P> "I just did bad," Gonzales said. "I never felt like I was up there for first. I  just went through the motions without doing anything."  </P> <P> Gonzales may have felt bad, but Saddleback Coach Mel Silva was elated. The  Roadrunners didn't compete in the meet last year, opting to run on that day in  the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational in Walnut, a meet conducted on the  same course as the Southern Section prelims and finals.  </P> <P> "It is a great honor to win it (Saturday)," Silva said. "We went to Mt. SAC  last year because we had a younger team and I felt it was important for them to  get some experience on that course. But the kids came through this year and  it's a neat feeling -- they really wanted this."  </P> <P> Katella senior Martha Pinto posted the fastest girls' time and won her fourth  county title, winning the varsity race in 17:26, nine seconds faster than her  time last year. Valencia's Heather Killeen was second (18:06).  </P> <P> Irvine won the girls' seeded race with 88 points. Dana Hills, which started the  season slowly, but has improved, was second (100) and Canyon was third (138).  Woodbridge's Kay Nekota, a freshman who started running in age-group  competition three years ago, won in 17:49.  </P> <P> Nekota and Irvine sophomore Kelly Roda ran together until the last half-mile  when Nekota pulled away coming down the last hill. Roda was second in 17:56.  Nekota said she wasn't surprised Roda stayed with her.  </P> <P> "She's been doing good this season," Nekota said. "She was looking very strong  during the race, but I erased it out of my mind and thought I could beat her."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meet Notes:  </P> <P> Also finishing for Saddleback were: Albert Ochoa (eighth, 15:47), Joey Heredia  (14th, 15:56), Johny Ochoa (18th, 15:58) and Mario Vela (27th, 16:11). Los  Amigos' Lihn Le won the boys' Race 1 in 15:56, an approximate time because an  earlier race overlapped and Le didn't receive an official time. Katella  sophomore Mike Love won Race 2 (15:42). San Clemente's Terri Smythers, who  skipped last spring's track season, won the girls' Race 3 (19:15). San Clemente  won the team title (24 points) with Orange Lutheran second (71). Orange  Lutheran, one of the top small schools, was led by Amber Parkinson's  second-place finish (19:45). Several of the top county teams will compete  Saturday at the Mt. SAC Invitational in Walnut.  </P> <P> At the Brea-Olinda Cross-Country Invitational at Carbon Canyon Park:  </P> <P> Santiago was the top Orange County finisher in the boys' and girls' divisions.  </P> <P> The Santiago boys' team finished fifth behind first-place Bishop Amat. Leading  Santiago was Jose Salcedo, who finished ninth overall in 17 minutes 4 seconds  on the five-kilometer course. Moorpark's Manuel Lopes was the top finisher.  Other Orange County finishers were Savanna's Ray Estrada (16:44, third place)  and Anaheim's Oscar Malo (16:55, fifth).  </P> <P> In the girls' division, Santiago was third and Chino finished first. Leticia  Perez (21:08) finished fifth to lead Santiago. Brea-Olinda's Dina Bloomfield  (21:02) finished fourth and Garden Grove's Natalie Lupicia (21:34) was sixth.  </P></p>

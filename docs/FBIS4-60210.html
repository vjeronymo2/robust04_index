			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, last night held telephone  contacts with Saudi King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of  the two holy mosques; His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, president of the fraternal United Arab Emirates;  struggler Yasir 'Arafat, president of the fraternal State of  Palestine; Hafiz al- Asad, president of the fraternal Syrian  Arab Republic; and Liamine Zeroual, president of the fraternal  Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria.    During these contacts, the leaders exchanged congratulations  on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. Our country's relations with each  of these leaders' country were also discussed.    The brother president briefed his brother leaders on the  current developments in the Yemeni arena in light of traitor  ['Ali Salim] al-Bid's action against his Yemeni homeland and the  Arab nation of announcing secession, which only represents  himself and the small gang of the [Yemeni] Socialist party [YSP]  that conspires against the Yemeni homeland, unity, people, and  their democratic approach.    The president said that all the sons of our people in all  the  Yemeni governorates reject this crime and adhere to unity and  democracy. They will continue to strongly defend and protect  them from all plots and plotters, and to sacrifice all that is  dear for their sake. He also said the masses of our Arab nation  also reject this crime because they view the Yemeni unity as an  important step on the road to achieving the pan-Arab objective  of establishing comprehensive unity among the sons of the Arab  nation.    The president expressed appreciation for the stands of the  Arab brothers who have always been concerned about Yemeni unity  and about supporting the Yemeni people's march under the banner  of the Republic of Yemen, whose fourth anniversary is being  celebrated by our people.    Another telephone contact was held last night between  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council, and his brother Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September Revolution in Libya.    They exchanged congratulations on the blessed 'Id al-Adha  and  the current developments in our country in light of the crime of  secession committed by traitor al-Bid.    The Libyan leader said he was very upset because of the  current serious developments which threaten the march of the  Yemeni unity. He also reiterated his support for the Yemeni  unity and that of the Libyan people's support for the Yemeni  people to safeguard the Yemeni unity, considering it a pan-Arab  gain for the Arab nation and an advanced step on the road of  achieving the comprehensive unity.</p>

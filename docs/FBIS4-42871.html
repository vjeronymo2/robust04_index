			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has  said that the real aim of Poised Hammer is to divide Turkey.  Its mandate should not be extended again, he said.    Addressing a PP assembly group meeting, Erbakan alleged that  it has been documented that Poised Hammer extends food and  medical aid to the separatist terrorist organization PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan].    Erbakan also said that it is wrong to extend the state of  emergency, which has been in effect for so long, by another four  months.    [Begin Erbakan recording] We want every kind of freedom to  reign in every part of our country. We hold our country's unity  and integrity above all else. While upholding our country's  unity and integrity, however, we want the rules to be the same  throughout the country. [end recording]    Erbakan charged that constitutional amendments are the  business of the parliament not of the government. He welcomed  the decision to set up an interparty committee to prepare the  constitutional amendments.</p>

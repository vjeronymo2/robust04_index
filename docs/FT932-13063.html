			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Lonrho negotiating to sell Observer to Independent LONRHO, the international conglomerate, is in negotiations to sell the Observer newspaper title to the owner of The Independent and its Sunday stablemate. Under the proposal being discussed, Lonrho would shoulder all the multi-million-pound cost of closing the Observer. Founded in 1791, the Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper. A merger between The Independent and the Observer would create a strong left-of-centre paper better able to challenge the dominance of the Sunday Times. The proposed deal envisages Lonrho taking a stake of between 15 to 20 per cent in Newspaper Publishing, The Independent's owner. Lonrho would also receive a sum of about Pounds 20m, deferred for up to 15 months, linked to the performance of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Mr Donald Trelford, editor of the Observer since 1975, insisted last night there was 'no agreement to sell the Observer'. However, one of Lonrho's financial advisers confirmed that the group was in talks with Newspaper Publishing to sell the Observer title. Although no formal decision has yet been taken by Lonrho to sell the paper, bids were invited and received from both Newspaper Publishing and The Guardian. Because The Guardian is controlled by a charitable trust, it was unable to offer a stake to Lonrho. Any sale will have to be approved by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Guardian interest could complicate the issue. Any sale to Newspaper Publishing which would involve the closure of the paper would be controversial given that The Guardian is keen to continue publishing. Mr Dieter Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder with 18.8 per cent and joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, has made it clear that he wants to sell the loss-making newspaper. Mr Rowland, who has effectively run Lonrho for the past 31 years, has always blocked any possible sale of the Observer and may try to do so again. Lonrho bought the Observer in 1981. It is believed that Mr Rowland last November vetoed a possible sale to The Guardian, which has long expressed an interest in adding a national Sunday to its business. Mr Rowland has in the past told friends that he would find any deal that would involve the closure of the Observer 'profoundly distasteful'. The newspaper's losses are now running at an annual rate of about Pounds 8m compared with last year's deficit of Pounds 14.9m. But Mr Bock, after taking his seat on Lonrho's board in Feburary, set up an internal team to work on the sale of the paper. If the sale goes through, it would suggest that Mr Rowland no longer exercises unfettered power on the Lonrho board. The Observer is printed by the Financial Times, under a contract which runs to January 1995.</p>

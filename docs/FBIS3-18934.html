Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello  Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano  Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named  Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5  news admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but  stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to  take flight.    The news bulletin also referred in passing to "another three  detention requests people have been talking about, for a case of  alleged kickbacks involving the ENEL [National Electric Power  Board] electricity agency."    "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely  risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are  turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the comment of  the Fininvest owner, who stepped down from the helm of his  media-to-retail empire when he took the political field with his  Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to beat the left in the March  27-28 elections.    "This is an offence to the intelligence and rights of  millions of Italians...(whom) Forza Italia calls on to punish  with their votes those who would transform a clean-up by  magistrates into a sad case of the political use of the judicial  system," said the pre-election poll leader, who is also the AC  Milan chairman.    Reacting to "the reports of imminent arrest," Dell'Utri's  lawyer said his client was "totally ready" to provide necessary  clarification on the alleged false accounting, expressing the  view that there was no need for preventive custody.    The preventive custody requests were reportedly on the desk  of preliminary hearings judge Fabio Paparella, but no official  decision had been announced. One of Paparella's reported  options was to pass them on to colleague Anna Introini, who has  been working for months on alleged "parallel accounting" within  the Fininvest group. [passage omitted]    Fininvest issued a statement Wednesday evening [9 March]  denying that Publitalia had ever issued false receipts and said  it was the victim of a plot being orchestrated by certain  factions in the judiciary and the press aimed at falsifying the  election campaign. The statement stressed how only selected  excerpts were being leaked by judicial sources to the press in  an attempt to create a distorted picture of a judicial  investigation "which could be clarified with extreme ease were  there the will to do so."    According to Fininvest, the investigation being carried out  by Secit and the Finance Guard was focused on company's  supplying Publitalia and thus had no connection with the Clean  Hands investigation into graft, bribery, illicit party funding a  corruption in general. "All possible clarification can be made,  in respect to civil rules, in the course of a tranquil  conversation with the magistrate" the statement said, "there  being the obvious readiness for the interested party to offer  the most ample collaboration."    "However, the audacity to question a subject in a state of  detention" the Fininvest statement stressed, "constitutes an  illegal act of persecution which has the sole objective of  falsifying the ongoing election campaign," against Fininvest  owner Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia (Go Italy)  movement.

(Saturday in Thailand), President Bill  Clinton must already have announced a major decision to lift the  trade sanctions imposed for 30 years on Vietnam, its adversary.    The decision of the U.S. leader will turn a new page in the  history of relations between the United States and Vietnam, now  free of conditions from the Indochina war. [passage omitted]    Those benefiting from the removal of the trade sanctions are  none other than private American companies which, from now on,  will be able to reap profits from Vietnam in full after allowing  Japan to gain huge interests for so long.    The American business sector believed that the sanctions  caused more damage to the United States than to Vietnam. It  deprived the U.S. private sector of huge "business  opportunities" during the 30 years of the sanctions. [passage  omitted] In the eyes of American businessmen, Vietnam is no  longer the enemy who killed more than 50,000 American GIs during  the war. Vietnam of the "new era" for them is a country with  high economic potential and the possibility of becoming another  "new tiger in Asia." More importantly, Vietnam can serve as a  "base" in the economic power play as a balance against China and  Japan. [passage omitted]    However, experts on this matter do not think the United  States will restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam as easily  as it decided to lift the trade sanctions (which stood for  economic commitments).    For the United States, the question of diplomatic relations  with Hanoi must certainly be linked with the question of human  rights, democracy development, and other conditions. Thus, it  will take a long time before the two countries can establish  full diplomatic relations.    As for President Clinton, he has once again demonstrated  political `courage' despite the fact that he risked being  opposed by war veterans. Yet the risk is worthwhile because he  has gotten full support from the business and political sectors,  especially from the rival Republican Party. With all the pros  and cons taken into account, it can be said that the whole of  the United States stands to gain from this action.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ewa K. Czaczkowska and Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: </F> "Summit Meeting After Rosati's Resignation; Popiwek--A Political  Issue"]    [Text] The government coalition met a double defeat on  Thursday [7 April]: It did not override the president's veto,  and, second, the summit meeting of the president, the prime  minister, and the head of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  will be held only after the coalition officially abandons the  candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister.    On Thursday, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, who paid a visit to  the president, made efforts to organize such a meeting. Perhaps  as soon as today the Sejm will discuss the new bill on wage  control.  <H5>  The New Bill as Soon as Today? </H5>   The coalition is of the opinion that the president's  rejection of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]  law was a political decision. The opposition claims that it  voted against it because it was a bad law. The president's veto  was not rejected because the only deputies who voted against it  were those of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD--and  not all of them at that. The deputies of the All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement [OPZZ] voted contrary to the coalition's  decisions, and a substantial number of the PSL deputies did not  take part in the ballot at all.    Before the voting, Prime Minister Waldemar Palwak said that  the debate on the law was a discussion "over who is who on the  political scene." When it turned out that the result of the  voting was negative for the government and the coalition, he did  not respond to the question of whether the government already  had another bill on wage controls and, if so, when it would be  submitted in the Sejm. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that, if  the Sejm decided to shorten the legislative procedures, the new  bill might be discussed as early as today.    "I am counting on a responsible attitude of the managers of  enterprises, on trade unions, when they have thought this issue  over," the prime minister appealed and asked not to dramatize  the situation.    Marek Borowski still maintains his opinion that the  president's veto was of a political, not a substantive, nature.  He said: "It is some kind of a success for the president;  however, it may turn into his failure if the government and the  coalition close ranks and are able to oppose the destructive  activities of Lech Walesa. As a result of this, further such  successes by the president will be impossible, and the coalition  will be strengthened. The president has decided to make himself  felt on the political scene in a manner that is detrimental to  the economy." According to Marek Borowski, the government must  start controlling wage increases with other methods, which are  more time-consuming and more difficult than the popiwek.  Treasury Partnerships may be controlled directly, other  state-run enterprises through fiscal offices. "This calls for  firm action by the government, and it is more inconvenient for  enterprises; however, in this situation, there is no better  solution. This is a challenge for the government and the  coalition," stated Borowski.    President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said that if the  Sejm amends the new popiwek law, the possibility cannot be ruled  out that the president will then sign this law.  <H5>  A Meeting Yes, Rosati No </H5>   While visiting the president, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy  tried  to arrange a summit meeting between the coalition and the  president; he also attempted to persuade the president to sign  the budget law.    After the talk, Andrzej Drzycimski once again declared on  behalf of the president the desire to meet with the coalition  leaders. However, the condition for such a talk was "an  unequivocal decision concerning the candidacy of Rosati"--that  is, abandoning it, as well as "joint topics"--the name of a new  candidate for deputy prime minister.    "Rosati is out of the question," Drzycimski repeated once  again. "The president should be consulted on the new candidacy  before it is announced to the public," the spokesman said. "If  one wants to obtain the acceptance of a candidacy, it is  customary to hold such consultations."    Following the meeting with the president, Jozef Oleksy said  that the "summit" meeting is possible "any day now." "The date  of the meeting is not up to us," stated Drzycimski. It seems  that the conditions necessary for holding this meeting may be  met no sooner than next week.    The president wants to talk with politicians who think  seriously about the country's affairs. Seriously, he  explained--that is when they do not call one another names.    During the talk with the president, Oleksy proposed holding  meetings with "the leading people" in the country, not in order  to make decisions but to agree on a joint opinion. Drzycimski  explained that the president believes that the meetings among  the leading politicians should be held within constitutional  bodies, such as the National Security Council, for instance. He  recalled that the law on the general defense duty had gotten  stuck in the government. It is worth recalling that the bill  was drafted by the military specialists from the General  Headquarters. It seems that its first chapter, which defines,  among other things, the powers of the president in the area of  controlling the issues of the state's defense, prepared in line  with the Belweder's suggestions, would probably be unacceptable  for the present coalition.    According to Drzycimski, the president has not yet decided  whether to sign the budget law and the electoral law to gmina  [smallest administrative units] councils. The Sejm speaker  feels that the president will most likely not sign the latter.  <H5>  The Defeat of the Coalition </H5>   The PSL deputies agreed that the result of the voting on the  president's veto was a definite defeat for the coalition. Roman  Jagielinski said that the defeat was caused by the fact that  some SLD as well as PSL deputies were not entirely convinced  that this law was right; in the previous voting, they were  forced to support this law, even though in the election campaign  both parties were against the popiwek. "The president's  decision was political, and we gave him good reason to make such  a decision by extending wage control to the private sector,"  Jagielinski stated. "We should draw the following conclusion  from this: It is necessary to close our ranks because there is  no alternative to the coalition. Then this defeat will turn out  to be beneficial to us."    "The irresponsible statements that a new law will be  forwarded to the Sejm are the worst. As a result of them, wages  will go up very fast," fears Maciej Manicki, who, along with  other OPZZ deputies, supported the president's veto in the Sejm  ballot. According to him, the unionists did not vote like the  rest of the coalition because they had much more important  issues in mind than merely the game played between the Belweder  and the government. It was a law that was supposed to be  retroactive--from 1 April--and was thus a violation of the law.  "The Constitutional Tribunal would immediately query it, so it  was better to put an end to it today," Manicki believes.  According to him, the fact that the union's deputies voted  differently will cause friction within the SLD Club; however, it  will only be temporary. He also draws attention to the fact  that as many as 20 PSL deputies did not vote at all.    "This was a bad law, and the opposition voted against it in  the previous voting," said Andrzej Potocki, of the Democratic  Union [UD]. "No one should have expected that we would change  our minds. We do not side with anyone in the dispute between  the coalition and the president." According to Andrzej Potocki,  before the debate, the coalition did not try to speak with the  opposition or try to persuade it to change its opinion. He said  that, if a new bill is submitted that would not have all of the  defects found in the rejected law, UD might support it because  it believes that it is necessary to curb wage increases.</p>

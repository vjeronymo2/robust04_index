			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, April 7 (AFP) -- Southern troops based in  northern Yemen bombarded the town of Dhamar, raining hundreds of  rockets on official buildings in an hour-long raid, police said  Thursday [7 April].    There were no reports on the number of casualties or the  damage caused during the attack late Wednesday by a battalion of  southern troops from Basahib, based south of Dhamar, 100  kilometres (62 miles) south of Sanaa.    Police said the bombardment followed an attack on guards  outside the Basahib camp when unidentified gunmen opened fire  from their car, without wounding anyone.    A police statement sent to AFP said the mortars had been  fired at several districts housing official buildings, the  national guard headquarters and the police station.    Northern troops did not return fire, the statement added.    The north and south armies have not been merged since former  North and South Yemen were united in May 1990.    A crisis broke out eight months ago when Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, a southerner, refused to take up his duties in the  capital Sanaa in the north, citing security fears and demanding  major political and economic reform.    Clashes between the rival armies have continued despite a  reconciliation accord signed in Amman on February 20.    In Sanaa a member of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 'Salih's  General People's Congress blamed leaders of al-Bid's Yemen  Socialist Party (YSP) for the attack saying they "were trying to  lead the country into war."    A YSP leader confirmed to AFP that the attack had taken  place  adding it had been provoked "by northern forces."    Al-Bid called on his northern rival Salih on Sunday to  withdraw all northern troops based in the centre of the country,  while in turn all southern troops in northern Yemen would pull  back to the south.    The two men were meeting for the first time since the  signing  of the Amman accord in Salalah in Oman. But their talks  concluded without any sign of ending the crisis which is  threatening to tear the country apart.    A member of the presidential council, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-  Ghani, told AFP that al-Bid's proposal for a redeployment of  troops would end up destroying unity.    He added "noone here wants war," saying the only way forward  was to continue dialogue with southern "opponents."    About 300,000 northern and southern troops are stationed in  the southern regions of Abanye and Shabwah to monitor the Yemeni  oil fields.    Although Yemen is only a small producer of about 340,000  barrels a day, control of the natural resource is essential to  ensure the survival of the government in the north or any future  creation of a southern breakaway rival.</p>

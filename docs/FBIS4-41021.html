			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleksandr Makarenko, deputy minister of foreign  affairs, spoke at a briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry today  on the results of President Leonid Kravchuk's visit to  Luxembourg and the signing of an agreement on partnership and  cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union [EU]. The  deputy minister described the agreement as the beginning of  Ukraine's integration in the united Europe. He said, in  particular, that for Ukraine the most important part of the  document is the political part, which confirms the EU's interest  in Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial  integrity. Regarding purely economic issues, Oleksandr  Makarenko said, the agreement envisages the withdrawal of any  restrictions on trade between Ukraine and EU member states. He  said, however, that although Europe, by this agreement, has  opened its doors, the speed of our integration will depend on  the speed of our reforms.</p>

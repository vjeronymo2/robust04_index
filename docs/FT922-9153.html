			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saving energy with born-again beverage cans - Geoffrey Dyer reports on the growth of the aluminium recycling sector in the US A SOPHISTICATED collection system has allowed aluminium beverage can recycling in the US to set a new record of nearly 57bn cans in 1991, up 3 per cent from the 1990 record of 55bn. The can recycling figures contribute to the growth of the American aluminium secondary industry, which over the past decade has accounted for about 30 per cent of total US aluminium supply. 'Of all the metals that are recycled today aluminium continues to be the model,' according to Mr Richard Holder, chairman of the Washington based Aluminium Association. The recycling rate for aluminium cans in 1991 was 62.4 per cent and reflects the increasing efficiency of the system through which producers pay customers for returning cans. Because of the relatively high scrap value of aluminium smelters have a strong incentive to recycle and to pay for the recovery, transportation and processing of the cans. A system has been set up with 10,000 collection points and including everyone from private businesses to boy scouts. The Aluminium Association claims the system to be so efficient that a can may be purchased, used, recycled and returned to the shelf in as little as six weeks. Technological developments have allowed for more efficient production and the weight of an aluminium beverage can is 30 per cent less than it was 20 years ago. Last year's recycling rate did fall from the 1990 rate of 63.6 per cent, but Mr Holder believes that some recyclers may have held over cans in the hope that the recession would end this year and that the aluminium prices would rise. He believes that in the long-term a recycling rate of close to 100 per cent is still a 'reasonable target'. Aluminium is an ideal metal for recycling, not just because of its high scrap value, but because it is relatively easy to recycle and can be used again and again. The benefits from recycling are both economic and environmental. Aluminium is one of the most energy-intensive materials in common use, the main requirement being the electricity needed to smelt aluminium from alumina (the intermediate material produced from bauxite ore). Recycling requires only 5 per cent of the energy that is needed to produce aluminium from bauxite. One study has estimated that doubling worldwide aluminium recovery rates would eliminate over 1m tonnes of air pollutants, including toxic fluoride. The savings on raw materials are considerable. For every tonne of resmelted aluminium, four tonnes of bauxite and 700 kg of petroleum coke and pitch are saved. Recycling also reduces the requirements of landfill space. Recyclers have gone to considerable lengths to make themselves more efficient in recent years. The scrap collection networks have been expanded, although they do not rival the schemes for beverage cans. Improvements in processing and engineering techniques, making the plants less labour-intensive, a reduction in fuel consumption and more sophisticated methods of avoiding impurities have all helped to reduce costs. Ironically, the producers of such environmentally-sound materials have found it difficult to cut costs because of the burden of environmental legislation upon them. Regulation in the 1990s has become 'much more cumbersome and burdensome", according to Mr Howard Sinclair, Vice President of Wabash Alloys in Wabash, Indiana. The 1990 Clean Air Act has created the most impact and producers have had to concentrate their minds on ways to reduce waste and pollution at every stage of the process. The enforcement, as much as the nature of the regulations, has become stricter. 'While our customers want us to lower costs and increase efficiency, the government seems to want us to increase costs,' laments Mr Sinclair. Aluminium recovered from scrap is an increasingly important part of the US aluminium supply and the 1990 figure for secondary recovery of 2.4m tonnes was an increase of 16.5 per cent from 1989. As well as cans the American aluminium industry recycles many consumer products including used motor parts, garden chairs and pots and pans. Scrap that is produced by manufacturers during processing, like clippings, cuttings and turnings, is immediately diverted to the aluminium recycling stream and 'in-house' scrap which is generated by foundries is remelted and recycled on the premises. The scrap is crushed and melted ina furnace, where other metals are added to the aluminium to alloy it. The melted aluminium is usually solidified as an ingot and sold as a number of products such as foil, wire or sheet. Some secondary producers recycle aluminium scrap into forms which are used as deoxidisers by the steel industry and into other products which are used by the chemical, coating, powder and paste industries.</p>

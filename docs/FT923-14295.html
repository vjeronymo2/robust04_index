			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Jobs: Making 'fast tracks' more empowering - Why high-fliers need help to become better delegators, listeners and team players If there is a single 'human resources' issue which helps chief executives to sleep soundly at night, it is the existence of a proven 'fast-track' process for developing their high potential young people into the leaders of the future. The maverick Lord Weinstock, head of Britain's GEC, may disagree, but leadership development and succession is at the very heart of future corporate prosperity. Hence the installation of fast-tracks by more and more companies - not just the original constituency of large multinationals, but also banks, insurance companies and other organisations. All now feel they must take young managers in their mid-20s and transform them, over the next 10-15 years of dizzy 'fast-tracking', into a high-powered elite. Yet the way that these processes operate, and the values and behaviour patterns which they promote among today's star middle-managers and tomorrow's top dogs, are in direct conflict with the popular and potentially powerful concept of 'empowerment'. Company bosses on both sides of the Atlantic are now rushing to install it (or at least espouse it), in spite of centralising pressures created by the recession. But very few of them are biting the bullet by changing their fast-track processes to encourage the development of 'empowering' behaviour in the company's central nervous system: its star managers. Instead, today's leaders are still cloning themselves. This is the stark conclusion of unpublished research done over the last couple of years by Dr Lynda Gratton, of the London Business School. Much of her hardest data is drawn from a study conducted in 1991 of more than 100 high fliers at a large European multinational. Gratton's results are impressive because she gathered observations not just from the high-fliers themselves, but from more than 1,000 subordinates, peers and bosses. The prime questions she sought to answer were whether the high-fliers were much good at the various behaviours that can be considered 'empowering', and especially whether they gave much priority to many (or any) of them. The answer in the majority of cases was a resounding 'no'. For anyone who still needs a plain person's definition of empowerment after the last 18 months of public and internal corporate hype on the subject, here goes. As organisations flatten their pyramids in order to cut costs, accelerate decision-making and become altogether more flexible and competitive, they can no longer operate in time-honoured hierarchical fashion. Instead of a series of levels which 'command and control' the one immediately beneath them, power (and information) on many issues must be delegated, decentralised and diffused. Trust must be established between bosses, peers and subordinates (to use conventional language - or 'colleagues', in the new). Individual effort within narrow departmental boundaries must be replaced by cross-functional teams. Instead of information being withheld at each successive level in the hierarchy, it must become shared - or, at least, accessible - through informal 'networking'. All this implies fundamental changes in the way that leaders behave. In assessing the 'empowering characteristics' (or otherwise) of the managers in her study, Dr Gratton asked participants to write down what they saw as the person's strengths and weaknesses (these were described politely by Gratton as their 'development needs'). The resulting descriptions were rich and varied: in total about 100 categories of behaviour were used by the participants, of which 20 were ones that are known to help create empowered organisations. The top four strengths to emerge were all individual, rather than team, ones: 'energetic and hard-working' (for 72 per cent of the high-fliers); 'analytically able' (63 per cent); 'action-orientated' (51 per cent); and 'intelligent' (46 per cent). Only then came the top empowering skill, 'ability to build teams' (45 per cent). Most other empowering behaviours, such as ability to engage in joint problem-solving, were cited as strengths for under 30 per cent of the high-fliers. As for people's 'development needs', the 100 individuals as a group were seen by two or more of the respondents - often including themselves - to be weak on half of the full 20 categories of empowerment, and not very strong on any. In particular, 42 per cent were described as expecting too much of, and being impatient towards, people with different abilities and needs; a recurrent phrase was: 'does not suffer fools gladly'. Depending upon the category, between 20 and 30 per cent were described as: abrasive; failing to share information and to keep communication open; unable to build teams; and failing to take others' views into account. Many were also poor listeners. The only goodish news, apart from most people's perceptions of their own weaknesses, was that the group was not homogenous. A significant minority did behave in an empowering manner, as well as possessing strong individual skills. Few of the results are surprising, if one considers that high-fliers tend to manage very much in their boss's image. They are selected to join the fast-track by their bosses, or their boss's bosses - all of whom will have prospered mightily by displaying the old command-and-control behaviour. In any case, the very nature of empowering behaviour is that it is almost all sideways and downward-focused. So how can bosses be expected to spot empowering behaviour from their subordinates at all? This problem is compounded by the way the fast-track operates, argues Gratton. High-fliers change jobs every 18 months or two years, seldom having time for their mistakes to catch up with them, or to establish trusting relations with people inside teams. They are measured on short-term results. They are rewarded for this and for 'managing upwards' - a polite phrase for showing the kind of behaviour which their boss appreciates. Added to this, they have only one set of role models - their 'command-and-control' bosses. So what is to be done to end this fundamental mismatch? If an organisation is really serious about empowerment, says Gratton, it must revamp systematically its processes for developing leaders: It must select individuals only after their delegation and team-building potential has been assessed in action. It should also allow entry to fast-tracks at several stages in peoples' careers. It must recognise the importance of what Gratton calls '360-degree feedback to the individual' - especially from peers and subordinates. Hardly any UK companies do this (BP and WH Smith are pioneers), and only a few in the US (including Citibank and IBM); Similarly, appraisal and evaluation must be done not just by the boss (with or without the individual's self-appraisal), and not just on short-term performance. It must treat managers as mature people who need to understand clearly their development needs and career options, and are involved closely in decisions about them. Even at human resource paragons such as IBM, this is not always the case. 'If companies really want to encourage empowerment, they've got to take some pretty firm action on things that they hold very dear', concludes Gratton. 'Without that, empowerment will remain a lot of wishful thinking.'</p>

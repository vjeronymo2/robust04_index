			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] bowed to pressure from France Wednesday [16 March] by  extending a system of minimum prices for imports of seven  species of fish by two months.    EU sources said the move, which reversed an EU statement the  previous day, was part of a deal under which Paris will drop its  opposition to the admission of Norway to the European Union.    The European Commission confirmed that the prices, due to  expire March 15, will be extended until May 17. It did not  specify there had been pressure from the French Government.    Earlier in Paris, the French Agriculture and Fisheries  Ministry said the decision was taken overnight after strong  lobbying by France.    "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that  the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of  minimum import prices," said the statement, citing Agriculture  and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech.    The prices were decided on February 4 and are aimed at  protecting EU fishermen against excessively cheap imports.  Minimum import prices were set for fish last year as well, from  February to December. [passage omitted]    Sources said that in return for the extension France had  agreed to conditions on Norway's admission to the European  Union, although no details were immediately available. [passage  omitted]    Initial reactions to the extension among French fishermen  were not positive. In Concarneau, Britanny, fishermen called  the deal "a half measure, which will have no effect long term,  and which does not solve the problem."    Union leader Yves L'Helgouac'h said: "If this measure has  been thrashed out at the expense of giving Norway membership of  the European Union, it is a dupes' market." Norway's admission  "is not a good deal for our fishing industry, which risks being  swamped even further by Norwegian fish," he added.</p>

Yohei Kono, president of the former ruling Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP), told reporters that the process of scrapping the  tax plan shows the Hosokawa administration is controlled by a  few members of the coalition.    Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] and a chief strategist in the coalition, and Yuichi  Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, reportedly played key  roles in drawing up the plan.    Kono blasted the irresponsible array of the cabinet, saying,  "if it is not Hosokawa who decided the plan, than who heads the  cabinet?"    He said the turmoil could deepen the public's distrust in  politics. [passage omitted]    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said in a party meeting  in  Yokohama, "what is going on with the responsibility of Hosokawa?  (the government and the ruling coalition parties) are in a state  of anarchy with no political responsibility."    Mori, meanwhile, urged the government to raise the  envisioned  tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen, including income and residential  tax reductions, saying "I'm skeptical about whether the 6  trillion yen will be effective (in boosting the sluggish  economy)."    He also insisted on separating cuts and increases in taxes,  saying that financial resources to cover tax reductions should  be considered after the economy begins to recover.    On an idea calling on the LDP to join the coalition, Mori  said "the LDP will not move to join (the framework of the  coalition)."    Earlier, the LDP Secretary General told reporters that the  coalition partners should have consolidated their opinions  before the announcement because the system deeply affects the  people.    The new tax plan was part of the government's expected  pump-priming package worth 15 trillion yen designed to lift the  economy out of the worst recession in the postwar era.    Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affaris  Research Council, also lashed out at Hosokawa, saying, "how is  Hosokawa feeling about the significance and the responsibility  of the remarks (he) made at the press conference?"    "I will pursue (this matter) in the Diet," he said at a  press  conference in Miyazaki, western Japan.    Hashimoto, a former finance minister, also expressed concern  that the scrapping of the new indirect tax plan could affect the  summit talks between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton  next week.

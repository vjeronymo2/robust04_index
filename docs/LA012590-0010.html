			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: UNEXPLAINED HEADACHE COULD BE TRIGGERED BY MANY  NUTRITIONAL FACTORS  </P> <P> It might be a dull, diffuse sensation or a brain-splitting migraine, but nearly  all of us suffer from the occasional headache.  </P> <P> Chronic or severe pain could signal a serious problem and requires medical  evaluation. Fortunately, most minor headaches disappear spontaneously or  respond to non-prescription pain relievers. Sometimes, though, neither scenario  applies: No medical cause can be found, yet the ache recurs.  </P> <P> If you're plagued by unexplained headaches, one place to look for clues is your  diet. At first glance, the list of possible food factors appears long. In fact,  however, food holds the answer in very few cases.  </P> <P> That said, it's true that nutritional factors can precipitate either type of  headache, more commonly the dull, diffuse kind. When such pain occurs regularly  in late morning or late afternoon, the most likely cause is simple hunger. Some  people, particularly children and pregnant women, are more sensitive than  others to the minor drop in blood sugar that is normal between meals. Skipping  meals can make the headaches worse.  </P> <P> The solution? Eat regularly, and keep meals and snacks balanced. Too many  refined starches and sugars to the exclusion of lean-protein sources leads to  rapid release of the hormone insulin. Insulin normally works to move nutrients  from the blood into the cells. But when it's released too quickly, the brain  may not receive enough nutrients, and a headache can result. Low-fat cottage  cheese and fresh fruit or part-skim mozzarella on whole-grain crackers are  excellent snack choices for people susceptible to this sort of pain.  </P> <P> Another source of headaches is iron-deficiency anemia. Women and children are  the likeliest victims, since their iron requirements are higher and deficiency  is more common. In anemia, oxygen-transport by the blood is impaired, and  insufficient oxygen to the brain translates into headache. If anemia is  suspected, a blood test can verify the diagnosis.  </P> <P> Remember, though, that iron supplements can be dangerous and should not be  taken without medical supervision. In most cases, anemia can be avoided by  eating foods naturally rich in iron, such as lean red meats, chicken and dried  beans. Consuming foods rich in Vitamin C (oranges, peppers or broccoli, for  example) along with a meat-containing meal improves absorption.  </P> <P> You might have noticed that many over-the-counter pain relievers contain  caffeine. Migraine headaches are often caused by dilation, or relaxation, of  blood vessels to the brain. Caffeine causes these vessels to constrict, thus  relieving many headaches, particularly migraines.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the body can become dependent on caffeine. Any change in  coffee-drinking habits -- either more or less than usual -- can trigger a  headache. If you suspect caffeine is the culprit, try weaning yourself away  from coffee, tea and colas. Decaffeinated teas and coffee provide an  alternative and are probably safe in reasonable quantities.  </P> <P> For a few people, reactions to certain foods and food additives can start that  horrible hammer tap-tapping in the skull. Preservations such as sodium nitrite  and nitrate, commonly used in packaged meats, may affect sensitive individuals.  Others may react to a food dye called tartrazine, or yellow No. 5, found in  many yellow and green foods, among them cake mixes, gelatins and candies. Also,  the flavor-enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG), best known for use in Chinese  foods, can produce symptoms nicknamed "Chinese restaurant syndrome," which  include a dizzy, throbbing headache.  </P> <P> If you consistently notice a headache after eating foods with these additives,  you can easily avoid them. According to Food and Drug Administration  regulations, all three must be listed by name on food labels.  </P> <P> Besides food additives, certain foods contain naturally occurring compounds to  which some people are sensitive. Foods aged or "ripened" through bacterial  action may contain tyramine, a substance related to the building blocks of  proteins, which the body converts to a potent blood-vessel constrictor. Like  caffeine, vasoconstrictors sometimes relieve headaches but can also cause them.  People taking certain drugs to treat depression are especially vulnerable to  the effects of tyramine, but it may trigger headache in others who aren't on  medication.  </P> <P> Foods high in tyramine include aged cheeses such as Cheddar and Brie, wine and  beer, yeast extracts, breads high in yeast, figs and eggplant. Another  compound, phenylethylamine, found in chocolate, cheese and alcoholic beverages  produces vasoconstriction that can lead to headache.  </P> <P> Keeping a record of food intake and headaches can help you and your physician  determine whether diet plays a role. Bear in mind that dietary factors are not  a major cause of headaches: Unless you can find a clear link, don't burden  yourself with needless diet modifications.  </P> <P> All that will do is create more stress -- probably the last thing you need.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Duck Registers With More Calories Because of Saturated Fat Content  </P> <P> Question: Over the holidays I prepared duck for the first time, and everyone  welcomed the change. But now that the applause has died down, I'm wondering how  duck compares to chicken in terms of saturated fat.  </P> <P> Answer: Duck has more. For example, 3 1/2 ounces of dark-meat chicken without  the skin contains between 9 and 10 grams of fat, depending on whether it's a  boiler or a fryer. Of that, about 2 1/2 grams is saturated fat. The same  portion of duck, by contrast, contains about 11 grams of fat, of which over  four grams is saturated. In other words, the two types of birds provide roughly  comparable amounts of fat, but the amount that is saturated is quite different.  </P> <P> Here's another way of looking at it. In the chicken, 43% of the calories come  from fat, compared to 50% in the duck. And of the total calories, 12% of those  in the chicken but more than 18% of those in the duck are from saturated fat.  </P> <P> Goose is even fattier than duck, but contains about the same proportion of  saturated fat. Three-and-a-half ounces have over 12 1/2 grams of fat, of which  4 1/2 grams -- accounting for 17% of the calories -- are saturated.  </P> <P> Q: Will eating a high-fiber diet prevent diabetes?  </P> <P> A: Scientists are trying to find out, but so far the evidence is unclear.  Several studies of the relationship between fiber intake and prevalence of  diabetes have found the disease less frequent in groups on high-fiber diets  than among those who have consumed little. Examining changes in dietary  patterns revealed that as fiber intake declined, diabetes became more common.  However, other studies have found no such effect.  </P> <P> Why the inconsistent results? Perhaps the answer lies in differences --  dietary, environmental, genetic and socioeconomic -- among the various groups  that have been studied.  </P> <P> Some studies have looked at the effects of fiber supplements on those who  already have diabetes. It is clear that some water-soluble fibers can help  control blood-sugar levels in diabetics. But how these observations relate to  preventing the disease in the first place is uncertain.  </P> <P> Results of most, but not all, studies in which high-fiber foods rather than  supplements have been used have demonstrated benefit too. But because these  diets differed in other aspects, it is difficult to separate the exclusive  effect of fiber. And once again, it's impossible to determine how the observed  effect ties in with prevention.  </P> <P> On the other hand, studies of animals who are genetically susceptible to  diabetes show that fiber helps delay onset of the disease, giving support to  several links between diabetes and fiber intake in humans.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that even without more proof of the fiber-diabetes  connection, there are plenty of good reasons to consume whole grains of various  types, and generous amounts of raw and lightly cooked fruits and vegetables,  and dried beans.  </P> <P> Q: Recently I entered the hospital for some minor surgery. As I lay in bed  recuperating, I found myself watching the intravenous fluid drip and wondering  how the procedure originated. Can you tell me?  </P> <P> A: Intravenous therapy was first used in Great Britain during the cholera  epidemic of the early 1830s. Physicians of that era generally did not  understand fluid balance. They treated their already dehydrated patients with  blood-letting and other methods that only aggravated the problem and hastened  their demise.  </P> <P> The man thought to be the first to suggest that adding fluids would be a more  rational treatment was William Brooke O'Shaugnessy. Dr. O'Shaugnessy was a  native of Limerick and a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. He originally  reported his ideas on the restoration of fluids to the Westminster Medical  Society in December, 1831.  </P> <P> A year-and-a-half later, the earliest report of the use of injections of water  with added salts appeared. Of the 25 cases recorded around that time, eight  recovered. Today we might not call this a medical breakthrough, but at the time  it was remarkable, especially since it was used only in patients who were  dangerously ill.  </P> <P> Yet it took decades before the treatment came into widespread use. One  stumbling block was that unsterile and chemically impure water caused serious  problems. In a recent article in Lancet, Dr. J.E. Cosnett observed that while  intravenous therapy was a rational idea, it appeared before our understanding  both of the body's chemistry and of microbiology were sufficiently advanced to  use it well.  </P> <P> Ironically, neither the names of Dr. O'Shaugnessy nor of Dr. Thomas Latta and  Robert Lewins of Leith, who were the first to try the treatment, are found in  any major work on the general history of medicine.  </P></p>

The government's draft budget was rejected, then a  no-confidence vote garnered 34 ayes and 25 noes, giving a  fortnight for the formation of a new executive. The ouster was  the first-ever by the regional assembly of the regional  government.    The vote represents a new set-back for the previously  all-conquering Northern League, which swept much of the board in  Northern Italy in local elections held in June, but then failed  to build on its breakthrough in voting in a group of major and  less important cities early this month.    The majority that downed Friuli Venezia Giulia's government  consisted of Left and Christian Democrats, Socialists, the  Communists, the Friuli Autonomy League, the Greens, and a couple  of independents. Opposition to the no-confidence motion came  from the League, the Republicans and the Liberals, who formed  the governing alliance, plus the neo-Fascist Italian Social  Movement and the Slate for Trieste.    The political parties have been negotiating for the  formation  of a new majority for several days. One idea is a Christian  Democrat-League alliance, which is being urged by the  neo-Fascists and the Slate for Trieste, and another a Left  Democrat-led coalition including the Communists, the Greens and  the Friuli Autonomy League with support from Christian Democrats  and Socialists.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT looks to a family of futures contracts - Proposals to rekindle the flagging interest of a deeply sceptical insurance industry The Chicago Board of Trade is considering changes to its plans to launch a range of insurance futures contracts this year, in an effort to rekindle the flagging interest of a deeply sceptical insurance industry. The contracts would allow insurance companies to hedge risks they had insured without needing to use the more usual route of reinsurance. One advantage of futures is that they can be traded quickly to take account of unforeseen events, whereas reinsurance contracts take time to renegotiate, said Professor Greg Niehaus at the business school of the University of South Carolina. Also, the futures could be useful to hedge undiversifiable risk, or what's left over after reinsurance, he said. The exchange had planned to begin trading the first of a series of insurance futures in homeowners' (or residential property) policies next month. But the CBOT's board of directors is now looking at developing a family of property futures that would be based on catastrophic losses from such events as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. These catastrophe contracts, which are still being researched, would be likely to be regional, according to Mr Richard Sandor, an executive managing director of Kidder Peabody and a CBOT board member. These would cover such risks as earthquake futures for the West Coast, tornado futures for the Midwest and hurricane futures for the East Coast. The CBOT has yet to decide whether to postpone the launch on September 25 of national homeowners' insurance futures so that catastrophe futures can be started at the same time, which is unlikely to be before December. A dual launch appeals because catastrophe futures have had a better reception from the industry than any other proposals for insurance futures made by the CBOT. Since proposing the idea in 1990, the CBOT has worked on developing futures on property and health insurance, with potential contracts to come on motor and marine insurance. But two years of conversations with the industry have stirred little enthusiasm. Mr Marc Rosenberg, vice-president for the Washington-based Insurance Information Institute, an industry lobby group, says: 'I haven't detected the slightest sign of interest by any insurer of note.' Mr Rosenberg, like many in the industry, believes the futures only duplicate the function of reinsurance, which covers underwriting losses above an agreed amount. He points out that, with all the current problems of credit quality in US insurance companies, it is unlikely that insurance regulators will be willing to embrace untested financial tools. 'Their job is to see that those they regulate aren't too creative,' said Mr Rosenberg. 'The nature of insurance is to guarantee that the money is there when the claim must be paid. And regulators are sceptical of anything that puts further risk into that equation.' Insurance company executives are loathe to get involved with any new instruments that regulators will question. Consequently, the CBOT must persuade regulators that insurance futures are viable risk management instruments that can improve a company's fortunes rather than harm them. In the US, insurance is regulated by each state and, to make the contracts viable, the exchange would have to convince regulators in at least several key states. So far, the CBOT has had little luck. It has limited approval from one state regulator, the Illinois department of insurance. And Illinois, the home state of the CBOT, has said insurance futures can only be used under its basket clause for 'undefined investments'. Such investments are restricted overall to a total of less than 10 per cent of assets or 50 per cent of shareholders' equity. This kind of approval virtually defeats the futures' purpose. If seen as an investment, they will not reduce underwriting exposure - their main purpose in the CBOT's view. It says they are not intended as a substitute for reinsurance, but as a complement to bring down underwriting risks. Acknowledging that the battle with regulators is uphill, Mr Les Rosenthal, another CBOT board member who is involved in bringing the contracts to life, said that once the exchange can educate them, they will not regard futures as 'a cowboy strategy'. Seasoned futures industry officials say the insurance industry's complaints are not new - similar complaints have come from the petroleum industry about crude oil futures, from the investment banks about bond futures and Eurodollar futures, and from Wall Street about stock index futures. All these industries were sceptical and said they wouldn't use the contracts, but today they are involved in futures for hedging. Mr Sandor said: 'It is unambiguously incorrect to view this market differently than other markets.' Those who study the industry say the CBOT is on the right path, but they believe the caution of the industry and regulators could yet doom the contracts. But Professor Stephen D'Arcy at the Department of Finance at the University of Illinois says the danger for the futures contract is 'the insurance industry will wait and see if it works, and while it waits, it won't work'. If that happens, the long-awaited launch of insurance futures - or what Mr Rosenthal of the CBOT calls 'the event of 1992' for the exchange - could fizzle out. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is researching the development of insurance futures too, although 'it is not our highest priority,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive, writes Tracy Corrigan. The exchange has not yet decided whether it will be possible to devise a standardised, tradable product which would be commercially viable.</p>

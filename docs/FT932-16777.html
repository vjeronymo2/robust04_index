			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Guarantees - are they worthless? / Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at building society 'promises' WHEN the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society launched its Best 90 account in February, it gave a guarantee that it would pay the highest 90-day rate of any of the top 10 societies or Abbey National. The guarantee lasts until at least May 1994. But since none of them has yet taken up the challenge, C&amp;G has not had to change the rates offered on Best 90's four tiers, ranging from 7.5 per cent gross to 8.55 per cent. Despite the lack of challenge, at least investors have a guarantee that is worth something. In the building society deposit market, the word 'guarantee' appears to be, in too many cases, either worthless or meaningless. 'Guaranteed differentials became fashionable in 1990 when the building societies started to launch variable bonds,' says Christine Bayliss, of Moneyfacts. 'Depending on what account they are linked to, they may be good or not worth much.' Many guarantees, for example, promise to pay a certain amount above the rate for a selected account (chosen usually because the account does not pay a competitive rate in the first place). Alliance &amp; Leicester's tax-exempt special savings account pledges to pay 4 per cent above the society's ordinary gross share rate, now 0.5 per cent. The society admits the latter is 'just about the lowest rate of interest you can get on any account.' The rate on the Tessa itself is 7.25 per cent, or 6.75 percentage points above the ordinary share rate. Competitive pressure means that rates have to be considerably higher than the guaranteed differential, effectively rendering the guarantee meaningless. Abbey National's first-issue Tessa also had a guaranteed differential, but for a greater amount - 5.5 per cent - above the bank's Instant Saver account, now paying 0.5 per cent gross. Just when this was looking as if it might become useful, Abbey launched a second-issue Tessa which pays 6.3 per cent on its lowest tier. Abbey has abandoned the guarantee. Woolwich launched a two-year investment bond in December which also guaranteed to pay 'at least 4 per cent' above the society's ordinary share rate of 1 per cent gross. The bond is tiered and its lowest rate is 7.5 per cent gross. So what is the point of the guarantee? 'It simply means that, whatever happens, the rate will always be what we promise. It is a safety net,' says the Woolwich. Similarly, Bradford &amp; Bingley's two-year bond, launched last month, offers a guaranteed 4.5 per cent gross differential over the rate on its basic Timesaver savings account, which pays 0.5 per cent gross. Interest paid on the minimum tier, starting with a Pounds 5,000 deposit is 7.25 per cent gross. Some accounts promise to hold a rate until a certain date. Yorkshire building society today is launching a postal account paying competitive rates of interest. The society guarantees to hold these until July 1. Northern Rock's Go Direct postal rates were guaranteed to April 1 when the account was re-launched at the beginning of January with 8.05 per cent gross on the Pounds 2,000-Pounds 10,000 band. It was closed to new customers on February 10. 'After the subsequent base rate cut and rumours of more to come, it was reassuring to know that these rates would stay,' says Bayliss. 'However, if the account was still open, people would still need to be mindful that these rates were issued before the last base rate cut and could, therefore, be in line for a sharp drop at the end of the guarantee period.' Unfortunately, some guarantees are only as secure as the company that provides them. Investors with Birmingham Capital Trust's 12 per cent fixed-rate Tessa were transferred to a lower rate with another provider when the loss-making account was closed at the end of last year.</p>

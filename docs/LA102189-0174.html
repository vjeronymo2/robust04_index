			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN CAN PLAY A ROLE AT THE PARTY  </P> <P> The scene at the Childs' household in El Toro was casual bordering on chaotic.  As public relations account executive Tracy Childs recalled a recent dinner  with guests, he described an adult conversation punctuated with frequent  admonitions to his sons, 3-year-old Aaron and 15-month-old Timothy:  </P> <P> "Aaron, don't stand on the table."  </P> <P> "Aaron, don't throw food on the floor."  </P> <P> "Timothy, don't eat the food Aaron threw on the floor."  </P> <P> Entertaining with children requires certain adjustments, Childs pointed out.  </P> <P> That has always been true. But those adjustments may be a greater challenge in  a world where both parents work, where many first-time parents are older, where  time is at a premium and so are baby-sitters. It's easy enough to forgo pressed  linens and polished silver and to limit the menu to one or two courses that can  be managed without help. But the tough question remains -- what shall we do  with the children?  </P> <P> For an increasing number of Orange County couples, the answer is, "Bring them  along."  </P> <P> Children almost always are included when Childs and his wife, Susan, get  together with friends. While it may take some extra organizing to work around  toddlers' prodigious energy and early bedtime, entertaining often seems simpler  this way.  </P> <P> Their preferred style always has been informal, he noted. But now, "our  entertaining is more family-oriented -- and it starts much earlier," he said  with a laugh. "By 7 o'clock, we're winding down."  </P> <P> When childless friends are invited, they arrange to begin the evening at the  end of the children's day, just before their 7:30 bedtime. But that doesn't  happen often.  </P> <P> "We don't have a whole lot of childless friends over anymore," Childs said.  "It's hard -- they can't relate to our life style."  </P> <P> It's a life style that is often out of sync with that of single friends and  co-workers. Weekends are for families, not football games. Couples who have  been away from their children all day are reluctant to leave them with a sitter  (if they could find one) in the evenings. And the urban custom of waiting out  the evening traffic jam at "happy hour" doesn't work for working parents.  Instead of hanging around for two-for-one cocktails and free bean dip, they  head straight home for cranberry juice and Ritz crackers with the kids.  </P> <P> A Tustin pharmaceutical sales representative, however, has found a way to share  that after-hours camaraderie with her family.  </P> <P> "Because I work, I always look forward to happy hour, so usually I have it at  my house," said Cathy Paolini.  </P> <P> Andrew, 3 1/2, and Lauren, 2, enjoy the appetizers and the company almost as  much as she does, Cathy said.  </P> <P> "They love it! When I tell them company's coming, they get excited, and keep  asking, 'Are they here yet?' "  </P> <P> Paolini and her husband, Frank, service manager for an automotive services  company in Long Beach, frequently entertain "just for fun."  </P> <P> "I enjoy cooking and getting people together, usually in groups of eight or 10,  including children," she said. "Everyone raves about what I can do in a short  amount of time."  </P> <P> Typically, the Paolinis' hospitality revolves around a barbecue in the back  yard, where the children play croquet and roast marshmallows in the fire pit  after dinner. Occupying the little ones is easier when older children help  entertain them, Paolini said.  </P> <P> "Probably the most formal entertaining we do is with a monthly dinner group,"  she noted.  </P> <P> Several couples regularly take turns hosting a formal dinner party, she  explained. A baby-sitting pool is formed by four families who hire two sitters  to watch all their children at one house. Videos are rented or treats are  provided for them. Usually they are fed ahead of time, but sometimes they are  given a meal together.  </P> <P> "It's fairly inexpensive," Paolini said. "They get something special and we get  something special."  </P> <P> Something special for the children is the key to making the occasion enjoyable  for everyone, according to Donna Alexander of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "We try as much as possible to invite someone who has children when we  entertain," she said.  </P> <P> It's more fun for 3 1/2-year-old Kristen that way. And after waiting 19 years  for their first child, Donna and her husband, Richard, aren't about to exclude  her from gatherings with friends.  </P> <P> Often the excitement of guests her own age is sufficient to keep Kristen  entertained while her parents visit. Sometimes, however, the excitement is too  much.  </P> <P> All children misbehave before guests at times, Alexander pointed out. "It's as  if they're thinking, 'If I'm going to be naughty, this is the time to do it.' "  Toddlers aren't always "party people," she noted, and may not be at their best  in a crowd.  </P> <P> Still, it is possible to avoid unpleasant scenes with an overstimulated child  without giving up your social life.  </P> <P> "The first thing we've done is to send Kristen to manners class," Alexander  said.  </P> <P> Besides learning to say "please" and "thank you," she now helps serve the  guests and performs introductions with ease. To encourage growing social skills  within a preschooler's limits, her parents also have changed their style of  entertaining.  </P> <P> They no longer serve buffet-style at large parties as they did before Kristen  was born. Instead, the Alexander family opts for smaller, more intimate  sit-down dinners with one or two other families. The children sometimes eat at  a separate table, but they have the same menu -- there is almost never any  reason to vary the food just for children, Alexander contends. And if the  children become restive before their parents' conversation is over, that's a  good time to bring out dessert, she said.  </P> <P> But Alexander also has a backup system -- a "prize bag.".  </P> <P> When there are no children to play with or Kristen begins to tire of the  activity, "I bring out something she's absolutely never seen before. We try to  keep new videotapes on hand, too," she said.  </P> <P> Alexander tries not to intrude on the children's fun when they are playing in  the family room. Allowing them the freedom to wreak a little havoc there while  adults visit in the living room "usually give us enough time," she said.  </P> <P> "When you've been alone as many years as we were, a child changes your life,  probably more than getting married did," Alexander mused.  </P> <P> Her friends understand that. Many of them also waited a number of years to  start a family and are happy to make the adjustments.  </P> <P> As Alexander remarked wryly: "Friends never balk at including Kristen. I'm the  one who gets up-tight."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE ARTS  </P> <P> A standing-room-only crowd of 300 Latino artists assembled in East Los Angeles  on Monday night to voice their hopes for how money from the new $20-million Los  Angeles Endowment for the Arts is spent. The throng, like recent gatherings of  musicians and Skid Row and black artists, expressed a variety of needs for the  municipal cultural plan whose spending guidelines are still being developed.  Latino artists have been shut out from major Latino arts institutions, said  Jose Armand, director of Latino Ensemble, and need spaces to rehearse, perform  and exhibit their art. "It's time to open some doors, heal some wounds and move  forward as part of the multicultural expression of L.A.," he said. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

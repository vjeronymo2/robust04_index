			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Swedish-UK groups win rail contract - Go-ahead for controversial link to Stockholm's main airport One of Sweden's biggest infrastructure projects was launched yesterday when a SKr4.5bn (Dollars 584m) contract to build a controversial rail link between Stockholm and the city's main Arlanda airport was awarded to a Swedish-British consortium. GEC Alsthom and Mowlem from the UK will be responsible for delivery of trains, tracks and switches for the 20km link, while the Swedish companies NCC, Siab and Kraftbyggarna will carry out the construction. Work will begin next year and is expected to take four years. The contract has been opposed by the opposition Social Democrats, the likely winners of next month's general election, who have said they will try to get out of it. The party wants a greater state involvement in the project. Most of the financing will be private, although there will also be a government grant and loan. The consortium partners are expected to put about SKr700m of equity into the project and raise about SKr2bn in the capital markets. Although the government will provide a SKr850m grant and a conditional loan of up to SKr1bn, it will not guarantee the private-sector fin-ancing. The consortium says 4m passengers a year need to use the link by the year 2000 for it to break even. But the viability has been openly questioned, given the extent of competition from bus and taxi services and good road links. Mr Mats Odell, Sweden's communications minister, said the project would have significant environmental benefits, with much road traffic switching to rail. If the state-owned Swedish railtrack and rail companies, Banverket and SJ, had won the contract it would have cost taxpayers SKr3bn more, he added. GEC Alsthom was involved with Mowlem in the Manchester Metrolink - the UK's first privately financed rail project - and it was responsible for the turnkey delivery of London's Dockland Light Railway. NCC is Sweden's largest construction company in civil engineering. The project will involve the construction of 20km of double-tracked railway for high-speed trains, three underground train terminals at Arlanda, and modifications to the central rail station in Stockholm. The consortium - which beat a rival bid from Asea Brown Boveri, Skanska and SJ - has a 45-year mandate to operate the shuttle, although all fixed assets will be handed over to the government in 1998.</p>

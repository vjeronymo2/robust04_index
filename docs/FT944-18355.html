			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK banks charge most for EU money transfers: Payment times fail to meet voluntary targets British banks charge the most for transferring money across European borders, but complete the payments faster than any of their European Union counterparts, a survey from the European Commission said yesterday. The survey also shows it costs more and takes longer to transfer money between member states in the EU than it did a year ago. The performance of EU banks falls well short of voluntary targets on the expense and speed of cross-border payments set by Brussels 10 months ago. The research is likely to lead to legislation from the Commission. Such a move would cheer consumer groups and small businesses that for years have condemned bank service quality. According to the report, Europe's businesses and consumers pay an average Ecu25.4 (Pounds 20) per Ecu100 cross-border payment, Ecu2 more than they paid a year ago. The average total time for a transaction is almost five working days, with averages in the member states ranging from three to eight working days. UK banks charge the most for sending a payment, followed by France and Portugal. Charges are lowest in the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg. Banks in Greece charge the most for exchanging foreign currency, and the UK and Belgium the second-most. Overall, costs are highest in France, the UK and Greece, and lowest in Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The British Bankers' Association said it was disappointed that the survey was carried out so quickly after the initial survey a year ago. It said: 'This did not leave time for in-depth analysis.' The survey targeted 352 bank branches, carrying out 1,000 urgent money transfers and more than 100 non-urgent transfers. On average, it cost less to send a non-urgent transfer, and those were carried out more quickly. Banks in Portugal, Ireland and Italy were the slowest to send, while banks in Spain, Luxembourg and again Portugal, the slowest to receive. Service was most efficient in the UK. The banks were ordered to charge the sender all the costs for the cross-border payments so that the beneficiary would get the full amount. But charging at both ends occurred in 36 per cent of the urgent transfers.</p>

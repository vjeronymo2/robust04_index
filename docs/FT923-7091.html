			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Industrial policy THIS WEEK'S report that the US government may wind down its funding for Sematech, the semiconductor research consortium, will cause satisfaction in various quarters. Set up in 1987 to help US semiconductor manufacturers tackle Japanese competition, Sematech was an isolated example of US taxpayers' money being spent on industrial policy in the European manner. If the semiconductor manufacturers are now to be left to their own devices, the principle of free markets is apparently reaffirmed. It may not be that simple. Sematech's demise is far from certain. If it comes, it will be at least partly because the programme has achieved its object. In essence, this was to demonstrate that state-of-the-art semiconductors could be made using only US equipment. This could not have been said five years ago. According to this week's report from the US General Accounting Office, it should be true by the end of this year. The contrast with such EC initiatives as the Jessi semiconductor programme is instructive. Jessi is bigger, more complex and more diverse in its objectives. It is also something of a mess. The difference may be traceable to the fact that Sematech was born in the ideologically hostile environment of the Reagan years. This gave it three starting advantages: a restricted budget - Dollars 500m of government money in all, a quarter the size of Jessi; correspondingly modest and achievable aims; and senior figures from the semiconductor industry rather than bureaucrats to run it. Granted, the wider effects of the project are not easy to define. At the outset, the underlying objective was to stop the US semiconductor industry's decline in world market share, then running at 3 per cent a year. The decline has duly been arrested. But this will have more to do with the achievements of individual US companies than with any technological advances produced by Sematech. The US industry also has a habit of holding market share during recessions and losing it again dramatically in the next upturn. It might be queried whether the Sematech experiment will be repeated in the US. It is hard to envisage another industry arousing the same protectionist fervour as semiconductors, which are central to the future of the wider electronics industry. In addition, the argument that domestic production of advanced semiconductors is essential to national security has lost some of its force with the end of the cold war. The Japanese electronics industry, too, is in a much more chastened mood than five years ago, partly because of the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble. It is therefore possible that Sematech will prove a one-off instance of co-ordinated industrial policy in the US. Either way, it points an awkward moral: that those countries which have least need of such policies are most likely to succeed with them.</p>

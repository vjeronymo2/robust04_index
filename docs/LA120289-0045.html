			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS PUMPED UP ABOUT NEW TEAMMATE  </P> <P> Mark Langston's signing with the Angels wasn't the best news Sandy Alderson  heard Friday.  </P> <P> "Well, congratulate the Angels," said Alderson, general manager of the World  Series champion Oakland Athletics. He paused, obviously thinking about his own  club's concerns. "I think," he added somberly.  </P> <P> Angel players and coaches exulted over the signing of Langston, interpreting  the addition of the 29-year-old left-hander as a sign of the club's commitment  to the future and proclaiming that his $16-million, five-year contract won't  spark envy among his teammates.  </P> <P> "Getting a World Series ring on our fingers at the end of '90, that's the only  thing we're thinking about," right-hander Bert Blyleven said. "I don't think  the players are jealous. Other people see the big money, but we don't talk  about that among ourselves.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased we got Mark Langston. He's been very consistent and I know he  wants to play on a winning ballclub. This shows that (General Manager) Mike  Port really wants to put a winning team on the field. I think everybody in the  organization has to feel pleased."  </P> <P> And apparently they do.  </P> <P> "It's exciting," Wally Joyner said. "I think this will help us close the gap  between us and the A's. One of the reasons we went after Mark Langston was to  better the ballclub. This is not going to do anything but improve our club and  our staff. Hopefully, down the line there's a couple of players left that they  might sign."  </P> <P> Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, was skeptical about the news  until he was repeatedly reassured that Langston's signing was certain.  </P> <P> "If that's the case, it's great," said Lachemann, whose staff's earned-run  average of 3.28 was second-best in the American League last season. "Obviously,  we've improved the ballclub.  </P> <P> "Mark's been a great pitcher in our league before he went over to the National  League. It's an indication that (owner Gene) Autry and Mike Port are really  concentrating on trying to win. They realize we had a very fine year but came  up eight games short. This is an indication they want not just a winning  season.  </P> <P> "When you say winning, you talk about being over .500, but really winning is  what Oakland did this year, winning the pennant and the Series."  </P> <P> Lachemann said he knew Langston casually from the pitcher's time in Seattle and  is already looking forward to working with him in spring training.  </P> <P> "I was relatively eager for spring training three days after the season ended,"  Lachemann said. "This makes everything that much easier."  </P> <P> Blyleven is also anticipating Langston's arrival because he expects to reap a  financial benefit of sorts.  </P> <P> "Now maybe Chuck Finley will leave me alone and won't bother me to buy him  lunch all the time," Blyleven said. "Mark Langston makes more money, and Chuck  will probably hook onto him now."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND DROPS FISCAL BOMB  </P> <P> The National Party government today announced it will bail out the country's  biggest bank as part of a triple economic bombshell that sent financial markets  into a frenzy.  </P> <P> Just three days after taking office, Prime Minister Jim Bolger unveiled plans  for the $380-million rescue of the Bank of New Zealand.  </P> <P> He also said the budget will have to be rewritten and that the government will  have to borrow an extra $740 million.  </P> <P> The truth had to be told on the economy, however shocking, he said at a news  conference. "The only way we are going to get confidence back into New Zealand  is for people to have figures they can believe and trust."  </P> <P> Bolger has accused the Labor government, swept from power in the Oct. 27  general election, of hiding the depth of New Zealand's economic problems.  </P></p>

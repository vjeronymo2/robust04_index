			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POLICE ARREST TUTU'S WIFE  </P> <P> Police arrested the wife of Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and about 200  other women in central Cape Town as they protested South African capital  punishment and the detention of children. "I'm very proud," Tutu said after  hearing that his wife, Leah, was arrested while trying to march to the British  Embassy to ask Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to intercede on the issues.  "The women have shown us up. They have shown us how to organize these things."  The march defied a ban on open-air protests. The women were released later  pending a hearing. In another incident, police fired shotguns and tear gas in  clashes with hundreds of students in Cape Town's Colored (mixed-race) suburbs.  Three students were wounded in the anti-apartheid protest.  </P></p>

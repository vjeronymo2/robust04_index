			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Carousel - Theatre At the heart of the National Theatre production of Carousel - which has just transferred to the Shaftesbury - is Joanna Riding's performance as Julie Jordan. After the show is over, what haunts you longest is her face. With its wider-than-wide cheekbones, its distant, shadowed eyes, and its grave composure (occasionally ravished by a smile), it is ideal for the loyal, troubled, loving Julie. Everything Riding does - in speech, song, body language, silence or stillness - is infinitely touching, and full of truth. She is more real than anyone we expect to encounter in a musical. Her performance alone is worth the price of admission; and Nicholas Hytner's staging of the Rodgers-Hammerstein show has many other marvellous features. I adore several of the songs. I love Hytner's pacing of every scene, the way Bob Crowley's sets seamlessly revolve, and everything to do with Riding's Julie and Michael Hayden's Billy Bigelow. And I am grateful for the unobtrusiveness of the amplification, and the lack of School of Elaine Page vocalisation. It would, however, be hard to leave the theatre borne on a wave of unmixed delight. The folks from Heaven are blaring, schoolmistressy creeps. Meg Johnson (replacing Patricia Routledge in the National's cast) has neither the vocal range nor the earthmother authority for Nettie; and Clive Rowe's way of acting Mr Snow as a witless Mr Slow is horrid. Rodgers and Hammerstein are simply too complacent in their presentation of women's he-hit-me-and-it-felt-like-a-kiss passivity. And Hytner actually deepens this flaw: he beefs up the sex-and-violence aspect and yet evades the female masochism the show portrays. The biggest single hit in this Carousel is the pas de deux for Julie's daughter Louise (Bonnie Moore) and a fairground boy (Stanislas Tchassov). This, and the other dances, were the late Kenneth MacMillan's last choreography. They are, like everything he ever made, full of little infelicities - and, like all his best ballets, full of basic large-minded strengths. The pas de deux, though repetitiously adorned with lifts, flips and catches that many dance-goers will know from such MacMillan ballets as Romeo and Juliet and Manon, has nonetheless a harsh, headlong urgency that is moving. It is curious which of Carousel's several famous songs work best in context. I find that (though it certainly jerks my tears) 'You'll Never Walk Alone' rings hollow. But Carrie's 'Mister Snow', for all its winsomeness and despite Katrina Murphy's tremulous singing, really is a ravishing lyric outpouring; Julie's resigned 'What's the Use of Wond'rin' speaks right to the heart; and Billy's Act One soliloquy looks right forward to Bernstein and Sondheim, though they never matched it. As for 'If I Loved You', it is a miracle of feeling and irony. The scene in which it first occurs, with Julie and Billy fluctuating between timidity and fearlessness on the brink of love, is Carousel's profound core, and here played with perfect sensitivity. By the highest standards - Show Boat, The Boys from Syracuse, Annie Get Your Gun - Carousel is not a great musical. There is a saccharine blend of operetta and vaudeville. (A 1945 musical with no jazz and no swing]) But it is far more melodic, subtle, and humane than any musical from the last 30 years. Right now, Carousel is the best musical in town.</p>

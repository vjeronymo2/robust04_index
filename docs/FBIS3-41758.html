[Belyayev]Unfortunately, it is getting worse. This </H3>  year there was an avalanche of morbidity due to diphtheria. In 9  months, 7,628 cases of diphtheria were recorded and 300 persons  died. Morbidity due to pertussis, measles, and other infections  that may be controlled by vaccine prophylaxis also increased.    There are several reasons for this crisis. People's immune  defense of their bodies has weakened because of a deterioration  of food quality. Energy hunger is now being observed among 20  percent of the population. And constant stress situations  because of uncertainty regarding tomorrow are affecting the  human immune system. In addition, in the past 2 years, the  public's faith in vaccines has been undermined as a result of an  antivaccine campaign in certain parts of the mass media. We were  only able to correct the situation at the end of this past year  by initiating propaganda for wide-scale vaccination of the  population. But time had already been lost.    Yet another reason for the increase in morbidity due to  diphtheria and diseases in its group is hidden in the fact that  physicians have begun to fear giving vaccinations because of  possible complications and contraindications. Instead of  preparing a contingent for vaccination, they simply reduce their  number. We have not raised the question of mass vaccination very  strictly. And Russia is no exception here. In the United States,  the most democratic country with private health care, a child  with no vaccination record is not even allowed near a school.  Even our emigrants there write letters to the committee  requesting that their vaccination records be sent.  [Bayduzhiy]And when, in your opinion, will it be  possible to change this situation?  [Belyayev]A headquarters for the fight against  diphtheria has now been created. The government has passed a  special decree for it and has begun allocating money. We had  planned to vaccinate the entire population by the beginning of  1994. Because of insufficient production of the vaccine,  however, this will evidently only be possible by the end of the  year. By that time, morbidity due to diphtheria should fall. The  same applies to other diseases in its group.  [Bayduzhiy]With diphtheria things are more or less  clear. But the worsening of the sanitary-epidemiological  situation in the country is hardly tied to an outbreak of  morbidity due to it alone...  [Belyayev]The rapid spread of three other groups of  infections is worrying us greatly. First, there are intestinal  diseases, among which dysentery and cholera stand out. Here the  situation is exacerbated by large migration flows, and this  summer was a difficult one for our service. Eighteen cases where  cholera was carried into Russia from distant countries were  recorded. It was only thanks to emergency efforts that the  situation was kept under control. A program to protect Russia's  boundaries and territories from dangerous human, animal, and  plant diseases being carried in from abroad has now been  developed. It will be presented to the government this month.    Recently, however, natural foci of the following infections  have been revived in Russia herself: malaria, fever, and plague.  Ten natural foci of plague alone have been counted on her  territory. Among them, the Astrakhan and Kalmykia foci have  recently become highly active. Plague causative agent is  beginning to circulate actively among the animals there.  People's access to these rayons has been sharply restricted;  however, a falloff in discipline could lead to very negative  consequences.    And finally, there is yet another group of infections with  increasing morbidity -- venereal diseases. This year, 30,000  cases of early syphilis have been recorded. The level has never  been this high since the war. This is especially alarming  against the background of the growing threat of AIDS. Despite  the fact that 688 HIV-infected individuals have been registered  in Russia, we have still been able to hold back the onslaught of  AIDS. It is important to do so as long as possible until an  antitoxin to this infection is found.  [Bayduzhiy]Do they understand how serious the  sanitary-epidemiological situation is in the government?  [Belyayev]If they did not, Russia would already have  millions of patients suffering from infectious diseases. The  situation in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where a catastrophic  increase in morbidity has occurred, would have been repeated.  Everyone, including the president, is working with us. A concept  and federal program for development of sanitary-epidemiological  monitoring has been developed. The service has the status of an  independent service, and by law, no one has the right to  intervene in our activity.  [Bayduzhiy]And what attempts have there been?  [Belyayev]As soon as the service began to acquire  authority and influence that was unanticipated by many,  individuals appeared who desired to take it into their hands.  This included both local authorities and the Ministry of health,  who wanted to subordinate it to itself. The problem of  counteracting mafia structures, which given our poverty, are  trying to influence the service's specialists through bribes, is  becoming increasing acute. Incidentally, financing is perhaps  the most painful issue for us. Since September we have been in  no way able to increase our workers' wages by a factor of 1.8 --  a measure stipulated by presidential edict. Unlike physicians at  medical institutions, who receive their salaries from the local  budget, workers of the independent sanitary-epidemiological  monitoring service are unable to do so. As a result, a stream of  specialists are leaving the service. This is forcing us to seek  the possibility of including nonbugdet funds by introducing a  charge for our services. Such practical measures evoke  criticism, but we cannot survive otherwise.  [Bayduzhiy]A couple of years ago any conversation  about sanitary-epidemiological problems inevitably came around  to the total absence of any laws in this area. Today there are  laws. But do they work?  [Cheburayev]The first law, titled ``Regarding  Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being,'' was issued in 1991. It  declared principles that at the time were absolutely new for the  USSR and Russia: people's right to a clean environment and  participation in its protection, the obligation of government  bodies to inform the public of the ecological situation, and the  need to compensate for damage to health. In reality, however,  the mechanisms of realizing these policies did not exist, and  some of them, for example, the opportunity for the public to  participate in developing an environmental protection policy or  the right to financial compensation for damage inflicted to  health, only existed on paper. Problems of a methodological  nature became the great obstacle here. How, for example, would  it be possible to isolate the role of any one enterprise in  harming a person's health as a result of emissions from other  factors such as the person's own harmful habits, his heredity,  and his unhealthy way of life? Perhaps we have only succeeded in  realizing the principle of openness of information most  completely. All of the data that the service has regarding the  sanitary-epidemiological situation is accessible and published  regularly.  [Bayduzhiy]Does the service have enough economic  levers to act upon the sanitary-epidemiological situation?  [Belyayev]We can fine a violator three months' wages.  And we recently received the right to fine enterprises. Much  remains to be regulated, however. Today, for example, it is very  difficult to halt construction that is violating public health  standards. Before, everything was simple -- an instruction was  given to the bank, which was a government structure, and it  halted financing of the construction. Now with the commercial  banks, nothing can be done. Or take another example. The legal  board has taken a document regarding compensating citizens for  damage inflicted on their health that we agreed upon with  interested departments and has been tossing it around under  various pretexts for half a year already. Obviously, as soon as  it is approved, there will be a squall of requests from the  public, and they are afraid of this. I think, however, that we  will nevertheless push through a similar policy, especially  since it is fixed in the draft of the new constitution.  [Bayduzhiy]In essence, such a measure would mean a  revolution in the government's relationship to the public's  health.  [Belyayev]Yes, but it is not coming to us easily.  Some day, when I am retired, I will write my memoirs about how  all of this happened.  [Bayduzhiy]But here again comes the question of  whether it will be possible to transform what is written on  paper into real life. As far as I know, the prepared draft of  the law titled ``Regarding Providing the Public With Drinking  Water'' contains a provision something like the following: Water  line owners must compensate the public for damage to their  health resulting from consumption of poor-quality water. In some  specialists' opinion, in practice, even in the first year after  it takes effect, the law will result in the ruin of most water  supply services. Can such a policy be implemented?  [Cheburayev]Even if it cannot, it is no reason for  changing the law. The main thing is to formulate the task and  begin performing it. In this case, the threat of fines and  actions will compel water suppliers to make the expenditures to  modernize their equipment. This will inevitably make water more  expensive, and so be it. Today in our country, 25 to 27 percent  of drinking water goes for industrial purposes, and in some  cities the figure is as high as 50-60 percent. Naturally, in the  event of such a policy, there will not be enough purification  facilities or reagents. The pattern of squandering nature must  be changed.  [Bayduzhiy]The leadership of the Russian Federation  State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, together  with other representatives of the Russian Council of Public  Health Physicians, became engaged in the preelection conflict as  a part of the ``Kedr'' [cedar] block. What dictated this step?  [Cheburayev]Years of work in the  sanitary-epidemiological monitoring system have shown that it is  impossible to improve the situation regarding protecting the  environment and human health at the level of competence  possessed by the previous legislature. There is no system to the  legislation that has been passed. Thus, individual laws  regarding policy in the area of handling radioactive wastes and  nuclear power generation have been developed in the absence of  general legislation about radiation safety. That is putting the  cart before the horse. Completely unacceptable policies are  being put into other laws at the very moment of their  development. In the Principles of the Law Regarding Labor  Safety, for example, compensation and benefits for harmful labor  conditions are stipulated. The measure appears to be  progressive, but in reality, it stimulates work in dangerous  industries and, in essence, selling one's health. And in our  country today such workplaces number 12 million. The law should  have stipulated another solution to this problem that is termed  ``protection by time.'' Essentially, this means that if it is  hazardous to work under certain conditions for an entire work  day, the work day should be reduced to the safe limit, whether  6.3 hours or even 30 minutes, and the person should receive a  full day's wages. Benefits and compensation may only remain in  situations involving no damage to health during work but rather  the risk accompanying work as, for example, in the case of  pilots or miners.    Without the development of competent legislation and entry  into parliament, it will not be possible to change the attitude  toward protecting the environment and human health. The election  of ``Kedr'' to parliament was necessary because unlike many  other ``green'' parties and movements, it does not talk but  really acts. In today's situation, this is very important.  <H5>  ITAR-Tass Postscript </H5>   The plan of the State Special Program for Ensuring the  Russians' Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being in 1994-1996,  which was prepared by the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and presented to the Russian  Federation government for consideration, has been tabled for a  month for revision. The principal comments made at the  government's meeting on 2 December concerned reducing proposed  expenditures for sanitary and epidemiological measures and  tightening the public health service's control over enterprises'  and organizations' ecologically harzardous activities. Instead  of having the state committee plan expenditures for equipment to  neutralize toxic wastes, the Soviet recommended that factors  without such neutralizers be shut down. It has been proposed  that the total expenditure estimate, which initially amounted to  70 billion rubles, be sharply cut.</p>

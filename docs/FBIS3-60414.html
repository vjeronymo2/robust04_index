"As an Eastern country with our own culture, traditions, and  strong religious upbringing, we will not employ such methods,"  Health Minister Suyudi told reporters after meeting with  President Suharto at Bina Graha Palace on Monday, 13 December.    Criticism has recently been heard from ulemas, who question  the methods of the anti-AIDS campaign and the recommendation  that people who frequently service women use condoms. They  believe that such tactics are tantamount to legalizing  prostitution. [passage omitted]    According to the minister, condoms should be used to prevent  the spread of AIDS, but society only approves of this method  being employed by people who are already infected with AIDS so  that the disease will not be transmitted to others, such as  their wives or spouses.

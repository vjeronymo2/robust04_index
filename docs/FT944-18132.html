			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Way open to wider review of rulebook Mr Tony Blair's pledge to redraft Labour's 'objects and objectives' will focus on the future of the party's controversial commitment to public ownership. The commitment, usually referred to in verbal shorthand as Clause 4, is more properly described as sub-clause four of Clause IV of the 13-page statement of constitutional rules. In language familiar to all party members the sub-clause pledges widespread nationalisation. Both supporters and critics of the leadership assumed that the well-known clause would be the main target of Mr Blair's plans to modernise the party's image. However, modernisers pointed out that his statement also opens the way for a much wider review of all 13 clauses in the rulebook. Many are uncontroversial. Clause I, for example, simply states the party's name, while others deal with issues such as membership subscriptions and the mechanics of elections. But there may be pressure for a fresh look at rule V7c, which requires most members to join a union; and at Clause IX, which describes the composition and powers of the national executive committee. The future of the union-dominated NEC has emerged this week as a target for change by modernising pressure groups such as the Labour Co-ordinating Committee. Mr Blair gave no indication of the form in which his proposals for change will be presented. But his speech ruled out widespread state control as a means of social change. Using language designed to mollify opponents, he said Labour would defend public services - including the railways and the Post Office. Mr John Prescott, the Labour deputy leader, said the revised statement of values would not rule out state control. 'Anything that I am involved in as an alternative will be putting forward that public ownership still features in the Labour approach to these matters,' he said on BBC television. The statement is also likely to include commitments on devolution, discrimination, trade union rights, freedom of information, democratic rights and social justice. Mr Blair's substantial majority on the NEC, combined with the support of Mr Prescott, will allow him to ignore leftwing opposition in the short term. However, amendments to the rules will have to be approved by next year's party conference, giving rank and file critics a year to try to win sufficient support to block any changes.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MASSENBURG IS A REAL SUCCESS STORY  </P> <P> These have been three upside-down years for Maryland's Tony Massenburg.  </P> <P> Since joining the Terrapin basketball program, he suffered through the  hurricane of innuendo that followed the death of Len Bias. Then he was forced  to sit out his sophomore year on academic suspension, a sojourn that was  extended through the first semester last year so he could get his grades up to  the satisfaction of Coach Bob Wade.  </P> <P> Even after Maryland's successful season last year, his dreams of playing for a  Top 10 school were dashed among the debris following the exit of six Maryland  players through transfer, academic ineligibility, red-shirting and suspension.  </P> <P> "It hasn't been quiet," Massenburg said. "I think my freshman year was probably  the quietest in terms of things going on."  </P> <P> Yet, here he is, after three years of turmoil, the Terrapins' leading scorer  who has also been honored for making the Athletic Director's Honor Roll, which  salutes student-athletes with a grade-point average of 3.0 or better.  </P> <P> "Tony has done a remarkable job," Wade said. "When I came here he was on  academic suspension. He's worked hard in the classroom and he's done an  excellent job trying to perfect himself as a basketball player. . . . He  could've given up a long time ago but he hung in there and he's gotten his  priorities in order."  </P> <P> It hasn't been easy for this 6-foot-9 junior from Sussex, Va.  </P> <P> "After the death of my teammate (Len Bias) things sort of got turned upside  down," Massenburg said. "I was right in the middle of it and I did a lot of  suffering because of the things that were going on and the probing that was  taking place."  </P> <P> Massenburg said he found himself accused of being on drugs, selling drugs, and  of being a college dropout when he was forced to red-shirt the 1986-87 season  after academic difficulties left him on academic suspension. He declined to  discuss the incident.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of people saying, 'He'll never play for Maryland again. He's  washed up. He'll never playing any more,"' Massenburg said.  </P> <P> "I had some terrible things said about me the year I didn't play. I went back  home and some rumors got spread around that I was selling drugs and that I had  flunked out of school. . . . I was still very much in school and very much into  basketball. I just wasn't playing on the team that year."  </P> <P> So, while the Terps were struggling through a season that saw them go winless  in 14 Atlantic Coast Conference games, Massenburg was helpless.  </P> <P> "Between my freshman year and my sophomore year I really improved a lot," he  said. "I could see where I could help the team. Sitting down really hurt."  </P> <P> It's a hurt that Massenburg has turned into something positive.  </P> <P> "The first year I sat out really did me a lot of good," Massenburg said. "I  didn't want to. I was forced to. But, in reality, it really helped me. . . . I  learned a lot. I grew up a lot as a person. If I hadn't already learned how to  face adversity, I learned how to face it then. I sort of found myself."  </P> <P> In spite of that progress, Wade forced Massenburg to sit out the first seven  games of last season to concentrate on his studies. When he finally did get  back into a Terrapin uniform, it was an auspicious return.  </P> <P> Twenty pounds heavier and stronger from working with weights, Massenburg  dominated inside, scoring 25 points and leading Maryland to an 82-77 victory  over South Carolina.  </P> <P> "That was like a dream," Massenburg said of that game. "I had worked in the gym  a lot by myself and prayed that I would come back and make an impact and do the  things I was capable of doing."  </P> <P> Massenburg wound averaging 10.1 points for the Terps, who finished 18-13 and  advanced to the second round of the NCAA post-season tournament with lineup  sporting only two seniors.  </P> <P> "Last year had me thinking, 'It's finally over. We're finally going to get on  track. We're going to win. We're going to present a positive image on the  University of Maryland once again,' " Massenburg said.  </P> <P> It wasn't to be. Freshman sensation Brian Williams transferred to Arizona. Two  other players also transferred. Guard Rudy Archer was ruled academically  ineligible, guard Teyon McCoy decided to red-shirt this season, and Rodney  Walker was suspended from the team.  </P> <P> The Terps went the entire month of January without a win, losing nine games,  seven in the ACC.  </P> <P> Massenburg's four years at Maryland have robbed him of any naivete that goes  with youth.  </P> <P> "In a way I'm glad it happened to me because it gave me a feel for what the  real world is like real early," Massenburg said. "There were some points where  I didn't think anybody was on our side, that Maryland was this black cloud over  college basketball."  </P> <P> Regardless, Massenburg has stuck it out. "I would just like to be remembered as  a guy who took some hard knocks at the University of Maryland and made the best  of it."  </P></p>

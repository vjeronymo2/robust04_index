			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION Defence </F> Correspondent]    [Text] Russia is forging ahead with large-scale research  into the development of high-tech weapons despite the nation's  economic crisis. Many of the country's top scientists are  employed on a wide range of major arms projects, not just to  boost domestic defence but to capture lucrative overseas sales.    And British and Western experts would be anxious to get  their  hands on top-secret scientific data.    "Weapons research is continuing in all areas -- the range is  extensive," said Robert Hall, editor of Jane's Intelligence  Review.    The Russians have a unique approach to many scientific  problems because of the restrictions they faced during the Cold  War. Lack of access to the West's computer revolution left them  reliant on such areas as theoretical mathematics. And they  became great innovative "lateral thinkers" to overcome some of  the scientific hurdles they faced. Consequently their expertise  in areas such as electromagnetic power, aerodynamics, underwater  propulsion, and laser, microwave and other "beam" technology  often rivals that of the West and sometimes exceeds it.    The Russians have already demonstrated they can generate 10  times the electromagnetic energy the United States has achieved  and with much smaller equipment. This could be used in a  variety of weapons, such as tank guns and an air "bomb" that  could disable all electronics over a wide area.    There is also speculation that the Russians have developed  an  ultra-quiet submarine propulsion system that uses  electromagnetic forces to draw in water through a duct and  squirt it out the stern.    Some of their electronic systems have confused Western  experts, including the Zaslon radar fitted to MiG-31 aircraft.  Leading electronics expert Mike Witt said: "This system puzzled  Western experts when it was unveiled in 1991 because it appeared  to be able to see backwards."    Russian scientists are also working on a system known as  Infra- Red Search and Track that detects aircraft by their heat  and, therefore, overcomes so-called "Stealth" technology.    Britain is developing a similar system for the four-nation  Eurofighter project and scientists would be very keen to  establish how the Russian system works.    Russia is making significant progress in missile technology  and last year unveiled its equivalent of the US Patriot  anti-missile system known as the S300V. During a demonstration  at Abu Dhabi four missiles were fired and successfully destroyed  targets in the air almost 20 miles away. It is said to be able  to track 24 targets simultaneously and then prioritise the  targets before firing four missiles from two launchers.    Advanced work is being carried out to develop affordable  anti- aircraft missiles such as the new shoulder-launched Igla  which should bring in desperately needed hard currency from  sales abroad.</p>

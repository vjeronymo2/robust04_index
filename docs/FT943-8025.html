			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Changing mood among big treasury players: Banks' faltering enthusiasm for trading When asked this week what effect HSBC Holdings' Pounds 92m first-half loss on proprietary bond trading would have, Sir William Purves, chairman, cited the mood of traders: 'Dealers who are relatively young have learnt that markets are not always going to be like 1993.' HSBC's Pounds 449m fall in overall trading income placed it among European banks which suffered most from falls in bond prices and volatility this year. Swiss banks have disclosed falls of up to 63 per cent in trading income this week, and German banks' operating profits have also suffered. Falls in trading income were expected after 1993's record year in which most banks and securities houses placed one-way bets on currencies and bond prices. But the effect on some banks has unsettled some investors and analysts. 'It calls into question the level of sustainable profits of banks. We are re-examining our forecasts with a more jaundiced eye,' says Ms Susan Sternglass, analyst at the investment bank Goldman Sachs. For some, banks' dependence on trading - both proprietary and on behalf of clients - may be a shock. 'Investors may not have realised that some banks are very big treasury players,' says Mr David Band, chief executive of BZW, Barclays' investment bank. He says this could lead to a de-rating of some bank shares towards the lower earnings multiples on which investment banks usually trade. That has been seen in the 4.5 per cent fall in HBSC shares this week. This is a worry for banks like the Swiss which have expanded trading to complement income from retail banking. Mr Rudi Bogni, head of Swiss Bank Corporation in London, says his bank will take in its stride a 63 per cent fall in trading income because it is within a band of acceptable volatility. 'We are a big institution, and we know what we are doing. We are still in the business of taking risk,' he says. Other European banks have suffered setbacks this year in the middle of building up their treasury and capital markets arms. One is Commerzbank, one of the big three German banks, whose trading income fell to DM87m (Pounds 36m) from DM273m after it made losses in June while trading on its own account. Mr Juergen Karcher, Commerzbank's head of fixed income, says the fall will not put the bank off its plans to expand European bond trading and treasury activities. 'I do not think this will have an impact on long-term strategy. You cannot just take the result from one day to another.' But even if long-term strategies are unaffected, European banks are likely to reduce their emphasis on trading in the short-term for several reasons. First, some of them built up proprietary trading too late to match the gains of US securities brokers. 'The problem for a lot of non-US firms was that they came to it too late in the cycle. They were vulnerable when the market turned around,' said one head of trading at a bank in London. 'I don't think anybody is saying 'OK, proprietary traders, stop trading', but because markets are difficult and there is not a strong trend, everyone has cut back as a matter of course,' said Mr Peter Bass, joint head of fixed interest and treasury at SG Warburg, the investment bank. Second, a lack of liquidity in some European markets has forced banks to cut positions. Mr Band says BZW 'clamped down' earlier in the year for this reason. 'Markets do not have to be stable, but they must be liquid. We have to be sure that we are able to get out of what get into,' he says. Large trades are more nerve-racking in markets where customer flows have shrunk, and it is hard to sell a position that has gone wrong. 'The low level of liquidity in the market will calm the speculation down,' said Mr Daniel Napoli, head of risk management at the US firm Merrill Lynch. Third, European banks discovered the shortcomings of their technology and risk management systems in volatile markets. Mr Band cites June, when Italian 10-year gilts rose in price by 10 per cent. 'Most of the things people regarded as being sure-fire went wrong, and violently wrong.' He says many European banks do not have the US firms' 'Formula 1' systems to allocate capital on a risk-adjusted basis. One reason for BZW's caution in trading this year was that 'we've passed our advanced driving test, and are on to rallying and Le Mans, but we're not yet Formula 1'. Fourth, banks have had difficulty controlling costs in line with falls in income. SBC's personnel costs rose 19 per cent last year - driven by investment bank bonuses - but fell only 6 per cent in the first half. Unless there are big falls in the second half, cost to income ratios will inflate. 'Costs seem to be more geared on the upside than coming down, and the first-half results raise questions about the appropriate cost base going forward,' says Ms Sternglass. Unless trading income revives, last year's record bonuses could be followed briskly by a shake-out of jobs. Bankers insist that such short-term factors are unlikely to last. Mr Bogni of SBC says banks will reduce trading in the second half, but will 'start 1995 with a clean sheet'. Sir William talked this week of HSBC starting to take significant trading positions again when markets stabilise. Yet a full recovery of confidence is not certain. The US bank JP Morgan's AAA rating was placed on negative outlook by the agency Standard &amp; Poor's in June because of increased exposure to trading. Banks with lesser reputations for risk management may find it hard to ignore such signals.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank's proportion of income from trading 1993 %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        First Half                    Second Half  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Denmark                    33                             13 France                     12                             17 Germany                     8                              8 Netherlands                 9                             10 Switzerland                32                             26 UK                          9                             10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trading Income  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        First Half 1993           First Half 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SBC                      SFr1.46bn                  SFr537m JP Morgan                Dollars989m                Dollars584m HSBC Holdings            Pounds522m                 Pounds73m Commerzbank              DM273m                     DM87m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Morgan Stanley, Datastream  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

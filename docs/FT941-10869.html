			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK less cool to military action The UK government last night backed away from its previous opposition to military action by the west to break the siege of Sarajevo. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, summoned an emergency meeting of senior ministers for this morning, senior officials said he was committed to immediate and 'muscular' action to end the bombardment of the Bosnian city. But they repeated that British participation in air strikes against the Serb forces would depend on such action setting out to secure limited tactical objectives. The UK would also insist that western governments be guided in their response by the advice of UN commanders in Bosnia. Officials said Mr Major remained convinced that generalised strategic bombing would not bring the conflict to an end and would threaten the humanitarian aid effort in the former Yugoslav province. In the past, Britain has also been the most forceful opponent of any action which might prompt the Serbs to retaliate against UN ground troops. With some 2,500 troops in Bosnia, the prime minister has faced strong pressure from Conservative MPs not to take action which would threaten British forces. That pressure was reinforced yesterday by warnings from leading MPs of the risks of air strikes. But Mr Major's officials acknowledged yesterday that the weekend massacre of civilians in Sarajevo had created 'a new situation'. They also suggested that the UK was now prepared to back armed efforts to demilitarise Sarajevo and to establish UN administration in the city. This morning's meeting of ministers had been called to endorse the new position ahead of planned talks by Nato ministers and commanders to agree on the precise terms of military action.</p>

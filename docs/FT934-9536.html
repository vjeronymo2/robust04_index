			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Take-up of Costain rights only 28% A Pounds 83.9m rights issue by Costain Group, the troubled UK construction and mining company, was supported by only 28 per cent of the group's shareholders. This left most new shares with institutions which underwrote the fund-raising. The 5-for-4 rights issue at 30p per share will cut Costain's heavy borrowings and underpin its US coal mining business. Costain shares, which peaked at 366p in 1987, closed unchanged yesterday at 29 1/2 p. The company said that the take-up was lower than it would have preferred but the nature of the issue meant that it was always likely sub-underwriters would receive more shares. Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said: 'The sub-underwriters include several large institutions which have reiterated their support as shareholders in the group.' Robert Fleming, which had a 7 per cent stake in the group, will see its stake rise to about 17 per cent, making it the largest shareholder. Mr Peter Seabrook, fund manager with Robert Fleming, said the outcome was disappointing but not surprising. His institution was taking a long-term view of Costain as a potential recovery stock. There was some criticism about Mr Peter Costain continuing as the group's chief executive when it announced in September its second rights issue within two years. An issue in 1991 raised Pounds 77m. One institution said last night that the key decision to support the refinancing, and Mr Costain, had been taken when the sub-underwriting was agreed. Mr Seabrook said: 'Mr Costain's position will continue to be addressed - but in due time.' The group ran into trouble after investing heavily to expand its housebuilding and commercial property operations as the UK property boom was peaking in the late 1980s. It has since sold these as well as its profitable Australian coal mining operations. Borrowings have remained stubbornly high. The rights issue will enable Costain to reduce net debt as a proportion of shareholders funds from 132 per cent to 45 per cent. This compares with gearing of 450 per cent at the start of this year.

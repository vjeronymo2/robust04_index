			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The feelgood factor: FT writers find UK economic gloom is not countrywide Enough of this gloom about UK industry. In a week of shaky sterling and plunging markets, what we want is a bit of good news. Surely somebody, out there somewhere, is doing well against the odds? As it happens, quite a few people are. An Oxfordshire maker of up-market lawn mowers more than doubled its sales in the year to end June. A Nuneaton company which renovates old Land Rovers expects turnover to rise by a third this year. A Midlands company which sells plastic buckets door to door recently announced profits up by 75 per cent. Granted, some of the lessons to be drawn from many recession-proof stories are not entirely cheerful. It would appear that it pays not to employ people. It also pays not to make anything yourself. The principle is splendidly illustrated by Betterware, the seller of plastic buckets. As the company's chief executive, Mr Andrew Cohen, remarks, Betterware is a retailer without any shops. It is also a manufacturer without any factories. Once it has designed its products, it has them made by subcontractors. The sales force which then knocks on the nation's doors is, of course, entirely self-employed and works on commission. A more exotic instance is Thermocrete, a West Yorkshire company which specialises in lining old or dilapidated chimneys to prevent seepages of carbon monoxide. Its operators, who for some whimsical reason are kitted out in top hats and tails, are employed by franchisees. Mr Allan Barnes, Thermocrete's chairman, says business has never been better, partly because the standstill in the housing market means people are spending more on their present homes. Turnover in the year just ended grew by a quarter. A more advanced example of the principle is Powerscreen International, a Northern Irish producer of machines for crushing gravel. Powerscreen employs no production workers. Instead, its factories in Northern Ireland and South Wales contract out production to self-employed team leaders who recruit teams of 20 apiece. The machines themselves are sold through distributors. Perhaps the most cunning case of profiting by non-employment is Capita, the London-based management consultancy. Among the chief exponents of hiving off labour in the UK are central and local government. Capita's specialisation is advising government on contracting out services to the private sector. Since 1989, the company's pre-tax profits have gone from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.5m and turnover has tripled. It is something of a relief to come across success stories which are more straightforward. Countax, the Oxfordshire-based lawn mower manufacturer, has had a splendidly wet summer. And recession or no, as Countax's managing director, Mr Harry Handkammer, remarks, people have to mow the grass. They are scarcely compelled to do so with one of Mr Handkammer's machines, which sell for between Pounds 1,600 and Pounds 2,000. But Countax's success dates from only two years ago, when recession was already on the horizon. The company provided accessories for a maker of garden tractors. The customer's sales dived and Countax nearly went under. It then turned to designing and making its own machines, which it now turns out at the rate of 8,000 a year. Sales in the year just ended rose from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 6.7m and this year are expected to reach Pounds 8m. The reason given by Mr Handkammer is slightly at odds with the prevailing climate. 'We have succeeded because we make the best product dealers can sell. Customers get better value for their money, it's that simple. Companies making bad products will do badly.' This certainly seems borne out by the Scottish shirtmaker Hilditch &amp; Key, whose shirts sell in New York at Dollars 195 each plus sales tax. Saks 5th Avenue, the US department store, reports sales up 60 per cent in a year. The secret, according to the Hilditch &amp; Key's chairman, Mr Michael Booth, is quality and hard work in selling; though, he adds, discounting is so widespread in the US that to get a product with a decent margin is worth a lot to the retailer. Then again, some companies selling cheap products do very nicely. The Land Rover Centre at Nuneaton in the UK refurbishes old Land Rovers and sells them for between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 6,000 apiece. Sales last year were Pounds 150,000. This year they are expected to reach Pounds 200,000. The owner and founder, Mr Phil Read, says he has never known it so busy. He has lately been selling an average of 3.5 reconditioned Land Rovers a week. A year ago it was one a week. Mr Read provides a whole string of reasons for his success. 'We deal with a section of the population which is just a little bit better off,' he says. 'People may have lowered their sights, but they're also sick and tired of small second cars sitting in the drive.' Alternatively, he says, 'there's a club cult thing - you drive along the road in a Land Rover and people are always waving to you'. Or, more basically, 'it's my personality and charisma'. Some success stories may even be pointing the way out of recession. Woolcombers Group, the Yorkshire wool processor which is planning to float on the stock market next month, is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The encouraging general point is that the textiles industry can be a leading indicator of recovery. It takes about 18 months to get wool from the sheep's back on to the customer's. Wool cleaning is the first stage in that process, so more throughput today means clothing manufacturers hope business will pick up towards the end of 1993. Companies have been wrong about that sort of thing before. In that case, one final success story might prove more durable. Symonds' Cider &amp; English Wine, a subsidiary of Bulmers, makes a cider with the intimidating title of Scrumpy Jack. Two years ago, Scrumpy Jack was sold through 400 pubs in the UK. It is now sold through 10,000. In that time, Symonds' output has quintupled. Pre-tax profits went up 50 per cent last year. Several reasons are suggested for this: in particular, the fact that UK brewers have been obliged by the competition authorities to throw their pubs open to competing brews. It may be tempting to think that there is a simpler reason: that in these hard times, the population has taken to viewing the world through a rustic haze of traditional English alcohol.

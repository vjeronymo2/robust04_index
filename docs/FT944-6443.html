			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (8): Diversity ensures that economy is resilient - Industry Bristol, it was recorded by an encyclopedia published in 1813, 'is generally esteemed the second city in England, for trade, wealth, and number of inhabitants.' The encyclopedia listed, among the 'considerable manufacturers,' brass, copper and lead works, turpentine and sulphur works, and the making of woollen stuffs, cotton, sail cloth and lace. There were sugar houses and no fewer than 15 glassworks. Two thousands ships were annually cleared through the city's docks, but the encyclopedia noted that, apart from London, Liverpool had become the greatest sea port in England, 'having exceeded Bristol considerably of late years.' The loss of trade to Liverpool was one reason why Bristol steadily slipped down the league table of UK cities. But Charles Harvey and Jon Press, in Studies in the Business History of Bristol, published by Bristol Academic Press, comment that the city has been much more than a maritime centre in decline. 'On the contrary, Bristol has for a long time enjoyed a diversified economy which has proved adaptable, resilient, and responsive to national trends.' Industries have waxed and waned in the city, notably cigarette, chocolate and footwear manufacture. The Wills company began in the city in 1786, and when it became part of Imperial Tobacco early this century, had a workforce of 3,000 people. Today, Imps employs only 600 people at Bristol and Avonmouth, making cigars. Other industries, such as railway locomotive and motorcycle manufacture, have come and gone. The defunct Bristol coalfield at one time produced 1m tons a year. Aerospace has long been an important industry, but one which has been contracting. However, the Filton and Patchway works of British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce still employ a total of more than 10,000 people. In keeping with the history of industrial diversity, other businesses have arrived and the city has benefited by never being over-dependent upon a single industry. The service sector, notably in financial and professional services, has helped to compensate for the diminution of manufacturing. In recent times, one expanding industry has been that of media-related businesses. Bristol is the home of the BBC natural history unit, of the commercial radio company GWR, and of Aardman Animations, which in March won an Oscar for its film The Wrong Trousers. HTV, the television company, has its west of England studios in the city. United Artists, the US group, has set up a base at Aztec West in north Bristol for its cable franchise. By late 1997 it will have invested more than Pounds 320m in a 4,000-mile fibre optical network, cabling Bristol and Bath and surrounding towns. Its workforce of 350 is expected to increase further next year. Another recent arrival at Aztec West is Anderson &amp; Lembke, a business-to-business advertising agency set up three years ago to serve the high-tech sector. It chose Bristol, it says, 'because of its easy accessibility, value-for-money office accommodation and local creative talent.' Also at Aztec West is Spandex, the supplier of sign-making materials and computers to the sign-making industry. Direct mail and telemarketing is a growing business - British Telecom has a 24-hour call centre in Bristol. Colleagues Direct Marketing of Bath has proved highly successful. In January, NatWest Ventures completed a Pounds 8m buy-out from ACT Group of Brann Direct Marketing, based in Bristol and Cirencester. Brann has a turnover of about Pounds 19m and employs 400 people. Computer-related companies include Systems Team, a systems house set up in central Bristol in 1982. It has become a leader in providing services to professional associations and membership organisations. Hewlett-Packard, the US company, has one of its chief European manufacturing and technological bases on a 163-acre site at Filton. Its H-P Laboratories there, employing 270 researchers and scientists, are its largest research centre outside the group's Californian headquarters. 'We believe that Bristol - with its excellent universities - is an excellent place to conduct advanced research, and that Bristol has much more to offer in the area of value-added services than strictly a good place to manufacture products,' Hewlett-Packard says. More traditional industries include a Courage brewery and two small regional brewers, Butcombe and Smiles. The drinks company Hiram Walker, renamed as a division of Allied Domecq, has its world headquarters in Bristol. There is also a sizeable printing industry. Oakley Press this year completed substantial investment in a fully-integrated pre-press and press operation. But one long-established company, J. W. Arrowsmith, which began printing in the 19th century, has become a much smaller business. Arrowsmith was recently the subject of the city's longest industrial dispute, which ended this autumn after 18 months of picketing. The dispute began over pay and the plant was picketed after the company dismissed 120 workers and de-recognised their GPMU union. A related business in the region is packaging, with companies such as DRG and ASSI, which has a Pounds 30m plant making corrugated packaging at Yate in Avon. Other manufacturers include Rotork, the specialist engineer in Bath, which increased its overseas markets during the recession and exports to more than 60 countries. Engineering company Strachan &amp; Henshaw, part of Weir Group, designs and supplies handling systems for nuclear power stations. Christies Panel Products makes fitted bedrooms. One long-established business is Bryan Brothers, founded in 1913, which has become one of the UK's largest privately-owned motor groups. Its contract hire business has a fleet of 8,000 vehicles. A newer company, in an old tradition, is Architectural Castings, a management start-up in 1992. It is planning further expansion after an injection this summer of Pounds 200,000 of equity and loan finance by 3i, the investment capital group, To complete the picture of diversity, at least one industry has had a renaissance since the days of the 1813 encyclopedia: the manufacture of hot-air balloons (which were piloted, the encyclopedia said, by 'aeronauts.') Mr Don Cameron, head of Cameron Balloons which he founded in Bristol in 1970, has seen the company become the world's largest maker of promotional and sports balloons, both hot-air and gas-filled. The company makes about one a day and exports to more than 30 countries. With a turnover of Pounds 4.5m, it employs 90 people. 'We have never had a redundancy,' Mr Cameron says, 'and it is our goal never to have one.'</p>

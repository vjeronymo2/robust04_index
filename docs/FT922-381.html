			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Life groups fined Pounds 50,000 each: Investment in Levitt Group 'violated principle of Financial Services Act' TWO of Britain's largest life assurance companies, General Accident and Commercial Union, were each fined Pounds 50,000 yesterday for investing in the now-defunct Levitt Group financial services company. Mr Roger Levitt, the group's chairman, has been charged with 62 offences involving Pounds 20m. The charges include conspiracy to defraud, theft, false accounting and obtaining property and services by deception. Regulators said the two life assurance companies had invested in Levitt partly in the hope of encouraging its independent sales agents to sell more of their products. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, levied fines against the two companies for investing Pounds 7.35m each in 1990 giving them a 4.9 per cent stake in Levitt Group. Levitt was once one of the largest privately held financial services companies in the UK. The investments were said to have violated a key principle of the Financial Services Act intended to ensure that those who offered 'independent' financial advice did so solely on each product's own merits. Before the Financial Services Act was introduced in 1988, insurance companies regularly invested in independent intermediaries in the hope of encouraging the sale of more of their own products. Legal and General Assurance, another leading UK life insurer, also had a 4.9 per cent stake in Levitt Group but was not part of the disciplinary hearing. Legal and General said its sales arrangement was with a division of Levitt which sold its products exclusively and did not claim to offer independent advice. Lautro rules only restrict investment in independent agents claiming to sell the best products of a group of companies. In explaining the fines, Lautro said its rules on commission allowed investments in independent sales agencies only when the investment was unconnected with the marketing of the life insurance company's products. 'In both cases the (life insurance company) members accepted that there was a connection between their investment and the increased marketing opportunities for their products, albeit with the disciplines of best advice.' Lautro said there was no suggestion that the payments involved any dishonest or improper motives and said that both companies had co-operated fully in the investigation. Mr Bill Jack, director and general manager of General Accident, said the payment to Levitt Group had been made as an investment, but the company also wanted access to Levitt's product advice panels which had not been suggesting GA products to clients. Mr Jack said the company believed Levitt Group could have recommended its products in accordance with the 'best advice' rules of the Financial Services Act. He said the investment led to no increase in sales of GA products, nor was there any sign that clients had not been given best advice.</p>

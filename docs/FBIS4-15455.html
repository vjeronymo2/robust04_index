			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev under the general heading: </F> "Russia Does Not Intend To Create Military Bases in Latvia.  Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To  Sign"]    [Text] "The agreements concluded between Russia and  Lativa, including the agreement on the military facility at  Skrunde, were approved by President Yeltsin. There have been no  changes in our position," IZVESTIYA was told by Sergey Zotov,  special envoy and head of the state delegation to the talks with  Latvia.    "In the interstate agreements that have been initialed, the  radar station at Skrunde is defined as a `Russian military  establishment under civilian control,' and it is stated that it  cannot be 'endowed with the status of a military base,'" Zotov  said.    According to information obtained by IZVESTIYA from various  sources, the Russian Foreign Ministry does not know how the  Skrunda radar station found its way into President Yeltsin's  directive on the creation of military bases on the territory of  CIS states. Especially since Latvia is not a member of the  Commonwealth.    Diplomats rule out the existence of a political subtext to  the presidential directive, and are inclined to think it is a  question of an annoying technical error. In their opinion the  president was given an old draft to sign, which had been  circulating around the bureaucracy for a long time. The  officials responsible for drafting it had not made the necessary  amendments to the text.    People in the president's entourage, judging by Press  Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov's statement, are also inclined to  think in terms of a "technical error" causing the furor which is  threatening to wreck the accords that had been reached. They  are studying the history of the error and considering how to  avoid possible negative consequences.</p>

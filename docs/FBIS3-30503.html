They had talks with Stanislav Daskalov, minister of foreign  affairs, while their meeting with President Zhelev is still in  progress.    After the meeting with Daskalov, Lord Owen pointed out, in  reply to a journalist's question, that he has never abandoned  the original plan to solve the Balkan conflict, and that the  plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into three parts on the basis  of ethnic principles has recently emerged as the only possible  alternative for a peaceful solution of the problems.</p>

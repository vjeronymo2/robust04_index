			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Mr Miyazawa: Correction Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, was wrongly quoted in a feature on Saturday as saying: 'When the US acts like a dictator over Japanese businesses, then we feel contempt towards the US.' The comment should have been attributed to Mr Takayoshi Miyagawa, a public opinion poll expert.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 INCUMBENTS, CHALLENGER WIN SCHOOL SEATS IN CULVER CITY  </P> <P> In a close race, voters Tuesday elected two incumbents and one newcomer to the  school board of the Culver City Unified School District.  </P> <P> The three seats will be filled by the top vote-getters: incumbent Julie Lugo  Cerra, who got 1,548 votes, or 26.11% of those cast; challenger Jim Quirarte,  with 1,544 votes or 26.04%, and incumbent Robert G. Knopf, with 1,465 or  24.71%.  </P> <P> Thomas Supple came in a close fourth with 1,371 votes or 23.12%.  </P> <P> Cerra, first elected in 1985, vowed Wednesday to "continue to be an informed  member of the Board of Education." She said she will work on implementing  strategic goals for the district, revising the curriculum and increasing  "accountability for everyone -- parents, teachers, students, staff."  </P> <P> The 44-year-old consultant said she wants to see a contingency program  developed that will deal with "any disaster -- gang activity, threats, an  earthquake." She added that student-athletes should be encouraged to strive for  "lofty goals. . . . We don't want the athletes just to be athletes -- we should  be monitoring their grades, giving them the tools to succeed," so they do "not  just play a good game of football."  </P> <P> Quirarte, 44, who manages property and is in the jukebox and vending machine  leasing business, said he was surprised that he came in second and by the voter  turnout.  </P> <P> "Four years ago, (it took) about 800 votes, and you were elected," he said.  "This time, it was (1,400). . . . The community is trying to send us a message  that schools are important."  </P> <P> Quirarte, who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1987, said he stood out from  the other candidates in his call for beefing up vocational arts. Noting that  only 34% of high school students nationwide graduate from college, Quirarte had  stressed a back-to-basics curriculum.  </P> <P> Knopf, 46, said he placed third, behind a challenger, probably because his name  was listed last on the ballot. The Hughes Aircraft Corp. engineer, who has been  on the board since 1981, said he wants to expand the district's child-care  programs and use computers to place students at their proper learning levels.  </P> <P> But Knopf said the board's first job is to reach an agreement with teachers  over salaries and benefits for this year. "Until the contract is settled, it's  a (distraction to) the educational program. We're in the business of  educating."  </P> <P> The teachers union and the district have a bargaining session set for today.  </P> <P> Noting that Los Angeles teachers recently won 8% pay raises for each of the  next two years, Culver City teachers last month rejected a tentative agreement  that included a 6% pay raise and new health benefits for retirees but had  higher health insurance co-payments. Bess Doerr, president of the Culver City  Teachers Assn., had recommended that the teachers approve the contract.  </P> <P> Doerr said this week that a new survey of the rank and file showed that  teachers, by at least 5 to 1, put salary as a top priority. She said the union  would propose an 8% raise today.  </P> <P> She said Cerra, Quirarte and Knopf will "do just fine for us."  </P> <P> Cerra said: "Culver City is in a very bad position because of Los Angeles  settling for 8%." She added: "It's also quite obvious that Los Angeles has  bitten off more than it can chew," referring to the $180 million in budget cuts  the Los Angeles Unified School District has said may be needed in 1990-91,  largely because of rising salaries for teachers and administrator.  </P> <P> Cerra, Quirarte and Knopf all said they would like to see Culver City teachers  get pay hikes but only if the district is not forced into deficit spending. "I  can't in good conscience lobby for something that will break the district,"  Cerra said.  </P> <P> Supple said he was disappointed at losing but said he knew the race would be  close. He lost, he said, because "I'm too straightforward, too blunt and I'm  Republican."  </P> <P> Supple, a parent and software engineer, said he would remain active on district  advisory committees.  </P> <P> The newly elected members will be sworn in at the board meeting Dec. 5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Culver City Unified  </P> <P> 100% Precincts Reporting  </P> <P> 3 Elected  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Julie Lugo Cerra *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,548  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jim Quirarte *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,544  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Robert G.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Lennart Meri has said that establishing  lasting good-neighborly relations with Russia is one of the key  priorities in Estonia's foreign policy. The president also  emphasizes the need to resolve all problems between the two  states through political means, in talks around a table.    According to the president, the exchange of ideas which took  place in Geneva between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin and Raul Malk, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign  Ministry, demonstrate a willingness to seek a mutually  satisfactory solution through talks. The elimination of the  last vestiges of World War II on 31 August not only presupposes  the withdrawal of Russian troops from the former East Germany  but also from Estonia and Latvia, President Lennart Meri says.    The Estonian president was prompted to explain Estonia's  foreign policy by remarks made at a news conference on Saturday  [4 June] by Major General Aleksander Einseln, the commander of  defense forces. Einseln said on Saturday that the Estonian  defense forces are capable of forcibly driving out the Russian  military units deployed here. According to the president, any  practical solutions about a prompt and unconditional withdrawal  from Estonian territory by Russian troops will proceed from  Estonian legislation and from decrees and instructions of the  Estonian Government.    This has been reported by the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE agency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kin -- The U.S. Marine Corps [USMC] on Okinawa  began a live-fire exercise on Camp Hansen training field at 0803  on 20 April [2303 GMT on 19 April]. For the exercise, Highway  104 was closed for the fourth time this year. A notice by the  USMC says the three-day exercise will be continued until 22  April, using three gun platforms in the training field. The  prefectural government said the exercise is the 146th since  March 1973.    Kin just elected a new mayor on 17 April. Commenting on the  exercise held in the wake of his inauguration, Mayor-elect  Katsuhiro Yoshida stated: "U.S. exercises should be stopped. I  am planning a field trip to inspect the areas adjoining the  training field to learn about the actual problems of U.S. bases."    Early in the morning of 22 April, local leftist groups  gathered around the training field and repeatedly shouted:  "Stop the firing exercises!" About 30 people joined a rally  held by The Security Repeal, Livelihood, and Democracy  Protection Okinawa Prefecture United Action Liaison Council  [Toitsuren] starting at 0700 [2200 GMT]. At the rally, Chairman  Hiroaki Yoshizawa of the Anti-Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Council  Okinawa Branch [Ken-Gensuikyo] stressed: "The live-fire exercise  is held in the wake of a series of aircraft crashes on Kadena  Air Base and Futenma Air Station. We must jointly oppose such  brutal practices by the U.S. Forces."    Meanwhile, the Okinawa Peace Campaign Center also held a  100-man rally on a hill in Igei District starting at 0800 [2300  GMT]. Chairman Zenshun Arakaki stated: "U.S. Forces conduct  various exercises almost daily, as if Okinawa is a battlefield.  We must be persistent in opposing such practices in order to  stop them someday."</p>

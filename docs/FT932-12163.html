			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Taskforce may be Hoover's last stand - A look at Maytag's emergency review of the UK group ONLY three months ago, the British government was trumpeting the decision by Hoover to close a factory in Dijon, France, and switch production to Scotland as proof of the UK's international competitiveness and its attractions as a manufacturing base. Today, that crowing looks decidedly premature. Not only are there doubts about whether the production shift from France will take place, but according to Hoover's top management, the survival of the entire business is at stake - largely because of the poor performance of its UK operations. Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Hoover Europe and UK managing director, said yesterday that a special taskforce dispatched by Maytag, Hoover's US parent, was conducting an emergency review of the business in an effort to cut costs and restore profitability. Though the review will take three weeks to complete, Mr Kamman said redundancies were unavoidable and plant closures possible. He said he did not feel bound by Hoover's earlier commitment to move production to Scotland, for which the UK government has pledged Pounds 2.5m (Dollars 3.85m) in assistance. When Mr Kamman arrived in Britain a month ago, it was widely assumed that his appointment was prompted by Hoover's free flights promotional fiasco. That incident led to the dismissal of Mr William Foust, Mr Kamman's predecessor, the departure of two other senior executives and a Dollars 30m charge against Maytag's first-quarter earnings. It is now clear that an even more pressing reason was the steep deterioration in the performance of Hoover Europe, which last year lost Dollars 67.1m after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge on sales of Dollars 501.9m. Mr Kamman said there had been little improvement in operating results this year, and that a continuing loss in the UK had been forecast in the budget drawn up by Hoover's previous management. Tackling Hoover's problems has become increasingly urgent for Maytag, the fourth-largest US domestic appliance manufacturer, which plunged into a Dollars 315m loss last year on sales of Dollars 3bn. Largely because of the special Hoover provision, Maytag lost a further Dollars 10.5m in the first quarter of this year. For most of its 86-year history, the Iowa-based company has been renowned for cautious management and home-spun values. But in the mid-1980s it was bitten by the takeover bug and spent Dollars 1.8bn to acquire Magic Chef, a US kitchen appliance company, and Chicago Pacific, which had owned Hoover since 1985. However, the moves - which took Maytag out of the US for the first time - proved over ambitious. Beset by management problems in its acquisitions, saddled with heavy debt and smitten by recession, the company has spent much of the 1990s struggling to keep its head above water. Turning Hoover around is crucial to Maytag's future. But on past form, it will not be easy. Hoover's UK operations, which date back to 1932, have a chequered history. The company got into difficulties in the 1970s, but returned to profit in the early 1980s after cutting costs, shedding staff, modernising production and launching products. But by 1989, soon after it was bought by Maytag, it was in trouble again and had to dismiss almost 1,000 staff. The following year, Maytag dispatched Mr Foust and a special taskforce to Britain with a remit to bring about its 'rebirth, rejuvenation, stability and return to profitability'. Two years later, investments of Pounds 20m were announced in Hoover's two UK plants, at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and Cambuslang, Scotland, in an effort to make it a pan-European producer. Last January, the company decided to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon to Cambuslang. However, Mr Kamman believes further painful surgery is needed. Though some parts of Hoover Europe are operating satisfactorily, others are afflicted by serious and widespread problems. Mr Kamman said two of Hoover's three European plants, in Dijon and Cambuslang, were close to profitability. However, there had been a substantial fall in French sales since the political controversy over the production transfer erupted. In the UK, sales had held up quite well, after receiving a lift from the free flights promotion. However, the company was losing money on some product lines while overheads in several areas were too high. Mr Kamman said that some 'pieces of the company' might have to be closed down completely. He said that job cuts were likely to fall more heavily on indirect employees than on those on the factory floor. It will probably take until the end of the year to draw up a complete recovery plan - and longer before it is clear whether it is working. But judging by Hoover's troubled past, and Mr Kamman's grim analysis of its present problems, this could be the company's last chance.</p>

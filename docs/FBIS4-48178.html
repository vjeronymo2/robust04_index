			<p>BFN     [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu, Rwanda's prime  minister-designate appointed by the Arusha agreements, has made  his voice heard once again from his exile in Brussels.  Furthermore, he has been received by Belgian Foreign Minister  Willy Claes. He wants a coordinating committee of the  Democratic Forces for Change to be established, and he explained  to Monique Mas what he expects from the international community:    [Begin Twagiramungu recording] The international community  should first of all help us -- and at all cost -- to establish  an international tribunal to try the criminals and the  perpetrators of the crimes and massacres which have been carried  out in Rwanda from 6 April up to the present day. Second, we  have to try to create authorities for the protection of refugees  and also to ensure their safety within the framework of the  supply of food aid. The role which UNAMIR plays, for example,  should be redefined, and if there is any question of another  force, then this force should be in a position to protect the  refugees, so that they cannot be attacked by other forces, such  as the militias, for example.    As for the genocide, we cannot mix up the war and the  massacres. The massacres which have been ordered in Rwanda quite  clearly differ from the war, and I must specify that this war is  the result of the massacres. Here I differ quite frankly with  those who claim that it is the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  which brought about the resumption of hostilities. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Capital House Investment Management CAPITAL House Investment Management, a division of the Royal Bank of Scotland, this week acquired Brown Shipley Unit Trust Managers, with some Pounds 70m of assets. Some trust rationalisation may follow the change. Two Brown Shipley trusts are moving to Rathbone Brothers, rather than to Capital House. The Smaller Companies and Recovery funds, run by Patrick Evershed, will be rebranded as the Evermore funds. The Brown Shipley Recovery fund is top of the UK equity growth sector over one year, although it is next to bottom over five years (Evershed took over management of the fund only in 1991). The new funds are reducing the initial charge from 6 per cent to 2 per cent with immediate effect; the annual charge is 1.5 per cent.</p>

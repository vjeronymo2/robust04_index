			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall sharply STERLING futures fell back sharply yesterday, reflecting new fears of a rise in interest rates, after turmoil in Scandinavian markets led to a new bout of investment in the D-Mark. Finland's decision to float the markka yesterday morning triggered a run on the currency and a new bout of investment in D-Marks, pushing sterling below DM2.79 for most of the day. Money market dealers remain certain that the Bank of England will defend the currency if it needs to by means of heavy intervention, helped by last week's substantial D-Mark loan from international banks. But the dollar's continued fall against the German currency and the forthcoming French referen-dum on Maastricht may make the next few weeks tricky for central banks. If the French vote No in their referendum, the consequences for interest rates could be serious: Sweden's decision to push up short-term interest rates by 8 percentage points to 24 per cent was a frightening example of what central banks in other parts of Europe might have to do to staunch further flows into D-Marks. The December short sterling contract reflected the underlying nervousness. It opened at 89.68 and promptly fell to a low of 89.44 in the early afternoon. It closed the session at 89.46. Trading in the September contract was less volatile because the contract matures next Wednesday. Yest-erday the September contract ended 17 basis points below its opening level, at 89.51. There was thin trading in the cash markets, where three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, firmed to an offered rate of 10 7/16 per cent at the end of the day from a previous close of 10 1/4 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 500m in the morning, but it took most of the day to remove. The overnight rate hovered below 10 per cent for most of the day, so clearing banks borrowed short term money instead of offering the Bank bills. The Bank purchased Pounds 41m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 550m and the Bank bought Pounds 197m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 330m.</p>

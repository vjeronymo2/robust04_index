			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Keating plays the grand trade policy card / A look at Labor's pre-election vision of an Australian role in a new integrated Asian Pacific market grouping WHEN it comes to electioneering, few political leaders have a greater sense of the value of a dramatic gesture than Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister of Australia. Launching his party's trade policy for Australia's forthcoming federal election, Mr Keating unexpectedly proposed the creation of an integrated Asia Pacific market of 2bn people. Such a market would account for half of global economic output and 40 per cent of world exports, making it by far the largest of the world's trade groupings. In addition to Australia and New Zealand, it would include the six countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), the three members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. From Canberra's point of view, the Keating plan is a natural development of Apec, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum initiated by Australia and the US in 1989. Apec, which includes all of Mr Keating's target countries except Mexico, has become the main focus of Australian trade promotion efforts, mainly because it accounts for 70 per cent of Australian exports. But Australian officials have become increasingly worried about the potential impact of a breakdown of the Uruguay Round talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on intra-Apec trade. There is particular concern that the US might seek a series of bilateral trade deals offering preferential access to Nafta, which could be used to discriminate against Japan, Australia's biggest trading partner. Mr Keating, who has assured Tokyo of Australian support in such a dispute, warned the Clinton administration that it risked 'accumulating resentment and resistance' if the benefits of such deals flowed mainly to the US. The alternative, he said, was 'an open economic association in the Asia Pacific region, in which its economies were by degrees integrated to create the world's most dynamic zone of production.' Mr Keating's proposal was intended to contrast Labor's enthusiasm for integration with the Asia Pacific region with the more conservative approach of the Liberal/National Party opposition, which puts more emphasis on traditional links with Europe and North America. However, as Mr Keating acknowledged, there are obstacles to the development of a cohesive trading bloc based on the loosely knit Apec grouping. Professor Richard Snape, head of the economics department at Monash University, concluded in a report on Australia's trading options that the size and diversity of Apec meant that negotiations on a comprehensive trade agreement would face the same problems as the Uruguay Round. For example, the US, Canada, Japan and South Korea are unlikely to make further concessions on agricultural trade than they have already made within the Gatt framework. In addition, Apec already includes three incompatible trading blocs - the Asean free trade area, Nafta and the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Professor Snape's report also concluded that successful regional trading blocs usually exhibit a high degree of geographical proximity, similar levels of per capita gross national product and cultural affinity. Recognising these problems and differences, Mr Keating suggested that Apec should initially seek harmonisation of trading and technical standards, competition regulations and corporate law, business practice, investment rules, and professional qualifications. Even this would be a substantial achievement in a region containing economies as divergent as communist China, the US and Japan. The Asean countries, for example, have found reducing protection difficult, and Australia and New Zealand have so far failed to harmonise company and taxation law. Senator Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign affairs and trade Minister, said yesterday that Apec was 'a very significant counter weight to the ever present pressures at work to break the world into three warring trade blocs, built respectively around the yen, the US dollar and the D-Mark.' However, he played down the prospects of economic integration, conceding that it would be 'some time' before the concept of an Asia Pacific free trade area becomes 'even remotely' a reality. 'Our position is that in the meantime we should do nothing to inhibit the development of genuinely regional arrangements, and nothing which cuts across Australia's basic self-interest in achieving further trade policy integration with the economies of East Asia,' he said. This approach is less ambitious than the Prime Minister's grand vision of a pan-Pacific common market. But it seems more achievable. It is also supported by the opposition parties, which have backed away from suggestions that a coalition government might seek membership of Nafta in preference to developing Apec. Whichever side wins the election on March 13, Apec will remain important to Australia as the only mechanism which offers Canberra a seat at the regional table.</p>

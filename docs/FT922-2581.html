			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / MGN seeks Dollars 86m from Daily News US LAWYERS acting for Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday filed a claim in New York seeking the recovery of Dollars 86m (Pounds 47m) of funds that were allegedly transferred last year from London into US accounts held by the Daily News, the New York newspaper owned by Robert Maxwell. The claim, filed in the New York bankruptcy court, charges that the Daily News aided and abetted Maxwell in the breach of fiduciary duties to MGN. It states that the Dollars 86m of funds was borrowed by MGN, on Maxwell's orders, from the London branch of a US bank. Mr John Campi, for the Daily News, last night denied any wrongdoing by officials of the New York tabloid. 'We did not use the money for Daily News purposes,' he said. A New York executive with personal knowledge of the transactions said, however, that during October last year the funds arrived in the Daily News accounts and within a week were all transferred to banks and other recipients both in the US and elsewhere. The orders detailing where the money was to be paid came from London. The US executive said that most of the transfers occurred in the week of October 19 last year, and were supervised personally by Maxwell. It is believed that at least some of the money was used to pay debts to US investment banks. The claim was made in the bankruptcy court because the Daily News filed for protection from its creditors last December under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. According to the lawyers, the deadline for claims to be filed in the New York bankruptcy court expired at the close of business yesterday.</p>

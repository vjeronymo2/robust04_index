			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Housing market 'stuck in doldrums' The housing market remains 'stuck in the doldrums' with homeowners keeping properties off the market 'in a seemingly futile wait for meaningful house prices', a survey of more than 100 estate agents said today. The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors revealed that less than 5 per cent of agents in England and Wales reported price increases during the three months to the end of October. This compared with 72 per cent reporting static prices and more than a fifth reporting price falls. Almost three-quarters of the agents said inquiries and viewings requested by potential purchasers had fallen compared with the previous three months. Some 16 per cent said that activity had remained the same. Only 10 per cent reported an increase in viewings and inquiries. The traditional recovery in the housing market during September and October, following the end of the school summer holidays, has failed to occur in the past two years. Some estate agents and builders believe this may be due to the government's decision to move its annual Budget statement to late autumn. They argue that potential purchasers, fearing that they may become worse off in the Budget, may be dissuaded from buying homes. Sentiment may not have been helped this autumn by the decision in September to raise bank interest rates by a half percentage point. Mr Peter Miller, the institution's housing spokesman, said yesterday that marked house price increases appeared unlikely for the foreseeable future with the government determined that Britain should have low inflation.

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (27): Takeover creates a powerful new force - As bad debts continued to affect the industry, management strategies were largely focused on improving profitability. This has resulted in drastic cuts in staff numbers / Banking THE MOST important event in the European banking industry during 1992 was probably the acquisition of the UK's Midland Bank by HSBC Holdings, the Hongkong banking group. The Pounds 3.9bn takeover created a powerful new force in European banking. In particular, Midland under HSBC's ownership is likely to pose a stiff competitive threat to the UK's other big banks. The deal also introduced a high-ranking new member to the FT500, since HSBC has moved its domicile to London. At a stroke, HSBC has become the second biggest European bank, after Germany's Deutsche Bank, and the 19th biggest European company. The remarkably strong performance of HSBC's shares during the year was also responsible in part for an impressive rise in the stock market index of UK banks, which performed 20 per cent better than the FT all-share index. On Europe's three other main stock markets - in France, Germany and Switzerland - no other banking industry performed as well. German banks outperformed the Frankfurt market by 10 per cent, but the French banks underperformed by 2 per cent and the Swiss underperformed by 5 per cent. UK bank shares, even without HSBC, performed well in the year. The rise was remarkable because UK banks continued to suffer from record losses on bad and doubtful loans. Investors bought their shares in the hope that profit recovery will be strong, once the UK emerges from recession. Despite the bad debts, UK banks retained their above-average capital ratios, a key measure of balance sheet strength. Nonetheless one big UK bank, Barclays, fell sharply in the FT500 ranking, from 21st place (and second place among the banks) to 44th (and sixth among the banks). Barclays' loan losses in 1992 have been significantly worse than its peers - and its share price has also suffered as a result of persistent reports that shareholders are unhappy about a board reorganisation. Having gone into recession before other European countries, analysts expect the UK to emerge earlier as well. So analysts are forecasting that loans losses suffered by banks in France, Spain and Germany will rise, as their economies continue to slow down. Like the UK banks, much of their bad debt charge is attributable to imprudent commercial property lending. In one region, Scandinavia, bad debts have come close to wiping out the local banking industry. There are no Norwegian or Finnish banks in the FT500  -and only one representative from Denmark, Den Danske Bank, and one from Sweden, Svenska Handelsbanken. Sweden's SE Banken and Nordbanken departed from the league table, as did Unitas Bank and Kansallis Osake Pankki, both from Finland. Norway's big banks remained under the intensive care of the Norwegian government and were therefore ineligible for inclusion in the list. The volatility of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism affected most banks. Many of their foreign exchange departments made big profits from selling the ERM's more vulnerable currencies, such as sterling. However, French banks' interest rate margins were squeezed in the autumn when they kept down their loan rates for small businesses and personal customers, in spite of a rise in money market rates which the French government had engineered to protect the franc. The management strategies of most European banks in the year were primarily focused on improving the profitability of domestic operations. Throughout Europe, banks attempted to cut staff numbers - with the most dramatic reductions being made by UK banks. Preparations for the single European market, which came into effect at the beginning of 1993, were low key. Cross-border takeover attempts by banks within the EC were few and far between. Internationale Nederland Group of the Netherlands tried in the autumn to buy Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second biggest bank. However, in November ING abandoned its takeover plans, because of disagreement with BBL on the value of assets held by the Belgian bank. On the other hand, France's Credit Lyonnais was poised at the end of the year to acquire control of a majority stake in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth largest bank. Another Dutch bank, ABN Amro, expanded its investment banking operations by purchasing the UK stockbroker, Hoare Govett, from Bank of America of the US (which had in turn bought Hoare's previous owner, Security Pacific). Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland experienced difficulty in attempts to sell its merchant banking subsidiary, Charterhouse. However, at the end of the year it remained hopeful that a sale would take place in January to a consortium consisting of Germany's BHF and Credit Commercial de France. Banks on the whole have abandoned plans to establish pan-European branch networks and are instead purchasing operations in specific markets which they feel they understand. Bank encroachment into the sale of life insurance  -known as Allfinanz or BancAssurance - continued, though there were no big acquisitions of insurance companies by banks or vice versa. There was continuing interest among banks about forming transnational co-operation agreements, sometimes involving the exchange of shares. One of the most imaginative initiatives in the year was the Royal Bank of Scotland's establishment of IBOS, an electronic system for linking its branches with those of Credit Commercial de France, Spain's Banco Santander and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. Although the EC single market programme has abolished many legal obstacles to cross-border expansion, a range of cultural, tax and regulatory obstacles remain. These obstacles on the whole affect retail banking aimed at small businesses and individuals rather than business between banks themselves or the provision of services to big companies. The most graphic example of these obstacles in the year was a French government prohibition on an attempt by Barclays to introduce a new banking product to France which was in effect an interest-paying current account. An assortment of European Community banking directives which came into effect on January 1 did nothing to remove such barriers to competition. They relate mainly to the levels of capital which EC banks must have to continue in business (The Own Funds and Solvency Ratio directives) and the way in which banks are supervised (the Second Consolidated Supervision Directive and the Second Banking Directive). The Second Banking Directive is the most important of the new EC banking legislation. It creates a 'passport' for EC banks, which allows any bank authorised to do business in an EC country to set up branches in another EC country, without the need to get the permission of the supervisor in that other country.</p>

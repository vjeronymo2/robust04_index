			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico loses 2.1% Mexican stocks closed down 2.1 per cent because of worse-than-expected third quarter results of market bellwether Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex). The market's key IPC index closed off 55.24 points at 2,578.38 - a loss of 2.10 per cent. Volume totaled a moderately heavy 1.39m new pesos, on 111.2m shares traded. A late technical closing rebound prevented the endex expereiring its worst decline since the 6.01 per cent fall on April 4. At one stage the market was off 4.78 per cent on the back of the lackluster earnings report from the national telephone monopoly. Telmex announced that its net income rose only 1.5 per cent to 7.145bn new pesos, less than expected by the consensus of market watchers. Local analysts said the steep fall in Telmex share prices was largely a result of foreign players changing positions and at least one foreign brokerage cutting its 1994 Telmex earnings estimate. Rumours that Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, top official of the ruling party, had resigned disturbed the market.</p>

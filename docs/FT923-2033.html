			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / US, UK oppose Bosnia no-fly zone THE US and Britain are opposed to any immediate attempt by western nations to enforce a 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia as a means of preventing air attacks by Serb forces. Their caution over French proposals for a ban on military flights became clear during two days of talks in London with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary. Mr Cheney said yesterday the idea was still being discussed but described the proposed ban as 'a bit of sideshow' compared with the main problem of how to achieve a political solution in the former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, the UN and EC peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina began in Geneva yesterday with the mainly Moslem Bosnian government refusing direct talks with Serb and Croat representatives and a hardline statement from the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, again staking Serb claims to more than half the country. The two co-chairmen of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and the Finnish mediator on Bosnia, Mr Martti Ahtisaari, met separately with the three sides during the day. Further meetings are scheduled for today and Monday. Prospects brightened, however, for a resumption of relief flights into Sarajevo. Speaking before a meeting with Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Karadzic confirmed that he would support a 'no fly' zone in the vicinity of the humanitarian aid corridors, though not for Bosnia as a whole. Mrs Ogata had said earlier she would recommend an immediate restart of the Sarajevo airlift if she received satisfactory assurances from the warring factions on the safety of flights. Mr Karadzic said that in the Bosnian talks he would be pressing for an 'immediate and unconditional' ceasefire, to be followed by negotiations to set up a confederation of three constituent states controlled by Serbs, Croats and Moslems. The UN Security Council appeared close to majority agreement last night on a resolution that in effect would nullify Yugoslav membership of the UN, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. Initiated by Western members with the backing of Moslem states angered by Serbian attacks in Bosnia-Hercegoviona, the projected resolution would reject the Belgrade governments claim to 'automatic continuity' as successor to the former state of Yugoslavia and require that it apply for admission like any other candidate.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg easier Shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange followed international markets lower. Brokers remarked that golds withstood an early assault from the stronger financial and commercial rands, but succumbed later in the day after bullion edged off the Dollars 390 an ounce level. However, analysts said that they expected current declines, especially in the industrial sector, to be short-lived; medium-term prospects remained positive, especially if the recent stream of positive company results continued. The overall index lost 50 to 5,701, the industrial index fell 64 to 6,539 and the gold index 18 to 2,302. Adcock Ingram rose 10 cents to R13.85 ahead of improved results and Edgars rose R3 to R128 after announcing a 25 per cent increase in interim earnings a share. De Beers slipped R1.25 to finish at R99.25.</p>

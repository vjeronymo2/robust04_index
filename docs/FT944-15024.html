			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television The move away from serious analysis in television journalism and towards 'human interest' material has turned into a trot. Stand by for the gallop. BBC1 begins another series of Children's Hospital which has the attractions of any medical series (high drama, bags of emotion) but also the special advantages that come with child patients: they look appealing and tend to die less often than the elderly (8.00). Blues And Twos is yet another of the rash of ambulance-chasing series which have burst out all over television. Today they chase paramedic Allan Norman as he races around London on a motorbike reaching casualties much quicker than a four-wheeled ambulance. Ironically he drives to work on an 80cc Yamaha but for the job he rides a Honda 1100 (8.30 ITV). Inside Story offers yet another report on cosmetic surgery; a subject upon which Alan Whicker made the definitive programme years ago (10.00 BBC1). Prostitute is the last of a three-part French series about 'the oldest profession' (11.05 C4). On second thoughts perhaps we are already seeing the gallop.</p>

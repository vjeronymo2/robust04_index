			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Brazilian inflation falls Brazil's monthly inflation rate fell from 50 per cent in June to 7 per cent last month following the introduction of a new currency, according to Fipe, a leading research institute. Although the rate is slightly higher than most economists expected, it was partly caused by a carry-over of inflation in the old cruzeiro real currency at the end of June as well as by frosts, which pushed up food prices. The new Real currency, which is part of a government anti-inflation plan and linked to Brazil's foreign exchange reserves, was introduced on July 1. Economists are generally optimistic that the new currency will keep inflation down in the short term, at least until presidential elections in October-November, and are forecasting a rate of 1-2 per cent for August. This is expected to benefit the presidential campaign of former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who negotiated the currency plan through congress. Mr Cardoso, the centre-right's candidate, is currently neck-and-neck in the polls with Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' party.</p>

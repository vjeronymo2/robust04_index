			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / An intruder scares the Old Lady: The growth of the secondary debt market in London has split the financial community Among the many indignities suffered by Mickey Mouse since he moved to the loss-making EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris, the most galling is this: people doubt the colour of Mickey's money. The FFr20.3bn of Euro Disney bank debt is being quoted at discounts of up to 70 per cent on the newest capital market in London. Euro Disney is the latest company to have its debt quoted in the secondary loan market, which has sprung up over the past two years. In this market, banks trade debt in troubled companies at a discount to investment funds - often based in the US - which buy it cheaply, hoping it will rise in value if there is a corporate restructuring. The market is small as yet. An estimated Dollars 1bn was traded in London in 1992, and Dollars 2bn this year, compared with UK industrial and commercial debt of Pounds 245bn. Yet the implications of banks selling debt are profound. 'The effect on the City will be as great as Big Bang was for the equity markets,' says Mr Robert Tyrwhitt-Drake, who heads Bankers Trust's secondary debt trading operation in London. The emergence of this secondary market has shaken some of the companies involved. US companies are used to dealing with competing creditors when trouble strikes. But UK groups are accustomed to a more protected environment in which debt restructurings are handled by a familiar set of banks, occasionally herded by the Bank of England. They now face a different world, in which debt may be held by US high-yield funds, known as 'vulture funds'. Such funds may have held debt for only a few weeks, and want a 'quick exit' as the price rises. They may feel no obligation to follow the Bank of England's 'London Approach' under which creditors are expected to reach a compromise on the relative merit of their claims. There are several reasons for the new market's growth: Foreign banks expanded in London during the 1980s by taking Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m participations in syndicated loans. Selling the loans - sometimes at 95 per cent of the face value - has been the fastest way to withdraw from London and concentrate on their home markets. Many poor loans made in the 1980s have now been written down to a fraction of their face value. This means banks can make a notional profit even when they sell at a discount. 'If a bank holds a loan at 20 per cent of face value, it will sell at 65 cents on the dollar,' says Ms Alex McLeod, managing director for asset trading at Continental Bank, the US commercial bank, in London. Banks embroiled in a large number of debt restructurings involving relatively small loans have sought to escape through debt sales or swaps. 'It is extremely awkward and consumes a lot of management time to be involved in lots of problem cases,' says Mr David Harrison, senior manager for corporate banking at Lloyds Bank. As banks have grown more willing to sell debt, buyers have come from the US market in search of bargains. Buyers have largely been US funds, although a handful of UK funds has now joined them. Some companies whose debt has been sold doubt whether the market is as large as many practitioners claim. Eurotunnel's Pounds 6.8bn of bank debt is widely quoted, but Mr Graham Corbett, its finance director, says Eurotunnel debt trades can be 'counted on the fingers of one hand'. He says that companies with big projects need to deal with banks who understand the complexities of such finance. This is hard for Eurotunnel anyway because 65 banks lend it money. 'I would like a smaller syndicate so we could spend more time discussing issues with them,' says Mr Corbett. 'You don't have that relationship with someone who is trading your debt.' Companies in administration after collapse have different reasons to hope their debt is not traded. First, because the price of distressed debt can swing wildly depending on the latest twists in a restructuring, buyers can disrupt the work of administrators by their constant thirst for data. Mr Mark Homan, a joint administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation, says there has been 'one hell of a clamour for information' from funds holding debt. Second, banks and insolvency experts are afraid of funds deliberately upsetting an orderly restructuring to make financial gains. They cite US cases where funds have allegedly forced other creditors to buy out their stake at a premium by threatening to block restructuring proposals. This obstructive behaviour may be unpopular with banks, but it is seen in the US financial services industry as part of the cut and thrust of corporate restructuring. The City of London, led by the Bank of England, has a different view. Under the London Approach the Bank discourages commercial banks from appointing receivers too quickly, urges them to share information and wants all creditors to try to reach a common agreement. The potential for this arrangement to be undermined by debt trading has led the Bank to be ambivalent over London acquiring a new capital market. Mr Pen Kent, the Bank director in charge of relations between the City and industry, says that although the debt market could bring liquidity, the destabilising of the London Approach would be 'too high a price to pay'. He argues that Chapter 11 proceedings in the US tend to be longer than UK restructurings. Because the latter are voluntary and need the unanimous agreement of creditors, he believes they must be fast in order to work. 'If creditors are just running around trying to sell debt to each other rather than working on a solution, it could be that a company will simply run out of time (to be rescued),' he says. Yet some secondary debt brokers argue that the London Approach simply protects banks at the expense of other groups of creditors such as bondholders. They argue that the Bank is struggling to maintain a cartel that does not always work in the interests of troubled companies. Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake of Bankers Trust says the Bank has had a 'protectionist approach that has created false markets'. The funds insist they do not impede restructurings. Mr Christopher Cooke, managing director of Kingsway Debt Managers - one of the few UK funds buying distressed corporate debt - says his fund is no more hostile than a bank. 'We would not do anything unfriendly,' he says. 'We are not trying to take control, or force asset sales.' Mr Gary Klesch, a debt broker and analyst, says that funds have 'no interest other than increasing the value of their stakes by helping the company involved to do better'. Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake says that funds can be more imaginative than banks because they are more at ease with complex capital instruments. 'Funds are prepared to look at a company's whole capital structure, and that is very valuable,' he says. He believes that the London Approach 'will not last five years' given the competitive pressures exerted by debt trading. If the approach to troubled businesses changes, then all European companies that encounter similar problems to those facing Euro Disney could see a brisk reaction not only from equity markets, but from their banks. Mr Corbett of Eurotunnel admits to being 'very torn' between his instinctive belief in markets, and his worries about debt trading. He will not be the last finance director to be so torn.</p>

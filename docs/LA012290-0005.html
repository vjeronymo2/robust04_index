			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> I commend The Times for your special report At The Crossroads (Dec. 10) and for  your continuing coverage of important environmental issues.  </P> <P> The report was an excellent summary of the environmental problems which face  not only the Southern California area, but the rest of the state, and our  nation as well.  </P> <P> It is perhaps not surprising that the severity of our environmental problems  has given Southern California a leadership role in developing and implementing  solutions -- which could become models for others to follow.  </P> <P> In developing these solutions, however, it is important that we recognize the  interrelated nature of these problems, and focus on their root causes. For  example, 80% of the major smog producing pollutants in California are the  result of the production or consumption of energy in its various forms. Once we  realize this relationship, it becomes clear that any meaningful, long-term  solution to our air quality problems (as well as our transportation problems)  must include consideration of the way we produce and consume energy.  </P> <P> At the state level, the Senate and Assembly recently initiated a cooperative  venture to address the interrelated nature of energy and environmental  problems. The Joint Committee on Energy Regulation and the Environment, which I  chair, has begun an in-depth examination of three critical areas: (1)  electricity resources and environmental impacts; (2) energy efficiency as a  coordinated environmental and energy strategy; and (3) integrated solutions to  energy, air quality, and vehicle problems. We intend to provide our next  governor with a blueprint for restructuring and coordinating programs to  address these problems.  </P> <P> The 1990s will truly be the decade of decision on environmental, energy and  transportation problems for all Californians.  </P> <P> HERSCHEL ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> State Senate, D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo of the Sandinist  People's Army (EPS) yesterday virtually proclaimed himself  Humberto Ortega's replacement as head of the Army once Ortega  goes into retirement.    "If contemplated in the legal mechanisms and if they propose  my name to fill the post, I would agree to become Army chief,"  Cuadra responded to a colleague's question.    Yesterday Cuadra represented the EPS at an official assembly  of the legislative branch in honor of Taiwanese President Li  Teng-hui. At the end of the official ceremony, Cuadra declared  that the military change of command process could last months.    Last week, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and EPS Chief  Gen. Humberto Ortega announced during a seminar on  civic-military relations that both state branches had reached an  accord on Ortega's retirement.    The accord establishes that this year the president of the  Republic and the supreme chief of the Armed Forces will appoint  a new Army chief, in accordance with the current Constitution,  and Ortega will officially retire in February 1995.    "Every Army contemplates a transition process during which  the head of the military unit surrenders everything in order,"  Cuadra reiterated.    Ortega's virtual replacement as head of the military  refrained from commenting on aspects of the Military  Organization Law but stated that his current chief made many  contributions to society "and thus deserves its recognition."    Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo declined to comment on  the date for Ortega's retirement.    Lacayo stated that the recent accord reached by the  executive  and legislative branches and the EPS regarding the Military  Reorganization Law "ended the tension."    Regarding the constitutional reforms, the high-ranking  government official said the executive branch had sent a  proposal to the legislature, and six days ago the legislative  branch made a counterproposal.</p>

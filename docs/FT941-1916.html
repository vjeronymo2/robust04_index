			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather in the red World of Leather, the USM-quoted furniture retailer, ended 1993 with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 121,000, after taking account of a Pounds 406,000 exceptional charge representing the costs of a contractual dispute with its former warehousing and distribution company. The dispute was resolved in an out-of-court settlement just before the year end, and involved a Pounds 150,000 payment by World of Leather. The pre-tax outcome compared with Pounds 44,000 profits last time and came from turnover up from Pounds 25.6m to Pounds 27.2m. Operating profits, before exceptional items, increased from Pounds 526,000 to Pounds 588,000. The improvement here, the company said, was achieved through improved margins - up from 44.8 per cent to 47.1 per cent - which more than offset higher distribution charges and administrative costs. On December 26 the company opened its first new store for nearly four years, increasing the number of outlets to 29. Losses per share came out at 2.4p (0.1p earnings). The directors said that provided there was no deterioration in the current level of trading it was hoped the company would return to the dividend list this year. The last payment was in 1989.</p>

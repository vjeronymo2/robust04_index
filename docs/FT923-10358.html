			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Turkish credits deal agreed TURKEY's Export Import Bank yesterday agreed credits worth Dollars 275m (Pounds 144m) with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, when other countries' credit agencies are unwilling to extend export cover, while the former Soviet Union's debt picture remains unclear, John Murray Brown reports from Ankara. The credits form part of a Dollars 1bn financial package promised by Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, in April, and underline Turkey's aim to win business in these republics. The deal provides Turkish exporters with 100 per cent trade insurance cover, Dollars 200m for Kazakhstan and the rest for Kyrgyzstan. A list of export items has still to be agreed. The accord follows a Dollars 1.7bn power plant deal in Kazakhstan earlier this month.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / New channel for TV shoppers A BRIGHT yellow car-shaped alarm clock selling for Pounds 16.50 ushered the age of television shopping into the UK yesterday as QVC, Britain's first home shopping channel, went on air. What is being touted as the UK's first glimpse of the future of television - and retailing - is a joint venture between BSkyB and QVC Inc, the US shopping channel. It will enable viewers to buy a range of goods 'from jewellery to household items, sporting goods to designer dresses, power tools to toys' with-out ever leaving their armchairs. Products are presented in themed hour-long programmes, such as Jewellery Showcase, DIY, Gifts for Children and Sporting World. About eight items each hour are demonstrated by one of the seven US-trained presenters, whose selection process involved having to talk about a yellow pencil for 10 minutes. Viewers dial a free telephone number to order, pay by credit card, cheque or postal order, and should receive their goods within five days. The channel is available on satellite and cable television as part of a package of 14 paid-for channels offered by BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. QVC, which stands for Quality, Value, Convenience, was launched in the US less than 10 years ago, and made profits of Dollars 34.9m (Pounds 23.3m) on sales of Dollars 535.7m in the first six months of this year. Mr Barry Diller, the former Hollywood executive who is now chairman and chief executive of QVC, yesterday said that the opening of QVC's first overseas service was a 'milestone'. 'Of the many things I wanted to investigate, offering this service outside the US was very much at the top of the list,' he said. QVC, is also trying to take over its biggest US rival Home Shopping Network to form a Dollars 2bn-a-year network and is launching a venture in Mexico. In addition to the Volkswagen Beetle-shaped clock, other items advertised in QVC's first hour included a 58-piece cutlery set for Pounds 160 (recommended retail price Pounds 199, according to QVC), a silver locket for Pounds 19.50 (RRP Pounds 31.45) a three-quarter length suede jacket for Pounds 160 (Pounds 179), and a Philips HR2898 food processor for Pounds 89.50. Prices do not include postage. As it buys direct from manufacturers and has lower overheads than conventional retailers, QVC aims to be 20 per cent cheaper than high street shops. Most of the first goods on sale yesterday were not branded and therefore difficult to compare. But Selfridges, the London department store, was selling the Philips food processor at Pounds 91.99 - cheaper than QVC once Pounds 3.50 post and packing was added. Eastern Electricity was undercutting them both at Pounds 89.75 for the same product.</p>

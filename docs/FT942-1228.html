			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Ukraine N-strategy doubted EU efforts to agree on a support framework for the overhaul of Ukraine's energy sector, to make possible the early closure of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors, have been clouded by leaked reports calling into question the strategy and its costs. The EU's Corfu summit is expected to agree a common position on the Ukrainian nuclear safety question today to take to next month's G7 summit in Naples. No figures for EU aid will be decided, in the hope of extracting maximum financial pledges from the US and Japan in Naples. The essential idea is to raise funding sufficient to shut Chernobyl and complete construction of five unfinished Soviet-era reactors to western safety standards. The EU made clear last week to President Leonid Kravchuk, when the 12 signed a wide-ranging partnership agreement with Ukraine in Luxembourg, that closure of Chernobyl was of paramount concern to west European governments. An April report by experts from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, leaked by Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group, underlines the inadequate safety standards of plant design and operation in Ukraine; the near bankruptcy of the nuclear sector, which constrains upgrading and maintenance, leads to staff shortages, and risks shoddy construction; and the plethora of estimates on the costs of safe nuclear power generation. Goskomatom, the Ukrainian nuclear authority, provided the EBRD/World Bank team with an estimated cost of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m) to complete five new reactors under construction at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnitsky. A year ago, the EBRD reported to the G7 that the cost of completing just two of these reactors would be Dollars 1.5bn, about half of it in hard currency. The Ukrainian government has since said that the overhaul of its nuclear sector could cost up to Dollars 14bn. Without western aid, it predicts the likely completion of only one of the five new units - already 95 per cent finished - but only to local safety standards. The fact-finding mission also warns that Ukraine could go ahead with its February decision to re-start next year Chernobyl's second reactor, damaged by fire in 1991. The EU and its G7 partners, by falling in with Ukraine's nuclear ambitions, on the evidence of the EBRD/World Bank report face a greater challenge than they have acknowledged. Western nuclear construction companies, moreover, may balk at accepting contracts in the Ukraine because there is no legal regime to protect them from liability in the event of accidents. Under international conventions, such a regime would have to be put in place with the consent of neighbouring countries. 'They will not sort this question out in the near term,' predicted Mr Antony Froggatt of Greenpeace. 'The west is playing with fire.'</p>

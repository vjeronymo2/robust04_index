			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Cash returns REUTERS' DECISION to spend Pounds 350m of spare cash buying back its own shares deserves to be more widely imitated. The idea of buy-backs has never really taken root in the UK, despite its continued popularity in the US. Even GEC, the UK pioneer of the scheme, has not bought in shares since the mid-1980s. But the rationale is becoming increasingly persuasive. If extra cash is scarcely a pressing problem for UK companies, it is at least more common than it was. This year, for the first time in five years, the UK corporate sector looks like generating a financial surplus. Meanwhile, the return on cash is abnormally low in relation to other forms of investment, so there is a greater opportunity cost to shareholders in leaving money idle. The traditional way of managers with spare cash is to buy things; but acquisition, especially for purposes of diversification, is decidely out of fashion. There can be exceptions to the general rule. GEC, for instance, could defend its decision to stop buying shares on two grounds. First, the rationalisation of its particular industry may have further to run, so that spare cash may genuinely be held for a strategic purpose. Second, like many other UK-based multinationals, GEC has a potential problem with advance corporation tax, since buying in shares counts for tax purposes as a distribution of income. Other companies with cash mountains have less excuse. In particular, drug companies like Glaxo and Wellcome, faced with the likely prospect of dwindling returns on new investment in the harsher world of the 1990s, might care to explain to shareholders why they should continue acting as their bankers. The argument could perhaps be taken a stage further. It is worth asking why companies, in giving shareholders their cash back, should require something in return: in this case, their shares. There was a time when UK companies took the same attitude over demergers, so that Racal shareholders, for instance, had to pay cash for their shares in Vodafone, which as a Racal subsidiary they owned already. It is a measure of progress that shares in demergers are now routinely distributed free, as was the case with Courtaulds or ICI. By the same argument, more companies might care to consider handing back cash in the simple form of a one-off dividend. Reuters could argue that the buy-back method gives shareholders a choice between taking their money and leaving it where it is; and the latter option may be preferable, depending on the shareholder's tax position. But the snag about buy-backs is that they have the largely cosmetic effect of increasing earnings per share on the reduced capital. In some companies at least, the result would be that shareholders end up paying managers bigger bonuses. If in doubt, managers should remind themselves that in any transaction of this kind, the shareholder is king.</p>

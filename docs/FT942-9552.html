			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Can the FA Cup deliver quality? - Football If the Football Association succeeds in buying Wembley Stadium, it could make the crumbling monument more attractive to football fans by improving the quality of entertainment provided by its own FA Cup. Over the last two seasons both semi-finals as well as the final have been played at Wembley - but the only people who can have enjoyed the experience are Arsenal fans and accountants. Wembley is the only English football stadium that can seat more than 50,000, albeit in extreme discomfort. It is the only ground where so many people - 335,000 - could have been bored witless by the nine hours of dreary FA Cup fare that stretched from the start of the Arsenal v Tottenham semi-final last year through to the dying minutes of extra time between Oldham and Manchester United last month. The Manchester roar that greeted Mark Hughes' late equaliser against Oldham provided a reminder of the wonderful atmosphere Wembley can generate. The omens are good for today's FA Cup final. The sun will shine. The perfect pitch will glow a beautiful green. The stands will be decked in royal blue and rich red. United, cocks of the north, will carry the aura of deserved champions. Glenn Hoddle, manager of Chelsea, the plucky southern underdogs, may even offer us a precious glimpse of his graceful talents. On the other hand the spectacle may be undermined, yet again, by the weaknesses of the two teams: United's are in their heads, Chelsea's in their feet. United, an almost-great team, are also a team of many paradoxes. Chelsea, being a much more limited side, offer just one: the contradiction between the style of Hoddle the player, and of Hoddle the manager. In the league this season, United did not show the weakness under pressure that destroyed them two years ago. When Blackburn closed in, United raised their game. Paul Ince plucked draws from defeats with late equalisers against West Ham and, crucially, against Blackburn. United showed the same resilience against lowly Oldham last month. But before that, they had been outplayed for an hour and three-quarters. United have been below their best in other big cup matches: they lost the Coca Cola cup final 3-1 at Wembley to Aston Villa; they threw away a three-goal lead against Galatasaray in the European Cup and, saving their worst performance of the season for their most important match, were gutless and witless in the away leg. This is the second United paradox. This afternoon's team stands on the verge of greatness and on the verge of break-up. The regular first team contains seven non-English players. They cannot all play in European Cup games. So manager Alex Ferguson must contemplate changes. One player at risk is Mark Hughes, an old favourite but thirtysomething and a Welshman. He may find himself displaced by an English goal scorer because United's tally of 80 Premier League goals represents a poor return for the pace, imagination and variety of its attacking play. Over the last two seasons, Ferguson has been prepared to loosen his control over the team and pick more unpredictable attacking players. The tough, diligent Brian McClair has been replaced by the rough but delicate Eric Cantona; Andrei Kanchelskis and Ryan Giggs - out and out wingers - play every week, replacing safer options such as Mike Phelan, Mal Donaghy, Clayton Blackmore even Lee Sharpe. Giggs still has games where his brain seems to be in neutral; and Cantona, who seems to be sent off every time United play in black, is wanted for questioning by the FA. But United have survived his suspensions because of Ferguson's careful and costly policy of stockpiling reserve players, many of them hardly needed because the team escaped serious injuries this season. Chelsea have not been so lucky: striker Mark Stein only returned last week, but scored twice; and Hoddle has been nursing injuries all season. He will probably only pick himself as substitute. The difference between the style of Hoddle the player and Hoddle the manager causes much confusion: Hoddle the player was elegant and imaginative - his team, for the most part, is neither. There is a misconception in British football that toughness means running around kicking people. For that reason Hoddle, an inept tackler, was accused of a lack of toughness. Yet every time he played, Hoddle knew the 'tough' men would kick him - but he still played his way: holding the ball in midfield, creating a little time and a little space until the right pass was available. That required real toughness. Hoddle's team reflects the tough and practical side of his nature. He has made the most of his resources, and his team is hard-working and well-drilled. Its greatest strength is in defence. Hoddle has bought Gavin Peacock and Mark Stein - a panic buy but the right panic buy. But he has also sold skilful players. He received a good price for the ageing Andy Townsend, but parted with two younger talents: Graham Stuart to Everton and Ian Pearce for a knock-down Pounds 300,000 to Blackburn. Both had a reputation for unpredictability. Perhaps Hoddle did not feel Chelsea could afford that yet. He will be happy today if his team repeats the pattern of this season' two league games against United: brave, resourceful defence, a goal from Peacock and a 1-0 win. If Wembley is treated to a repeat of the first of those two league games, when United played with verve and flair, and Chelsea defended with passion, it will be a great afternoon. If the two teams reproduce their second meeting, when sullen United were stifled comfortably by Chelsea's defensive approach, the fans will have time to reflect on how hard and cramped Wembley's seating is.</p>

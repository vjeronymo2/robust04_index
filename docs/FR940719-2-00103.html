			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A Section 8 control group, which will receive a regular tenant-based Section 8 certificate or voucher (with no locational restrictions) plus regular briefing and assistance from the public housing agency; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An in-place control group, which will receive no tenant-based assistance but which will remain initially in current public housing or Section 8 project-based housing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All these participants will be tracked over a ten-year period to assess the program's effects. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  By using three-way random assignment, HUD will be able to provide definitive answers to three key policy questions regarding mobility programs. First, do programs like MTO contribute to moves to low-poverty areas? Second, are these moves (and not other factors) the basis for positive employment and educational outcomes? Third, is the MTO approach more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective than the existing Section 8 program in producing such outcomes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``participant'' is used to refer to a member of any of the three randomly assigned groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A2&blank;How and By Whom the Data Will Be Used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information will be used by the Department to (1) monitor demonstration activities; (2) prepare biennial reports to Congress; and (3) establish baseline information about participants for a long-term evaluation of the program, the results of which will be reported in Congress in 2004. Much of the information collected under this request for clearance will also be used by local demonstration sites to manage the program locally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A2.1&blank;Consequences if the Information Was Not Collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Without this planned data collection effort, HUD would be unable to meet its short-term responsibilities with regard to program monitoring or Congressional reporting. In addition, without collecting baseline information about participants and their families, HUD would be unable to assess long-term effects of the program and to answer key policy questions about mobility programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A2.2&blank;Description of the MTO Data Collection Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This request for OMB clearance covers two distinct groups of instruments associated with the start-up and early implementation of the MTO demonstration program. The groups of instruments are based upon the identity of the respondent:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Data collection forms with participant respondents_Baseline data will be collected through a survey of participants. These data will be used initially to describe the participants served in the demonstration; they form the foundation for the long-term evaluation of the program's effects on participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Data collection forms with agency respondents_MTO program operation data will be routinely collected and maintained by PHAs and NPOS and periodically reported to HUD. These data will enable HUD to fulfill its monitoring responsibilities and meet Congressional reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Each of the instruments in these two groups will be discussed in turn. Copies of the instruments can be found in the appendices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A2.2.1&blank;Data Collection with Participant Respondents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two data collection instruments have been developed for participant respondents: the MTO Enrollment Form and the Participant Baseline Survey. In addition, information about participants related to income, current residence and other items will be taken from HUD form 50058, which provides family-level data for households receiving assistance under the public housing and Section 8 programs. Copies of the instruments and the HUD 50058 form are found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential applicants are identified through outreach efforts conducted by the public housing agency. Families interested in participating contact the PHA by a certain date. The PHA makes a preliminary review and identifies those families that appear to be eligible for the program. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  A waiting list of screened families who are interested in participating in the program is developed by each PHA. Families are notified that they may be eligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the MTO program, and an appointment to verify eligibility is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Households must meet the following minimum criteria: (1) residence in a public housing or Section 8 project-based unit within high-poverty census tracts identified by the PHA; (2) very low-income; (3) family with children <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a family comes to the PHA for the scheduled appointment, eligibility is reviewed by a PHA intake worker. Based on this in-person review, if the applicant is eligible for the program, he/she is requested to complete the Enrollment Form and MTO Baseline Participant Survey. While the baseline is a self-administered survey, a data collection assistant will be available at each site to answer questions and assist those that may have language or literacy problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MTO Enrollment Form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MTO Enrollment Form is completed by applicants (also referred to here as ``families'') who wish to participate in the program. The Enrollment Form will be presented to the applicants by PHA staff. This brief form advises the applicant of the demonstration requirements, including random assignment, forming the basis of informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consent. The applicant checks one of the two boxes on the form to indicate whether he/she is interested in participating in the MTO program. The form is signed and dated by the applicant. The PHA staff will be available to answer applicants' questions about the demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MTO Participant Baseline Survey.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Participant Baseline Survey is completed by all those who sign the Enrollment Form for MTO and are determined eligible for Section 8 and the MTO program, whether or not they eventually receive assistance under MTO. In other words, the survey is completed by those who will ultimately be assigned to the experimental and both control groups. The survey is completed prior to random assignment, in order to avoid any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect that assignment to one group or another would have on participants' answers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Participant Baseline Survey provides information necessary for an evaluation of the long-term effects of the program. Thus, the questions are focused on developing information that can help to explain outcomes_that is, data on particular characteristics or experiences of families that will help to explain why the program ultimately affected them as it did. The baseline survey is divided into three parts. Part I requests information about the following topics:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Housing information: the participant's previous experience with the Section 8 program, the participant's mobility and prior housing, reasons for wanting to move, and condition of current housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Neighborhood: participant's satisfaction with current neighborhood, safety and victimization, neighborhood conditions, and access to services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Neighbors: the participant's social network and social supports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employment history: Current and recent employment, recent efforts to search for work, transportation to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vigueras] </F>   [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 12 Apr -- In the new era  of NAFTA, contraband continues to be a burden to the detriment  of the national economy and to the benefit of informal trade,  which grows uncontrollably under the protection of organized  contraband mafias, the customs authorities themselves, and  politicians in top government positions who protect smugglers.    At the culmination of this six-year period is a country  overrun by uncertainty, in an infrastructure of customs  corruption, interwoven in a vicious circle that includes  merchants, businessmen, and authorities who protect it -- a  system that has remained untouched, surviving the ups and downs  of international trade as confirmed by the fact that in only one  of the sections of corruption rampant in Ciudad Juarez,  approximately $800 million a year in illegal goods are imported  from duty-free stores in EL Paso.    Customs corruption is so extensive that it is possible to  illegally import whole containers loaded with beans, poultry,  lard, lubricating oil, new or old tires, potatoes, used clothes,  furniture, used vehicles, tools, toys, textiles, household  appliances, computer equipment, spare parts, or any other item  that can result in profits, which in turn extends from the  lowest to the highest officials within the Finance and Public  Credit Secretariat.    It has been pointed out that the uncontrolled import of  illegal goods originating from the United States is a blatant  example of covert impunity. It is also been said that this  impunity is being encouraged by Finance Secretariat officials  despite numerous complaints to this effect filed by private  sources.    However, this is only a sample of the lucrative business  that  extends from Reynosa all the way up to Tijuana and includes the  18 Mexican border customs posts which, far from defending the  extensive border, merely proceed to get rich during the "year of  Hidalgo." According to a study entitled "Mexico-USA, the Border  of Poverty," this activity paves the way for scandalous tax  evasion involving millions, thus blocking the country's  development.    The study reveals that during 1993, according to preliminary  estimates, the illegal importation of U.S., European, and  Asian-made goods originating from the United States, all on the  fringe of legal import activities between both countries, could  have totaled nearly $20 billion. This amount fosters the large  market dominated by an underground economy controlled by a  contraband mafia headed by well-known businessmen and corrupt  politicians who have leased the border to the detriment of the  country's tax revenues and even its development.    It has been possible to establish that outside the El Paso  duty-free stores, near Ciudad Juarez's international Reforma  Bridge, vans bearing Chihuahua, Texas, and New Mexico license  plates transport an alarming quantity of goods to Mexico on a  daily basis. These vehicles are loaded to capacity, and the  Ciudad Juarez customs authorities normally accept bribes ranging  between $3,000 and $5,000 per vehicle. Approximately 50 vans  pass through this international bridge daily.    It is a well-known fact that Mexican citizens returning from  the United States through this point are allowed by the Finance  and Public Credit Secretariat to import $50 per person  duty-free. Nonetheless, vehicles transporting contraband tend to  smuggle amounts sometimes totaling up to $100,000 per vehicle.  Considering the cost of some goods imported legally such as  Rolex watches, costing somewhere between $2,000 and $10,000, or  other expensive products independent of the large volume of  jewelry, perfumes, wines, and liquors, this adds up to enormous  sums of money." [quotation mark as published]    This does not even take into account that the Reforma  Bridge lacks import facilities, and therefore, they have no  reason to cross this bridge. The analysis by the Mexican-U.S.  Center for Border Studies reveals that several mafias control  contraband of various types with profit margins of up to 70  percent as is the case with liquor, expensive watches like  Rolexes, and other products purchased at duty-free shops brought  from the United States under preferential tariffs. The former  is the case of the English whiskey Johnny Walker, Spanish  brandies, and sophisticated French liquors. It adds that border  transactions of this type make their profits mainly from  catering to a select Mexican clientele that buys the goods  wholesale to resell them to a special group.    The study emphasizes that luxury watches from England,  Switzerland, and other European countries, like the famous  Rolex, are purchased according to the taste of select Mexican  buyers, who obtain the merchandise through the contraband kings  with the respective profits. The same process applies to  expensive French perfumes, which can only be found in Mexican  shops at exorbitant prices, and to a huge amount of jewels.  However, the study reveals that computers and electric  appliances represent a larger volume compared to the over $42  million a year earned from the consumption of cigarettes from  the United States and other European countries.    Regarding the expensive liquors that yield profit margins of  over 70 percent, it is estimated that some $150 million worth of  wines and liquors of the most prestigious worldwide brands --  bought at the so-called duty free shops in El Paso, Texas --  cross this border. This is a common occurrence, to a smaller  or a greater extent, at other points along the U.S.-Mexican  border that also cater to the finest demands of Mexican  consumers in a specialized manner.    Some 200 or 300 vans known as "venaditas" pay customs  officials some $60,000 daily, and each vehicle pays between $200  and $300 to introduce merchandise illegally into Mexico.    Sources for this information are public complaints, in  addition to thorough journalistic investigation that graphically  shows vans filled with food products, motor oil, and other  products that are being taken to a warehouse in Ciudad Juarez.  These products are mainly picked up by the Economy Cash and  Carry company, which belongs to Mike Dipp, a wealthy  businessman, and his associates. Current investigations reveal  that the customs office in Ciudad Juarez is one of the leading  ones nationwide in allowing the entry of condoned contraband,  and that customs official Carlos Aguilar is certainly aware that  the goods ["pollas"] are picked up daily from the three  international bridges on the border between Ciudad Juarez and  Texas. Of the three bridges, the San Geronimo Bridge -- which  borders New Mexico -- is the most widely used because it has  little surveillance and customs officials are not at risk of  being seen by occasional local tourists.    Finally, the study points to customs administrators in  Ciudad  Juarez, Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas -- who is  currently the customs administrator in Nuevo Laredo -- as  officials who have established a chain from Ciudad Juarez to the  border to ensure their absolute control of the contraband  stemming from Texas, the leading exporting state in the United  States. Texas exported $23 million in 1993.    This situation has created a network of nepotism within  customs personnel on both sides of the border and resulted in  the blatant enrichment of their families since they assumed  their posts since Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas have  formed a monopoly [un enroque de puestos].</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has slammed  Radio 702 for broadcasting what it calls misinformation from one  of the government's dirty tricks departments. Spokesman Carl  Niehaus was referring to reports that ANC Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa had bought a farm in the eastern Transvaal.  Niehaus says such reports are unfounded and he says it's the  media's duty to avoid being used to disseminate deliberate  misinformation.    [Niehaus] We are concerned that Radio 702 allowed such a  campaign to be carried on the air virtually throughout the day  and it took them over four hours before they approached the  African National Congress for any comment. The ANC believes  that this places a serious responsibility on the media not to  run such dubious stories without checking and double checking  their authenticity.</p>

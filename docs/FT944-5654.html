			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Observer: On the ROCs Britain may not yet recognise the People's Republic of China in the political arena, but the powers that be have at last sanctioned an official trading relationship with Taiwan. At the end of the month, the Department of Trade and Industry takes over the functions of the independent Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee, which has been busily promoting UK trade for 20 years from its office in deepest Croydon. Given that the latter fostered trade in a host of exports from Scotch whisky to railway rolling stock, and managed to create the largest overseas market for Montego cars, the DTI may find it a hard act to follow.</p>

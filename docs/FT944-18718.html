			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Russian currency concerns deepen The fall in the rouble is 'very dangerous' to the Russian government and could push reform off course because the government would lose the fragile confidence it created in the country earlier this year, according to the senior official concerned with the Russian budget. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, said, however, that his government was still prepared to take 'unpopular' measures in order to attract international financial support for a reform programme. In an interview with the FT, Mr Alexashenko said that there was very little the government could do to stem the flight from the rouble to the dollar. Mr Alexashenko said that the central bank had spent more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) defending the rouble in the past two to three months and on his calculation had only Dollars 4bn-Dollars 4.5bn left - 'and after that, what, clearly, there is nothing'. The rouble has lost more than 16 per cent of its value against the dollar in the past week and at close of trading on Friday stood at Rbs2,633 to the dollar. The deputy minister said that 'there will be a drastic rise in the inflationary expectations of the people, and of course an increase in inflation itself - and in the medium term an increase in government expenditure. But the psychological result will be the mistrust of government policy and a continued outflow of funds from the rouble to hard currencies.' Mr Alexashenko - a young economist who was formerly in the 'expert group' created by Professor Yevgeny Yasin, now a presidential adviser - has emerged as a key player in the battle to keep the government's tight money strategy on course and to argue with the international financial institutions for increased support. Brought into the government less than a year ago, he says that 'the government of (prime minister Victor) Chernomyrdin is much tougher than (former prime minister Yegor) Gaidar's. This prime minister says No to everything.' Speaking in a break between hectic talks on the 1995 budget - already delayed in its promised delivery to the parliament - he said the assumptions for that budget would also be thrown into confusion by a continuing plunge in the value of the rouble. 'We were assuming a certain dynamic in the exchange rate. we did not expect such a devaluation. 'If this continues we will have to change the budget's parameters - and cut down on expenditure. The process will be very hard.' The International Monetary Fund, now at its annual conclave in Madrid, should 'make clear its view one way or the other,' said Mr Alexashenko. 'For two years we had a lot of promises but little aid delivered. 'Now I believe the government is ready to take even unpopular decisions  - but I'm not sure that either the IMF or the Group of Seven are ready to say what measures they will support,' he said.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Economic Notebook: Investment crisis put in perspective A glance at events over the past seven days might almost suggest that the UK is facing an investment crisis. Among last week's gross domestic product figures was the news that manufacturing investment fell by a real 6 per cent in the first quarter compared with the final three months of last year, and was respectively 13 per cent and 28 per cent down on the first quarters of 1991 and 1990. The new half-yearly outlook for the industrial world's economy from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris put the UK at the bottom of the Group of Seven countries' business investment league. Not only does the OECD expect gross private non-residential fixed capital formation in Britain to register a decline this year for the third year running, it also forecasts that Britain will experience the slowest business investment growth of the G7 countries in 1993. In the committee stage of the finance bill, Labour MPs tried to retain the Business Expansion Scheme for manufacturing industry on the grounds that small companies would otherwise be starved of capital to finance investment. The MPs' concern was increased by last week's gloomy official reports which were based on quantitative data. But are such figures the best way to judge investment trends? Mr Martin Ricketts, economic director of the National Economic Development Office, suggests that poor investment figures do not tell the whole story. Value for money should also be considered when looking at investment statistics. In a paper destined for a National Economic Development Council meeting, but which, since the government decision to kill off Neddy, Mr Ricketts has completed in a personal capacity, he argues that any government that set out in pursuit of quantitative investment targets would be making a big mistake. The collapse of communism bears out this idea. As Mr Ricketts observes: 'No society was more driven by the demands of investment than that of the Soviet Union and few can have used investment to so little effect.' Nearer home, the fact that Britain is well represented among the world's most profitable companies suggests that some managements are value added from the investments they make than some of their rivals. The relative success of some UK businesses indicates that factors other than the volume of capital investment create competitive advantage. These, according to Mr Ricketts, are assets which potential rivals find hard to copy and include: Technical innovation. While Britain's spending on research and development as a share of GDP is lower than that of the US, Germany, Japan and France, some companies such as Glaxo have proved to be successful in turning product innovation into high profits. Teamwork. This entails the creation of a co-operative, alert and adaptable workforce. Reputation. This important form of intangible capital can only be established by continuous attention to the customer. Such assets take time to create. They cannot simply be bought off the shelf or created through government schemes. On the other hand, few people would dispute that Britain, with unemployment heading towards 3m, needs more investment. Much of the good achieved in the 1980s, when UK business investment grew more than 40 per cent and at a rate second only to that of Japan among the G7, has been undone by the recession. In these circumstances, what should the government's policy be? Mr Ricketts suggests that policy objectives should focus on facilitating the creation of competitive advantage and on removing impediments to investment rather than offering investment incentives that might be of dubious value. The government is already doing some of the right things, according to Mr Walter Eltis, Nedo's director-general. He singles out the encouragement given to foreign companies to set up shop in Britain as an important part of an investment-friendly industrial policy. Foreign-owned companies employed 14.6 per cent of the workers in manufacturing industry in 1989. But they paid 17.6 per cent of the wages and salaries and produced 23.5 per cent of manufacturing output. They were also big investors, responsible for 26.7 per cent of net capital expenditure. This worked out at net investment of Pounds 5,354 per employee for foreign companies compared with Pounds 2,512 for domestically-owned companies. This foreign involvement in the UK did more than simply create jobs. The investment by the Japanese car companies, for example, was of high quality as well as quantity. It incorporated the assets highlighted by Mr Ricketts such as technical innovation, teamwork and reputation of end product. In some cases, such as the television set industry, such foreign investment has resulted in the complete replacement of a domestically-owned industry by foreign-owned plants. In other cases, notably the car industry, the superior overall performance of foreign-owned companies has forced UK rivals to imitate, invest and innovate. The UK has created a climate conducive to investment in other ways. The corporation tax rate, at 33 per cent, is the lowest in Europe and below US levels. Personal taxes are low by most EC standards. Industrial relations have been transformed since the mid-1980s, so that the number of days lost to strikes last year was the lowest for a century. Other things need to be done. Mr Ricketts says the government must reduce inflation further. Low inflation makes it easier for companies to plan ahead and should help pave the way for lower interest rates. Britain's poor infrastructure is another barrier to investment and growth as are the weaknesses of its education and training systems. These are points that need to be hammered home constantly to both industry and government. However, the government's decision to close Nedo means there will be one less forum for the discussion of such issues.</p>

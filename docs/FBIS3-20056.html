			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mannheim (DPA) -- Despite a ban on demonstrations,  more than 10,000 Kurds came to Mannheim to hold rallies on  Sunday [27 March]. The dispersal of many gatherings by the  police was largely peaceful. In the evening, city and the  police spokesmen told journalists that a total of 40 persons  were arrested. Apart from two, whose arrests were not because  of the demonstration, they have been released again.    Kurds in Germany and abroad had called for a mourning march  for two women who had burned themselves in Mannheim last Monday  in protest at the oppression of their people in Turkey. In the  evening, Mayor Gerhard Widder (Social Democratic Party of  Germany) said that the city had banned the demonstrations  because the safety of citizens and demonstrators had not been  guaranteed. During strict checks, which the police had  instituted along all major roads leading into Mannheim in the  morning, arriving Kurds had been told so. According to the  latest experiences, a high potential of violence and new  self-immolations had to be expected.    Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) stressed that it was expected that  up to 40,000 Kurds would answer the call. Therefore, it had  been agreed with the other laender that checks would be held and  Kurds recognized as participants in the banned demonstration  would be prevented from continuing on their way. This led to  far fewer persons coming than had been feared. The Federal  Border Police (BGS) had stopped the entry of Kurds at the  borders, such as at the three-country corner near Aachen.    Police pointed out that, during the checks, more than 250  knives, machetes, cudgels, and blank-cartridge pistols were  seized. This shows that acts of violence would have been  possible. The tactic of dispersing gatherings for  demonstrations, but countering escalations led to the fact that  no one was injured and the only material damage caused was to  two cars. The strong presence of the approximately 2,700  officials of the BGS and police from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse,  Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bavaria was also quite impressive.    The police stated that, despite the strict checks and the  many people turned back, as of noon, Kurds -- 10,000 in the end  -- kept entering Mannheim. Slogans were repeatedly shouted  against the Turkish Government, but also against the German  Government. Some people in the crowd were arrested. Batons  were not used.    In the afternoon, the Kurds withdrew to the edge of the  city,  from where they departed in the evening, after those arrested  had been released and a minute of silence had been observed.</p>

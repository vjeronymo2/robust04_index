			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Morozov, personal correspondent (Salekhard): </F> "In the Interest of the Northern Peoples"]    [Text] The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!"  association discussed the results and implications of the March  election and addressed a statement to Russian government  agencies.    It says: "As a result of the elections to the Federal  Assembly of the Russian Federation, there are no representatives  of the small Northern nationalities among the three elected  deputies. Only three of the 13 elected deputies of the  representative agency of the government of the Yamalo-Nenetsk  Autonomous Okrug represent small Northern nationalities. This  has confirmed the earlier fear that the present electoral system  would lead to a situation in which no one in the representative  bodies of government would be defending the rights of the small  Northern nationalities.    "The board of the `Yamal for the Descendants!' association  demands that the RF Federal Assembly include quotas in  legislative instruments on federal and local elections, pursuant  to Article 69 and the first paragraph of Article 72 of the  Constitution of the Russian Federation, so that at least 25-30  percent of the deputies will represent small nationalities and  ethnic groups."    A similar statement was issued by an association of small  nationalities from Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug.    In the middle of March the State Committee on the Management  of State Property issued Directive No 508-r. It defines the  procedure for exchanging vouchers for shares of stock in the  Gazprom RAO by the population of Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrug.    The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" association  feels that the document "contradicts the essence of the Russian  President's Directive No 58 of 26 January 1993 on the sale of  5.2 percent of the stock of the joint-stock company to the small  Northern nationalities and the personnel of budget-carried  organizations and organizations securing the development of gas  condensate deposits."    The association feels that the directive of H. Chubays'  agency should be amended because it will allow all inhabitants  of the okrug to take part in the check auctions, with no  restrictions on the checks negotiated by a physical person. Even  individuals who have never lived within the territory of the  okrug will be allowed to bid in the auctions. The Yamal  Investment Check Fund, which collected the vouchers of much of  the rural population, has been excluded from the participants.  All of this "will lead to a situation in which a privilege  intended for segments of the population with little social  protection will be granted to absolutely different groups, and  primarily to commercial and shadow entities."    That is why the board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!"  association authorized, Kh. Kzyngi, its president, to send a  letter to Chairman R. Vyakhirev of the board of the Gazprom RAO.  The letter explains the association's assessment of the  directive and expresses the hope that esteemed Rem Ivanovich  "will, as usual in recent years, take effective action to  protect the interests of the small indigenous nationalities of  the North....    "The present situation is so critical that we have to take  the necessary steps to let the population of the okrug judge the  seriousness of our intentions to cooperate."</p>

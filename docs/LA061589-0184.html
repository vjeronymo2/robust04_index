			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BANK SEEKS $211,000 PLUS DAMAGES;  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN FARMERS MARKET FACES FRAUD SUIT  </P> <P> Dana Niguel Bank has sued Christian Farmers Market for more than $211,000 plus  punitive damages, alleging that the upscale grocery chain has defrauded the  institution and defaulted on a loan.  </P> <P> The lawsuit gives further indication of financial problems for Christian  Farmers Market. Over the weekend of May 27, the chain abruptly closed the doors  of its open-air grocery and food court at MainPlace/Santa Ana mall.  </P> <P> Christian Farmers Markets still operates two stores, in Laguna Hills and San  Juan Capistrano. The chain earlier had two other stores, in Diamond Bar and  Fullerton, according to the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The owners and founders of the Orange County grocery chain, Michael and Susan  Christian, could not be reached for comment. Their attorney also could not be  reached.  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit filed April 25 in Superior Court in Santa Ana, the  Christians borrowed $290,000 from Dana Niguel Bank in May, 1987. The loan "was  to repurchase all of the business assets" of the Christian Farmers Market in  Diamond Bar, which had been sold the year before, according to the lawsuit.  </P> <P> To secure the loan, the Christians gave the bank a security interest in the  accounts, fixtures, furniture and inventory of the Diamond Bar store.  </P> <P> Within 15 months, by August, 1988, the Christians -- without asking the bank's  consent -- had transferred their collateral in the Diamond Bar store to their  landlord in exchange for ending their 15-year lease, the lawsuit states.  </P> <P> The bank agreed to substitute the collateral at the Diamond Bar store for the  collateral at the Christian Farmers Market in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The Christians later "abandoned the Fullerton store and turned over the key to  the store to the landlord," the lawsuit states.  </P> <P> The Christians have not made payments on the bank's loan since Feb. 1, the  action contends. The bank wants to immediately collect more than $211,415 plus  interest and punitive damages.  </P> <P> In addition to seeking repayment of the loan, the bank has sued the couple for  fraud. The bank contends that the couple "had no intention of repaying the  loan" or giving Dana Niguel Bank a security interest in the collateral of the  Diamond Bar store.  </P> <P> Bank officers declined comment on the suit. The bank's lawyers could not be  reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Ship's post-bail arrest valid THE PRINSENGRACHT Queen's Bench Division (Admiralty Court): Mr Justice Sheen: July 15 1992. OWNERS OF a ship against which a writ in rem has been issued submit to the court's Admiralty jurisdiction if, before the writ is served, they voluntarily give bail for the purpose of avoiding the ship's arrest. And a subsequent arrest despite bail is valid if it was not vexatious or oppressive in that the plaintiffs believed it to be necessary to preserve the jurisdiction. Mr Justice Sheen so held when dismissing an application by the defendant owners of Prinsengracht, to set aside the arrest of the ship by the plaintiff cargo-owners. HIS LORDSHIP said a writ in rem was issued by the cargo-owners against Prinsengracht on April 15 1991. It could not be served that year because she did not come within the jurisdiction. In January 1992 it was anticipated that Prinsengracht would enter an English port. On January 28 Clyde &amp; Co, the cargo-owners' solicitors, wrote to Holmes Hardingham, solicitors for the shipowners, requesting security for the claim in the hope that the need to detain the vessel could be avoided. They enclosed a draft letter of undertaking for the shipowners' agreement, confirming that they agreed that claims should be subject to English law and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court. Holmes Hardingham resp-onded by notifying Clyde &amp; Co that a bail bond had been provided by the London Steamship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association. By that bail bond the Association submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, and consented to execution if the shipowners failed to pay any sum adjudged against them. On January 29 Holmes Hardingham, without waiting for the writ to be served on the ship, acknowledged issue on behalf of the shipowners. If the shipowners wished to take part in the proceedings, they were entitled to do so by virtue of Order 75 rule 3(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The rule provided that a defendant to an action in rem in which the writ had not been served 'may, if he desires to take part in the proceedings, acknowledge the issue of the writ . . .'. There was nothing new in a defendant waiving the necessity of service. He could enter an appearance as soon as he heard the writ had been issued, although it had not been served. At about 10.45am on January 29, an assistant solicitor for the shipowners attended the Admiralty and Commercial Registry with a bail bond in the correct form, and it was accepted for filing. The next person at the counter was a clerk from Clyde &amp; Co, with the documents necessary to effect an arrest. The Admiralty Marshal phoned Clyde &amp; Co and asked if they wished to go ahead with the arrest despite the fact that a bail bond had been filed. They said yes. At 11.10am, the Marshal phoned HM Customs at Immingham. Prinsengracht was arrested at 11.40am. Mr Teare for the shipowners acknowledged that if Clyde &amp; Co had reached the Admiralty Registry before Holmes Hardingham, the court would have had jurisdiction. He submitted that if a ship was arrested and then released a few minutes later when bail was given, the court had jurisdiction; but if bail was lodged a few minutes before arrest, the court did not have jurisdiction. He said that followed from the Court of Appeal decision in the Deichland (1990) QB 361. Mr Kendrick for the cargo-owners contended that the shipowners had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction, and that the cargo-owners had shown good and sufficient reason for the arrest even though a bail bond was given. The first question was whether the shipowners had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction. The writ was a writ in rem addressed to the owners and/or demise charterers of Prinsengracht. The claim was within the High Court's Admiralty jurisdiction. An opportunity to serve that writ might never have arisen. The shipowners took the voluntary step of acknowledging issue of the writ. They thereby became party to the action which, from that moment, became in personam as well as in rem. By acknowledging issue of the writ, the shipowners voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction because they 'desired to take part in the proceedings'. Their voluntary act in acknowledging issue of the writ at a time when no action by them was called for because the writ had not been served, was the clearest submission to the jurisdiction. The next question was as to the nature of bail. DR Thomas on Maritime Liens, p228 said bail was not a guarantee to the plaintiff, but an undertaking to the court, and might therefore only be given following appearance in the action. It said it fol-lowed that 'where bail is prov-ided there is on the part of the res owner a concurrent submission of his personal liability beyond the value of the res'. That statement was adopted. It accorded with what had always been the practice of the court, and was reflected in RSC Order 75 rule 6 which provided that a person entering a caveat against arrest must acknowledge service and give bail or pay into court. In the Deichland the shipowners' club had given a letter of guarantee but had not agreed to submit to the jurisdiction. The ship had been served but not arrested. The court held that the jurisdiction given to it by Article 7 of the 1952 Arrest Convention was only preserved by Article 57 of the 1968 Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention as rel-ating to a 'particular matter', if there was an arrest. But that did not rule out jurisdiction by express agreement (see the Deichland, 385 G) or by submission to the jurisdiction (382 H). Contractual security might be given without submitting or agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction, as in the Deichland. But bail could not be given without submitting to the jurisdiction. There was no reference to that in the Deichland because it was not relevant. It would be absurd and it would bring the law into disrepute if a defendant could procure a bail bond in which there was a solemn undertaking to satisfy judgment, and then say to the plaintiff 'you cannot obtain judgment because you cannot arrest my ship and I have not submitted to the jurisdiction'. That was not the effect of the decision in the Deichland. The shipowners, by acknowledging issue of the writ, had shown their desire to take part in the proceedings. They were free to do so. They had submitted to the jurisdiction and the motion must fail. In case a higher court held that the shipowners had not submitted to the jurisdiction, the next question was whether the arrest was valid. Mr Teare submitted that on provision of bail the ship was released from the action and could not be arrested. He relied on Dr Lushington's judgment in The Wild Ranger (1863) Br and L 84,87 - 'bail given for a ship in any action is a substitute for the ship'. It was held in the Arctic Star, February 1985, CA that the rule that bail represented the ship and that she should be free from further arrest on the same claim, was viewed in the light of whether it was oppressive and vexatious to re-arrest. In the present case there had only been one arrest, which lasted less than a day. It was not vexatious or oppressive. The ship was arrested solely because the shipowners declined to agree expressly to submit to the jurisdiction, and because it was thought the Deichland decision might have made it necessary to arrest her though bail had been given. In looking after the cargo-owners' interests, it was natural for Clyde &amp; Co to make sure they did everything necessary. If arrest was necessary to preserve the jurisdiction, it could not be wrongful. If contrary to the court's view bail could be given without submitting to the jurisdiction, and it remained necessary for the cargo-owners to arrest the ship, that arrest could not be unlawful. The motion was dismissed. For the cargo-owners: Dominic Kendrick (Clyde &amp; Co). For the shipowners: Nigel Teare QC and Simon Kverndal (Holmes Hardingham).</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUST JOKING, NOT DROWNING, YELTSIN SAYS  </P> <P> Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin told the Supreme Soviet on Monday that an  investigation has been made into a purported attempt to drown maverick  Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, but Yeltsin said on state TV that it was all a  joke.  </P> <P> Bakatin told the lawmakers that Yeltsin had reported to a policeman that a car  overtook him, and unknown persons made him get into their car, pulled a bag  over his head and, on reaching a bridge across the Moscow River, threw him in  the water.  </P> <P> "Yeltsin said he managed to reach the bank, rested to regain his breath and  then turned to the militia (police). However, he asked the militia people not  to let anyone know what had happened," according to an account by the Tass news  agency.  </P> <P> Bakatin said that legal action was started to establish the circumstances  behind the statement made by Yeltsin, since it referred to a criminal case  involving an attempt on a person's life. Yeltsin's account "could not be  confirmed," Bakatin said.  </P> <P> Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30, two days after the alleged incident, that the  policeman misunderstood a joke. On Monday, he had to tell the Supreme Soviet  and the entire nation.  </P></p>

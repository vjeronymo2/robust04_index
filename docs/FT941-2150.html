			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall further ahead of Fed meeting US Treasury bonds suffered further losses yesterday amid continued jitters over monetary policy and ahead of this week's influx of fresh supply. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower at 91 9/16 , with the yield rising more than four basis points to 6.944 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 to 99 3/16 , to yield 5.051 per cent. After a sharp downturn in bond prices in the previous session, the tone of the market remained decidedly defensive. Uncertainty over the timing of the Federal Reserve's next strike on short-term interest rates was the catalyst to renewed selling pressure and a dearth of any significant buying interest. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, was scheduled to meet in Washington today. The consensus among Wall Street analysts sees the central bank lifting its target for the Federal Funds rates - at which banks make overnight loans to one another - by either 25 or 50 basis points, from the current 3.25 per cent level. But the extent of the market's recent weakness has surprised some analysts, given last week's unthreatening data on consumer and producer prices. The perception of political interference in the rate-setting process was partially to blame, following Friday's unexpected talks between President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman. Another factor exacerbating the market's jitters was the breakdown of negotiations between the US and North Korea over nuclear inspections and threats by the White House to take steps to punish the recalcitrant Asian power. Of more direct concern was the Treasury's plans to sell Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes today, followed by an auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities on Wednesday. The new issues could inspire slack demand in view of the fluid state of Fed policy. An overwhelming belief that the US Federal Reserve will further tighten policy today sent European government bond markets lower at the start of trading yesterday. Analysts said they expected the Fed to proceed cautiously since a rise of more than a quarter-point would be viewed negatively by the markets. 'The Fed will try to avoid upsetting the markets,' said one analyst. However, traders said the lower levels attracted some bargain-hunting, which pushed prices a shade higher in the afternoon. They added that a widening in the yield differential between 10-year German government bonds and UK government bonds to more than 100 basis points prompted some investors to switch from bunds to gilts. The spread has been as narrow as 50 basis points in the past. In London, gilts drifted higher after a weak opening but most of the activity was in the futures market. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded between the day's low of 108 19/32 and high of 109 9/16 before settling at 109 1/8 in the late afternoon, down  7/32 on the day. In the cash market, five-year gilts made the day's best gains, of around 7/32 , as traders who had gone short of paper with that maturity last week in the belief that the Bank of England would announce a five-year, fixed-rate auction were forced to cover their positions. The Bank is due to announce details of its first auction of floating-rate gilts for 15 years today. The market expects the issue to have a five-year maturity, to be priced to yield 20 to 25 basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and to raise in the region of Pounds 3bn. Analysts reported that the Bank had been in close consultation with leading participants in the gilts market regarding the size of the issue, which reflected its desire for a smooth launch. A successful issue would open up new funding avenues for the Bank, analysts said. The defensive nature of the issue is likely to appeal in particular to the monetary sector, to central banks and to foreign institutions. Bunds recouped some of their early weakness on hopes of a further fall in the Bundesbank's repo rate tomorrow, to 5.8 per cent from 5.88 per cent. The bund future on Liffe broke above a chart resistance point of 96.20 and rose to the day's high of 96.52. However, it fell back to 95.82 in the late afternoon, down 0.78 points, due to lack of follow-through buying. The market also found some support in economists' bullish forecasts on German inflation. Provisional cost of living data for the month to mid-March are expected to be published by the end of the week. A year-on-year figure of 3 per cent would please the market. By contrast, traders said the publication of M3 for February would not have much impact on the market provided it came within forecasts of around 15 per cent. Italian government bonds eased as the countdown started to the March 27 general election. The Italian government bond June future fell just over one point to 109.36 in the late afternoon.</p>

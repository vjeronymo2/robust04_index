			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Turn of Tides for Kohl in </F> Opinion Polls"]    [Text] Bonn -- Almost all recent opinion polls indicate  that the mood in the population is changing in favor of the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In various inquiries, Kohl is also  catching up in the direct comparison with his contender, Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping.    The recent figures received by the Chancellor's Office in  Bonn also reveal that the situation has improved in the new  laender. This includes a survey carried out by the Allensbach  Opinion Research Institute, according to which as many as 52  percent of those asked in all of Germany believe that there will  soon be "flourishing landscapes" in eastern Germany.    The question that was put to 1,036 citizens was: "Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1990 said that there would soon be  flourishing landscapes in the eastern laender. He was laughed  at for this statement and exposed to a lot of criticism. What  do you think, will there be flourishing landscapes in the  eastern laender before long or can this not be expected?" Only  34 percent of those asked stated that one could not expect it,  with 14 percent saying neither yes nor no.    In a survey carried out by the Forsa-Institute, for the  first  time 33 percent preferred Kohl to Scharping, who received only  29 percent. In an Emnid survey carried out last week among  1,500 citizens, the CDU/CSU for the first time stands at 40  percent again and the SPD only at 39 percent. In the Emnid  survey, 48 percent preferred Scharping to Kohl in the direct  comparison. Compared to the previous Emnid survey, the SPD  challenger dropped 6 percent from 54 percent, while Kohl scored  44 percent this time.    The most recent Infas survey sees support for the CDU/CSU at  38 percent and the SPD at 39 percent. One pollster explained:  "In the Lower Saxony election of March, the SPD had gone across  the top in the polls by reaching 40 percent. Ever since, it has  remained beneath the 40-percent level in all Infas surveys. The  CDU/CSU, however, has increased its popularity virtually one  percentage point each month since mid-February (35.5 percent)."</p>

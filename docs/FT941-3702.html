			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Taken in isolation, yesterday's UK producer price figures should have been a tonic for gilts. Output prices showed an underlying increase of just 2.4 per cent in the year to February and there has been a marked deceleration in the last three months. Input prices showed a small seasonally-adjusted increase in February, but they are still down 3.6 per cent on the year despite scaremongering about commodity price rises. That gilts only managed a half-point rise in low volume clearly reflected continuing worries about how the New York bond market will react to this week's torrent of US data. With long gilt yields some 5 percentage points above inflation, the positive message from yesterday's producer prices must eventually reassert itself. Then the authorities might again have an opportunity to raise long-term funds at rates well below 7 per cent. This week they must decide whether to hold an auction in March. If they are brave enough to go ahead, they may have to content themselves with a short-dated issue. The producer price figures could help with that by keeping hopes of lower base rates alive. The figures are good news for equities too, whether or not they lead to a rate cut. The large discrepancy between the trends in input and output prices suggests manufacturers are enjoying higher margins without inflationary price rises. Small wonder earnings and dividends are turning out higher than the market expected.</p>

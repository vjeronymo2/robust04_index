The source added that the airplane, registration TG-CAC and  piloted by Gerardo Poitevan, carried 18 delegates, including Dr.  Sergio Viva Scheel, a UN human rights consultant. This fact was  later corroborated by Hugo Leon Mejia del Aguila, the human  rights office assistant in Nebaj, Quiche.    The visitors witnessed the attack and saw how the rebels  fired indiscriminately without regard for the fact that  civilians were present in a flagrant violation of human rights,  the Army report states.    The Guatemalan Army reported that this attack shows once  again the guerrillas' lack of respect for the sacred right to  life. After the rebel attack, the visiting delegations traveled  without further incidents. The delegates did say they would  report the event at the international level because the URNG's  criminal action exposed its lack of political willingness to  promote peace, the report concludes.</p>

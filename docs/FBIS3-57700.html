Payin is head of the Committee on  National Politics under the Russian Presidential Council and a  respected political scientist.    The Russian Bloc is made up of political parties who support  the reunification of the Crimean Peninsula with the Russian  Federation. The Russian Party, the Black Sea Fleet Officers'  Assembly, and the Russian Popular Council have been the most  active in supporting such a move. And they all have been  supporting Yuriy Meshkov for president of the Crimea since  February 1993.    What are the possible consequences of their struggle?  According to Payin, "it would be impossible to peacefully and  legally turn the Crimea over to Russia: Leonid Kravchuk has the  right, given to him by the Ukrainian parliament, to overrule any  decision taken by the Crimean authorities which contradicts the  Ukrainian Constitution and threatens that state's territorial  integrity".    The Russian Foreign Ministry has also declared its  unwillingness to strain relations between Russian and Ukraine  over the Crimean question, taking into account the current  situation in both countries.    After his victory in the first round of the presidential  elections, Meshkov himself announced that he was not going to  insist on the Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine and unification  with Russia. Meshkov intends to fight for equality between  Ukraine and Russia in Crimean matters, especially concerning the  Black Sea Fleet, according to Payin's assesment.    No matter what the results of the voting are, Payin predicts  that ethnic tensions in the region will rise. However, he  emphasized that, "any expected result in the elections at the  current stage will not be cause for a reexamination of the  Crimea's fate or status".    Despite Russia's determination not to inflame the subject,  Payin is sure that "the election results will not bring the  Crimea reconciliation, since it is completely possible that  those groups who are unsuccessful in the elections will step up  their illegal political activities. Despite the balanced  position occupied by Kiev and Moscow, there are forces in both  Russia and Ukraine who have a lot to gain from destabilising the  political situation. These are the "soldiers of fortune", who  have already shown up in the Dniester area, Abkhazia, and other  regions of conflict", the presidential advisor explained.</p>

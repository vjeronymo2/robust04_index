			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kedar Nath Pandey: "Will India Succeed in </F> Globalising Economy?"]    [Text] Indian economy is passing through many kinds of  pulls and pressures. At one end of the spectrum, we have the  Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, who under the benediction  of Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, would like India to  dispose of its economic assets to go global, because the present  government has nothing to show on the credit side of its  achievements. Then, there are "Swadeshiwalas" who have time and  again expressed their reservations on the Congress Government's  present economic policy in many spheres. The third force in  operation is what is called the "Bombay enclave" of  industrialists, who through the FICCI [Federation of Indian  Chambers of Commerce and Industry] have demanding for a "level  playing ground," and express fears about opening up the economy  without due safeguards for indigenous sector.    On the political plane, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has  let its support to this demand by stressing the need to  strengthen Indian business before exposing it to external  competition. The party has also called for restricting the entry  of foreign multinationals to core sectors of the economy.    A rather crude formulation against multinationalism has come  from the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (organization of  service to the nation)] in the form of the slogan of swadeshi  and the call to boycott consumer products of foreign-dominated  companies. The attack on the office of the British agri-business  giant, Cargill in Karnataka by an incensed gang some time ago  and the company's recent withdrawal from the export-oriented  industrial salt project in Kandla in the face of a vociferous  campaign are the other unsavoury manifestations of  anti-multinationalism. No wonder, former Industry Minister  George Fernades finds the setting right for his crusade against  some of the multinationals.    This built-up against multinationalism and external  liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to  stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In  particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what  needs to be done at the policy level in dispel genuine fears of  industry.    While build-up against multinationalism and external  liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to  stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In  particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what  needs to be done at the policy level to dispel genuine fears of  industry.    While industry leaders continue to support external  liberalisation, they have put forth certain specific demands.  These include a correction in the existing "inverted" duty  structure under which the import duty on finished products is  higher than that on capital goods, raw materials and  intermediates; further lowering of interest rates to bring them  down to international levels; removal of restrictions on  inter-corporate investments; permission to borrow against  shares; and permission to issue non-voting shares. The basic  idea is to enable Indian industry to grow in size, to be able to  compete against foreign multinationals and to protect Indian  promoters against possible takeover bids by foreign moneybags.  The government would do well to look into these demands and take  necessary steps, not only to reassure Indian industry but also  to blunt the edge of much of the criticism at the political  level.    So far as imports are concerned, there is definitely a case  for adjusting the tariffs in such a way that finished products  attract a higher duty than the related capital goods and  intermediates. The inverted tariff structure is against all  tenets of good taxation. But short-term revenue considerations  have held the Finance Ministry back from correcting this  aberration.    The perceived strength of the Indian capital goods industry  provided the Finance Ministry the argument for reducing the  import duty on such goods. But there is no justification for  subjecting the industry to unfair competition. If despite the  inverted tariff structure, capital goods imports have not risen  so far, it is partly because of the high cost of imports after  the devaluation of the rupee. In this sense, the Indian capital  goods industry still enjoys a certain measure of protection. But  the lower imports of capital goods are also attributable to  lower government investments and the slow pace of foreign  investment. The crunch will come when foreign investors bring in  their own capital goods in the form of equity to compete against  indigenous suppliers. It is, therefore, hoped that the necessary  correction in the present tariff structure will be made in the  forthcoming budget.    As regards interest rates, again, industry's demand is  unexceptionable. Although the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has  brought down the lending rates by 4 percentage points since  October last year through piecemeal reductions, the present  rates are still almost double the average international level.  Industry needs bank credit to meet its working capital  requirements and to enhance its capacity utilisation. The RBI  Governor recently stated that there would be no further  reduction in the lending rates for some time. This is far from  what industry had expected.    The RBI and the Finance Ministry are unduly paranoid about a  sharp cut in lending rates. Their fears about inflation getting  worse on this account do not reckon with the deflationary impact  of increased capacity utilisation. Nor are their apprehensions  about bank deposits coming down as a result of the concomitant  cut in lending rates well-founded. Even if bank despite come  down for a while and the money flows into other channels, it  will eventually come back to the banks.    As it is, the spread between deposit and lending rates in  India is too large. If despite this, some of the banks are not  making enough profits or are in the red, it is because of their  inefficiency. Therefore, what is needed is expeditious action to  carry out the overdue financial sector reforms. Putting off  further cuts in lending rates sends out wrong signals about the  government's commitment to these reforms.    Provisions for inter-corporate investments as well as  amalgamations have to be liberalised to enable Indian companies  acquire the requisite muscle to face the competition from  foreign multinational majors. In fact, it is time to promote  some of our own multinationals. There are several companies in  both private and public sectors which have the capacity to  assume this role but are hamstrung because of government  restrictions. For instance, the public sector BHEL [Bharat Heavy  Electricals, Limited] can go truly global, provided it is  allowed to raise money abroad or float its own finance company.  We have to go a long way in revitalising the public sector which  accounts for a major chunk of industrial investment.    Lowering of tariff and non-tariff import barriers and free  inflow of foreign direct investment and technology form an  essential part of the globalisation exercise. But in order that  globalisation works to the country's advantage, a series of  steps are necessary to enhance the competitive edge of the  Indian economy.    Foremost, we have to strengthen our production base. And  this  is saying a lot. For, all impediments in the way of efficient  production have to be removed. But the real test of the  globalisation strategy will lie in the country's export  capability. Apart from a strong production base, cost  competitiveness and quality, what is imperative is a complete  reorientation of production and marketing operations. The old  concept of market coinciding with national boundaries has to  give way to a new one. In today's context, market is where  demand is -- whether at home or abroad. Hundred per cent export  units or EPZs [Export Processing Zones] have lost much of their  relevance. Export capability has to permeate the entire economy.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: RC Cement owners to place 28% on NYSE The Italian owners of RC Cement, the US cement company, are to place 28 per cent of the company on the New York Stock Exchange next month, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. The company's controlling shareholders - Unicem, the Italian cement business which is part of the Agnelli family's empire, and Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement manufacturer - will place 4.125m shares on the market, raising between Dollars 66m and Dollars 78m. Unicem owns 66.7 per cent of RC Cement, and Italcementi the rest, but after the placing, which is being handled by Lazard Freres, the French bank, their stakes will drop to 48 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. This year, RC Cement is expected to report turnover of Dollars 160m. In the first nine months of this year, Unicem said the US company increased sales by 24 per cent to Dollars 125m, due to a recovery in cement consumption in the US, generating a net profit of Dollars 12m.</p>

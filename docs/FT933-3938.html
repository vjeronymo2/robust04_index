			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani cotton fears ease PAKISTAN'S CENTRAL cotton committee - the country's largest government backed body for research - expects this year's crop to reach the target of 12m bales, despite recent reports of a leaf curl virus attack and a feared locust invasion. The latest assessment comes amid growing concerns over the future of crops, especially as fears run high ahead of a fresh entry of locust swarms from Indian Rajasthan, next week. Pakistan's cotton crop suffered a shortfall of about 3m bales last year, because of widespread devastation caused by floods, heavy rains and a similar virus attack. Mr Iftikhar Afzal, vice president of the committee, said this week that the cotton crop in the Southern province of Sindh has been better than expected. As a result, the province is expected to produce up to 1.8m bales, 20 per cent above target. In Punjab, where the bulk of the country's cotton is planted, there may be a slight shortfall from the target of 10.5m bales. Recent rains there have brought down temperatures and prevented the virus from flaring up, with the result that earlier estimates of losses have been reduced. Despite the reassuring assessments, the final crop output will depend on the extent to which Pakistan is able to control the locust attack, officials say. 'We are doing everything to save the crop. If we are unable, the consequences can be devastating. But we have been able to control quite a lot of activity on the locust,' said Mr Afzal. Other officials say, moreover, that farmers are better prepared this year in applying pesticides, based on their experience last year.</p>

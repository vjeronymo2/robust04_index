			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lack of data slows trade A LACK of fresh economic data and lethargy after the long weekend led to an extremely quiet day on the foreign exchanges yesterday. 'There has been no real news to stimulate the market into any sort of activity,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, who described the day as torpid. Analysts said a small rally by the dollar in late trading was more the result of speculative money moving around than reaction to any news. However, both the dollar and sterling benefited to a certain extent from a wobbly D-Mark, which weakened in the wake of the warning from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, at the weekend that Germany faced four years of tight financial policies with public spending growth limited to 2.5 per cent per year. Mr Waigel said there would be no new spending commitments without compensatory cutbacks in spending elsewhere, a comment which prompted immediate rumours that Germany might be pressured to lower interest rates at the Group of Seven meeting this weekend. The US currency closed in London at DM1.6690, after last Thursday's DM1.6650. In Asian trading the dollar had ended slightly higher at Y134.47 and DM1.6655. In New York last night the dollar finished at DM1.6687/92 and Y134.21/26. Sterling finally stood at Dollars 1.7500/07. The pound remained well supported, hovering above DM2.91 throughout the day. However, traders said the UK currency was still having great difficulty breaking resistance in the DM2.9180 to DM2.9220 area. Figures for UK retail sales and trade data, due on Friday, are likely to be down-played by the markets as 'pre-election' data presenting a distorted month-on-month comparison because of uncertainty caused by the general election. The main currencies in the European Monetary System ended a quiet day little changed from the end of last week. The D-Mark, under slight pressure from the generally firmer dollar, drifted lower against the lira and French franc but gained a fraction on sterling. Overall, it eased to 20 per cent of its allowed swing above its central Ecu rate from 22 per cent on Thursday. The French franc closed at FFr3.3793/98 against the D-Mark, a 12-month high and up from FFr3.3798/3803 on Thursday, as the market continued to show its approval of former finance minister Pierre Beregovoy's appointment as prime minister on April 2. The lira, which had weakened at the start of the month on uncertainty surrounding Italy's general election, improved to L750.80/90 against the D-Mark from Thursday's L751.55/65. The Spanish peseta has been added to the exchange cross-rates table.</p>

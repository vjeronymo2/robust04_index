			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: KLM raises Fl 1.19bn with global public offer KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has raised Fl 1.19bn (Dollars 625m) through a global public offering of ordinary shares which closed heavily oversubscribed yesterday. The total, which includes the sale of slightly more than Fl 225m in preference shares to the Dutch state, was nearly Fl 200m higher than KLM expected to raise. The carrier said the success of the offering made KLM one of the world's most strongly capitalised airlines. The proceeds will be used to improve the balance sheet, opening up opportunities for KLM to finance capital spending from internal resources. KLM had planned to issue at least 18.5m shares at Fl 44 each, but the strong demand prompted the banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro and Merrill Lynch, to exercise its option to sell an additional 2.8m shares. The Dutch state will maintain its long-standing 38.2 per cent voting stake in KLM by purchasing 970,455 new ordinary shares, investing Fl 235m in new convertible preference shares and topping up its payments on shares that were previously partly-paid by Fl 22m. The airline said this flexibility by its biggest shareholder, which had said it wanted to spend no more than Fl 300m, enabled it to generate maximum proceeds. Of the state's total investment, only Fl 43m would take the form of new ordinary shares, increasing availability to other investors. KLM said demand from the US had been reasonably strong, while there was heavy demand from Anglo-Saxon countries. Most demand came from institutional investors. KLM's US partner, Northwest Airlines, recently cut the price for its initial public offering in New York. But Mr Pieter Bouw, KLM's president, noted that conditions governing an IPO were different from those associated with a capital-raising exercise by a company like KLM, which has long been listed.</p>

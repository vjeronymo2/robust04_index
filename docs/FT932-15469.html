			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Spanish bank goes ahead with share offer ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish bank, is to go ahead with its international share offering in spite of the uncertainty created by yesterday's snap election announcement. The bank announced a price range of Pta3,500 to Pta3,950 a share for the sale, valuing the 22.31 per cent stake on offer at Pta98bn to Pta110bn (Pounds 625m). Analysts described the range as reasonable, saying the final price would be close to or even below the group's book value of Pta3,863 a share. The final offer price will be set on or around April 23 and the subscription period will start at the end of the following week. 'In an electoral period it is likely that Argentaria will be seeking to offer as attractive a price as possible,' said Mr Juan Cueto of Ibersecurities, a Madrid stockbroking firm. Argentaria will offer 28m shares or approximately 22.31 per cent of its equity. The offer may be increased to 31.3m shares, or 24.9 per cent, if justified by demand. More than half of the offering will be aimed at retail investors in Spain. Four million shares, in the form of 8m American depositary receipts will make up the US tranche with Morgan Stanley acting as lead manager. The UK tranche comprises provisionally 3.5m shares, with SG Warburg as lead manager. The continental European tranche, lead by Union Bank of Switzerland, will account for 2.5m shares. A further 1m shares will be offered outside these areas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA)--Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn  Khudayyir has received Jordanian Education Minister Dr. Khalid  al-'Umari and his delegation. The prime minister emphasized the  depth and strength of fraternal bilateral relations, especially  in the educational field, and said these relations are based on  the common future of the sons of the Arab nation and their  glorious Arab and Islamic heritage.    He praised fraternal Jordan's position toward Iraq while  confronting the 30-state aggression and the unjust siege imposed  on it, and emphasized that Iraq will not forget this honorable  pan-Arab position by the fraternal Jordanian people.    Khudayyir said that if Iraq had not built an advanced and  broad educational base and scientific cadre, it would not have  been able to rebuild after the sinful 30-state aggression with  such speed and efficiency.

The prime minister asked the guest minister to convey his  greetings to the Jordanian prime minister along with his wishes  for continued progress for the brotherly Jordanian people.    Dr. al-'Umari conveyed the greetings of the prime minister  of  fraternal Jordan to the prime minister, and his wishes of  continued progress to the Iraqi people.

He said his visit aims to discuss means of implementing the  educational agreement concluded by the two countries.

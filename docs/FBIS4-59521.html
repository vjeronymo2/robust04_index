Our troops have gone past Jawl Madram,  which is located in front of the al-'Anad base.    Meanwhile, the valiant, brave Armed Forces on the  southwestern axis managed to advance dozens of kilometers from  the Kharaz area eastward, heading toward the Salah-al-Din camp.  They seized large quantities of hardware, vehicles, equipment,  and a sea radar station.

The aircraft returned safely to base.    The units of our Armed Forces in all axes and sectors  received many of officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers who set themselves free from the grip and domination of  the apostate, secessionist forces, joining the units of the  forces of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy,  declaring their rejection of the secessionist, conspiratorial  scheme and joining the units of our Armed and Security Forces to  confront the enemies of the people, unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy.

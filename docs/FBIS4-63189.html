			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by itar-tass string correspondent semyon ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 -- A Gorizont communications and  telecasting satellite was launched from Site 81 of the Baykonur  Cosmodrome at 05.01, Moscow Daylight Saving Time, on Friday by  Russian Space Defence Forces (SDF).    The satellite was lofted into space atop a heavy-duty  three-stage Proton-K booster rocket with a Dm-2 boost section.    This is the second Gorizont satellite launched under a  contract between Russia and the U.S. Rimsat company (the first  one was launched on November 18, 1993).    The contract provides for the launching of seven Russian  satellites -- three Gorizont ones and four Express ones --  within the period of September 1993 to March 1996. They are put  into geostationary orbits with fixed postions over the Pacific  Ocean region. The full value of the contgract is 150 million  U.S. dollars.    The successful launch was watched by Rimsat company  representatives, a spokesman at the SDF press centre told  ITAR-TASS.    The launch was the 210th one since 1967 when a Proton-K  booster rocket was used for the first time and the 188th  successful one.</p>

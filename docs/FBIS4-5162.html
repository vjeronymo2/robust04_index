Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Korean  people  cannot remain an onlooker to this but are keeping tabs on  Japan's moves.    The analyst says:    The Japan defence agency has set it as a primary task to  "increase the capacity of intelligence gathering.",it is putting  fresh muscles into the system of gathering information on the  Korean peninsula and training in secrecy information-gathering  experts with the help of the U.S. CIA.    Though the Cold War has ended Japan is now showing extra  zeal  in gathering information about the DPRK and other countries by  using even satellite photographs provided by the United States.  This is a tell-tale sign of its preparations for overseas  aggression.    The top political and military quarters of Japan are  attempting to overpower the DPRK with strength in league with  the United States and the South Korean puppets. This is an  anachronistic and foolish design.    The Japanese reactionaries must clearly know that their  scheme to fulfil their design of overseas aggression,  intensifying information gathering against the DPRK, will lead  them to destruction.</p>

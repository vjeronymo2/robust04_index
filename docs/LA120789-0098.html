			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORT URGED TO FIND BERTH FOR MUSEUM SHIP  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has urged the Port of Los Angeles to find a berth  for the merchant ship Lane Victory, but it stopped short of recommending that  the ship be placed at Berth 87 in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles Maritime  Museum.  </P> <P> The 11-0 vote represented a partial victory for the Long Beach-based U.S.  Merchant Marine Veterans World War II, which has been trying to renovate the  ship into a floating museum and is pressing the Harbor Department to give up  Berth 87.  </P> <P> The Harbor Department has repeatedly refused the group's requests, saying it  needs Berth 87 for use as a container terminal. However, spokeswoman Julia  Nagano said, "We are working with them to find a permanent home and we are very  supportive of their venture."  </P> <P> The council's resolution, introduced by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, asks  the Harbor Department to find a home for the ship "in a locale with easy public  access and adequate parking accommodations, where it will serve as a memorial  museum and benefit the residents of Los Angeles and all of Southern  California."  </P></p>

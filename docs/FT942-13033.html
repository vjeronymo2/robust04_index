			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Labour says defence statement is a cover-up: Up to 20,000 redundancies expected; Military bases may merge; Some activities face privatisation The Ministry of Defence yesterday released its annual statement on defence expenditure several months earlier than usual and without the usual statistical details. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, presented the document as a commitment to maintaining or even increasing Britain's fighting capacity. He said that high performance by the armed forces was one of Britain's greatest strategic assets and would not be compromised. The annual statement was unusual in containing virtually no change in defence policy. The timing of the statement prompted a storm of Labour complaints that the government was covering up its plans for an overhaul of support services in the armed forces which are expected to involve heavy job losses. Labour MPs said the government was postponing announcements of large cuts and heavy redundancies until after the local and European elections. Labour criticised the document for failing to give details of the cuts which would come from the review of costs, which is called Front Line First. Mr Rifkind confirmed that more than 30 separate studies of possible savings were under way and that the defence ministry was studying more than 3,000 proposals for saving money from its own workforce and ordinary service staff. However, no final decisions had been made. The minister said that the breadth and capacity of Britain's armed forces was matched only by that of the US, Russia and France. Mr Rifkind added that the government intended to maintain that position. At the same time, however, he came under attack from Conservative backbenchers for jeopardising frontline forces through cuts in support staff. Front Line First is expected to recommend mergers of bases, privatisation of some services and up to 20,000 redundancies among support personnel. Under the proposals Rosyth naval base in Scotland could close, and several headquarters could be merged. Up to 90,000 vehicles may be leased instead of owned, and much of the Royal Air Force's maintenance could be handled by private companies. Tory MPs expressed deep concern yesterday about the effect of impending cuts in the defence budget, in spite of Mr Rifkind's assurances. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said he wanted to see what Front Line First would show, but warned that sweeping cuts in military support staff could reduce frontline effectiveness. 'We have to be very careful that we don't leave our troops unsupported,' he said. 'We have to make sure that they have real back-up.' Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said: 'This is a whitewash, not a white paper. The Tories are running scared on defence.' But Mr Rifkind was supported by Sir Archie Hamilton, a former Tory defence minister, who said: 'I am being constantly reassured that the the savings are there.' But he said some proposals would face strong political opposition.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FRONT LINE FIRST: THE OPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Transport vehicles and aircraft leased rather than purchased  -RAF Logistics Command - current staff 13,000 - scrapped and work   transferred to private sector  -Senior officers cut by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent and perks   such as staff and cars cut back  -RAF HQ at High Wycombe and army HQ at Wilton merged with Navy HQ at   Northwood  -Closure of Rosyth Naval Base  -Merger of Medical staffs of Army, Navy and Airforce.

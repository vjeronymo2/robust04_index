			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 88. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1) because it would start the 45-day period on the day after the date the patent owner or the approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received notice of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. The comment argued that the 45-day period should begin on the day after the date that the patent owner and the approved application holder received notice and, if these dates differed, the latest date should mark the start of the 45-day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency agrees with the comment and has revised &sect;314.107(f)(1) to begin the 45-day period on the day after the date the patent owner and the approved application holder have received the applicant's notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 89. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2). Absent a notice of an action for patent infringement, the proposal would make the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective immediately upon the expiration of the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit or upon FDA's completion of the review and approval process, whichever is later. The comments noted that the regulation would have ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicants notify FDA whether a patent infringement suit had been filed and asked FDA to permit, by regulation, patent owners to notify FDA whether it had brought suit. Alternatively, some comments would require the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certify that it had not been sued. The comments explained that these changes were necessary because ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants would have no interest in notifying FDA whether suit had been filed because, without such notice, they could immediately secure effective approval of an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to permit patent owners or their representatives to notify FDA whether a patent infringement suit has been filed. The statute does not require applicants to certify that they have not been sued, and the agency does not believe such a burden to be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has also made minor revisions to &sect;314.107(f)(2) to place more emphasis on an applicant's obligation to notify FDA immediately of the filing of any legal action within 45 days of receipt of a notice of certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the agency has made a grammatical change in &sect;314.107(f)(2) to clarify that applicants must send the notification to the Office of Generic Drugs or to the appropriate division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research reviewing the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90. One comment addressed the requirement in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) that a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed ``before the expiration of the 45-day time period or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever occurs later.'' The comment argued that a patent owner had 45 days to file a lawsuit after receiving a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent and, therefore, a party should have an additional time period beyond the 45-day period for filing an action for patent infringement for notifying the agency whether an action had been filed. The comment would revise the rule to give a party an additional 15 days beyond the 45-day period to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. FDA believes it is important to learn immediately if an action for patent infringement is filed before the completion of the 45-day period to avoid an erroneous approval with an immediate effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has, therefore, amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to require applicants to notify FDA immediately whether any legal action has been filed. The agency has also amended this subsection to clarify the identity of the ``applicant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 91. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified its notification requirements in &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii). As proposed, &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii) would have required parties to identify a drug by its established name, but would not have expressly required any identification of the drug if no established name existed. The agency has amended this provision to require identification of the drug product by its established name or, if no established name exists, its active ingredient(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 92. One comment asked FDA to publish information regarding the status and progress of patent infringement suits so other ANDA applicants could decide whether to intervene in the suit ``and ask that the 30-month period be shortened or lengthened in the event that it feels that one or both of the litigants are not reasonably cooperating in expediting the action.'' Alternatively, the comment asked FDA to permit any interested party to petition the agency ``to remove an ANDA from exclusivity considerations if it has not proceeded with due diligence_either in prosecution of its ANDA or defense of an infringement suit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes that ANDA applicants are capable of monitoring the progress of patent litigation without imposing the additional burden of acquiring and publishing information on patent litigation on FDA. The agency, therefore, declines to adopt the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also declines to amend the rule to permit third parties to petition the agency to deny exclusivity to an ANDA due to the ANDA applicant's actions during litigation. Under the statute, the reduction or enlargement of the 30-month period is left to the trial court's discretion. Intervention by the agency is unwarranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93. One comment suggested replacing the words, ``action to defend,'' in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iv) with the words, ``action for patent infringement.'' The comment said that ``action to defend'' was not a term of art.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees and has adopted the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94. FDA, on its own initiative, has modified the language regarding waivers in &sect;314.107(f)(3). The change is intended to clarify that the patent owner does not object to FDA's approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application with an immediate effective date and to account for those situations where the ANDA applicant or 505(b)(2) applicant and the patent owner have agreed to extend the 45-day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Section 314.108_New Drug Product Exclusivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;314.108 was intended to implement the new drug exclusivity provisions under section 505(c)(3)(D) and (j)(4)(D) of the act. This section of the act provides specific time periods, known as new drug product exclusivity or market exclusivity, during which the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA must be delayed or, in some cases, a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA cannot be submitted. For example, section 505(c)(3)(D)(i) and (j)(4)(D)(i) of the act grant a 10-year period of exclusivity to new chemical entities that were approved during January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act grant a 5-year period of exclusivity to new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984. These sections of the act expressly state that no 505(b)(2) application or ANDA may be submitted during the exclusivity period except that such applications may be submitted after 4 years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(iii), (c)(3)(D)(iv), (j)(4)(D)(iii), and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act grant a 3-year period of exclusivity to an application or supplemental application that is approved after September 24, 1984, and contains ``reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval'' of the application or supplemental application and ``conducted or sponsored by'' the person submitting the application or supplemental application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 505(c)(3)(D)(v) and (j)(4)(D)(v) of the act granted a 2-year period of exclusivity to drugs that are not chemical entities or for certain changes to already approved products that were approved during January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984. FDA did not propose any regulations for this 2-year period because it expired on September 24, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exclusivity provisions of the act do not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic version of the same drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) would provide 3 years of exclusivity to an application that was submitted under section 505(b) of the act, was approved after September 24, 1984, was for a drug product containing an active moiety that had been previously approved in another application under section 505(b) of the act, and contained reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(5) would provide 3 years of exclusivity to a supplemental application that was approved after September 24, 1984, and contained reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

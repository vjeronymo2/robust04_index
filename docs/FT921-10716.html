			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round has Easter deadline, says Andriessen THE international trading community had a 'window of opportunity' until Easter to reach a basic agreement on a final package in the long-delayed negotiations of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), Mr Frans Andriessen, vice-president of the European Commission, said yesterday. Addressing a two-day conference in Rome on Italy's foreign trade, Mr Andriessen said that if an agreement could not be reached by Easter, the US presidential campaign 'with its announced heavy stress on isolationism and protectionism, will thereafter probably close that window for the remainder of 1992'. He insisted it was essential for the EC to make a final effort 'to reach the best possible consensus across the board'. But he warned that the EC's final efforts to compromise had to be matched by parallel engagements and concessions by all the main trading partners in the Gatt. 'There are no chances of a negotiated deal without the Community; but even lesser chances of a deal negotiated against the Community,' he added. The proposals put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, had required 'substantial improvements, notably in the field of agriculture'. The EC, he claimed, was being asked 'what we cannot deliver; and what we can deliver is not accepted by our partners'. Contrary to a number of 'misleading' reports, the Commission was not eager to get a deal at any price and Brussels did not accept deadlines ' as blind dates'. Although he recognised the need for mutual compromise, there was no way he could recommend a deal to the Council of Ministers which did not seem 'suitable and profitable to the Community's long-term economic interests'.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans The 8 per cent rise in Rothmans International's shares and a corresponding 18 per cent leap in those of Dunhill Holdings suggests the UK market has high hopes for Richemont's proposed restructuring, despite the somewhat botched manner in which it was announced. The Stock Exchange was surely right to suspend both shares given Richemont's distressingly vague statement. There is certainly a managerial argument for re-organising Richemont's cascading shareholdings into two discrete industrial groups with separate listings. The previous objection was the ostensibly punitive tax implications. But the establishment of twinned UK and non-UK holding companies may permit Richemont to skirt such difficulties. This should also allow Rothmans and Dunhill to distribute surplus cash to shareholders more efficiently. With some Pounds 900m of cash in the bank, Rothmans' largesse could be considerable. The fusing of Dunhill and Cartier - in which Richemont and Rothmans both have stakes - would create an attractive international business. The reshaping of Rothmans will leave it as a pure tobacco company supported by enhanced dividend prospects.</p>

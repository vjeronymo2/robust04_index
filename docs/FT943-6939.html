			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Germans settle property claims The German federal office for the regulation of property questions, set up to deal with outstanding property rights claims in eastern Germany from the Nazi and Communist eras, yesterday said it had settled 38 per cent of all claims by last June, excluding enterprises. More than 43 per cent of all claims for businesses had also been settled. The office, which expects to take 10 more years clarifying the rest, originally registered 1.248m claims for 2.8m property titles. Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt have resolved only 20 per cent and 31 per cent respectively of all enterprise claims largely because both regions had sizeable Jewish communities, and it has been difficult to trace descendants. Saxony, with 62 per cent, has the highest rate of settlement among the eastern states.</p>

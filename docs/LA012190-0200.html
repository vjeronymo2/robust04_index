			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRISON RELEASE ATTRACTS SWARM OF NEWS MEDIA  </P> <P> Reporters from all over the country have converged on the story of Charles  Rothenberg's Wednesday prison release, for weeks inundating both the man who  set his son afire and his ex-wife with interview requests.  </P> <P> From Oprah Winfrey's show in Chicago to East Coast network and local television  news programs, the media have tried to arrange coverage of Rothenberg as he  leaves prison. The Times, "A Current Affair," CBS News and KABC-TV have  interviewed the son Rothenberg burned beyond recognition nearly seven years  ago. CNN is still interested in doing so. Dozens have been turned away.  </P> <P> "Simply today, I think I've fielded probably a half-dozen calls alone about him  and I expect it will intensify," said Ted McAlister public information officer  at the San Luis Obispo California Men's Colony from which Rothenberg will be  paroled.  </P> <P> "Local reporters and press as far away as New Jersey have inquired, so it's  coast to coast," an already weary McAlister said Thursday. "All forms --  television, radio, print -- have contacted us. Oprah Winfrey, Joan Rivers, all  your other 'Hard Copy,' 'Inside Edition'-type programs."  </P> <P> Rothenberg, 49, has denied all requests for in-prison interviews. While media  coverage of his departure from the medium- and minimum-security compound is  expected to be extensive, it is unlikely that anyone will actually see him  leave.  </P> <P> Public outrage about his release has forced prison officials to keep  Rothenberg's parole destination a secret. So he will be removed from the  6,465-inmate facility with stealth, officials there say, possibly in darkness.  </P> <P> Although authorities are trying to avoid a "media circus," another corrections  official said, a "camp-out" of reporters and television crews is nevertheless  expected outside the remote prison grounds.  </P> <P> According to Harry Gaynor, director of the New Jersey-based National Burn  Victim Foundation, at least five media outlets have inquired about having him  and Rothenberg on their shows once Rothenberg reaches his parole destination,  and dozens more have called with questions. So many, in fact, that Gainer now  only returns phone calls collect. The foundation intends to publish "A World  Without Tears," a book about child abuse co-authored by Gaynor, Rothenberg, a  psychiatrist and a minister.  </P> <P> To publicize the book -- the foundation would receive any profits -- Rothenberg  has said he is willing to appear on a few "carefully selected shows" to "help  other parents." However, none of those appearances has been scheduled because  Rothenberg does not know where he is being paroled, and it remains unclear  whether he would be allowed to travel.  </P> <P> Although Rothenberg has refused to be interviewed as his prison release  approaches for fear of jeopardizing it, he has communicated in several letters  to reporters. In his correspondence with The Times, he writes incessantly of  the "overwhelming" media attention.  </P> <P> Some prison officials believe that Rothenberg enjoys what he perceives as  intense personal interest in him. Thus, they suspect he may ultimately reveal  his whereabouts once coverage of his release ends. This troubles them, said  Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the Department of Corrections, which oversees  California's prisons. Parole agents do not want to continually relocate  Rothenberg in the event communities discover him there and protest. And Kindel  said some corrections administrators worry what Rothenberg may do when the  attention fades.  </P> <P> "I think he'll do something," Kindel said. "I am still convinced this guy loves  this stuff and if the media would ever leave him alone, I think he is the kind  of guy who would be interested in getting it (the attention) back."  </P> <P> After seven years in the national spotlight, 13-year-old David Rothenberg and  his mother, Marie Hafdahl, are tired of the attention. They have repeatedly  cooperated with the media, partly to promote a 1989 television movie of the  case and a book she co-authored.  </P> <P> They have refused requests, however, to appear with Rothenberg in any of  television appearances he might make. And they are hoping reporters will leave  them alone after this week.  </P> <P> David Rothenberg, who has been interviewed since grade school, says he is tired  of the questions, the "dumbest" being: Is he angry at his father for trying to  kill him? "What do you think?" he said he asked the reporter. "What would you  think? That was a dumb question."  </P> <P> He is polite about it, but adds: "I'm kinda sick of it."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Nov 16--The Health Ministry will get a  Rs. 300 crore soft loan from the World Bank for its national  leprosy eradication programme. With this, the Government hopes  to bring all of its yet-to-be-covered 66 endemic districts under  multi-drug therapy and focus on the need for the rehabilitation  of cured patients.    Giving this information at the annual meeting of the  voluntary organisations and state leprosy officers, the Union  Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Mr B. Shankarananda,  said an increase of 35 per cent in the grant-in-aid would be  given to the voluntary organisations involved in the programme.  As many as 285 voluntary organisations and NGOs are enlisted for  this programme.    Of the 201 districts in the country which have been  identified as endemic for leprosy having more than five cases  per 1000 population, 135 districts have been brought under the  multi-drug therapy. Besides, there are 77 districts which are  moderately endemic having two to five cases per 1000 population.    While opening the two-day conference here, the Minister  admitted to "having miles to go" before achieving the target of  eradication of leprosy by 2000, even though there are about one  million leprosy cases in the country which is one-fourth of  1981-82. Though the discharge of cured patients is more than  twice the number of new cases, each year another three to four  lakh new cases are being added.    Rehabilitation problem: On rehabilitation, he  called upon voluntary agencies to play a more active role. "As  more and more patients are being treated, the problem of their  proper rehabilitation in society is becoming more visible and  acute. It is therefore essential to work out and initiate an  appropriate rehabilitation programme. For the leprosy afflicted  patients of the poor sections of society, social rehabilitation  has little meaning unless accompanied by economic resettlement."    The Health Secretary, Mr. R.L. Misra, said several good  projects in rehabilitation were not accepted in the past because  of the confusion on whether rehabilitation was the  responsibility of Ministry of Welfare or Health. Since Mr  Shankarananda's taking over in July 1993, it has been decided to  entrust rehabilitation to the Health Ministry.    Dr A.K. Mukherjee, Director-General of Health Services, said  it was possible to reduce the incidence of leprosy by 41 per  cent in the last decade due to the multi-drug treatment which  had shortened the duration of treatment.    India has been playing an important role in developing and  testing immuno-therapeutic and immuno-prophylactic agents for  leprosy eradication. Leprosy vaccine is a distinct research goal  and an area of high research priority.</p>

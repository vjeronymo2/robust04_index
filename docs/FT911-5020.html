			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Hasbro may alter bid to appease Tonka holders HASBRO, the biggest US toymaker which has offered Dollars 470m to acquire Tonka, maker of Monopoly, Play-doh and Tonka trucks, yesterday said it was willing to change the terms of its bid in an attempt to appease disgruntled bondholders who have not been willing to tender under terms of Hasbro's initial offer. Hasbro, which last week said it might drop its bid if the deal is not completed quickly, said it would increase the price for Tonka's 16 1/4 per cent series A debentures to 92.8 cents on the dollar from 80 cents on the dollar. Hasbro will also raise its offer for Tonka's 17 1/4 per cent series B debentures to 93.2 cents on the dollar from 75 cents, provided at least 90 per cent of holders of each series agrees to the revised offer. However, the new bid is contingent on Tonka's stockholders accepting a reduced offer of Dollars 5 a share from Dollars 7 a share. On Wall Street, shares in Tonka dropped 63 cents to Dollars 4 3/4 yesterday. Hasbro said the Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund, a unit of Goldman Sachs which owns more than half the Hasbro bonds, had been unwilling to accept the company's previous offer but was prepared to accept the revised bid. Tonka's board is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to consider amending the merger agreement. The new offer increases the total value of Hasbro's bid to Dollars 486m.</p>

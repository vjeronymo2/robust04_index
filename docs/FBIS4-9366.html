			<p>BFN     [Text] Republic of Croatia President Franjo Tudjman has  sent a letter to Prime Minister Nikica Valentic; Luka Bebic,  president of the Committee for Internal Policy and National  Security; Supreme Court President Milan Vukovic; and State  Prosecutor Krunoslav Olujic. The letter is based on Article 94,  Paragraph 2, of the Croatian Constitution, which defines the  president's obligation to secure adherence to the Constitution  and the regular functioning of the state authorities.    The letter demands that they investigate and establish the  real state of facts, within their powers, regarding the claims  by Stipe Mesic published in FERAL TRIBUNE on 25 March, in which  he says: A number of murders have been committed, whose  perpetrators have still not been arrested, although their  identity is known. It is known who killed Reihl-Kir [head of  Osijek police, killed in summer 1991], Saban Krivokuca, and the  Zec family.    The letter demands that the government and the relevant  parliamentary committees, within their defined powers, examine  the situation regarding protection of human rights and the  implementation of the principles of a law-governed state, in  particular all incidents which violate the legal order and all  forms of crime.    I am proceeding from the belief that the Croatian state  authorities, despite the war, paid particular attention to the  protection of human rights and implementation of all basic  principles of a law-governed state, to the importance of the  rule of law and the need for all state authority bodies strictly  to adhere to law and the constitution and to effectively take  measures to curb all forms of crime. I have emphasized this on  many occasions, for instance in my address to the parliament on  23 March 1993, the letter says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  deployed on Thursday formations of Pacific-based pursuit-assault  planes and VTOL [vertical take-off and landing] assault planes  at the U.S. Air Force bases in South Korea, according to  military sources.    The warplanes were flown in an air war exercise with the  skies above Yongwol, Chunchon and Asan Bay as its operational  theatre. In coordination with more than 100 fighter-bombers,  assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes of  the U.S. Seventh Air Force stationed in South Korea, they staged  an exercise of striking targets and supporting ground attack.    The drill was a wildcat war gamble designed to increase the  capability of quick flight of the fighter planes of the U.S.  Marines to the Korean peninsula and their capacity of surprise  strikes at the North in coordination with the U.S. Air Force  flying corps present in South Korea.    The frantic war exercises against the northern half of Korea  clearly reveal the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S.  imperialists.</p>

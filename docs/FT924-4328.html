			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Beijing leaders 'don't want to deal with Patten' CHINESE leaders do not want to deal any more with Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, because they do not trust him, one of China's top advisers in Hong Kong said yesterday. But Mr T S Lo, who was a member of the colony's Legislative and Executive Councils in the early 1980s and is one of Beijing's 44 advisers in the colony, sought to allay concern that China would move to set up a separate institution to vet agreements the Hong Kong government made with business. On Monday China said that any agreement the Hong Kong government entered into would be invalid if not first approved by Beijing. This promoted widespread concern that China was attempting to bring the process of government in the colony to a standstill. Yesterday the Hong Kong stock market continued its slide, with the Hang Seng index down 90.06 points to 5,411.65. It has lost 9.6 per cent so far this week. 'When they talk about the Chinese side's agreement they are talking about the system that has been set up already - the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and anything created under those auspices,' Mr Lo said. 'I can't visualise a de facto shadow committee which adjudicates on the validity of contracts entered into between 1984 and 1997.' On his visit to Beijing Mr Lo met Li Peng, China's prime minister, and Lu Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese cabinet. His comments were seen as authoritative, but it is unlikely that China will agree to any big contracts until Mr Patten withdraws his proposals for more democracy. Mr Lo indicated that China would not back down on its opposition to the governor's proposals. He said China feels that the Basic Law - the Beijing drafted constitution for Hong Kong which comes into effect when the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 - provides for a lot of democracy. He said that Chinese officials feel that all Mr Patten is doing is breaching deals already reached between Britain and China. 'Because of that they feel that they don't want to deal with him any more.' Yesterday Mr Patten repeated in an interview with the BBC that the fate of his blueprint for constitutional reform would be decided by the Legislative Council. He said that while he could not introduce more democracy than the community wanted, he 'could not go less far than the community wants me to go.' 'At the end of the day, these matters will be decided in Hong Kong by the Legislative Council. . .I can't go beyond what the Legislative Council wants to do.'</p>

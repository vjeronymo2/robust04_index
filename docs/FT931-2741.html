			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Marketing (Management and Advertising): The direct seller's party piece If you want to sell sex toys or Tupperware tubs in a recession, how do you go about it? Throw a party, according to a growing number of small clothing and hardware firms. In recent years party plan selling - as the original Tupperware sales format is known - has been expanding along with other forms of home-based marketing. Turnover in the direct-selling sector now amounts to more than Pounds 769m, and is growing at 10 per cent a year, according to a recent report by the Direct Selling Association. Some of the most successful firms are notching up annual growth rates of more than 50 per cent. The Ann Summers group, for example, which first made its name with sex shops, has seen its sales of lingerie and marital 'novelties' almost double in the last two years to Pounds 43m, primarily through party-plan selling. The more mundane household item Betterware group - which, after the cosmetics giant Avon, is now the second-largest direct-selling company in the UK - has recorded a rise in its turnover from Pounds 2m to Pounds 65m. Direct sellers themselves attribute this growth to their aggressive marketing techniques - at a time of low consumer confidence personal contact and word-of-mouth recommendation is, they say, more effective than advertising. 'If people are told that times are bad, that they shouldn't spend money, then they don't like going shopping. But the demand is definitely still there if you take it to them,' claims Deon Melck, managing director of Tupperware UK, the original pioneers of the suburban hard sell. But another factor seems to be the attraction of part-time sales work at a time of high unemployment. In spite of the changes in female employment that have occured since Tupperware parties were first launched in the 1950s, the majority of the 45,000 direct selling agents in the UK are still women. Ninety three per cent of these are part time, and increasingly they schedule the sales work for the evenings. 'It's a good job,' says 'Phil' a London-based saleswomen for Ann Summers, who had previously organised Tupperware parties. Her commission from the sales - 79 per cent of direct selling companies work on a commission basis - is around Pounds 1,000 a month. 'In a recession people might not want to go out and buy a vacuum cleaner - but they do want to have fun,' she adds. In the case of Ann Summers this fun factor pays dividends. To break down inhibitions, each sales party starts with games, continues with demonstrations and then finishes with women placing their orders in carefully sealed, anonymous envelopes. At a typical Thursday evening party in Orpington, Kent, most of the 15 female guests arrived claiming that they were only there 'for a laugh' - but then left after spending a total of Pounds 235. Although most direct sellers recognise that their sales forces may contract if jobs growth in the economy resumes, they insist that their turnover will continue to rise in a recovery. Nevertheless, as James May, director of the British Retailers Consortium, points out, the sector still remains tiny compared with the retail market, accounting for less than  1/2 per cent of total consumer sales. According to the Direct Selling Association, however, retailers have recently shown increased interest in direct selling. But attempts to fuse the two sectors face a fundamental problem - sales staff may be less motivated to market their goods if they can be easily purchased from a nearby corner shop. In an effort to prevent retailers from 'poaching' their ideas, direct-selling companies are now attempting to step up product innovation. Tupperware, for example, recently launched a new range of childcare products. But as direct-sales companies themselves acknowledge, ultimately their main weapon remains their low overheads, flexible sales force and, above all, the personal customer contact. 'It works because we pay attention to the customer,' says Richard Berry, director of the Direct Selling Association. 'In that respect maybe the retailers could learn from us.'</p>

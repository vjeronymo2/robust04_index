			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 10  March.    The "Peru Textile Fair" ended very successfully in Tokyo,  Japan. Several Peruvian textile industries displayed cotton and  alpaca clothes, thus increasing the chance of exporting to  Japan. The Peruvian industrialists representing 16 companies  negotiated with Japanese wholesale importers, who were surprised  at the quality of the products. A seminar also was sponsored as  part of the fair in order to report on the characteristics of  the Japanese textile market and to properly train Peruvians for  future negotiations. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 2)    The Chinese Bank has agreed to a $40 million loan to support  social projects being implemented by the government. President  Fujimori noted that the Chinese credit is one of the most  advantageous ever granted to Peru because the interest is much  lower than that of international banks. He said China has  granted to Peru $55 million in credits and $16 million in  financial aid in the past 12 months. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 23  Feb 94 p A6)    Several specialists told EXPRESO that the Peruvian foreign  debt notes suddenly dropped from 72 percent to 65 percent last  week because foreign investors reportedly are starting to  evaluate the impact of the norms on the exchange of debt for  privatization. Most believe that those who bought 70 percent of  the debt notes made a bad investment because Peruvian debt notes  will continue to drop in upcoming days. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish  24 Feb 94 p A24)    The National Institute of Statistics and Information Science  reported that the February inflation rate in metropolitan Lima  was 1.8 percent, raising the cumulative inflation rate for the  year's first two months to 3.7 percent.

(Lima EL  COMERCIO in Spanish 2 March 94 p A1)    On 3 March, the Lima stock exchange hit a record $63.3  million as a result of the successful privatization of the  Peruvian Telephone Company, which sold 74 percent of its shares.  (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p B1)    The Special Privatization Committee reported that the  government has decided to accept $60 million worth of Peruvian  foreign debt notes in the privatization of the Central Peru  Mining Enterprise. The base price for the sale of the company is  $280 million. The name of the owner of 100 percent of the shares  will be disclosed on 11 April.

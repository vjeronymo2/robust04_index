			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tata Tea gets a taste for expansion - India's biggest plantation group is seeking acquisitions When Tata Tea, India's biggest plantation group, made known its target of eventually doubling tea output from its present level of 58m kg, it was clear that it would be on the acquisition trail. It is one of several which has looked at Tetley, the tea business put up for sale by Allied Domecq, the UK spirits group. Analysts believe Allied might be asking about Pounds 375m (Dollars 585m) for Tetley, which generates operating profits of about Pounds 24m on annual turnover of about Pounds 350m. Tata and Tetley already operate one joint venture, an export-oriented tea-bag manufacturing unit in Cochin. Tata Tetley tea bags are selling well in western Asia and Poland, where a production unit is likely to be set up. Tata is the only Indian tea company to move from a production-led to a market-led producer of tea and set up a base in the US to market instant tea. Breaking away from a long tradition of selling tea in bulk, Tata Tea, which owns 52 tea estates, has pioneered in India the marketing of tea with added value, such as tea bags, packet tea and tea in polybags. Tata Tea stands out in establishing several consumer brands, in competition with the long-established players in the Indian market such as Brooke Bond and Lipton. Having consolidated its position in the value-added market, the management has turned to acquiring new estates. Recently it bought Borjan tea estate, spread over 872 hectares in Assam. It believes it can raise productivity at Borjan to more than 2,000 kg a hectare from the present 1,390 kg. The company is hopeful that its negotiations with several tea estate owners will yield positive results. Except for Darjeeling where the best tea in the world is grown, Tata Tea owns gardens in all tea-growing centres in India. The strategy will be to buy gardens and then bring them up to the Tata Tea standards. 'Tata Tea is financially very strong to bid for a number of tea estates simultaneously. It has reserves of nearly Dollars 70m and it has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.61,' said an analyst with a leading merchant bank. Tata Tea, which two years ago took over Consolidated Coffee, is now acquiring a majority stake in Asian Coffee, the instant coffee manufacturer. Tata Tea has a joint venture in Sri Lanka which manages several tea estates in the island. It will bid for some tea estates in Sri Lanka when there is privatisation.</p>

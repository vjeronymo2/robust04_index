			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE LAKERS? IT HAS BEEN ASKED BEFORE  </P> <P> A veteran championship team hits an unfortunate slump in the early rounds of  the playoffs and fails to make the finals for the first time in years. Fans  wail, gnash their teeth and call for the coach's blood, ignoring an otherwise  excellent season.  </P> <P> Sportswriters insist major changes must be made, the team is clearly over the  hill, and the young, victorious team is anointed as the new power in the  conference.  </P> <P> The Lakers of 1990, you say? Well, yes, but also the Lakers of 1986, after  which the same over-the-hill veterans won back-to-back championships and would  have had a third but for ill-timed injuries. Let's not panic, but thank the  Lakers for a fine regular season, and in Dodger tradition, vow to "wait till  next year."  </P> <P> DARREL INGERS, Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: Tales of the subconscious OXFORD BOOK OF MODERN FAIRY TALES edited by Alison Lurie Oxford Pounds 17.95, 474 pages Children know something they can't tell; they like Red Riding Hood and the wolf in bed', Djuna Barnes once remarked, and anyone who has told the story to a child will know what she meant. Fairy tales are among the oldest forms of literature, and their survival, told from generation to generation over centuries, bears witness to their extraordinary psychological power. As recent Freudian critics have shown, they confront our deepest unconscious dilemmas - sibling rivalry in Cinderella, sexual fear/desire in Little Red Riding Hood, terror of abandonment in Hansel and Gretel - in symbolic forms which console and help us through life. The modern fairy tale is another animal altogether. It cannot compete with such primitive, mythic enchantment but, as this enticing new collection shows, it has attractions of its own. Where Cinderella is timeless and universal, the modern tale speaks volumes about its author's personality and the society in which it was written. Where Cinderella is comforting and familiar, the modern tale is complex and disturbing. And where Cinderella is effective told in any language or style, the modern tale has a literary quality which makes it at its best a sophisticated and satisfying work of art. So rich is the fairy tale form that, since the Victorians first used it as a literary model, each generation has mined it for its own purposes. For Ruskin and Dickens, it was the perfect vehicle for social criticism as well as a chance to gush about children - Dickens said that to marry Red Riding Hood would have been perfect bliss. For Oscar Wilde, who wrote stories about giants loving little boys and romances between male swallows and princely statues, the tale was a masked plea for sexual tolerance. Today, fairy tales are fodder for post-modernist inversions and feminist twists like Angela Carter's 'The Courtship of Mr Lyon', an updated Beauty and the Beast, or Jeanne Desy's 'The Princess Who Stood on her Own Two Feet', where a tall and clever princess 'enchants' herself to stop walking and talking in order not to overpower the chauvinist wimp of a prince who is courting her. Alison Lurie's collection has an impressive range, but the book is marred by an introduction so skimpy that it is quite useless in explaining Ms Lurie's choice of works, how the stories relate to each other or to traditional tales, why modern fairy tales matter as literature, or who is intended to read them - surely not children? GK Chesterton said that fairy stories were especially enjoyed by the young because 'children are innocent and love justice, while most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy'. A fascinating element of many modern tales is that they follow fairy tale forms but deny justice at the end, often to peculiarly chilling effect. I would have welcomed background from Lurie on, say, Mrs Clifford's 'The New Mother', a Victorian Hansel and Gretel reeking of repression and menace, where a mother leaves the children who love her to punish them for discovering dark secrets, and sends a witch-like 'new mother' with glass eyes and a wooden tail. And surely Bernard Malamud's sad 1960s 'The Jewbird', about a wise Yiddish crow killed by a frozen-food salesman, echoes Wilde's 'The Happy Prince', with its kindly swallow frozen to death: brilliant commentaries, both, on materialistic society. Explanatory links from Lurie would have made a more elegant, unified volume, but this book is nonetheless a feast of pleasure and surprise.</p>

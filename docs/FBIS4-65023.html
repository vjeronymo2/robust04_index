			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thierry Portes: "Official Launch of the </F> Majority's Campaign: `A Europe of Peace and Employment'"]    [Text] The La Villette Science and Industry Park, the  Eurotunnel, the day after the anniversary of the World War II  victory, this day of Europe. Yesterday, the candidates on  Dominique Baudis' UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR [Rally for  the Republic] list for the European elections often referred to  symbolic events during the official launch of their campaign for  "a Europe of peace and employment."    It was under the model of a satellite, between models of the  Ariane rocket and the IFREMER [French Institute for the  Exploitation of the Sea] submarine Nautilus, that the  representatives of the majority list met in the La Villette  Science Park late in the morning. Dominique Baudis, who never  forgets that he is mayor of Toulouse, did not fail to praise the  success of the Ariane and European aerospace projects. After  the praise, he regretted the fact that there are only four  researchers for every 1,000 workers in Europe, compared with  eight in the United States and nine in Japan.    In his view, therefore, Europe's future depends on an  increase in the effort to promote research and on strengthening  cooperation among European nations. Since individual member  countries would not be able to withstand this budget strain, who  other than the Twelve in a joint effort could help the 40  nuclear power stations of the Chernobyl type which are currently  operating in the former Soviet empire? Similarly, in the race  against the AIDS virus, he pointed out, "we will win more  quickly if the Twelve work together."    Christian Jacob who, in taking fourth place on the majority  list, has taken leave from his role as president of the National  Union of Young Farmers, took the opportunity yesterday to assert  that the agricultural world is also "enthusiastic," and places  its future in the European impetus.    "The world is dangerous and France needs all the strength of  Europe for its security and the security of French people,"  Dominique Baudis said. Although European security depends on  employment, the fight against AIDS and countering nuclear  dangers in the former Soviet bloc, this security must obviously  be based on the limitation or even banning of old conflicts.  <H5>  New Beginning </H5>   After employment, the mayor of Toulouse turned to the second  theme of his campaign: A Europe of peace. The day after the  celebrations to commemorate 8 May 1945, it was easy for him to  reaffirm that developing European unity was begun after World  War II in the hope of preventing further conflicts among the  European nations. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Baudis stated, is there  to remind us that nothing is ever fully achieved and that the  ambition of the early Europeans -- Robert Schuman and Jean  Monnet -- should not to be abandoned. Helene Carrere  d'Encausse, the number two of Dominique Baudis' list, took up  this subject, stressing that in East Europe the victory over the  Nazis was won one day later, on 9 May 1945 when the Soviets  entered Berlin. The academician, who is an expert on Russia and  the "other Europe," wanted to regard this one-day "lag" behind  the West as a symbol too.    This original lag must now be made good and "Europe must be  expanded," she explained, expansion in her view being "the fruit  of the miracle of the collapse of the Berlin Wall." In "this  Europe which needs to be rethought," Mrs. Carrere d'Encausse  said, "France must play a decisive role" to remain faithful to  the French founders of European unity and to the historical ties  which bind our nation to the countries of East Europe. She  cited the example of the Pact for Stability in Europe, which is  so dear to Edouard Balladur, and stressed that France should now  make "a new beginning" on this path of peace. "Our united  list," Mr. Baudis also said, "is not focused on certain past  divisions." Following this reference to the debate between  supporters and opponents of the Maastricht Treaty, he stated  that his "role" and that of his fellow candidates on the list  "is not to be the advocates of the Brussels administration to  the French people, but to be the French representatives in the  Strasbourg Parliament in order to control Brussels more  effectively."    Jean-Louis Debre, the deputy secretary general of the RPR,  once again stated that "the RPR unreservedly supports" the  campaign led by Dominique Baudis. "It is a young team which is  not focused on the past and which transcends the divisions of  the past," he emphasized, addressing the Maastricht opponents  within the RPR ranks. It was left to Yves Galland, president of  the Liberal caucus in Strasbourg, to more specifically name the  majority list's opponent: the Socialists.    In particular he criticized the Socialist European deputies  for systematically defending the Commission's regulatory powers.  In the UDF and RPR, Mr. Galland declared, "we do not want an  administrative Europe which interferes with and wants to have a  say on everything."</p>

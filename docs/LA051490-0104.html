			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW HITS RECORD HIGH;  </P> <P> UP 19.95 IN NEAR RECORD '90 TRADING  </P> <P> Stocks closed at an all-time high today on buying carried over from last week's  rally, although profit-taking late in the day pared the overall gain.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 63.07 on Friday, closed up 19.95  points at 2,821.53 -- well above its previous high closing, 2,810.15 recorded  on Jan. 2.  </P> <P> The Dow, which was up as much as 52 points in earlier trading, also shattered  its intraday high of 2,822.95, set the morning of Jan. 3.  </P> <P> Volume was a strong 225.41 million shares, compared with 234.04 million shares  traded Friday, the year's heaviest trading day. Gains outpaced losses by 2 to 1  on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Traders said investor enthusiasm carried over from Friday's big rally. But a  bout of selling late in the day held down the gain in the Dow index.  </P> <P> Prices were higher in active trading of American Stock Exchange issues.  </P> <P> Despite an afternoon pullback that analysts attributed to profit taking after  Friday's surge, the market staged a broad-based rally for the second straight  session, thanks to a huge amount of carryover institutional buying from Friday  and a lot of computerized program buying.  </P> <P> "It's just a little slowdown. We're absorbing some of the runup," said James  Andrews, first vice president of institutional trading at Janney, Montgomery  Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Andrews said the rally has been driven by institutions, which have held large  cash positions, putting their money to work again. "And if we get an indication  that rates are coming down, we could see real big swings on the upside," he  said.  </P> <P> The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in economic  statistics of late, which has reduced worries over inflation and the  interest-rate outlook.  </P> <P> In afternoon trading, Treasury notes and bonds were as much as 3/8 point higher  after bonds surged more than 2 points Friday after the government report of a  decline in April producer prices, which made investors feel more confident that  interest rates have peaked and that inflation is under control.  </P> <P> "You couldn't have put together a better combination of news for the market,"  said Hugh Johnson, chief economist at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.  </P> <P> The U.S. Treasury bond market gained a bit more ground today following Friday's  big rally, with prices of government issues unchanged to slightly higher in  quiet early trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue was up nearly 1/8 point, or $1.25  per $1,000 face amount, by midday. As a result, its yield, which moves  inversely to the price, inched lower to 8.65% from 8.66% Friday.  </P> <P> On Friday, the 30-year bond soared about $17.50, while shorter-term issues also  posted heathy price gains, reflecting a change in market psychology.  </P> <P> Market watchers say recent government reports have convinced many traders the  economy is growing only moderately and inflationary pressures are subsiding.  For instance, the government reported Friday that retail sales declined steeply  in April and inflation on the wholesale level had eased that month.  </P> <P> Also boosting to the market was the success of the government's three-day  quarterly refunding last week.  </P></p>

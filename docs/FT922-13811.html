			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / People: Barclays' Italian job changes hands There is change at the top in Barclays Bank's operations in Italy - a country that in the past has proved fraught with difficulties for the UK clearer. Richard Adams, general manager in Italy for the past six years, has been battling with the legacy of years of over-expansion combined with losses and fraud in leasing. Adams, one of whose tasks on arrival was to beat a retreat from retail banking in general, returns to London 'after a very satisfying time making the operation more focused - and profitable'. He becomes head of financial institutions within the corporate banking division. Italy returned a small profit in 1991, compared with losses estimated in the region of Pounds 30m a year when Adams took over. His replacement is Hugh Malim (pictured), who was actually in Italy during the 1980s troubles, but was responsible for other areas, the bank says - setting up factoring and consumer finance as well as opening the Rome office. Malim, an ex-Navy man and keen pilot, has headed export finance at Barclays in London since 1988, and comes back to Italy with big plans to build the investment banking capability. Returning to the country will suit his wife, who has a fashion design business based in Milan - and will put him closer to the Cresta run, his other love. Of his own new job, Adams says that while it would once have meant donning an ambassadorial hat to make endless visits around the correspondent banking network, the trick these days is to tailor Barclays' services to the individual and very different strengths of financial institutions around the world. He replaces Michael Tomalin whose new appointment within the group has yet to be announced.</p>

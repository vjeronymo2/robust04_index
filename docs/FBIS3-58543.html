			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "eli": "Opposition and FDP Opposed To </F> Schaeuble Proposal"]    [Text] Bonn -- There is little inclination in the  opposition and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as a government  party to follow Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] floor leader Wolfgang Schaeuble's move for an  expansion of the Bundeswehr mission. In a Bundestag debate,  requested by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], only  CDU/CSU speakers were ready to advocate, like Schaeuble, the  idea of using the Armed Forces for missions at home. As far as  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was concerned,  ostentatiously no leading party or group members took the floor  in the debate. FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said he did  not see a need for decision on the matter. Schaeuble himself did  not take part in the debate, because he had to attend a CDU  Presidium meeting.    On behalf of the CDU, Minister in the Chancellor's Office  Friedrich Bohl cautiously supported Schaeuble. He said that  under certain and precisely defined conditions, an internal  mission of the Armed Forces could make sense. Bohl criticized  the "emotional discussion" and stressed that one certainly could  discuss the "idea of rejecting the proposal," but he did not  understand why "people should come with a big hammer." Under  the impression of epochal changes, the option of a Bundeswehr  mission inside the country's borders must be examined.    Rupert Scholz, a constitutional expert and former defense  minister (CDU), and Johannes Gerster, deputy CDU/CSU floor  leader, expressed the most favorable opinions on Schaeuble's  proposal. Scholz said that the term of external security had  changed; it now also included migration movements, terrorism,  and ecological situations. Security policy and the Bundeswehr  mandate had to be reoriented to this new definition. Gerster  said the Bundeswehr should defend the borders.    FDP Secretary-General Hoyer said he was not happy with the  discussion. He stressed that "at least since the emergency laws  became effective, clarity has been created on the issue of  Bundeswehr missions at home," and stated categorically: "There  is no need for decision." Hoyer said it was true that  absolutely new circumstances could require new decisions, but he  did not see that this also required a constitutional amendment.  The Bundeswehr could already help in disasters. Hoyer warned  that the debate, touched off by Schaeuble, would be  counterproductive because it burdened the discussion on an  amendment to the Basic Law for out-of-area missions. In  addition, there was the danger that the Bundeswehr's anchoring  in society and the citizens' trust in the armed forces could  suffer harm. Both were based on the fact that the Bundeswehr  averted dangers from outside and did not appear as a power  protecting law and order at home. FDP deputy Juergen Koppelin  said that for the liberals, Schaeuble's proposal amounted to an  "erosion of the constitution."    SPD politician Erwin Horn said that "those who want such  missions want a different republic." Horn called Schaeuble's  proposals absurd, and insinuated that for tactical  considerations, Schaeuble wanted to sacrifice the consensus  among the political parties. He added that even Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe had rejected the proposals. One could not  call upon the citizens to respect the constitution, and at the  same time deal with the Basic Law as if it were a tear-off  calendar.</p>

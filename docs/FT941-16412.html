			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / British Steel chief says EU pact in danger British Steel warned yesterday that a key part of the European Commission's plan to restructure the European Union's steel industry could collapse if a controversial rescue of Klockner-Werke's Bremen mill goes ahead. In an outspoken interview following last month's Brussels agreement on state subsidies, Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, urged the Commission to speak out against the Bremen rescue and to encourage mergers in the industry. Mr Moffat's comments underline the unease among big non-aided steel producers following last month's agreement - which resolved disputes over subsidies in Germany, Italy and Spain - and indicate that the subsidy issue has not been laid to rest. British Steel and its big French and German counterparts regard the future of the Bremen mill as a test case for the industry. In November, Klockner-Werke said it was selling 75 per cent of the mill for a symbolic DM1 each to four local companies in a consortium led by the city state of Bremen. Opponents say the deal amounts to state aid. Mr Moffat said the Commission should say in advance of being asked formally to approve it that the deal is not acceptable. This could clear the way for a rival plan under which companies in Eurofer, the Brussels-based association of big European producers, would pay DM1bn (Pounds 300m) for the Bremen cold mill and shut down its hot-rolled mill, which has capacity of 3m tonnes a year. Non-aided steel producers have been given until the end of February to come up with 25m tonnes of capacity cuts to match the 5m of cuts to be made by subsidised producers under last month's agreements. But Mr Moffat said producers would not come forward with cuts if others continued to be 'spoon-fed'. 'If the Bremen issue is resolved unsatisfactorily, that would put paid to the flat products initiative,' he said. Cuts of 6m tonnes are being sought in hot-rolled coil and 2.5m tonnes in steel plate. Mr Moffat said in the autumn that British Steel may not take part in the EU-backed self-help scheme - under which producers remaining in a sector will pay rivals which leave or reduce their presence. Yesterday he said British Steel still reserved the right not to pay the levies involved in the scheme. 'If we think that subsidies are going to be continued, the answer is no - and we would not be alone.'</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Japan investing less abroad JAPANESE foreign direct investment fell by about 16 per cent in the first half of this financial year compared with last year, according to government figures published yesterday. However, Japan's current account surplus continued to grow strongly in October, rising to Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn), about 60 per cent up from the same month last year, while the trade surplus rose by about 28 per cent to Dollars 13bn. Exports were 9 per cent up at Dollars 30.1bn, with imports at Dollars 17bn, 2.6 per cent lower than the same month last year. The growth of the surplus is likely to add to pressure on the government to revive the economy to raise import growth. Japanese companies made 1,913 foreign direct investments in the six months to the end of September worth about Dollars 17.3bn. This was 39 per cent lower than in 1990. The figures suggest Japanese companies are pulling back from the aggressive international strategies they pursued in the late 1980s, as a result of the slowdown in the Japanese economy, which has sharply cut profits and raised the cost of capital for investment. The number of investments made in the US fell by about 22 per cent from last year's half-yearly rate to 629, worth about Dollars 8bn, about 11 per cent down. Japanese direct investment in the US is running at 38 per cent below the 1990 level. However, the US accounted for about 46 per cent of all Japanese foreign investment in the first half, compared with about 43 per cent last year. Japanese investment in the UK is holding up well compared with that in the rest of Europe. There were 103 Japanese investments in the UK, worth about Dollars 1.8bn, a marginal increase on last year. In contrast, Japanese investment in Germany fell sharply. There were just 26 investments in the six months to the end of September, worth about Dollars 297m, compared with 119 investments worth Dollars 1.1bn all last year. The Japanese are retreating from investment in eastern Europe. There were no Japanese investments in the Commonwealth of Independent States in the first half of this year and just one in Hungary, worth about Dollars 2m. Asian states were the main gainers, reflecting the strategic shift in Japanese investment towards the faster growing Asian economies such as Malaysia and Singapore. There were 622 investments in Asia during the first half.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> D.C. MAYOR TO ASK AIRING OF DRUG DENIAL  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry of Washington plans to ask for release of his grand jury  testimony, in which he denied using drugs with a convicted narcotics dealer.  News reports have said that former city employee Charles Lewis has allegedly  told prosecutors that he and Barry repeatedly used crack cocaine together. "I'm  prepared to ask the prosecutor to release my testimony before the grand jury  and Mr. Lewis' testimony, so therefore the public can see what was said," Barry  said at a City Hall news conference. "A small group of character assassins have  taken it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands . . . to do in  the press what they can't do in court." Testimony before a federal grand jury  generally is kept under seal until it is brought up in open court. "We have  nothing to hide regarding the testimony of the mayor or Mr. Lewis," said  Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy.  </P></p>

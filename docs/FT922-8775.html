			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Soldiers to join UN mission in Cambodia GERMANY yesterday despatched its first soldiers on an official basis to join a United Nations peace-keeping expedition - 140 military medical staff to operate a hospital in Cambodia. The volunteers were seen off at Munich airport by Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, who promised that the German constitution would be amended by the end of the year to allow the full participation of German soldiers in UN peacekeeping missions. The staff will form part of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) which will demobilise four rival armies and prepare for national elections in April 1993. Mr Ruhe insisted that the use of medical personnel fell within the current law, although it is clear that the German government has been deliberately stepping up the use of 'para-military' personnel outside the country to prepare the population for a change in the constitution. Mr Ruhe renewed the government's pledge to amend Bonn's post-second world war constitution at least enough to allow German troops full participation as UN 'blue helmets', peace-mission soldiers with sidearms only. The medical troops are a convenient solution for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, caught between its desire to play a greater world role after German unity and a constitutional ban on deploying fighting troops outside NATO territory. Munich's second international airport was officially opened at a ceremony yesterday after years of controversy and rising costs. Planners said it would handle between 18m and 20m travellers a year by the end of the decade. It does not officially go into service until Sunday, but according to official estimates, between 12m and 14m people will pass through it this year.</p>

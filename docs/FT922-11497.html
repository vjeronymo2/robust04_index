			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Japan moves to allay fears on health of banking system THE JAPANESE ministry of finance made an unprecedented attempt to quash doubts about the health of the country's banks yesterday by issuing a detailed report on their financial performance. The ministry released estimates of the banks' financial results for the year to March 31, saying Japanese banks were 'very sound'. They would have no difficulty in coping with the fall in the Tokyo stock market or with a sharp rise in bad loans, the ministry said. 'Our banking system is very sound. Excessive concern is unnecessary,' a senior official added. The ministry's action followed the recent plunge in bank share prices and reports of growing overseas concern about the condition of some Japanese financial institutions. Although the statement was issued after the stock market closed, speculation about its contents had helped to boost the Nikkei average of leading shares which rose 562.93 to 17,402.05. Foreign bankers said any improvement in sentiment could be short-lived because the figures in the ministry's statement were largely in line with expectations. They said that, in giving data for profits and bad debt provisions for last year, the ministry had not allayed fears about write-offs in 1992-93, which could be much larger. The finance ministry said operating profit for all 153 Japanese banks rose 26.8 per cent to Y3,659bn (Dollars 27.5bn), boosted by declining interest rates. Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Y2,799bn, because of aggressive write-offs for loans and investment loans, including those related to the property market. Net after-tax profits fell 24 per cent to Y1,379bn. Banks' valuation losses on share portfolios surged 500 per cent to Y1,734bn and the write-off for bad loans rose to Y639.3bn. Analysts said write-offs for 1991-92 gave little indication of the larger write-offs which were likely in the current year. Acknowledging this concern, a senior ministry official said the large national banks - including 11 city (commercial) banks, three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks - had Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn in bad loans at the end of the fiscal year. This meant loans on which no interest had been paid for six months. However, all but Y2,000bn-Y3,000bn was covered by collateral, the ministry said. Banks could easily cope with bad loans because, even after recent stock market falls, they had unrealised portfolio gains of Y17,000bn. The figure for bad loans is considerably lower than analysts' estimates of Y20,000bn-plus, but much depends on the precise method by which bad loans are calculated. The ministry said all except 'one or two' leading banks cleared the 8 per cent capital-adequacy ratio which has been set by the Bank for International Settlements. The ministry gave figures for different categories of bank but not for individual banks, which will publish their own results next month. World stocks, Back Page, Sect 2</p>

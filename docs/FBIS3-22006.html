The operation culminated with a  spectacular raid in the heart of the Flores neighborhood  yesterday evening.    The site of these events was Calle Andres Lamas between  Gaona  and Franklin, where a large drug transaction was about to take  place.    Forewarned, discreet police surveillance was set up in the  area, awaiting the right moment to go into action.  Superintendent Jorge Palacios, director of Federal Operations,  was in charge.  <H5>  The Roundup </H5>   According to the police report, [passage omitted] two Ford  Fuegos, one red and the other gray, were parked near Franklin.  [passage omitted]    After the traffickers, from whom no weapons were taken, had  been overpowered, [passage omitted] a long and painstaking  search was made of the interior of the two Ford Fuegos in which  the criminals had arrived at the scene. In the red car brown  nylon bags were found, each containing one kilo of cocaine.  Twenty kilos were found, all in bags like the ones just  described. [passage omitted]  <H5>  A Revealing Detail </H5>   It was learned there that one of the two occupants of the  red  car in which the drugs were found is a Bolivian citizen, who had  earlier been sentenced in Argentina to 12 and 1/2 years in  prison. For reasons still unknown, he was released after serving  only one and a half years of his court-imposed sentence.  [passage omitted]</p>

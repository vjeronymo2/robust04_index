			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trinity jumps 27% to Pounds 16.9m TRINITY International Holdings, the publisher of Merseyside's Daily Post and Liverpool Echo, reported a 27 per cent increase, from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 16.9m, in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 26 on turnover reduced from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 115.4m. The outcome reflected the sale of the papermaking and packaging division 13 months ago at a profit of Pounds 1.66m. There was also a Pounds 2.04m contribution to profit from Scottish and Universal Newspapers, acquired in July. UK operations made profits of Pounds 14m (Pounds 7.92m), a rise of 76 per cent. This offset a 38 per cent decline to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 3.3m) in North American. Earnings per share were 17.1p (15.6p). The proposed final dividend is 6p, making a total for the year of 8.7p (8.4p) per ordinary (limited voting) stock unit. Dividend cover is 2 and gearing 14.5 per cent. Mr Phil Graf, who succeeded Mr David Snedden as chief executive last month, said yesterday: 'We think the dividend cover is sufficient to protect the long term fabric of the business. 'We continue to be interested in acquiring other UK publishing operations, but we also have some work to do on our existing businesses this year,' he added. Display advertising was up on Merseyside, despite recession, together with several classified advertising categories. A continuing attack on the cost base had also proved important, Mr Graf said. North American operations were hit by recession because of the dependence of Alberta and British Columbia - where Trinity publishes local newspapers against fierce competition - on natural resources. In Pittsburgh, where community newspapers have benefited from a prolonged strike at a leading competitor, results have been improving recently. Management changes, new union agreements, and closure last month of two loss-making businesses - resulting in a Pounds 1.53m provision - are expected to make an impact this year. Mr Graf said a Pounds 16m investment programme would be completed in the Liverpool press hall this year, reducing four printing lines to three and enabling full-colour printing of the Daily Post from next autumn.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITO DOESN'T LEAVE FOES JUMPING FOR JOY;  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING: HER ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRIPLE AXELS PUTS EXUBERANT JAPANESE  AMONG FEMALE ELITE.  </P> <P> Her dynamic performance in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, combined with  the elimination of compulsory figures after 1990, made it inevitable that  Japan's Midori Ito some day would rule women's figure skating.  </P> <P> Even U.S. champion Jill Trenary knew the best she could hope for before last  year's World Championships in Paris was that Ito's rise would be gradual  instead of immediate.  </P> <P> As the fourth-place finisher in Calgary behind three retiring medalists,  Katarina Witt, Elizabeth Manley and Debi Thomas, Trenary was expected to  inherit the title in Paris. Her expertise in figures, in contrast with Ito's  haphazard etchings, was supposed to be her edge.  </P> <P> But Ito, who was performing triple jumps as a 6-year-old in Japan, does nothing  gradually. Trenary knew her cause was lost as soon as she saw her 4-foot-9,  97-pound rival on the ice. Trenary acknowledged this week that she was  intimidated by Ito, which she said accounted, at least in part, for her flawed  freestyle performances and a third-place finish.  </P> <P> "I was in awe," said Trenary, who shared practice time with Ito. "I didn't  expect her to be as good as she was."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Trenary, she was not assigned to Ito's practice group for this  year's World Championships, which begin today for the women with compulsory  figures. But she said it would not have made much difference if she had been.  She came here expecting the worst, which means Ito's best.  </P> <P> "I've accepted it," Trenary said. "She's very talented."  </P> <P> Trenary's coach, Carlo Fassi, said her only hope to beat Ito if both skate  their best would be for the judges to reverse the trend of recent years in  scoring and reward aesthetics instead of athleticism.  </P> <P> This will not be good news for Trenary, but Ito, 20, claimed at a news  conference Monday night that she has improved artistically. Until now, her  reputation has been based solely on her jumping ability, which she said came  naturally.  </P> <P> "As a child, I felt I could master some of the jumps quicker than the other  children," she said through an interpreter. "Jumps that would take them three  hours to learn took me an hour and a half."  </P> <P> As an 11-year-old in the World Junior Championships, she completed three triple  jumps. Last year, she became the first woman to perform the most difficult  triple jump, the axel, in competition.  </P> <P> "Last year, the challenge was the triple axel," she said. "Since I can do that  now, this year I am trying to do more for artistic impression."  </P> <P> To that end, she has been taking ballet lessons. Although her coach, Machiko  Yamada, choreographed the freestyle program in the past, that duty fell this  year to Ito's ballet teacher.  </P> <P> But asked what it is about her skating that so excites crowds, she smiled and  said, "Jumps."  </P> <P> While other women -- the United States' Elaine Zayak, for example -- have built  their programs around jumps, it is only since Ito emerged that it seems to have  become required in order to impress international judges. Skaters who have  followed Ito's lead include Californian Kristi Yamaguchi, second in the  national championships to Trenary the last two years, and France's Surya  Bonaly.  </P> <P> Bonaly, 16, is a former gymnast who already is practicing quadruple jumps,  which have been performed in a major competition by only one man, world  champion Kurt Browning of Canada.  </P> <P> Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys, runner-up in last year's world championships,  compares Ito to Browning.  </P> <P> "Ito is fearless, and Kurt Browning has a lot of that quality," he said. "If  they thought they could climb up on top of the rafters and jump off with their  skates on, do six revolutions and have a chance of surviving, they would do  it."  </P> <P> Critics of the trend, which they say was encouraged by the impending  elimination of compulsory figures, fear it will increase the potential for  injuries, particularly in young girls.  </P> <P> Ito suffered an injured left ankle on a triple jump last May and has to have it  heavily taped before going onto the ice. She said her own experimentation with  quadruple jumps will be postponed until her ankle improves.  </P> <P> For now, she is content to have seven triple jumps in her freestyle program.  Her only problem in practice has been that the ice at the Halifax Metro Centre  is barely large enough to contain her. On triple axels, she comes perilously  close to crashing into the boards. Officials of the International Skating Union  said the ice meets their minimum requirements but added that the increased  emphasis on jumping might force them to revise their standards.  </P> <P> Born in Nagoya, a city of 2 million, Ito was accomplished enough by age 4 to  skate to the center of the ice rink and ask Yamada to coach her. Two years  later, after her parents separated, she moved in with Yamada's family and has  lived there since.  </P> <P> "At that time, she accepted me as one of her children," Ito said. "So I didn't  feel that I was a hardship for her."  </P> <P> Beyond that, Ito divulges few details of her personal life. Her parents still  live in Nagoya, but she said she keeps in touch with them primarily by  telephone. She said her father is a businessman. Asked what kind, she said, "A  regular businessman."  </P> <P> She recently graduated in home economics from a two-year school, Tokai Gakuen  Girls College, and soon will begin work for a large Japanese company, Prince  Hotels, although she said she has not yet been informed of her job's  requirements.  </P> <P> One of Japan's most popular athletes -- "I am not even able to go to the  doughnut shop with my friends without being recognized" -- she recently  received the ultimate honor in her country, an invitation to visit Emperor  Akihito in his palace.  </P> <P> She does not seem to have been affected by her fame. As exuberant as ever on  the ice, Ito once was described as "a smile attached to wings." After  particularly difficult jumps, she pumps a fist in the air. That is not typical  of Japanese athletes, who usually are stoic while competing, but her coach quit  trying years ago to change her.  </P> <P> When it comes to discipline, however, she is very Japanese. After finishing  sixth last year in figures, which account for 20% of the final score, she had  to win both freestyle programs to become the champion. In an attempt to  improve, she said she has spent two-thirds of her practice time this year on  the tedious tracings. That does not mean she has acquired a love for them, but  she puts her head down and carries on.  </P> <P> "Compulsories," she said, "are compulsory."  </P></p>

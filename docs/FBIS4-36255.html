			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Syria at the 11th Hour"] </F>   [Text] Because the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] operation  against Hizballah was so daring and successful, Israel must show  that it is really interested in a dialogue with Syria. The  government assumes that terrorism can be fought without  silencing the political process, and following the Air Force  attack, the time has come to test this concept. The problem is  that even prior to Mustafa al-Dirani's capture and the attack on  the terrorists in Lebanon's al-Biqa', there were blanks on the  political radar Jerusalem directed at Damascus.    It is true that Yitzhaq Rabin did not promise Husni Mubarak  that his government would be prepared to withdraw from the  entire Golan Heights, but he led the Egyptian president to  believe Israel is ready for such a move. That is a wise and  dangerous move. It reflects a complex situation for a statesman  feeling around for an Archimedes level in diplomacy to signal to  his enemy his willingness to pay a high price for peace, but not  any price.    Rabin can permit such brinkmanship after accumulating with  Shim'on Peres a lot of credit in the negotiations with the  Palestinians. Just as Likud leaders know they cannot bring the  right-wing masses out to demonstrate against an evacuation of  Gaza and Jericho, they also know that had the prime minister  proposed a peace accord based on a total withdrawal from the  Golan Heights the minority coalition in the Knesset would have  received majority support among the people.    Warren Christopher's entourage told Hafiz al-Asad precisely  that. When he complained about Rabin linking any withdrawal to a  national referendum, he was told that in their view, the prime  minister has the power to align a majority for his position.  Al-Asad silently agreed with that. It seems that the only one  who cannot gauge the level of credit at his disposal is Rabin  himself. He sees the situation as made up of both light and  shade. He is first interested in giving al-Asad the feeling  that there are no free meals, and therefore Israel will express  no regrets if Christopher does not make haste to take off in the  first flight to the Middle East. On that there is full  coordination between Jerusalem and Washington.    That understanding is part of the overall perspective that  Bill Clinton's administration will not impose a solution on  Israel, which al-Asad must be convinced of in order to  understand that the negotiations must be conducted with Rabin  and Peres.    Under those conditions, Jerusalem responds incorrectly by  emphasizing that Syria lacks a military option against the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces]. The government believes that Damascus  has the clout to harass and support terrorism, but not to score  a strategic victory. Modern history is full of such misguided  declarations, like those made by Golda Me'ir and Moshe Dayan at  the time. Rabin and Peres were a part of that team and should  remember, given their positions in the top leadership. So why  repeat the mistake?    Just like in those bad years, Jerusalem is developing a  lexicon of dangerous terms to hold up the process. At the time,  the Israelis aspersed to Henry Kissinger and Joseph Sisco that  Yasir 'Arafat will never recognize Israel's right to exist,  therefore there is nobody to talk to on the Palestinian side.  This was until we heard 'Arafat's famous "caduc," embarrassing  Jerusalem. Warren Christopher and Dennis Ross are now being  told that al-Asad is not Anwar al-Sadat.    The disparity is as long as the negotiations themselves: The  Egyptian got things going by stepping off in Jerusalem, and the  Syrian stays clear of it. Al-Sadat agreed to the withdrawal  starting without the uprooting of settlements in Sinai, al-Asad  refuses to hear of such a possibility. What can be done,  Jerusalem asks with glee, if Damascus refuses to adopt the Camp  David model?    But that is a mistake. One day al-Asad will get up and fully  adopt the Camp David technique after adapting it geographically  to the northern border, and Rabin's arguments and Peres'  diplomatic arrows will become empty cliches in one blow.    The prime minister is mistaken in waiting for processes to  develop in Israel and the Arab world. He and Peres have the  backing and power to advance the negotiations. Since in my  view, they have already accepted in their hearts the concept  that any peace with Syria depends on a full withdrawal from the  Golan Heights, they will gain almost nothing by sticking to the  approach that it has no chance of being approved. No delaying  tactics will lead Damascus to give up part of its territory.    The horse trading has to be conducted by sticking in  principle to the Camp David accords and adapting it to Israel's  special defense needs in the north. There is also another  important parallel: Rabin rightly claimed recently that the  accord with the PLO was completed five minutes before midnight,  not five minutes after. He just has to continue the parallel:  Why does the agreement with Syria also have to be made under  tough conditions? If the initiative and political credit exist,  then it can be agreed upon at the 11th hour. It is a blatant  case of the saying: the sooner the better.</p>

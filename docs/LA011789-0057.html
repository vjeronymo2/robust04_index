			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The body of a U.S. pilot killed in the April, 1986, bombing of Libya was  returned to American soil in a solemn ceremony attended by relatives. The body  of Air Force Maj. Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci of Utuado, Puerto Rico, was flown  from Torrejon Air Base in Spain to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. An honor  guard carried the flag-draped military coffin off the gray and white C-141  airplane. The body will receive final preparations at the base mortuary before  being turned over to the family for burial. Greeting the airplane were several  members of Ribas-Dominicci's family, including his wife and son. Libya said it  released the remains as a "humanitarian initiative." But Salvador  Ribas-Dominicci said he is "angry" with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi for  the delay in the release of his brother's body.  </P></p>

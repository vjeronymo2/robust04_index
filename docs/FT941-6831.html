			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Observer: Hoarety Most high street bank customers can warm to the subject of slipping standards of service, but it seems that the deep pile carpet at even the most recherche private bank is also wearing distinctly thin. C. Hoare &amp; Co's worthy 322-year-old tradition certainly proved cold comfort to one customer of 35 years' standing who decided to vote with his feet after being informed, by letter, that the rate on his overdraft would be soaring to 7 per cent over base. His account had dipped Pounds 20,000 into the red, a not uncommon occurrence, and hardly a vast sum considering that the bank held title deeds to his house as well as sundry life policies with a combined worth well over Pounds 1m. He admits he had moved his securities portfolio, over which the bank used to have a charge, to his stockbroker for ease of administration, but that had been nearly 12 months previously. To add insult to injury, that discreet personal service for which he had long paid so dearly ran to a distant 'Dear Sir' atop the offending missive.</p>

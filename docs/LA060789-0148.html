BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITAIN SELLS AIRCRAFT, MISSILE FIRM  </P> <P> The government said today it would sell Short Brothers Ltd., the ailing Belfast  aircraft and missile maker, to the Canadian aerospace company Bombardier Inc.  for 30 million pounds, about $47 million.  </P> <P> The announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy the state-owned  company, which is Northern Ireland's largest employer, after the government  said it planned to privatize it.  </P> <P> The Northern Ireland Office said the government will inject 372 million pounds  ($584 million) into Short Brothers and write off a 390 million-pound ($612  million) loan it made to Short earlier this year to help the company pay its  debts.  </P> <P> "Bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by Shorts in the  Northern Ireland economy and intends to acquire the company as a long-term  investment and to maintain it as a complete entity," Northern Ireland Secretary  Tom King told the House of Commons. But he added that he could not guarantee  that all workers would keep their jobs.  </P> <P> Short Brothers' once made biplanes under license for U.S. aviation pioneers  Orville and Wilbur Wright.  </P></p>

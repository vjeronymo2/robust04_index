			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, Apr 05, BNS -- Estonia is ready to initial  the draft agreement with Russia on troop withdrawal, said Raul  Malk, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry.    He said Estonia's position is that the document is "ripe  enough" for signature.    Malk said Estonia now also had more grounds to expect that  Russian troops will be pulled out from the country by Aug. 31,  1994. "It seems to me that after the past round of talks at  Lohusalu the Russian side is more definitely expressing the  final deadline for the withdrawal as Aug. 31," the Estonian  diplomat said.    Russia, however, insists that the troop withdrawal agreement  must be initialed together with an agreement on social  guarantees for its retired officers living in Estonia, similar  with the document initialed between Russia and Latvia.    The head of the Russian delegation, Vasiliy Svirin, in an  interview with BNS ahead of the talks said that if no agreement  on the retired military is signed, the deadline of Aug. 31 will  lose its actuality and the withdrawal will continue under a  timetable to be determined unilaterally by Russia.    Malk in his far more optimistic remarks said that Moscow  authorities recently had taken a more clearly defined stance in  their assessment of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union of  the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact era.    Attempts are in evidence, however, he said, not to  acknowledge the legal aspects of how Estonia became a part of  the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Russia wishes to become a full  member of the Council of Europe, she ought to read the rulings  of this European body on the topic of Estonia's annexation into  the Soviet Union. He said these rulings contained clear  formulations which Estonia's position on the issue was based  upon.    Speaking about the border dispute, Malk said work on the  issue was currently in a stage of a very difficult exchanging of  opinions. He added that he saw the solution for the problem as  also an "optimistic" one.</p>

			<p>txt}[Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said  that the Greek foreign policy positions are known, oft repeated,  and clear in every direction. Venizelos was referring to press  reports which, he said, imply that Greek policy on Skopje and  the dialogue is changing. The name is not up for negotiation,  the government spokesman said. He noted that Skopje must  believe that it is to its benefit to change the name. The name  is not subject to negotiation, but becomes an issue of dialogue  so that the Greek side can expand on its position.  <F P=103> NC1801133994 </F> <F P=104>  Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network </F>  Language: <F P=105>Greek and clear </F> Article Type:BFN     Answering questions, Venizelos said the government considers  acceptance of such a proposal possible and noted that he is  under the impression that the Greek side's statements are not  falling on deaf ears. The government spokesman pointed out that  there has been no move from the government's positions and  repeated that no country will be recognized with the name  Macedonia or its derivatives. He added that the government  expects tangible and practical signs from Skopje that would  diminish its intransigence and provocation.    Replying to other questions, he said Greece agreed to  Skopje's application to join the United Nations as the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which came up during the New  Democracy's term in power. Asked about the level of dialogue  with Skopje, Venizelos said it is too early to say anything and  added that the process is still pending at the United Nations.  It is within that framework that Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias sent a letter. The government spokesman noted that  the previous government was characterized by double talk, while  this government tells everyone the same things.</p>

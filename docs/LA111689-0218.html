			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONDOS FOR HORSES -- AND THAT AIN'T HAY;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: A CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT PLANNED BY DREW PEARSON'S STEPSON HAS  SET ASIDE ACREAGE FOR A FEW FOUR-LEGGED RESIDENTS.  </P> <P> Condominiums for horses! At prices ranging from $400,000 to $900,000 per lot  for accompanying humans, only we poor peasants could say nay to the idea.  </P> <P> As we rein in the puns, let it be said that it's all true. Merry-Go-Round Farm,  off River Road in Potomac, Md. -- bought with the proceeds of Drew Pearson's  investigative (he called it "muckraking") newspaper column, for which it was  named -- has been a great jumping-off place for Democratic parties for almost  60 years. Now lawyer Tyler Abell (Pearson's stepson and President Lyndon B.  Johnson's protocol chief) is creating 79 building plots, 50 horse stalls (first  come, first stabled), a pasture and innumerable squirrel leaps. It is much like  taking a great mansion and turning it into condominiums, with the ballroom and  garden to be shared by all.  </P> <P> The refuge, 18 miles from the White House by Abell's odometer, is spectacularly  situated on a rural promontory overlooking the Potomac River. For 50 years or  so, it has served as the weekend destination for Pearson's widow, Luvie  Pearson; her son, Tyler Abell; Tyler's wife Bess Abell, Lady Bird Johnson's  social secretary and Joan Mondale's chief of staff; their two sons, Lyndon and  Dan Tyler Abell; six dogs and 20 horses; a 12-week-old baby.  </P> <P> Those who made brief for brief starring appearances include former President  Lyndon Johnson, former Chief Justice Earl Warren, former vice presidents and  presidential candidates Henry Wallace and Walter Mondale, and movie star Rita  Hayworth. Not to mention the Democratic Government in Exile.  </P> <P> Drew Pearson came to Washington to work for the Baltimore Sun in the 1920s. In  1930 he and Robert S. Allen anonymously wrote a book, "Washington  Merry-Go-Round." With their second, "More Merry-Go-Round," the Sun fired  Anderson, and the two started the famous column (now Jack Anderson's) in 1932.  It first appeared here in Cissy Patterson's Washington Times-Herald. Pearson  took Patterson's daughter, Felicia Gizycka, as his bride, and they had a child,  Ellen. That marriage lasted only three years. Pearson then met and got married  to Luvie Moore, a movie critic). Pearson continued to get along with Cissy --  for a while. They didn't break up until 1942, when he began supporting Franklin  D. Roosevelt and the effort to have the United States join the Allies against  Hitler.  </P> <P> Anyway, this is all by way of explaining that while the newspaper publisher and  the columnist were friends, he found the Potomac farm for her. She bought it  for $50,000 in 1930. When she later bought Dower House in Prince George's  County, Md., she gave the Montgomery County land to her granddaughter, Ellen,  with Pearson as trustee. He eventually bought it from his daughter when she  moved to California, and in 1939 he built the hillside farmhouse there now.  </P> <P> "That was when he tried to run it as a dairy farm and Victory Garden to help  the war effort," Abell said.  </P> <P> Pearson used to sell muck -- the bottom of the old canal bed -- from the farm.  A big sign on River Road offered "Drew Pearson's Manure, All Cow, No Bull,  Better Than the Column."  </P> <P> "My stepfather -- before he died in 1969 -- and I realized we wouldn't be able  to hold onto the 204 acres forever. We'd have to develop it," Abell says now.  "But it's taken a long time to work out. I went all over the country looking at  other such developments. It took forever to get the plans through the  Montgomery County requirements."  </P> <P> Abell says he thinks the plan he has worked out with Colden Florance of Keyes  Condon Florance Architects and landscape design consultant Edward Alexander is  "perhaps the only kind in the country." The people get a bit more than a half  acre each. The horses will have 150, minus that devoted to Tyler's Puddle,  Luvie's Lake, Drew's Lake and the human residents' two to four tennis courts.  </P> <P> The houses will not be allowed to interfere with the horse trails or with the  remarkable views. Each contract will be accompanied by the Merry-Go-Round Farm  Architectural and Landscape Design Guidelines by Florance with architect Brian  Harner. The guidelines are a short course (well, at 76 pages, maybe not so  short) in architectural styles and philosophy, obviously bent on protecting the  acreage from the kinds of filthy-rich nighttime-soap-set excesses so visible in  the houses on nearby River Road.  </P> <P> The preamble notes: "The intention is to avoid two extremes to which ordinary  residential developments frequently succumb: either a monotonous repetition of  house types that suppress individuality and imagination, or an uncoordinated  cacophony of misunderstood historic styles with awkward massing and siting."  </P> <P> Before people can start to wonder what they can put up, the preamble adds:  "While certain styles may be preferred, any style may be introduced subject to  the approval of the Architectural Committee." Then it goes on to list pages of  designs for windows and details. There is even a three-page list of sanctioned  plants.  </P> <P> Merry-Go-Round might be said to serve quasi millionaires -- those with enough  money to acquire a taste of country estate, but not enough to afford to pay for  all of it by themselves. The prices of people sites will range from $400,000  for each of five or six lots in the woods to $900,000 for the three with the  views of the Potomac, the Virginia shore and the Appalachians. Twenty-three  sites are being offered now, but Abell says he will eventually carve out 56  more.  </P> <P> Buyers will own their building sites. The 150 acres, however, will belong to  the Merry-Go-Round owners association. The $200-a-month fee will pay for a farm  staff of five, maintenance of the tennis courts (two are almost finished, and  two more planned), barns (two now, another one e planned), trails and roads,  two snowplows and two trucks, plus grass mowing. ("We didn't want anyone mowing  the grass when their neighbors are giving a party," Abell says.)  </P> <P> Stabling for the horses will cost another $200 a month. There is pasturage for  probably 50 horses, Abell said. Some people, therefore, will have to keep their  spare horses elsewhere. No extra charge for dogs, or cats, though. No limit to  the squirrels, snakes, birds or crickets.  </P> <P> Luvie Pearson is keeping the farmhouse and its 10 or so surrounding acres. The  Abells have a five-acre site with the former dairyman's house. They're living  in the main house at the farm.  </P> <P> ("I agreed to try it for a year," said Bess Abell.) In the meantime, they're  renting out their Georgetown house, next to Luvie Pearson's. Tom Hulce, star of  "A Few Good Men" at the Kennedy Center, is the current tenant.  </P> <P> Obviously, they're giving their kingdom for a horse.  </P></p>

He claimed that allegedly the rights of the  Armenians in Akhalkalakskiy and Akhaltsikskiy rayons--where the  Armenians are the majority of the population--are being  violated. Tengiz Sigua, the former Georgian prime minister and  now a deputy at the Georgian Parliament, speaking during the  parliament session on 8 March, expressed serious concern  regarding such accusations. It was stated during the session  that unless urgent measures are taken this region of the  Republic could become a second Karabakh.    It seems that the Armenians, who have always looked upon  foreign territories with heinous intentions, have now coveted  the territory of another neighbor. Unless their covetous  approach is obstructed, they will continue to claim other  territories.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Fall-out from Hong Kong spreads throughout region A FURTHER sharp fall in Hong Kong triggered selling in Japanese shares yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 133.60 to 17,260.08, although buying by investment trusts and arbitrageurs pushed the index up to the day's high of 17,508.32 at the start of the afternoon session. However, short selling and profit-taking by dealers depressed the Nikkei to the day's low of 17,205.32 just before the close. Volume rose to 240m shares from 206m. Declines led advances by 573 to 367 with 172 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.23 to 1,304.08 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.09 to 1,051.29. Traders said investors used the fall in Hong Kong as an excuse to take profits. 'It's a consolidation period, as investors have started to realise that the recent rise may have not be backed by economic fundamentals and corporate profits,' said Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities. Most investors, including public funds, waited on the sidelines for third quarter GNP figures which were announced in the afternoon. Traders said that while the 1.6 per cent annualised fall from the previous quarter shocked investors, hopes of an imminent cut in the discount rate emerged. In spite of the fall on the first section, The second section rose 4.06 to 1,677.76, gaining for the 11th consecutive day as dealers targeted small-capitalisation shares. Dealers also traded speculative issues, with Nippon Carbon, second most active issue of the day, unchanged at Y513 and Clarion up Y13 to Y485. High-technology issues were lower on profit-taking, with Toshiba down Y4 to Y618 and NEC retreating Y9 to Y659. Toy makers, which firmed on hopes of robust sales ahead of Christmas, also fell on profit-taking. Bandai lost Y150 to Y3,630 and Konami fell 80 to Y2,870. Morinaga Milk Industry jumped Y57 to Y700 on reports that the company had started drug research for a new virus. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 54.68 to 18,718.60 in volume of 35.4m shares. Machinery and construction stocks fell on profit-taking, while pharmaceuticals and electronics companies gained ground. Roundup THE fall-out from Hong Kong was felt throughout the region. HONG KONG crashed 8 per cent as the stand-off between Governor Chris Patten and China's leaders prompted panic selling across the board. However, a small bounce in the Hang Seng index in the final minutes and a slight premium in December futures on the Hang Seng raised hopes that the market might be close to its bottom. The Hang Seng index ended 433.44 lower at 4,978.21, but off the day's low of 4,947.75. Turnover jumped to HKDollars 5.3bn from HKDollars 3.6bn. Among the most active stocks, HSBC was down HKDollars 4 at HKDollars 51 and Cheung Kong 90 cents lower at HKDollars 18. SINGAPORE closed lower in cautious trading as sentiment was dampened by Hong Kong. The Straits Times industrial index fell 11.55 to 1,448.34 in volume of 86.62m shares. Speculative interest in companies linked to Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB) remained but there was light profit-taking. MPHB lost 7 cents to SDollars 1.65 and it was the most active share with 6.21m traded. AUSTRALIA was also depressed by Hong Kong but dealers noted an inflow of capital into Australia from Hong Kong. The All Ordinaries index closed 4.6 down at 1,433.8 in turnover of ADollars 141.4m. The gold sector was weak as an ownership dispute at the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea weighed on shares. The three listed co-owners of Porgera continued a slide begun last month on news that the PNG government wanted to raise its 10 per cent stake to 30 per cent. Placer Pacific slid 8 cents to ADollars 1.10, Highlands Gold 4 to 63 cents and Renison Goldfields 2 cents to ADollars 2.65. NEW ZEALAND finished lower for the third consecutive day as the market continued to consolidate from a strong run. The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed down 6.02 at 1,519.54 in turnover of NZDollars 25m. SEOUL fell after the central bank's rejection of a cut in interest rates. The index closed 11.27 lower at 638.93 in turnover of Won430.87bn. TAIWAN reversed early gains to end lower and the weighted index closed 21.62 down at 3,614.08 in thin turnover of TDollars 4.9bn. MANILA rose for the third day on hopes of better economic conditions in the Philippines in 1993. The composite index went up by 6.14 to 1,279.54.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Arts: Elisabeth IT IS rare to attend a musical where practically every song, every scene-change is applauded and the audience stays behind for a good half an hour at the end to show its enthusiasm. So it was at last week's first night of Elisabeth at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. To be sure, there is something peculiarly Austrian about Elisabeth. She was the wife of Franz Joseph, the last Austrian Emperor. She came from the Wittelsbach family in Bavaria and perhaps had a touch of its legendary madness. She did not take easily to the conventions of court life and for much of the time lived apart from her husband. She was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in Geneva in 1898. At one level, there is a touch of banality. Much of the trouble seems to have stemmed from her inability to get on with her mother-in-law. On the other, she was a genuinely romantic figure. Johann Strauss died shortly after Elisabeth was murdered and it was said that an age of imperial splendour was sinking into twilight. Recently, there has been an attempt to restore the musical tradition in modern form. This consists of translating Sondheim and Lloyd Webber into German. Some of those who saw Cats in Vienna said that it was the best production of the show they have seen. Elisabeth supplies the Austrian gloss and sugar. The lyrics and book are by Michael Kunze and the music by Sylvester Levay, both of whom pioneered the German-language work on Anglo-American musicals. Direction is by Harry Kupfer of Bayreuth fame, so there is no shortage of experience. No shortage of staging techniques either. The speed and variety of some of the scene and costume changes are breathtaking: the depth and height of the stage are used to the full. The principal device is a kind of suspension bridge from which the figure of Death, who haunts Elisabeth from the start, periodically descends. Beneath is a symbolic drawbridge which can be transformed into a gondola. Then suddenly the stage is cleared, as the peasants and workers begin to revolt against a decrepit empire. One point in the story is notably modern. The decline of the royal house is hastened by the interest of the media. An old-fashioned news reel camera is shown looking into the Hofburg: a huge red arrow pinpoints a particular room just as it might in a tabloid photograph. For the outsider, there is one fascinating insight. A late scene in Elisabeth shows the rise of Austrian nationalism with the fascists on the march. Although it is at least as well executed as any other piece of choreography, it throws the audience into an embarrassed silence. It is the only scene that is not applauded. The musical influences come from all over the place, including Beethoven's ninth symphony. Dramatically, there is a Brechtian influence in the figure of Lucheni, Elisabeth's assassin. Dominant, however, is The Phantom of the Opera, from which the figure of Death seems to be partly drawn. Played by Uwe Kroger with flowing blond hair, this is a striking if melodramatic performance: rather like the whole show - corny, but effective. As Elisabeth, Pia Douwes does not quite show what a strange figure the empress must have been. If you are in Vienna, you should see Elisabeth, for it goes with the place: I am less certain that it would translate successfully into English. Theater an der Wien, Vienna 587 05 50</p>

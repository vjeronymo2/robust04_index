['Arafat] Actually I followed what happened, and I express  my strong satisfaction with what has been achieved and consider  it complementary to what has been achieved on the Palestinian  and Jordanian track. It is now the Lebanese track's turn after  the Syrian track, God willing. Because we aspire to a  comprehensive Arab solution that takes account of our Arab  nation's interests to establish a just and comprehensive peace  in the region.    [Khayrallah] Your position sounds very positive with regard  to what has happened. So how would you assess what President  Clinton said in that meeting?    ['Arafat] What he said emphasized the importance of what  happened on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the Washington  agreement between Israel and the PLO in order to reach the  declaration of principles agreement we signed. What President  Clinton said is a new driving force for the current peace  process in the region.    [Khayrallah] What about what President al-Asad said and his  focus on a comprehensive peace?    ['Arafat] That is not the demand of Syria only. I mention  President al-Asad because he stressed a comprehensive peace,  which is the demand of the Arab nation as a whole. It is a  Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Arab  demand.    [Khayrallah] It is now four months since the Gaza-Jericho  First agreement was signed in Washington. How would you assess  the course that began after the White House ceremony?    ['Arafat] Regrettably, the Israeli side continues to try to  get around what was agreed upon. I hope that the conference's  cosponsors, who signed the agreement with us, will hasten to  intervene to force Israel to implement precisely and honestly  what was agreed, including compliance with the dates stipulated  in the agreement. Israeli maneuvers are continuing, in order to  evade the dates and try to win as much support as possible for  the Israeli view with regard to the implementation of the  agreement. This is expected from the Israeli side and came as  no surprise to us. We know how to run the negotiations with the  Israelis. We know the nature of the negotiations; they are not  easy. We always try to urge them to comply precisely and  honestly with what was agreed. But regrettably, the Israeli  maneuvers are still continuing.    In this context we are not begging from Israel, but, rather,  demanding an implementation that serves peace and its march.  Peace is in the interests of all: us, them, and the region as  a whole. This is the comprehensive peace we are talking about as  an Arab nation.    [Khayrallah] There is an Israeli view that President 'Arafat  is not convinced that what the two sides have reached so far is  an agreement on a transitional, not final, phase, and that you  want to begin the final phase now.    ['Arafat] Any Israeli official who says that seems not to  have read the agreement. The agreement specified phases for  that; it is a phased agreement. As for Gaza and Jericho, the  Israeli withdrawal from there means that they will become a  liberated territory in the legal and international sense. And  if some Israeli officials know this fact, let them refer to  international law and international stipulations to see what  withdrawal means.    The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho means that this  territory becomes liberated the minute the (Israeli) withdrawal  begins, just as happened when the French withdrew from Lebanon  and Syria, the British from India and Egypt, and the French from  Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. But, as we agreed, the  implementation will be in stages. For example, the withdrawal  from the densely populated areas in the other parts of the West  Bank will take place before the elections. This is because the  elections should be conducted under international supervision  and under the Palestinian National Authority's supervision. We  will set up a national authority in Gaza and Jericho which will  extend to all Palestinian territories.    [Khayrallah] That is in the context of the negotiations....    ['Arafat] No, in the context of reality...only in the first  stage this authority is not entitled to set up an army or to  have embassies. But when the PLO signed--and (Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin signed with the PLO, which has a bigger  international recognition than Israel. [as published]    [Khayrallah] But if we want to determine what the  disagreement is and take the crossings issue for example, what  are the points of disagreement?    ['Arafat] Are we going to live in Bantustans or ghettos? No.  When we say "withdrawal," it means complete withdrawal. They  are using security as an excuse. Assuming you do not trust the  Palestinian policeman or officer standing at the crossing point,  do you also not trust the international presence? We too do not  trust the Israeli soldier. In Sinai they trust the  international presence. The Likud party trusted the  international presence there. So there is at least a precedent  for him [Rabin] to rely on, namely the Likud's agreement to the  international presence in Sinai. What different does it make  for the international forces in Sinai to expand to the finger,  or [Gaza] Strip -- the strip resembles a toe on the map with  regard to Sinai, which is why they call it the Gaza Strip.    [Khayrallah] So how do you believe that can be resolved?    ['Arafat] We are following up the matter. We also urge the  cosponsors of the conference and the international parties to  participate in persuading the Israelis to understand this matter.    [Khayrallah] Are you satisfied with Israel's request that  there be a ceiling of 7,000 Palestinian policemen?    ['Arafat] There is no Israeli demand to that effect. On the  contrary, they are aware of the importance of the police. In the  developed states there is a policeman for every 200-250  citizens. As for Third World countries, there is one policeman  for every 100-150 people. But this applies to states that have  armies which they can use at any moment. We Palestinians are not  allowed in the first stage to have an army. So we will rely  mainly on the police. The number agreed in the security  committee ranges between 20,000 and 25,000 policeman.    They say that they have no objection to the number we  specified. Our talks with World Bank (officials) and the recent  meeting in Oslo with the donor states and the World Bank showed  that the first group in Gaza and Jericho only should be 12,000  to 15,000 policemen, and the other groups are to be sent when  the withdrawal from the other Palestinian territories has been  completed.    [Khayrallah] In view of that, do you expect progress to be  achieved in the near future, based on compromises with regard to  the crossings, for example?    ['Arafat] We hope so. But not compromises, but, rather,  solutions that give us our rights in full.    [Khayrallah] But at what stage?    ['Arafat] The negotiations are continuing in Taba.  Negotiations were held this month in Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and  now are being held in Taba.    [Khayrallah] Why were the economic negotiations in Paris  suspended?    ['Arafat] Because politics comes before economics. There  must be an agreement on political matters in order for economic  negotiations to progress.    [Khayrallah] The negotiations are continuing now. Are you  satisfied with the Palestinian delegation's performance?    ['Arafat] Yes. The Palestinian delegation is implementing  its leadership's instructions. So we are satisfied.    [Khayrallah] Completely satisfied?    ['Arafat] Of course. The delegation takes account of the  Palestinian people's interests.    [Khayrallah] Do you believe that better elements could be  used in the negotiations?    ['Arafat] If necessary, we will send [other] elements. And,  praise God, we have sufficient competent and capable cadres.    [Khayrallah] How do you explain Palestinian differences?    ['Arafat] What differences?    [Khayrallah] Among Palestinian leaderships....    ['Arafat] There are no differences. But Palestinian  democracy is strong, which means.... Differences exist in  Israel. And in the United States there are differences over  NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] (the economic  agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico). And in  Europe there are those who are for GATT and those who are  against. It is one of the characteristics of any democratic  arena. We are proud of Palestinian democracy, even if it does  not appeal to some people. We are exercising it to serve the  Palestinian people.    [Khayrallah] How do you explain the press campaigns against  you these days?    ['Arafat] They are incited. They reflect -- whether in the  Arab or foreign press -- their surprise at the resoluteness of  the Palestinian position. But there is a Palestinian proverb  which says, "the wind cannot shake a mountain."    [Khayrallah] Let us move to the Jordan issue. What is the  status of relations with Jordan at present?    ['Arafat] Relations are "fine," and we have signed a very  good economic agreement with the Jordanian brothers, and the  joint committee has begun its work. We are proud of  Palestinian-Jordanian relations.    [Khayrallah] But what was the reason for the delay in  signing  the agreement?    ['Arafat] We had to wait for what was going to happen  between us and the Israelis.    [Khayrallah] So relations with Israel are not given  precedence over relations with Jordan?    ['Arafat] That is impossible. And an agreement will be  signed between us and the brothers in Egypt; you were the first  to read the "draft agreement on economic and technological  cooperation between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the PLO." It  will, God willing, be signed this month, because we are seeking  protection through Arab economic relations against Israeli  infiltration among the Palestinian people, who have been under  the occupation for many years.    [Khayrallah] So you do not in any way give precedence to  relations with Israel over relations with any Arab party?    ['Arafat] It is not possible, because our Arab relations are  fundamental.    [Khayrallah] But how do you explain your request to set up a  Palestinian central bank or to have a Palestinian currency?    ['Arafat] We are entitled to demand everything the next  Palestinian entity should have. We are on our way to a state  which is supposed to unite confederally with Jordan, in  accordance with the resolution adopted by our National Council  and the two fraternal peoples' free choice. If our brothers in  Jordan agree, we will establish the confederation with them  immediately. The state to be established, God willing, should  have all these capabilities.    [Khayrallah] When do you expect to reach Gaza or Jericho?    ['Arafat] We hope that Israeli intransigence will end. The  Israelis should understand that, if the central issue in the  Middle East and the Arab nation, that is the Palestinian issue,  is not resolved, there will be no stability, security, or peace,  but rather, total chaos. So they should take account of the  importance of resolving this issue.    [Khayrallah] But how? What is your advice to them?    ['Arafat] The agreement signed was not between us and Israel  only. The world took part in it and it was signed by the U.S.  and Russian cosponsors of the conference, under the U.S.  President's auspices and before the eyes of the entire world,  which blesses it.    [Khayrallah] What are you actually requesting Israel to do?    ['Arafat] To implement honestly and precisely what has been  agreed.    [Khayrallah] Do you believe that Israel has not read the  agreement well?    ['Arafat] No, it has read it well, but it is trying to  maneuver and evade the substance of the agreement.    [Khayrallah] What would you say about relations with  Rabin? How do you find the man?    ['Arafat] I say that military men honor their word, and I  hope this will apply to the implementation of the agreement.    [Khayrallah] What was the status of the talks with him,  given it is the first time you have met with an Israeli prime  minister?    ['Arafat] They were not easy. The first meeting was  difficult. But after that we moved to lay new foundations to  implement the agreement, and when he requested the postponement  of the withdrawal, I agreed.    [Khayrallah] What attracted you in his personality?    ['Arafat] He honors his word.    [Khayrallah] What about Shim'on Peres?    ['Arafat] He is an experienced politician.    [Khayrallah] What is the difference between him and Rabin?    ['Arafat] I do not interfere in the Israeli Government's  private affairs.    [Khayrallah] Yasir 'Arafat is accused of wanting to control  everything, as though the stage can accommodate one person only.  What is your opinion?    ['Arafat] You know, building a homeland requires a man who  works day and night. It is now 0115 hrs, and the work has just  started. By God, if a child is wounded in the intifadah, I am  responsible for him, and.... I would like to remind you of the  committees we have set up to tackle the new situation with  regard to building the Palestinian national authority. These  committees have been formed at all levels. For example, the  economic committee follows up matters with the donors and the  World Bank. We have also started to set up establishments like  the human rights committee as well as the environment, census,  health, education, and housing establishments.    [Khayrallah] How do you view Arab relations in general?    ['Arafat] By God, they need further efforts from Arab  leaders to restore Arab cohesion, because we are facing a new  order and it will be to our cost if we do not confront it  united. I call for further Arab unity in the interests of our  children and posterity.    [Khayrallah] Can you make an initiative in this connection?    ['Arafat] I support the Arab League secretary general's  initiative.    [Khayrallah] What about Palestinian national unity and  [Palestinian] opposition organizations?    ['Arafat] I tell them one thing. Now that an understanding  has been reached between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and  signs of a solution have begun to emerge on the Syrian front, I  tell these organizations: My hand is extended to you in order  to build the Palestinian National Authority and a free homeland  for all the free people of Palestine -- a democratic, civilized,  contemporary homeland based on the principles, values, ethics,  and religious radiation derived from Palestine's traditions and  civilization and the religious tolerance for which this land --  the land of Palestine, the land of peace, the land of sanctity  -- is known. I extend my hand to you all in order to reinforce  our national unity, because Palestine is being reborn, and  Palestine needs all its women and children.    [Khayrallah] How many hours do you work a day?    ['Arafat] Between 17 and 18 hours, as usual.    [Khayrallah] Are there any more visits coming up?    ['Arafat] A visit to Egypt and a meeting with President  Mubarak on Thursday, and a meeting with U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Brown. Then I will go to Oslo to take part in the  funeral of Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, an old friend of  mine since he was defense minister. He used to visit southern  Lebanon to inspect his country's unit there.</p>

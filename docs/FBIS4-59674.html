			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, today received an Arab League  delegation under Major General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab  League assistant secretary general for military affairs. During  the meeting, discussions dealt with the developments in our  country in light of the explosion of the military situation and  the rebellion against the legitimate authority by the apostate  and secessionist gang in the Socialist Party's leadership.    The brother chairman briefed the Arab League delegation on  current developments, pointing out the subversive role that has  been played by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the  Socialist Party's leadership since 19 August 1993, including  what happened in Abyan on the eve of the signing of the pledge  and accord document, the explosion of the military situation in  Harth Sufyan, Shabwah, 'Imran, and then in Dhamar and later in  Aden against the central security personnel and the 2d Armored  Brigade in al-Rahah in Lahij. He also reviewed what is currently  taking place on various axes of combat.    The brother chairman held the rebellious, secessionist  clique  responsible for igniting the war, imposing it on our people and  the legitimate leadership, and leading the country into its  current situation. He stressed that the secessionist gang  represents a small clique that has violated the people's will  and national consensus and rebelled against the constitutional  legitimacy to implement its secessionist plan and dismember the  homeland. He indicated that the security organs recently  discovered large quantities of weapons stockpiled by that gang  in various parts of Sanaa and other cities to spread chaos in  the country, foment sedition among the children of our people,  and abort unity and democracy.    The brother Presidential Council chairman said he is  confident the brothers and friends would understand the reality  that what is taking place in Yemen is a domestic affair and a  rebellion by the secessionist gang against legitimacy and unity.  He also said that the secessionist, rebellious, and adventurous  elements which made the decision to go to war should recognize  unity and constitutional legitimacy and give themselves up to be  fairly tried, or leave the homeland to avert our people and  their Armed Forces further bloodshed. He stressed his eagerness  for dialogue within the framework of safeguarding unity,  democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. He also highly valued  the Arab League's role and its concern for legitimacy and  safeguarding Yemeni unity, given that it is a national gain for  the Arab nation.    He said that our country can never do without the role of  the  Arab League and of all the brothers and friends in standing to  the side of our Yemeni people, supporting Yemeni unity, and  Yemen's democratic course, and its constitutional institutions.    For his part, the brother Arab League assistant secretary  general has emphasized the Arab League's concern for Yemen's  unity and for security and stability in Yemen. He stressed that  the Arab League is ready to play any role that will safeguard  Yemen's safety within the framework of unity and legitimacy.</p>

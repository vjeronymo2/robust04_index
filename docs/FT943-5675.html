			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Compensation provision 'clear in 10 years' A sharp increase in asbestos-linked personal injury claims has forced T&amp;N to make record compensation payments in the first half of this year, writes Tim Burt. The company, which as Turner &amp; Newall was formerly Britain's largest supplier of asbestos, paid claimants a total of Pounds 22.1m in the six months to June 30, compared with just Pounds 3m last time. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said the sevenfold increase reflected the group's determination to settle as many outstanding cases as possible before a new compensation framework came into force in North America. Under the framework, claimants should avoid lengthy legal action by receiving fixed compensation payments for various forms of asbestos-linked illness. The first-half compensation payments were paid from balance sheet provisions, which fell from Pounds 38.4m at the year end to Pounds 34.9m at the half-way stage. Mr Hope predicted those provisions would decline gradually and could be wiped out altogether within 10 years. 'The beneficial effect on gearing will be significant and it will help our future results enormously,' he said.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Chairman resigns from Taylor Woodrow offshoot MR PETER Hedges yesterday resigned as chairman of Taylor Woodrow Property, one of the construction company's biggest divisions. It is the latest in a series of senior management changes at the group which incurred a Pounds 16m pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year. Taylor Woodrow said that Mr Hedges, 49, was leaving 'to pursue other interests in management, property investment and industry.' Mr Hedges is thought to have been a candidate for the chairmanship of Taylor Woodrow, which was given to Mr Colin Parsons following the departure in March of former chairman, Mr Peter Drew. One of the first acts of Mr Parsons was to dismantle a top heavy senior management structure which included two deputy chairmen and three joint managing directors. Mr Hedges, although he retained his power base as head of one of the group's important division, was stripped of his titles of group deputy chairman and joint managing director.</p>

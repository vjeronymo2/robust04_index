			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 14 May (AFP) -- Several armored cars took  up positions Saturday in the Georgian capital Tbilisi ahead of a  debate in parliament on President Eduard Shevardnadze's  challenge to deputies to abolish the post of presidency.    The armored cars were reinforcing police checkpoints already  in place for several days in the center of the town, witnesses  said.    Shevardnadze submitted Friday [13 May] his resignation and  proposed abolishing the presidency to protest the deputies'  refusal to ratify an accord towards settling the conflict with  the separatist republic of Abkhazia in western Georgia.    Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by  the Georgia news agency IPRINDA said that Shevardnadze would  remain parliamentary speaker, a post to which he was elected in  October 1992.    Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in  November 1992.    The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of  Abkhazia. The accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and  Abkhazian delegations in Moscow, calls for deploying  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a  12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from  the rest of Georgia.    Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a  series of political crises, including two civil wars and the  Abkhazian secession struggle, at a time when the national  economy is in ruins.</p>

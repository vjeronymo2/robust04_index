			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Lysenko report: "Pavel Grachev Proposes Holding </F> Reichstag Session"]    [Text] Berlin -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  has voiced a desire to include a session in the Reichstag  building as part of the ceremonies to mark the Russian troops  withdrawal from Germany.    We can assume that the discussion of this proposal from  Pavel  Grachev will not be easy. Such a request was made last year by  Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the  Western Group of Forces, but nobody took it seriously at the  time.</p>

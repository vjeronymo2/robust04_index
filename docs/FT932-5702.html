			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (1): Old dragon roars again - The message from senior officials in Shanghai is that this booming port intends to become a leading financial and trading centre in Asia, competing vigorously with the region's dynamic centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul SHANGHAI'S city fathers describe it as the economic 'Dragon Head' for the whole Yangtze river region. The phrase neatly expresses the city's soaring ambitions, which are endorsed by central government cadres in Beijing. The message from top officials in this booming port city is that Shanghai aims to become a leading financial centre in Asia, competing vigorously with the region's dynamic centres, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul. Mayor Huang Ju is happy to trumpet Shanghai's mission entrusted to it, he says, by the watershed 14th Communist Party Congress in Beijing last year that endorsed 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' (meaning almost anything goes as long it works). 'The Congress clearly pointed out that Shanghai, as the head of the dragon, should become an international trade and financial centre in the Far East and Western Pacific within the next 20 years,' he says. Privately, Shanghai's senior officials are more specific. The year 2010 is often mentioned as the target for the city to achieve its ambitions, one of which is to overtake Hong Kong as a financial services and trading giant. Shanghai embarks on this mission with formidable advantages, tempered by some conspicuous disadvantages. Advantages include its location at the mouth of the Yangtze whose riverside cities and towns, including Shanghai, account for about half of China's industrial output. It is also favoured by a motivated and well-educated population whose latent commercial instincts have been fired by China's accelerated reforms. Among its disadvantages are a chronically overburdened infrastructure in a densely-packed city of 13m; a relatively unsophisticated financial services sector that will take years to reform even if the government has the will to do so; and the deadweight of numerous state industries, at least 20 per cent of which are loss-making. Judging by Shanghai's speedy advances on various fronts in the past year, its ambitious aims are within reason, if not within its grasp. But it still has far to travel before it can hope to be included in the same league as Tokyo or Hong Kong, or even Seoul and Taipei. In their race to catch up, Shanghai officials could be forgiven for casting envious eyes south towards Guangdong province and the Shenzen economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong, which were first to be accorded the economic freedom to experiment over the past 10 years. Shanghai, birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party and scene of great turbulence during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, has, on the other hand, been kept on a tight leash by Beijing, fearful of its wilfulness. Through the 1980s, Shanghai's once virtually unchallenged status as China's premier industrial and exporting powerhouse was gradually eroded. Since 1978, the year that China tentatively embraced its 'open door' policy, the municipality's share of the country's exports has declined from 30 per cent to 7 per cent last year. It lost its ranking as number one exporter to Guangdong in the mid-1980s and in 1985 yielded to Jiangsu province its long-coveted status as the provincial-level unit with the greatest absolute value of industrial output (GVIO). Shanghai officials date the city's resurgence in the past year to the more encouraging policies of the central government that followed a tour of southern China in February 1992 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, during which he urged faster growth. While seeds for last year's explosion of activity had been sown well before Mr Deng's intervention, his injunction to the nation to 'seize the opportunity' has proved a powerful catalyst at all levels. The municipality recorded growth in 1992 on total GNP of RMB105.4bn of 14.8 per cent, well above the national average of 12.8. This compared with Shanghai's stuttering growth rates in the 1980s which were only about half those recorded nationally. Foreign and provincial-level investment poured into Shanghai in 1992, with foreign companies pledging Dollars 3.5bn, equal to total investment for the previous 10 years. Shanghai's securities exchange and the growth of investment opportunities, especially real estate, have been a powerful magnet. Last year the flow of funds into and out of the municipality reached RMB300bn, compared with RMB120bn in 1991. Figures for the first quarter of this year show that Shanghai is continuing to experience strong growth, well ahead of national targets of 8-9 per cent. GNP growth for the three months, compared with the equivalent period last year, reached 14.2 per cent with manufacturing up 22 per cent, retail sales up 30 per cent, and real estate investment up 12 per cent. Imports surged by 30 per cent, while growth in exports by value was a disappointing 4.3 per cent. Planning commission officials explained that exports were down partly because activity lagged during the long Spring Festival holiday, but also because it was now becoming more profitable to sell in the domestic market. Officials appear surprisingly insouciant about inflation which reached 16.7 per cent last year, well above the reported national average of about six per cent. Wages in Shanghai shot up by 17-18 per cent in 1992. Mayor Huang contends that Shanghai's inflation, with its own 'Chinese characteristics', is manageable. The present bout differs markedly, he says, from the sharp price rises of the 1980s that almost derailed the reform effort and necessitated a tight credit squeeze. Then, inflation flowed from a surge in imports and unrestrained growth; now, it derives mostly from changes to the pricing system as part of China's sweeping structural reforms. Whatever the truth, municipal economic policy envisages no slackening in growth rates and thus demand for imports. Shanghai plans annual growth of 10 per cent for the rest of this decade, but officials are confident that the rates achieved will be higher. If targets are met, the city's economy would nearly double by the year 2000, a staggering advance on the present. Much hope is pinned on new foreign investment pouring into the city's various developments zones including, principally, the new Pudong zone of more than 500 sq km on the east bank of the Huangpu river. Western officials are sceptical about what they believe are some of the more grandiose claims registered about Pudong's growth prospects. They also note that efforts to upgrade the zone's infrastructure are flagging due to lack of funds. But it is also true that Shanghai's rapid economic take-off in the past year confounded the sceptics. The city's energies have been unleashed after a faltering start and it is set to maintain a cracking pace. . . if it can overcome huge infrastructure problems left over from years of neglect. Shanghai's roads, rail system, sewerage, telecommunications, housing are all inadequate for a city of its size and aspirations. Shanghai officials acknowledge these drawbacks and have instituted a crash programme to improve transport and communications, but efforts to rebuild the city's decaying infrastructure, especially its road system, are adding, unavoidably, to the chaos. About 750 roads are being worked on at present, and traffic snarls are a feature of daily life. In their efforts to launch Shanghai into the 21st century Mayor Huang and his colleagues can at least be confident that, unlike the barren years of the 1980s, the city now has a coterie of fairly active supporters in Beijing. Mr Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party and newly-appointed state president, is a former mayor himself; although perhaps more important is the presence of Mr Zhu Rongji, China's 'economic czar' in the Beijing hierarchy. Mr Zhu is the immediate past mayor of Shanghai and is credited with having laid the foundations for its latest growth spurt.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / US says Japan trade talks still far from breakthrough The top US trade negotiator warned yesterday that the US and Japan are still a long way from any agreement in their framework trade negotiations, and that no breakthrough was likely in talks this week. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he did not expect that 'any dramatic announcements or breakthroughs in the near term' would follow his meeting in Washington yesterday afternoon with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, nor his talks today with Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese foreign minister and deputy prime minister. 'I think this is a time for listening and exchanging ideas,' Mr Kantor said. This sober assessment of the chances of a quick agreement came as the clock ticked away towards a September 30 deadline, when the US must decide whether to impose sanctions on Japan in retaliation for what it sees as unfair trade practices. Mr Kantor said no decisions had yet been made on sanctions. 'We are going to listen and listen carefully,' he said. But Japanese officials in Washington warned that they would not take US sanctions lying down, and might instead take the issue to a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. None of the three sectors targeted by the US-Japanese framework agreement - government procurement, cars and car parts, and insurance - appears close to resolution, although Japanese officials are more hopeful than their US counterparts about an insurance deal. In talks on government procurement, the two sides are still far apart over how to measure progress in expanding foreign bidders' access to the Japanese market. This reflects the broader disagreement between the US and Japan over whether the use of numerical indicators to measure progress amounts to the setting of unacceptably inflexible targets. Japan complains that the US insists on an indicator tilted towards a substantial increase in market share in each monitoring period, while Japan wants a neutral indicator of progress. The car and car parts talks are even further from agreement. Japanese officials point proudly to statistics showing a 47 per cent increase in imports of US automobiles in the first seven months of this year, even while the overall Japanese car market has shrunk. But they balk at giving any kind of government assurance to back up the Japanese carmakers' voluntary commitment to increase their purchases of US-made auto parts. The US is also seeking to add flat glass to the sectors under discussion.</p>

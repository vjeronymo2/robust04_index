			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIER DESMOND'S VISION FOR IRELAND FAR-REACHING;  </P> <P> SEES HIS COUNTRY AS THE JUMPING-OFF POINT TO UNIFIED EUROPE FOR BUSINESSES IN  1990S  </P> <P> Some countries are blessed with oil, iron ore or even diamonds. But Ireland's  natural resources are its people and its educational system, says Dermot  Desmond.  </P> <P> All right, the acknowledged Wunderkind of Irish finance will concede when  pressed, that maybe its blarney should be mentioned, too.  </P> <P> But if blarney used to symbolize a sort of quiet, disarming native charm, the  hyperactive, 38-year-old Desmond represents a new, concentrated brand for the  hard-sell, fast-paced Europe of the 1990s.  </P> <P> Pointing to the unified European market planned for 1992, Desmond, the  executive chairman of Dublin's NCB Group Ltd., said: "We see a number of  non-European companies that will want to market their financial services on the  continent. Ireland should be the bridgehead for these companies."  </P> <P> It was Desmond who first promoted the idea of transforming the seedy docklands  section of Dublin into a new, international financial services center scheduled  to open this fall. The 65 tenants already signed up include Irish and a range  of foreign firms -- from America's Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Bank to Japan's  Daiwa Bank and West Germany's Dresdener Bank.  </P> <P> Desmond's influence extends well beyond that project, however: A few weeks ago,  he became chairman of the newly created Irish Futures and Options Exchange.  </P> <P> While claiming no interest in politics himself, he has also been a key economic  adviser to Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and his Fianna Fail (Soldiers  of Destiny) political party during the country's remarkable economic resurgence  of the past two years.  </P> <P> In concert with two other center-right parties, Haughey has slashed government  spending, cut foreign debt and brought a seemingly chronic double-digit  inflation rate down to 3%.  </P> <P> "Desmond is credited with converting the Fianna Fail leadership, and Charlie  Haughey specifically, after the (1987) election into taking this tougher  economic line," noted Terence J. Baker, senior research officer at Dublin's  Economic and Social Research Institute.  </P> <P> "He's somebody who has the ear of the Taoiseach (prime minister). There's no  doubt about that," confirmed a government official who spoke on condition of  anonymity. And an Irish journalist said Desmond can occasionally be seen  slipping into Haughey's office around noon for a brown-bag lunch.  </P> <P> Interviewed in the offices of his stock brokerage and corporate finance firm in  Dublin, Desmond would say of his relationship with Haughey only that "I'd be an  admirer of him -- of his national commitment. . . . We can have a kind of  non-presidential communication."  </P> <P> A smoker and fidgeter, Desmond has the appearance of a man in a hurry. When he  was not talking during a recent interview, his foot bounced in time with some  incessant inner tempo. Admirers describe him as "bright," "lively," even  "charismatic." Critics call him a self-promoter.  </P> <P> He founded National City Brokers as a foreign exchange and currency deposit  agency in 1981 after several years of working first for Citibank in Dublin,  then as a World Bank adviser to the government of Afghanistan in Kabul.  </P> <P> In 1984, his firm bought a small Dublin stock brokerage and became the NCB  Group. The closely held company has since grown into one of the country's  largest stock, bond and corporate finance firms.  </P> <P> Married and the father of four, Desmond is acutely aware of the continuing  emigration of Irish youth in search of the economic opportunities that this  country has never seemed able to provide. His dream, he said, is "to see kids  grow up in a country they're proud of and which has opportunities for them to  work in."  </P> <P> The Europe of 1992 offers Ireland a unique chance, Desmond believes. With  trading barriers scheduled to come down, the incentive is for firms to  centralize their European operations, and Ireland has specific attractions for  financial services companies, he said.  </P> <P> Desmond ticked off Dublin's selling points: It is located within the same  advantageous time zone as London, permitting communication with all the world's  major financial centers during waking hours. English is the language of  finance, and Ireland's highly regarded educational system is the source of a  potentially superior work force.  </P> <P> Ireland has a new and efficient telecommunications system and, to sweeten the  deal, the government has instituted what is reputed to be the most generous  collection of tax breaks for foreign investors offered by any European Economic  Community member.  </P> <P> On top of everything else, Desmond said, Dublin offers what some would consider  a superior, less costly and certainly less congested life style than  alternatives such as London.  </P> <P> With the first building in the new International Financial Services Center due  to open in September, Desmond said there are as many more firms applying for  licenses as have already signed up. The plan now calls for 500,000 square feet  of space in the center, compared to the original 300,000, he added.  </P> <P> And if you think that's blarney, Desmond said, you're wrong. "All the blarney  in the world won't convince any of these financial firms to come in," he  explained. "The blarney we use is reinforcing the truth."  </P></p>

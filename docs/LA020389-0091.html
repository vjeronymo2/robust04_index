			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> The Ensemble Studio Theatre, beset by financial difficulties, will leave its  East Hollywood home at the end of February. Vicki Williams, a spokeswoman for  the theater, says the group can no longer afford the "more than $3,000 in rent  and other costs" and is looking for a new theater. The news follows the  premature closing Sunday of "West Memphis Mojo" at the Ensemble, the result of  a dispute between the Ensemble and the show's producers, Larry Riley and Carmen  Hayward-Stetson, over the running costs of the production.

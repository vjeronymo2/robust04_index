Goethe University, Frankfurt-am-Main;  UDC577.113.6.088.53:543.422.25]    [Abstract] Two-dimensional NMR ROESY spectroscopy was  employed in assessing the configuration about the P atom of 16  pairs of deoxydinucleoside methyl phosphonates with the general  formula [MeO)[.sub]2[/]Tr]Np-(CH[.sub]3[/])N'(Ac) and the  unnatural -O-P(CH[.sub]3[/])(O)-O- internucleoside bond. In  the formula, N- and N' indicate the base protected  dinucleosides. Cross-relaxation data on interaction of  P-CH[.sub]3[/] protons with the 3'-end nucleoside revealed  differences only in the case of H(3')- and H(4')-protons of  pyrimidine nucleosides. These interactions were more pronounced  in the case of the S[.sub]p[/] isomers. Accordingly, the  spectral variations between the diasteroisomers were due to  conformational differences predicated on the nature of the  heterocyclic bases in the dimers.

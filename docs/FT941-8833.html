			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Pounds weathers mixed data Sterling yesterday maintained a firm tone in spite of the release of mixed economic data and a strong D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. After falling nearly a pfennig to DM2.54 on the release of subdued UK retail sales and prices data, and unemployment figures which showed a surprise rise, the pound later recovered to end in London at DM2.5471 - slightly above Tuesday's close of DM2.5463. Market reaction was that, while the figures were soft enough to justify last week's UK rate cut, they did not indicate that the economic recovery was in any jeopardy. The D-Mark was stronger against most currencies ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting, while the dollar-yen rate stabilised following considerable volatility earlier in the week. UK economic statistics showed subdued price pressures in January, with headline retail price inflation for the month at 2.5 per cent. Analysts said the key figure was probably the 0.6 per cent increase in retail sales. Although towards the lower end of expectations, it did confirm that consumer spending - whose strength is pivotal to an economic upturn - continues to grow. Unemployment rose by a surprise 15,000, the first increase in months, but this was treated as a seasonal blip. The Treasury said the aim of economic recovery with low inflation was being achieved. Against a year ago, company output was up 3.5 per cent, retail sales up nearly 4.0 per cent and unemployment down 200,000. Underlying inflation for the last four months was the lowest in 25 years. Observers said the figures left the way open for a further  1/4 percentage point rate cut. Sterling appeared fairly strong yesterday, holding its own against the stronger D-Mark. Market opinion was, as usual, split over what can be expected from today's Bundesbank meeting. A Reuters survey of 20 economists found that 10 do not expect a rate reduction, eight forecast a cut and two say it is too close to call. The D-Mark was stronger on most European crosses, reflecting a market view that rates will not be cut today. Yesterday's repo tender - where the Bank allocated a smaller than expected sum to the market - was seen as making a rate cut unlikely. The discount rate, which stands at 5.75 per cent, was last reduced at the Bundesbank's October 22 council meeting. The bank's monthly economic report, released yesterday, did not favour any particular analysis of what the council might decide. Some observers noted that the bank had left room for a cut. It reported success in combating inflation - the annualised rate of increase in German prices over the last six months was only 2.5 per cent - and said the recession was not yet over. Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said he had little doubt the central bank wanted to cut rates. Although the unresolved IG Metall wage dispute is seen as reason for not lowering rates, Mr Holtham asked: 'If they do not cut now, when will they cut?' He noted that if they choose to delay, they may well at their next meeting be faced with a less favourable environment in the form of a firmer dollar and a set of unfavourable M3 money supply data for January. There is also a widely held view in the market that the D-Mark risks being penalised if Bundesbank policies are seen as hindering economic recovery. The dollar recovered ground against the yen amid determined intervention from the Bank of Japan and an apparent softening of stance from the US administration. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, described recent yen strength as an 'accidental' by-product of the trade dispute. It closed in London at Y103.55 per dollar after Tuesday's Y103.10. It finished trading in New York at Y103.80. Although there is widespread agreement that recent yen strength is unsustainable, few are prepared to argue that the yen will not rise to Y100 against the dollar. But Mr Tony Norfield, UK economist at ABN-Amro, argues that the D-Mark/yen rate may be serving as a leading indicator of a reversal of yen strength. Mr Norfield said the recent strength of the D-Mark meant that it had not suffered as much as other currencies against the yen. Although the yen had recently been close to its all-time low of Y59 to the D-Mark, it had bounced back to trade yesterday at the top end of its recent Y59.60 to Y60.35 trading range. He said there was a 'great reluctance' on the part of traders to sell the yen below its record low. 'What we could be seeing as the yen situation unravels is the yen value falling across the board. If that did happen, what we would see is unwinding of recent dollar weakness.' Bolstering the view of a possible turnround is increasing evidence that fund managers are buying dollars against yen, believing the US currency has fallen too far. Liquidity conditions were tight in the UK money markets, with few bills forthcoming early in the day. Most of the assistance provided by the Bank of England to the market was at unspecified overnight rates. The Bank put Pounds 655m into the market this way. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 258m of assistance at its established rates. This compared with a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m, revised from Pounds 850m.</p>

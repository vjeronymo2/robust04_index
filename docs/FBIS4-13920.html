			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA)--Investigations by Lebanese  judicial and security authorities with 16 members of the  Abu-Nidal-led Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary Council [FRC]  arrested a few days ago have revealed that eight of them were  involved in the assassination a few months ago of Jordanian  diplomat Na'ib al- Ma'aytah. The number of persons arrested in  connection with the crime has thus risen to 11, after charges  were pressed against three others.    The Lebanese Army troops on Thursday stormed one of the  Abu-Nidal group's barracks in al-Rawdah, Western al-Biqa', and  seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and  missiles estimated at 25 truck loads. The army arrested 16 FRC  members.</p>

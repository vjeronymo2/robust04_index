			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corporation: </F> "Is the United States Really Fair?"]    [Text] The decade between 1980 and 1989 was really a  period of upheaval. The change was so great that Professor John  K. Galbraith even called it "The Age of Uncertainty." The  situation worsened in the 1990s, since everything became  unpredictable. In my opinion, we are now living in a period of  "social diastrophism" that is creating all sorts of gaps.    With respect to the industrial world, we have already faced  many crises in the past, such as the Nixon shock, the first oil  shock, the second oil shock, and the influence of the strong yen  on the export-dependent Japanese economy. Drawing on our  resources, we were able to tide over each of these crises.    When the value of the yen against the dollar came close to  100 yen recently, I was as scared as if a guided missile had  been launched against Japan. Japanese high-technology industry  will indeed suffer catastrophic damage from a sudden  appreciation of the yen, as if it had been attacked by a  missile. In February, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen.  Then, it plunged about 20 percent in a very short period of  time. Under such circumstances, our business will not be  viable. The rise of the yen against the dollar is at the root  of the current recession. Of course, this is not the only  cause, but there is no doubt that the strong yen is weighing  considerably against the national economy.    In discussions about the appreciation of the yen, nine  people  out of ten have no doubt that the yen's rise is encouraged by  Japan's trade surplus, and they are generally sticking fast to  their opinion. Is what they say really true?    In September 1985, the dollar was quoted at around 240 yen.  In its trade with the United States, Japan marked a surplus of  11.9 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of that year. When I  met Carla Hills, the then U.S. Trade Representative, toward the  end of 1991, we were just then informed that Japan's trade  surplus with the United States had totaled 11.7 billion dollars  (figure announced at that time by the government) in the third  quarter. And the value of the yen against the dollar was  between 120 and 130. These figures clearly show that the trade  imbalance between Japan and the United States had remained  basically unchanged despite the high appreciation of the yen.    Despite these facts, Director C. Fred Bergsten of the  Institute for International Economics, who is reportedly a  prominent economic brain trustee of U.S. President Bill Clinton,  still reiterates the need for a stronger yen. "International  cooperation, such as the introduction of a reference range, is  needed to promote a rise up to 110 yen, or even up to 100 yen,  in the value of the yen, to bring down Japan's trade surplus,"  Bergstan said, when he came to Tokyo in February 1993 to give a  lecture.    According to his theory, if the yen rises at an annual rate  of one percent against the dollar, Japan's current trade surplus  with the United States will be cut by one billion dollars in two  years. If that is the case, will the surplus decrease by 10  billion dollars, with a 10 percent rise of the yen, which is  equivalent to a fall of the dollar by 10 yen? That cannot be.  Professor Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology is also very emphatic about the necessity of  improving the value of the yen up to 100 yen. How can such a  view remain unchallenged?    It is because all trade statistics have always been valued  in  dollars. If dollars are converted into yen, the quarterly value  of Japan's trade surplus with the United States in 1985 would be  equivalent to some 2.5 trillion yen. This year, the same value  would have dropped to some 1.1 trillion yen. Everyone can read  in newspapers that in other countries, like France or Germany,  trade imbalances are valued in their currencies; that is to say  in French francs or in Deutsche marks. Japan is the only  country using the dollar from beginning to end.  <H5>  `The Yen-Valued World' and `the Dollar-Valued World' </H5>   The French or the German case is just one example. What I  would like to emphasize most is the importance of fact-finding.  People should speak out only after shaping their ideas based on  facts. Let me give one or two more examples.    A famous Japanese economic analyst told me: "In the early  1980s, Japan's national defense spending was criticized as being  too small. However, the attack from other countries gradually  eased in the latter half of the 1980s, thanks to Japan's  efforts. As a result, I also escaped being criticized by  American and European economic analysts, and I could preserve my  honor." So, I asked him, "Did Japan double the number of its  military planes or its warships? Did Japan double the number of  Self-Defense officials?" As a matter of course, that could not  be. What is certain is that in the latter half of the 1980s,  the dollar plunged sharply against the yen, from the 240-yen  level to the 120-yen level, following the Plaza Accord reached  by the Group of Seven in 1985. Therefore, dollar-valued  national defense spending has increased considerably. However,  the rise was more apparent than real.    Although he is a well-known economic analyst, he was unable  to recognize that what had occurred was the result of  exchange-rate magic.    Another example is the gap between domestic and global  prices, which is often taken up for discussion between Japan and  the United States. It is really regrettable to see that there  are so many unsubstantiated arguments that remain unchallenged.    For instance, Mr. Bergsten points out that although Japan  does not impose any import duty on foreign semiconductors, it  raises nontariff barriers equivalent to 107 percent. Where did  he get this data? I found that his argument was based on a  paper written by a Japanese university professor. In his  original text, the professor said that in Japan, a domestic  integrated circuit is about twice the price of a foreign  integrated circuit imported from Taiwan or from a Southeast  Asian country. However, after a thorough investigation, I  discovered that the two integrated circuits mentioned in the  paper were not of the same kind. Mr. Bergsten denounces Japan's  nontariff barriers using incorrect data obtained from such an  improper comparison. His argument is totally irrelevant. With  regard to integrated circuits, Japan is making a great effort to  increase the purchase of foreign products. If we take these  efforts into consideration, it is not too much to say that Japan  is even applying a negative tariff rate on foreign products.    By the way, the price of a haircut is 3,500 or 3,600 yen in  Tokyo. The barber fee has gradually increased since the end of  the war, with the current of the times. This price will not  change even if the dollar falls to 100 yen.    For example, even if the barber can buy a pair of Solingen  clippers for 10,000 yen instead of 12,000 yen, thanks to the  yen's rise, the price of a haircut would never become lower,  because "the yen-valued world" differs from "the dollar-valued  world" in real economy. Despite the difference, I have seen  many comparative lists of commodity prices indicating the barber  fee in New York and the one in Tokyo, by simply converting yen  into dollars or dollars into yen. This is really amazing.    In 1991, Japan's gross national product was about 470  trillion yen. The export-import value amounted to 500-odd  billion dollars, which is equivalent to some 60 trillion yen, at  an exchange rate of 110 yen against the dollar. This represents  less than 20 percent of the gross national product. This means  that the portion that is directly affected by exchange  fluctuations does not even reach 20 percent of the GNP. More  than 80 percent of the GNP corresponds to "the yen-valued world."    With a wise look, some commentators used to base their  argument on "the law of indifference," which I find strange,  when they had to refer to the gap between domestic and global  prices, during debates on the sudden rise of the yen. For  example, let us suppose that a Japanese TV set worth 20,000 yen  was sold at 100 dollars in the United States, when the dollar  was quoted at 240 yen. I believe no one would have found  anything strange about that. However, when the dollar dropped  to 180 yen, people began to put the price gap into question.  This is because if the same TV set continues to be sold at the  same price in the United States, its yen-valued price would fall  to 18,000 yen. There has not been discussion about the gap  between domestic and global prices, since the dollar reached the  180-yen level. However, it does not always follow that the  price gap is caused by the yen's appreciation, since the retail  price could remain unchanged because of the U.S. distribution  system.    There is now a growing call for economic deregulation.  Thanks to various efforts, such as the rationalization of  business routines, the purchasing power parity of the yen  against the dollar, which was more than 400 yen after the end of  the war, has already improved to less than 200 yen. Needless to  say, Japan should continue to make efforts in that direction.  However, I do not want to see Japanese people repeating the  foolish mistake of taking the yen's sudden appreciation for  granted and to accept it without due consideration. The yen's  rise is nothing but a result of a speculative move made by young  speculators. The economic fundamentals of "the yen-valued  world," which corresponds to 80 percent of the national economy,  are almost not affected by exchange fluctuations. As for "the  dollar-valued world," which represents the remaining 20 percent,  even if the value of the yen becomes about 20 percent stronger  against the dollar in a mere six months, it does not mean that  its economic fundamentals will also undergo a similar change.  Such a change is beyond possibility.    We are now living in a period of time when it is not  possible  for our country to stand by itself. Speaking of Japan's  relations with the rest of the world, Japan-U.S. relations are  the most important.    I have stressed for a long time that Japan is like a younger  brother of the United States. After the end of the war, our  brother helped us out of difficulty. One day, we should return  the kindness.    Meanwhile, if we compare the two brothers, we can see that  the United States is rather interested in software. Attracting  many persons of remarkable talent, the United States is already  living in an age of highly advanced information. This is why  the percentage of Americans working for manufacturing industries  is decreasing more and more. According to statistics released  in 1990, only 16.7 percent of the U.S. working population was  employed by a manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, Japan  continues to spend money to buy high-quality software from the  United States. Thanks to its excellent manufacturing  technology, it develops new products from U.S.-made software.  New products are then supplied to the United States.    It seems that the United States has finally begun to  understand this situation. However, discussions between the  two countries are still not going smoothly.    For example, I thought that everything would be resolved  once Japan and the United States reached agreement following  ministerial level bilateral talks, such as meetings between the  Japanese international trade and industry minister or the  Japanese posts and telecommunications minister and the U.S.  secretary of commerce or the U.S. trade representative.  However, things were not so easy.  <H5>  Japan Has a Masochistic Tendency of Self-Condemnation </H5>   There is the problem of increasing Japan's purchase of  foreign semiconductors to more than 20 percent of its market.  This is a striking example showing the discord between the two  countries. The text of the new U.S.-Japan Semiconductor  Agreement states that the Japanese Government "recognizes that  the U.S. semiconductor industry expects foreign-made chips to  gain more than a 20 percent share of the Japanese market by the  end of 1992." However, the text also says clearly, "Both  governments agreed that this numerical target does not  constitute a guarantee, a ceiling, or a floor."    Despite the contents of the agreement, once the  semiconductor  issue comes to the fore, Americans get excited and start talking  about penalties in the case of failure to meet the target.    Although there are only a few Japan-bashers among U.S.  congressmen, when the matter becomes serious, the United States  has a tendency to resort to punishment, even if there is no  basis for it. The Japanese Government as well as the Japanese  news media should become more conscious of this. They should  tell people the truth, by calling what is right, right, and what  is wrong, wrong.    I do not know why, but Japanese people have a masochistic  tendency to immediately take the blame before even trying to  ascertain the truth, when they are severely criticized by people  of other countries. Moreover, Japanese people have another  strange mentality: they are strongly inclined to believe more in  press reports dispatched from abroad by a Japanese correspondent  than those compiled by journalists based in Japan.    Japan should not let the United States speak as it likes. On  the contrary, it should answer back in the same way. In certain  cases, it should be prepared to speak out twice as much as the  United States; otherwise it will not be able to face this  country which speaks in a loud voice. Frankly speaking, what  the United States is doing now is like saying, "You buy this,  you buy that," with a gun in one hand. In the case of  semiconductors, the United States has hinted at revival of the  Super 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade act, if the targeted 20  percent market share is not achieved. The way the United State  speaks can be seen as if it wants to intimidate Japan into  submission.    To begin with, the United States should understand that  marketing is an absorptive phenomenon. It is not because a  trader has tried hard to intrude an article upon consumers so  that he will find a big market for it. People will never buy  articles that do not meet their needs. The desire to buy should  come first.    Now, people often use the word "symbiosis." Among different  antagonistic parties, which are the two parties which must live  together in symbiosis? This should be the most important point,  when we think of symbiosis. The confrontation between producers  and consumers is never put in question on the occasion of  international trade disputes. It is the antagonism between  producers of different countries that is always at issue.  Consumers are completely neglected during trade negotiations.    European and American business leaders say that Japanese  people work too hard. They criticize Japan's ratio of labor  income distribution. They also point out that Japanese  companies have a low pay-out ratio. However, it is not proper  to overreact to these comments by European and American business  leaders, without having a critical mind. The pay-out ratio  increases considerably when companies suffer a decline in profit  due to a recession. This is quite natural because companies  continue to pay dividends, despite the decrease in profit.  instead of raising or lowering the dividend at once, Japanese  management makes it a practice to increase the dividend  gradually, so that it can maintain the level even in case of a  decline in profit. Stability is very important in Japanese  management. It is very bad if Japanese people are unable to  give a clear explanation like this.    As for the ratio of labor income distribution, it is true  that there is a gap between Japan and the United States. The  U.S. ratio is about 80-81 percent, while Japan's ratio is around  76-77 percent. Japan still has to invest considerably in plants  and equipment, since it is still based on manufacturing  industry. Meanwhile the United States, where the service  industry is already predominant, has no need to spend so much  money on plants and facilities. If someone wants to comment on  Japan's ratio of labor income distribution, he should make a  proper comparison of the two countries, as I did.    How can two antagonistic groups coexist? This is the idea of  symbiosis. For example, we can say that parents and children  live together in symbiosis, since there is always a certain  antagonism between them. Although they have a different sense  of values, they try to overcome the gap to live together happily.    Professor William G. Ouchi of the United States has tried  to clarify Japanese management methods by comparing two types of  companies; Type A companies versus Type Z companies. Type A is  a typical company with top-down decisionmaking. Type Z is a  company having a participative approach to decisionmaking: it  tries to reach a consensus by listening to what people of minor  positions say. Originally, Japanese companies had the same  characteristics as Type Z companies. However, they have now  changed a little bit because the lifetime employment system is  transforming to what I call a "continued employment system." In  terms of employment, Japanese companies have become less stable  due to an increase in the employee turnover rate: instead of  hiring only new graduates, as they did previously, Japanese  companies have begun to take experienced hands into service.  However, Japanese companies are still more steady than the Type  A companies of the United States.    We are introducing favorable management methods from the  United States, while keeping what is good in our management.    For instance, under the Japanese system of lifelong job  rotation, personnel changes used to be made in an arbitrary  manner. Today, many Japanese companies are asking their  employees if they have a request, so that they can reflect their  wishes as much as possible on the occasion of their job  rotation. As for NEC, we have adopted a U.S. review system  under which all employees will be appraised according to their  achievements, and not according to the amount of hours they have  spent on the job.  <H5>  The Japanese Economy Suffers From Second-Stage Cancer </H5>   If we compare the current economic situation to a cancer, we  can say that there are already many symptoms showing that the  cancerous growth has entered its second stage. I think the  national economy got cancer toward the end of 1992. On 28  August 1992, the previous government announced a package of  economic-stimulus measures worth 10.7 trillion yen. It had to  convene an extraordinary Diet session from the end of September  through October to pass a supplementary budget so that the  package would be implemented as soon as possible to maximize its  pump-priming effect; otherwise "pure water," or real government  spending, would have become smaller than the mentioned figure.  Unfortunately, for several reasons, the convocation of the  extraordinary Diet session was put off from day to day. It was  around 10 December that the Diet finally passed a supplementary  budget to finance the program. The impact of the long-awaited  pump-priming package was weakened because of this delay.    At that time, I was already stressing the need for income  tax  cuts in addition to building up a counter argument against the  tenacious view that the issue of deficit-financing bonds should  be absolutely avoided.    Basically, the Government should not issue bonds to cover  the  budget deficit. This is a matter of common sense. For  instance, if we do not have enough money to wine and dine, it is  not good to borrow money for that. But taking another view, let  us suppose that you get cancer. Your doctor tells you that it  is still operable because it was detected in its early stages.  But for that, you will have to pay one million yen. In such a  case, you should try to recover your health, even by borrowing  money from your friends or obtaining a loan from your company,  because cancer can be cured if spotted early enough thanks to  the power of contemporary medical science. If the surgical  operation is delayed, your cancer will enter its second and  third stages. The doctor's fee will run up even higher and you  may still die in the end. No one will be able to bring you back  to life. Toward the end of 1992, I was strongly calling for a  quick remedy to recover the national economy, by comparing the  current recession with cancer.    With respect to income tax cuts, I said "some 100,000 yen  per  household." I proposed an income tax reduction worth 3 or 4  trillion yen. As a matter of course, income tax cuts of this  scale are not sufficient to prop up a sluggish economy. I added  that we should also make efforts to create a better atmosphere  to induce people to spend money. For example, if consumers  begin to feel that the employment situation will not become  worse, that they will be able to return their housing loan  somehow, and that the economy has now bottomed out, they will  certainly spend 70,000 to 80,000 yen out of the 100,000 yen they  receive from income tax cuts. However, if the surrounding  atmosphere remains gloomy, after spending 10,000 or 20,000 yen,  consumers would prefer to put the remaining money in a bank.    After all, economic performance is highly influenced by  social psychology. In other words, it is a question of  thinking. Therefore, I said that a reduction in income tax of  100,000 yen per household would be effective if a package of  other measures, such as a cut in interest rates, a revision of  the capital gains tax, and the bolstering of the stock price of  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, is implemented at  the same time.    Initially, the government predicted that the GNP would grow  at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in fiscal 1992. In the middle  of the year, it revised the figure to 1.6 percent. By the end  of the fiscal year, it announced a 0.8 percent growth. Last  year, Japan's economy shrank by 0.4 percent (later, the figure  was revised to 0.6 percent) during the July-September period  compared with the previous quarter. The government reported the  drop in the GNP only at the beginning of December 1992. It  means that it needed more than one month to make such an  important announcement.    This is incredible, and no one has taken the blame. As  for us, we must take the responsibility as company executives  for even a small decline in profits. For instance, in the case  of NEC, it was decided to cut the bonus of each executive by 25  percent. If necessary, a further reduction will have to be  implemented.    Company executives make sure to take the blame for what they  have done, because they are entrusted by stockholders.    Frankly speaking, the government policies adopted until now  were wrong. It is all right if the government believes that  deficit-covering bonds are unnecessary. It is good if the  government thinks there is no need for income tax cuts. The  only point I would like to stress is that the government should  take the responsibility for that.  <H5>  Now Is the Very Moment To Carry Out Currency Reform </H5>   When I attended a meeting of the Advisory Group for Economic  Restructuring [a private advisory panel to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa] some time ago, I spoke with Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura about what the administration  should be doing. I told him that the government should first  set a target. I explained that administration is needed to help  people reach a goal. I also added that administration becomes  impossible where there is no target. For instance, the  government should first say, "This year, the targeted economic  growth rate is such and such." How can we work out an economic  policy without fixing a target?    First of all, I want government officials to become more  aware of the importance of setting a target. With regard to  public investment, which has always been considered the  centerpiece of an economic-stimulus package, I would like to ask  government officials to come up with a well-balanced program.  Here, the word "well-balanced" especially means that public  works spending should concentrate mostly on projects that meet  the needs of the times.    I am not against the idea of appropriating public works  spending for the construction of bridges. Public works used to  be the symbol of destruction and reproduction, workers are  digging in and filling in the ground over and over again." I  think we should try to improve this image of public works by  introducing the idea of new social infrastructures that meet the  needs of the times.    I have been stressing the importance of improving social  infrastructures in consumer-oriented areas. The previous  pump-priming package, which was worth 13.2 trillion yen and was  adopted in April 1993, called for fiscal spending to expand and  improve new social infrastructures. A supplementary budget  passed the Diet on 10 June 1993, to finance stimulus measures.  I hope that the idea of new social infrastructures will be  reflected also in the budget for fiscal 1994.    For instance, improvement of administrative information  systems based on computer networks should always be included in  public works spending from now on. Until now, public works were  concentrated mostly on projects to construct state-owned  facilities or such infrastructures as bridges and roads.  However, if the situation remains unchanged, we can no longer  meet the needs of the times, as we are now living in an age of  an information revolution.    In December 1991 when he was still a senator, Vice President  Al Gore proposed a bill, which was enacted later by  then-President George Bush as the "High-Performance Computing  Act." Now, on 15 September 1993, the U.S. Government announced  a project called the "National Information Infrastructure  Program," which is to be promoted by a special task force headed  by the secretary of commerce, and comprising officials of the  Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Health and  Human Services, and directors of such institutions as the  Technology Standards Institute. Japan will not be able to keep  pace with the times if the government does not seriously tackle  the question of the growing importance of information from now  on. The government should compile the budget for the next  fiscal year keeping in mind the key point that we are living in  the information age. In addition to income tax cuts and public  spending emphasizing the improvement of new social  infrastructures, we need one more measure, which would have a  special impact on the economy. I propose that the government  carry out currency reform.    Many people are strongly opposed to currency reform, saying  the government should not implement such a costly measure while  the national economy is still sluggish. On the contrary, I  rather say the government must spend money, more aggressively to  some extent, especially because of the recession. Although the  national economy remains weak, it does not mean that Japan has  no money at all. So why not spend it? In Japan, postal savings  alone amount to 170 trillion yen in total. Moreover, it  reportedly shows an annual increase of 10-odd trillion yen. If  we add other personal savings as well as corporate savings, the  total amount would reach 1 quadrillion yen.    There are calls for investment tax cuts. However, I do not  think this measure is immediately necessary, because companies  will not invest as long as there is no demand. They will start  to invest only when there is every indication that individual  consumption will pick up. Investment tax cuts will be helpful  once there is an upward trend in demand.    Currency reform would help create new special demand. Some  people even say that it would have an economic impact worth just  under 5 trillion yen. As for the cost needed for currency  redenomination, the implementation of tax cuts for the sake of  policy would be one way to finance one part of the total cost.    Currency reform will help invigorate the stock market.  Stock prices will more or less tend to go upward thanks to  redenomination. This is not the only merit of currency reform.  I hesitate a little bit to speak about the other advantage,  because people might say, "Every miller draws water to his own  mill." But anyway, I would like to point out that if people see  a sector hit hard by the recession, like our software industry,  regaining strength thanks to currency reform, it would have a  big psychological impact. Employment destabilization is now a  big problem. It the employment situation becomes more stable,  consumers will decide to spend more money. Some people often  say that consumers spend less money because there is nothing new  to buy. However, I do not think so. In the past, for instance,  there was a period of time when consumers used to have two or  three cameras at home. Individual consumption is highly  influenced by psychological factors derived from the economic  trend.    One more advantage is that by improving the prestige of the  yen, the currency reform might help halt the unjustified attempt  by the United States to encourage a further appreciation of the  yen against the dollar. I do not know why, but since around  1987, Professor Lester C. Thurow has been reiterating that the  value of the yen against the dollar should be 95 yen.    Let us suppose that the dollar drops to 95 yen. If the  Japanese Government carries out currency reform, one dollar will  be worth 0.95 new yen. Such a situation would probably be  inadmissible for a proud country like the United States. I do  not say that the appropriate value of the yen against the dollar  is 100 yen. However, currency redenomination would prove  significant, if it helps avoid at least a further appreciation  of the yen above the 100-yen mark.    For the moment, I do not feel a strong will to invigorate  the  national economy on the part of the government. People  attribute the current recession to the speculative bubble  economy, to the sudden appreciation of the yen against the  dollar, to cyclical fluctuations, etc. These opinions might be  true. However, what is more important is to take the necessary  actions. Unfortunately, it seems the government has no  intention of making efforts to improve the current situation.    Politicians may be too occupied with political reform to  think about the economy. However, that should not be the case  for government officials who, unlike politicians, do not have to  run in an election. I want government officials to show a  strong will to help the economy recover, because it is time to  compile the budget for the next fiscal year; otherwise, the  national economy will never be revived. There is still a  feeling that the economy will take a favorable turn by itself,  even leaving the recession as it is, or that the economic  climate will soon improve little by little since we have already  suffered hardships for so long. Unfortunately, the current  situation no longer allows the entertaining of such an  optimistic view.    "The government should not issue deficit-covering bonds,  which would weigh upon public finances until the days of our  grandchildren." If there are people who continue to say this, at  a time when we should concentrate on the urgent question of how  to pull ourselves out of the current difficulty, I should say  that they are really dreamers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>   [Text] Hundreds of workers serving in the ANC are to be  retrenched as part of an elaborate reorganization of the party.    The ANC currently has about 1,200 employees in its service.  BEELD has been informed that the party intends trimming down  full time staff to less than 100.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said at a  news conference that the reorganization of the ANC will come  into effect form 1 October.  ?? Among others things the ANC's 14 regions will be reduced to  the nine provinces, and the ANC's departments will be reduced to  six departments.    The department responsible for MK [Spear of the Nation --  ANC  military wing], for instance, will be disbanded.    Mr. Ramaphosa said those workers who will be dismissed will  get settlement packages retroactive from July this year. "They  are good packages."    He said the ANC has not yet determined how many posts there  will be after the reorganization. He mentioned as an example  that the ANC currently has 13 drivers, but after reorganization  there will be only four.    All posts will be advertised and preference will be given to  the retrenched workers who apply for the posts.    BEELD has been told that the ANC intends to bring salaries  for the posts on par with those earned by MP's. There have been  many complaints among ANC members whose contention was that  "they had made the same sacrifices in the liberation struggle,  and yet they were earning far less than ANC members elected to  Parliament."    -- The ANC has a big problem in many of its regions with  debt  accrued during the run-up to the election. The ANC is looking  at "creative methods for handling the debt."    -- The ANC's head office remains at Shell House in  Johannesburg. The organization will, however, now occupy  considerably less office space. The ANC is to start a  "sub-office" in Cape Town.    -- The ANC wants to extend its ties with the South African  Communist Party, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade  Unions], the broader democratic movement and community  organizations, and will ensure that it remains their undisputed  leader.    -- The ANC's national conference, at which a new national  executive committee is to be elected, will be held from 17 to 22  December.    -- The ANC's national working committee of 26 people is to  be  expanded to also include cabinet members, deputy ministers, and  provincial premiers who had not been members of the working  committee up to now.</p>

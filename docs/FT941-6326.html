			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Bigger burden for a stronger man: India is taking a calculated gamble on growth to offset undemanding borrowing targets India this week altered course on the road to economic reform, abandoning the tough fiscal path it has tried to follow for the past three years, in favour of gradual structural change combined with acceptance of large fiscal deficits. While the aim of increasing growth through economic liberalisation remains the same, Mr Manmohan Singh, the scholarly finance minister, signalled in Monday's budget that he and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, prefer to bypass difficulties rather than confront them. They may get away with it for a while but they could be storing up problems for the future. The two have chosen to tolerate a higher level of public borrowing than they deemed acceptable even a year ago. They have tacitly admitted that the government, with its vast web of bureaucracy and state-owned industry, its coils of patronage, its subsidies and corruption is too big an animal to be tamed quickly. They are gambling that the measures already taken since they embarked on reform in mid-1991 will be enough to create space for domestic enterprise to grow and prosper. If they are right, then India will have shown the world how to restructure a socialist-style economy with a minimum of dislocation. If they are wrong, they risk sending the country back down a vicious circle of mounting debt, rising inflation and declining growth. It is possible for Mr Rao and Mr Singh to succeed: there is growing confidence in India among domestic and foreign businessmen; foreign exchange reserves are at record levels; and after six good harvests in succession, farmers are content. But the decision to take a relaxed attitude to public borrowing will make the country more vulnerable to external shocks such as a jump in world interest rates or oil prices, or a bad monsoon. Any of these could spark a surge in inflation, which is already uncomfortably high, running at 8.2 per cent a year after a recent low of 7 per cent. And no Indian government can tolerate high inflation for long, given the devastating effects of rising prices on the poor. Mr Singh presented his budget as a calculated economic risk. The truth is that the calculation is as much political as economic. The ruling Congress (I) party faces several state elections over the next year, culminating in a general election which must be held by mid-1996 but could be held earlier if the prime minister wishes. A tough budget risked losing votes. As Mr Tapan Dasgupta, a leading economic commentator, says: 'This budget is the political price for doing reform in a democracy.' Over the past year, there have been many indications that the government was relaxing curbs on borrowing - the religious unrest which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992 brought unexpected policing bills; it also hit trade, reducing customs and indirect tax revenues. Nevertheless, Monday's public borrowing figures came as a surprise. Mr Singh disclosed the fiscal deficit for the year ending March 1994 would reach 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product - compared with a target of 4.7 per cent. Moreover, the finance minister set an undemanding target of 6 per cent for the 1994-95 financial year. The government is further distancing itself from the aim it espoused in 1991 of cutting public spending in order to free resources for private enterprise. These cuts were a condition of the emergency loan India secured from the International Monetary Fund in order to stave off default in a balance of payments crisis. In practice, the government reduced the fiscal deficit greatly only in the first year after getting the loan from 8.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent of GDP - and the deficit has been creeping up ever since. Mr Singh is now trying a different tack - he hopes that the economy will grow, so the size of public borrowing in proportion to the economy will shrink, even if it does not fall in absolute terms. The stone will be as large as it was, but the man carrying it will be stronger. To help stimulate growth, Mr Singh has included in his budget more measures designed to mobilise the resources of private enterprise - and to encourage businesses to become more competitive with foreign companies. Deregulation remains a central feature of government policy. As in previous years, customs duties are being cut - from a peak rate of 85 per cent to 65 per cent. Duties on capital goods and materials, including steel, are being reduced sharply to encourage industry to invest in world-class plants. Indirect taxes are being pruned to reduce their complexity and generate more competition. Corporate tax rates are coming down - as is the income tax burden on consumers, to help boost demand. Industrialists hailed the budget for its emphasis on growth. 'It's a great budget for industry,' said Mr Tarun Das, secretary-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the employers' body. Mr Singh has some good reasons for feeling positive about achieving his target of increasing growth from an estimated 4 per cent this year to 5-6 per cent in 1994-95. After almost three years of slowdown induced by the 1991 financial crisis, industry is staging a belated revival. Industrial output rose only 1.6 per cent in the first half of 1993-94, weighed down by the weak performance of heavy engineering and other sectors dependent on government orders such as telecommunications. But consumer goods companies, including vehicle and electronics manufacturers, are making significant advances in output. Exports soared 21 per cent in the 10 months to the end of January. Moreover, India is attracting record amounts of foreign capital. An estimated Dollars 3bn will flow into the country in the year to the end of March 1993 - up from Dollars 585m in 1992-93. The total includes direct investment, foreign portfolio investment and overseas capital issues by Indian companies. These inflows have given India a good cushion against external shocks - Dollars 13bn in foreign exchange reserves, enough for more than six months of imports. 'It is these reserves which have allowed Mr Singh to present the budget that he has,' says Mr S L Rao, director of the NCAER, an independent economics think-tank. However the government's hopes could still be dashed if it neglects either its own housekeeping or reform. The most immediate concern is that public borrowing could rise further. 'Borrowing is out of control,' says Mr Dasgupta, 'How can those who have let it go bring it back under control?' The pressures for wasteful spending - for subsidies and hand-outs - will increase the closer the government gets to a general election. A more radical approach would have been to step up and extend the half-hearted privatisation programme. India has gone some way towards forcing a shake-up of its private sector by exposing it to foreign competition. But the government has baulked at a similar transformation of the public sector. It is, at least, selling shares in profitable state-owned enterprises, including the State Bank of India, the largest commercial bank, and the national oil corporations. But sales are expected to be a mere Rs25bn (Dollars 797m) in 1992-93 and perhaps Rs40bn next year. Mr Rao, of the NCAER, says the buoyant stock market could absorb Rs300bn a year. 'So much more could be done with privatisation. It might produce demonstrations in the streets. But so what? The government is too cautious.' Similarly, there is little indication in the budget that the government will tackle another sacred cow of pre-1991 India - a virtual ban on compulsory redundancy, which many potential foreign investors see as an obstacle. Mr Manmohan Singh and his colleagues deny that they are going slow on reform. They point to the many useful measures in the budget and to other non-budget measures in the pipeline such as liberalisation of the insurance industry and of telecommunications. But it is difficult to avoid the impression that they are now making progress largely in directions which do not require much blood, sweat or tears. As Mr Rao, of the NCAER says: 'In restructuring, there's no gain without pain. This government seems to believe differently.'</p>

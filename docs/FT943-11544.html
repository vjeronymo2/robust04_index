			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Improved trading behind 46% advance to Pounds 3.2m at Admiral Improved trading conditions and continued emphasis on careful management helped Admiral, the Surrey-based computing services company, lift pre-tax profits by 46 per cent from Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 3.2m in the six months to June 30. Shares rose 30p to a new high of 610p. Turnover was 39 per cent higher at Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 17.7m). Earnings per share improved by the same percentage to 18.5p (13.3p) and the interim dividend goes up 25 per cent to 2.5p. The group, which specialises in consultancy, training and software, has consistently improved sales and profits through the recession and continues to recruit steadily. Staff numbers total 854, 30 per cent higher than last year. Cash amounted to Pounds 3.9m, down from Pounds 5.5m 12 months earlier because of acquisitions, including The Training Centre, purchased in February to strengthen computer training operations, and Sumlock Legal and products from Hay Logic, which together formed a new company, Admiral Legal Systems. Stripping out the contribution from purchases, turnover jumped 30 per cent and operating profits 40 per cent. Mr Clay Brendish, co-founder and chairman, attributed the performance to a strong and continuing relationship with existing customers. The Singapore and Australian subsidiaries were on their way to achieving critical mass and the company was seeking to expand through acquisition in mainland Europe. He added: 'The second half has started well for all our operating companies. The signs are that the economy will continue to strengthen'. Admiral tends to perform uniformly across the year, suggesting full year pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 6.5m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jaba Ioseliani, head of the </F> Georgian delegation at the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva,  by an unidentified correspondent; date not given -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Ioseliani] There are no results. There is a lot of  argument. The formula for the deployment of UN troops in  Abkhazia changed four times. In effect, the Abkhazians do not  want troops to be deployed to allow the refugees and displaced  people to return home. They are playing a cat-and-mouse game  with us. They want to accept a minimum number of people, very  few people.    The talks were about military aspects. They should have  discussed how and where UN troops were to be deployed. However,  the Abkhazians had devised their plans with the knowledge that  unless troops are deployed, the refugees will not return. So,  when we agree to something they want, they come up with new  demands. In a word, they do not want it to go ahead.    Pressure on them can only be applied by the Russians. There  can be no pressure from the United Nations. The rule is that  everybody should sign the agreement. Troops cannot be deployed  unless there is mutual consent. What can we do when they do not  agree? We cannot impose it upon them by force, can we? The  Russian delegation seems to have taken some steps, however,  there is no final result yet.    There is a fourth formula. Our representative, General  Vladimir Chikovani, is taking this formula to Tbilisi today.  Let us see what happens. Batoni [Georgian polite form of  address] Eduard Shevardnadze will see it. Perhaps consultations  will be held about it. We will act in accordance with what they  decide in Tbilisi. But it is a rather complicated formula.    At the same time, there is a formula envisaging CIS  involvement. We were told by the Russians, by General Georgiy  Kondratyev: Forget them. You see, nothing works out with them,  the Americans. We will establish order in Abkhazia in three  days. I do not know, but this is what they are saying.    The United Nations is really a bureaucratic and retrograde  organization. The United Nations say: We have no right to do  this and that, we have no rights at all. I told them: If you  have no rights, we do not need your ornamental presence there.    They want to do the job wearing white gloves, but nothing  can  be done wearing white gloves.    [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, what about Abkhazia's status?    [Ioseliani] This will be discussed on 19 April. But if we  fail to solve this problem here, how can there be any talk about  the status of Abkhazia. What is the need for a status when the  issue of the refugees and the deployment of troops has not been  solved?    So, we will act according to the will of the authorities,  the  people and Supreme Council.    [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, does Russia have a concrete  plan?    [Ioseliani] Russia agreed to our plan. When we produced it  on the first day of talks, both the United Nations and Russia  welcomed it, saying it was a businesslike and good plan.  However, on the second day they said that the Abkhazians  disagreed. What could we do if they disagreed? All right, we  made concessions. They did not agree to the third formula  either, and we are now discussing a fourth formula today.    There will be no end to new formulas because, in effect,  they  are against the deployment. They want just a minimum number,  about 5,000 [as received] troops to be deployed at this stage.  It will not work that way.    [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when the Russians ask us to let  them in and promise to establish order in three days, what do  they mean and what is their plan?    [Ioseliani] They are saying two parties should be involved.  They or the CIS should be involved.    They asked me if we wanted the Ukrainians, on behalf of the  CIS, and the Turks to be deployed there together. I told them  that we did not want the Turks, but if it is the Ukrainians,  then all right.    They do not want to act alone and be blamed for anything.  They want to be peacemakers in the eyes of the world. [passage  indistinct] They want either the CIS to be involved, or the  United Nations. Then there will be UN observers. If this does  not work, let it be a two-party thing, they say.    They say: It is not a problem at all to make two airborne  landings and finish it off. We will establish order in three  days.    [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when will this round of talks  finish? And also, did we achieve any goals or not?    [Ioseliani] [Words indistinct] I personally think that the  Abkhazians will not agree to anything. They will only  agree...[pauses] They are now having their heads turned by  victory, so they will not agree to anything. Until you hit them  in the head and do something to them...[pauses] People are like  that -- if everything goes unpunished, they carry on doing it.    Nevertheless, we won and they lost the information war. All  countries support us, the United Nations supports us, the  Russians, in fact, also support us. However, this is only  verbal support. When it comes to the crunch...[pauses] All  right, it is a matter of money.    The United States promised money but it has not been  allocated so far. Then, countries will have to gain the  agreement of their parliaments to send troops. Then, a force  has to be set up. Then, their rights have to be determined.  Unless they are attacked, peacekeepers have little freedom of  action. They just carry out a policing function. [passage  indistinct]    We have influenced world public opinion to believe that we  are right and that our territorial integrity is necessary. And  now, if we can do it, even if we burn and scorch everything  there [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] Are you in favor of a peaceful or military  solution?    [Ioseliani] Of course, I am in favor of a peaceful solution.  But I doubt that it is possible because unless they feel some  pressure, the Abkhazians will not budge. If the Russians allow  us to do it, if the Russians do not resist us, then my  Mkhedrioni [special militia] will be enough to deal with them.    I told the Russians: Leave us alone, do not interfere, and I  will show you what kind of people the Abkhazians are. If the  Russians cannot allow this to happen, then they should deal with  the problem themselves.    Let the United Nations do its business gradually. After it  solves organizational issues in three or four months, then it  will send troops and do whatever it likes. But before the  United Nations does it...[pauses] I do not think we should say  no to the United Nations. Let the United Nations do its  business. Meanwhile, we will turn to Russia and the CIS. But  this should happen under UN auspices. When UN troops are ready,  they can be deployed.    If not, may the Russians leave us alone and we will deal  with  the Abkhazians. This is my answer.    [Correspondent] If the peace talks are not successful, do  you  think that there is a chance for us to win in the war?    [Ioseliani] If the Russians do not interfere, of course,  there is. The Mkhedrioni alone is enough to deal with them,  provided the Russians do not interfere.</p>

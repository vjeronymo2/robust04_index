A Foreign Office spokesman told reporters in Islamabad today  that Pakistan has taken notice of Indian Foreign Secretary J.N.  Dixit's statement that the presentation of Indian proposals on  Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek, and nuclear  nonproliferation will depend on Pakistan's response to holding  the next round of foreign secretary-level talks. The spokesman  said that during his stay in Islamabad, Dixit pledged that  proposals on these issues will be submitted within two weeks.  But the Indian foreign secretary said at a news briefing  yesterday that the presentation of Indian proposals will depend  on Pakistan's response to holding the next round of talks  between foreign secretaries within four months. The spokesman  said all these problems -- Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek,  nuclear proliferation, and Kashmir -- were created by India. He  added that if India puts forward proposals to solve the problems  that it has created, how can this be described as a liberal  concession to Pakistan? The spokesman said the latest Indian  statements confirm Pakistan's view that India has remained  intransigent on the core issue of Kashmir.    Answering a question, the spokesman said that Pakistan will  consider how and when to raise the Kashmir issue at the United  Nations in light of the outcome of the India-Pakistan talks.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Sport: Surfing close to the edge in ski goggles - Sailing With half the contest over, the 32,000-mile Whitbread race is turning into a battle between two yachts and two very different skippers. Intrum Justitia, the European entry helmed by British sailor Lawrie Smith, leads the Japanese / New Zealand team aboard Tokio by around 20 miles. Chris Dickson, Tokio's highly competitive skipper, predicted before leaving Auckland last Sunday that Intrum was the boat they would be watchful of, once the fleet hit the big winds of the Southern Ocean. So it proved. Tokio led the celebratory waltz out of Dickson's home port. But when the strong breezes came on the second day at sea Intrum blasted through, covering 400-plus miles in a one-day run while still off the coast of New Zealand. Before the advent of the water-ballasted W60 class, such distances were achieved only by the biggest maxi-yachts in the most extreme conditions. What interests most observers, not least Chris Dickson, is what makes Intrum such a flier? Both Intrum and Tokio (plus another five boats in the 10-strong W60 fleet) are designed by Bruce Farr. The differences between the two are tiny, although Intrum does have the steering positions so far aft that the helmsman is practically standing on the transom. In the extreme running and reaching conditions below 50' south, when the bow wave starts at the mast and dumps straight back into the cockpit, the man at the wheel wants to be as far from the action as possible. Even so, it is essential to wear ski goggles and a mouth and nose mask designed for motocross motor cyclists to be able to breathe through the blizzard of icy spray. Nevertheless, Dickson says it is not mechanics that give the advantage. Dickson believes these are minor technical points. 'Sure they've got a fast car but so have we. They've got some excellent helmsmen who are totally fearless. Driving at night on an icy road, they've just got the pedal on the floor. Every time it blows 50 knots they're taking miles out of us.' Dickson has spent some of the four-week stop in his home town pondering how hard he wants to pound his yacht and crew. 'It's dark. You're crawling around the deck because the vibration makes it impossible to stand. The bow wave starts at the mast and the solid part comes straight back into the cockpit. You're off the top of one wave and into the middle of the next. Something inside me says we shouldn't have the spinnaker up,' mused Dickson. So he makes the prudent choice and the kite comes down. 'Unfortunately the next morning someone like Intrum has kept theirs up and gained 20 miles,' continued Dickson. 'Then I go against all my instincts and put ours back up. You're beyond the edge of control and it's a difficult decision.' New records for 24-hour runs have been set by Intrum, piling sail on as the gales build. South of Tasmania in the third leg Intrum went from back marker to leader in a day by sailing ahead of a fierce storm with spinnaker and full mainsail set. 'We decided to push ourselves through the storm,' said Intrum's navigator Marcel van Triest. 'It took tremendous crew work and guts but we sailed past four boats to find ourselves in the lead.' Halfway through the race, Dickson believes his 17-hour overall lead has been built on a 'safety first' approach. But he doubts that such a policy will keep the pursuing fleet at bay for much longer. 'In the heavy air down south we've been erring towards safety and seamanship. We've got to think again about that,' he said. Smith, who can be as flamboyant and devilish as Dickson is calm, ascribes Tokio's lead to a secret weapon. Smith left Auckland convinced that Tokio had a few unorthodox sails in her inventory. 'At certain angles, close fetching, Dickson is faster than anyone in the W60 fleet. It's between 10 and 20 knots of breeze that the advantage comes in,' said Smith. 'He's obviously able to put up a sail that we just don't have. Whether it's legal or not I don't know.' Forty-eight hours before the re-start Smith had sent Swedish watch leader Gunnar Krantz to the airport with a one-way ticket to Stockholm. 'We weren't getting on very well, so it's best that he left,' said Smith. Krantz was one of the original Intrum Justitia crew recruited by Roger Nilsson, whom Smith replaced at the Punta del Este stopover. Dutch helmsman Marco Constant, 33, has taken Krantz's berth. He sailed aboard Atlantic Privateer in the 1985 - 86 Whitbread. Krantz may have bumped into Irish sailor Joe English at the departures lounge. Dickson said English was leaving the Tokio project 'for personal reasons'. Around the waterfront bars the story was different. Crew mates said Dickson and English disagreed over how far to push the boat downwind. His place has gone to Californian helmsman Peter Heck. Dickson has raced with him on the ultimate downwind speed machines, the 70ft Santa Cruz sleds. The underlying message of this is clear. To get the best out of the W60s in heavy air requires at least half the crew to be outstanding, even world class, helmsmen. They must also be happy to work standing in front of a fire hose.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to the Assembly of </F> the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo on 28 March --  live]    [Text] Esteemed Deputies: [words indistinct] that this  session of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina will have the  significance of a political event that will lead us into  qualitative [word indistinct] of the struggle against aggression  and the new stage of the peace process, as well as a new period  of life.    The agreements reached in Washington have already yielded  the  first effects -- first of all, on the fields in central Bosnia,  Herzegovina, and other regions mostly populated by Bosniaks and  Croats. One of the results of the Washington agreement is this  Assembly session, which is competent to verify the agreements  and consistently implement them.    Many and partly contradictory assessments have already been  made about the agreement by domestic and world politicians,  journalists, and other observers. These assessments range from  the extremely positive and optimistic, which see the agreements  as an historic turning point in the solving of the crisis in the  former Yugoslavia, to the negative and pessimistic, which see  the agreement as just one more paper that will not bring any  essential change to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I  think that at this moment one should not waste much time or  effort on seeking and assessing attributes by which the  agreements will be qualified.    Put simply, with this agreement, a very important step has  been made toward a permanent and just solution to the situation  in which our country finds itself. A realistic concept has been  defined and certain prerequisites for implementing it have been  ensured. However, it will be possible to assess objectively the  significance and value of the work done in Washington only when  the full effects of the agreement are seen. It is not the time  for euphoria or pessimism, but for extremely serious,  responsible, and intensive work on implementing the agreement  and seeking the solutions for those questions that the  agreements have left open.    There are many valid reasons for reaching the agreements and  I will present only several of the most important ones.    First, these agreements represent a basis for the speedy  establishment of peace and the normalization of the situation,  above all in those regions populated mostly by the Bosniak and  Croatian people and open the door to the so-called Serbian side;  they therefore present the possibility of a permanent and just  political solution for the entire territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Second, these agreements represent a defeat for the strategy  of the Serbian aggressor, who in fact reckoned on the rift  between the Bosniaks and the Croats and who profited most from  the incitement of the conflict. By overcoming the conflict,  reaching the agreements and implementing them, one creates an  extremely important strategic balance, which significantly  reduces the room for maneuver of the extremist and aggressive  Serbian nationalism, thereby rendering the project of a Greater  Serbia historically without prospects.    Third, [words indistinct] a significant step toward  annulling  the consequences of ethnic cleansing, because by adopting them  one creates the political and legal prerequisites for the return  of the refugees and displaced people to their homes, and by  implementing them one ensures the realistic conditions for this.    Fourth, in realizing these agreements one relatively quickly  opens the road for forming links with the Western world, above  all through the status of associate member of the European  Union, if we manage this, and with NATO within the Partnership  for Peace. One does not need much political wisdom or knowledge  to appreciate the importance of this prospect, so the chance  should not be missed.    Fifth, the war devastation has had catastrophic consequences  and the removal or recovery of these requires huge resources.  Without the help of the developed world, the process of  renewal, reconstruction, and development is almost unimaginable.    The concluded agreements and their implementation will  render much more realistic our chances to receive the justly  expected help. Finally, these agreements have been fully  endorsed by the United States, the European Union, and many  countries and international organizations.    This support is not only of a theoretical and verbal nature,  but expresses a readiness to guarantee the agreements and to  support their implementation with concrete measures and  instruments, including the appropriate arrangements with the  peacekeeping forces.    We therefore have the right to expect from the international  community, and above all the United States, to do what is  necessary to implement the project made with their support and  help. Therefore, these are some of the more important reasons  and goals that we had in mind when we concluded the Washington  Agreement.    Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, allow me briefly to say  something about some sections that go to make up the package of  agreements, that is, the constitutional project of the  federation, the preliminary agreement on the principles of the  future confederation, the arrangement concerning the right of  the Republic of Croatia to cross the Neum commune and the same  right of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina concerning the lease  of the port of Ploce, as well as the military agreement  concluded in Split, which is an integral part of the package.    Regarding the constitutional project for establishing the  federation, this project obviously represents the most  acceptable answer to the question: How should the state be  organized according to the needs of the citizens and people who  live in this region? Relations within the federation are founded  on the full equality of the Bosniak and Croatian peoples and the  equality of all citizens. The organization of the federal and  cantonal authorities consistently expresses these principles.    The duties of the federation are adequately defined and  provide the absolutely necessary level of political and economic  integration for the existence and functioning of the federal  state. At the same time, a high degree of decentralization and  the transfer of numerous powers of the state to the federal  units and cantons, and the appropriate solutions on determining  territories of the federal units have instantly eliminated all  reasons for conflicts and clashes, save pretensions for conquest  and separating parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The cantons as federal units are not defined exclusively  according to the ethnic principle, because this is simply  impossible in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course there will be  cantons in which the Bosniaks or the Croats will make up 80  percent and cantons where this ratio will be almost 50-50  percent.    In either case, both the Bosniaks and the Croats are  constituent nations, which means that a Croat or a Bosniak  cannot be in a minority in any part of the federation,  regardless of the number of members of that nation in a  particular region. Therefore, the cantons are not to be  considered exclusively national territories of either nation.  Every federal unit is joint, as is the federation.    Regarding the constitutional project of the federation,  there  was full unanimity and I think that the act of adopting and  promulgating the constitution will be [word indistinct].  Regarding the adoption of the constitution and the realization  of provisional solutions, I will make some proposals later.    Regarding the preliminary agreement on the principles of the  future confederation, I think that these principles have been  defined in such a way that they completely guarantee the respect  of all the state attributes of the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the Republic of Croatia. The  federation will not lose any of its characteristics regarding  its sovereignty with the conclusion of the confederal agreement.    On the other hand, both the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Republic of Croatia, within the confederal relationship,  are creating wide and firm prerequisites for the achievement of  capital, economic, defense, and other interests.    Neither side is going into this confederal relationship  blind. On the contrary, it has been envisaged that specific  relations in every sphere be defined by separate agreements.  The confederation is simply an expression of the real interests  of the people and citizens, two states, and only as such can it  be created and survive.    In this context is also the arrangement concerning the  regime  of crossing parts of the [Neum) commune, which is identical to  the right of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the regime of crossing  the territory of the Republic of Croatia to the port of Ploce.  This arrangement is of mutual interest and represents an  expression of mutual understanding and confidence building. The  principle of reciprocity has in this case been fully respected,  too.    Finally, regarding the military agreement, one should state  that it is already being implemented according to a set pace,  and that the results so far achieved are within expectations.  Contacts are being held at the highest military level at which  answers are successfully being found to the majority of  outstanding issues. (?Of course), the final success of the full  implementation of the military agreement depends to a great  extent on steps to be taken in the sphere of politics. We must  bear this in mind all the time when we hold political talks and  make political decisions.    Therefore, in general, the agreements concluded represent a  sound basis and an important step toward final, lasting, and  just solutions. Although certain positive effects are already  being felt, one must nevertheless bear in mind that their  implementation is yet to come. This is a very (?responsible)  and very complex and delicate job. [words indistinct]  psychological, emotional barriers, calming of passions, and  (?extremism) of all kinds.    This is not a call to forget or forgive. Crimes, regardless  of who has committed them, cannot and must not be forgotten, nor  can the perpetrators remain unpunished. Our future is not and  cannot be made of only memories of crimes and injustice. Hating  crime and criminals is understandable, but hating entire nations  is a crime in itself.    The peoples on this territory have always been able to and  wanted to live together; this is our future. I am not implying  just the Bosniaks and Croats alone, but the Serbs as well. On  this basis, there is an open invitation for the Serbs to join  the agreement and live in the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  like other peoples under the same conditions and with the same  rights.    In any case, we will know how to respect those members of  the  Serbian nation who did not side with the perpetrators of crimes,  especially those who actively contributed to the struggle  against the aggression, the struggle for joint freedom and a  joint state. They will most certainly not be second-class  citizens, nor will members of all the other peoples. (?In) the  democratic society that we want to build, there is no place for  second-class citizens.    Esteemed deputies, although agreement has already been  reached on the essential issues, we are still facing numerous  decisions that will be neither simple nor easy to make. Not  because some people here want disagreements, but simply because  the answers that need to be found are not simple and easy. I  think that the very act of adopting and promulgating the  constitution of a federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the  most important, represents the easiest part of the work,  considering the consent that has already been achieved.    However, our aim is not only to adopt the constitution, but  also to implement it quickly, consistently, and fully. To  achieve this we urgently need to find and synchronize a certain  number of legal, organizational, and staff solutions that must  promptly follow the adoption of the constitution.    The transitional solutions include tight but (?manageable)  deadlines if an agreement on some essential issues is reached in  advance. Therefore, I consider important the proposal that  within the discussion on the constitutional project we bring  into line the views and opinions on those issues that need to be  decided upon the adoption of the constitution. This is not some  kind of political condition, but simply a practical approach to  the realization of the established concept.    The transitional provisions envisage that the Assembly elect  a transitional president and vice president of the federation  and appoint a government immediately after the adoption of the  constitution. The setting up of cantonal bodies is envisaged to  take place within 30 days. The countdown to these deadlines  will start with the adoption of the constitution and it would  not be good if we found ourselves in a situation where these  deadlines had not been met.    Therefore, I consider it important that the Assembly hold a  continuous session so that solutions on which the realization of  the constitution depend in this transitional period are found  and synchronized, and that we then adopt the constitution.    Of course, a different order of moves is possible. This will  finally be decided by the Assembly. Whatever the decision, we  rightly believe that the all the participants in the work of the  Assembly will be profoundly aware of our responsibility before  our peoples, our citizens, the international community, God and  the people, as it is commonly said.    Therefore, I appeal to you on behalf of the Government of  the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to (?support) and endorse the  agreements that have been reached, and to invest all your energy  in implementing them consistently and efficiently. Thank you.  [applause]</p>

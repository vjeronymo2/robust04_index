			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.P. Danilova, S.A. Yazynin, S.N. Yeremenko, </F> R.G. Vasilov, Scientific Production Association of  Biotechnology, Moscow; UDC 616.097]    [Abstract] The popularity of immunoassay methods for  medicinal monitoring of digoxin and reports about the presence  of the so-called digoxin-like immunoreactive factor in the serum  of some patients who receive no digoxin due to the  cross-reactions with endogenic steroids as well as the desire to  obtain monoclonal antibodies to digoxin prompted an attempt to  produce antibodies to digoxin suitable for this drug's  immunoassay study. To this end, digoxin was attached through the  digitoxose terminal radical to the bovine serum albumin and  hemocyanin; the conjugates and their properties are described.  BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally and subcutaneously  by 0.2 ml of emulsion. The hybridomata producing MCAs were  produced by fusing spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized by the  conjugate with X-63 Ag 8.568 myeloma cells, and three hybrid  clones were selected by indirect solid-phase enzyme immunoassay  analysis method (ELISA). The antibodies were obtained from the  mice's ascitic tumors, purified, and analyzed. The procedure for  determining the antibodies' specificity and affinity is  outlined. The findings confirm that monoclonal antibodies to the  digoxin drug with a high affinity and specificity and with a  binding constant ranging from 10[.sup]9[/] to  9.2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] were produced.

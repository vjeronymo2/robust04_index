			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: McCain brothers call truce WALLACE and Harrison McCain, the Canadian brothers who head the McCain potato-chip and frozen-food empire, have called a truce in their public feud over succession plans for the family-owned company. The agreement means that instead of airing their dispute in open court, the brothers will renew attempts to reach a private settlement. If those efforts fail to achieve a deal by early next year, the family will resolve its differences through arbitration. A court in New Brunswick was this week due to hear an application by Wallace for an injunction overturning a decision by the McCain Foods' board to oust him as joint chief executive by the end of this month. Five minutes before the hearing was due, however, the judge was asked to postpone the case while the two sides hammered out a settlement. Under the agreement, Wallace will remain as joint chief executive while the company seeks a successor to the brothers. The feud stems from a unilateral decision by Wallace three years ago to appoint his son Michael as head of McCain's US operations. Harrison said in an affidavit earlier this month that an atmosphere of 'distrust, intrigue and manoeuvring' has since pervaded the business. Wallace has argued that Harrison has felt threatened since he had a heart attack last year. Wallace said in a recent affidavit that failing the implementation of a previously agreed succession plan, his first choice was to split the company, which has annual sales of about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.3bn), into two roughly equal parts. He would take over the US and the Pacific Rim operations, leaving Harrison with the UK and European businesses. McCain is the biggest UK supplier of frozen potato chips. Wallace has also proposed buying the two-thirds stake in McCain Foods which he and his branch of the family do not already own.</p>

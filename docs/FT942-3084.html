			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Observer: Big John Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. John Prescott, Labour's blunt-speaking bruiser, was yesterday condemning the 'politically motivated ministers' who had engineered the rail strike. Wasn't the ex-ship steward one of the 'politically motivated men' excoriated by Harold Wilson, then prime minister, during the 1966 seamen's strike? Prescott was not named by Wilson because he had been adopted as prospective Labour candidate for Southport. Comment of this sort might go down well with the trade union lot but they are not going to help Tony Blair's chances of winning an election if Prescott were to be his deputy.</p>

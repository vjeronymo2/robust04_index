			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Unhappy Irish await a new government Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's acting prime minister, in Budapest yesterday for the European security conference, was hoping for a dignified exit on perhaps his last appearance as premier on the international stage. His expectations were to be cruelly dashed. New revelations about his role in the unfolding judicial scandal that destroyed his government last month forced him to cut short his trip and rush back for yesterday's vital session of the Dail, the Irish parliament. With Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader, yesterday calling off his negotiations with Fianna Fail, it is widely believed that a general election is the only way out of the impasse. Mr Bertie Ahern, who succeeded as leader of Fianna Fail after Mr Reynolds was forced to resign as prime minister, publicly accepted that a fresh alliance with Labour was no longer an option. The latest breakdown follows allegations that Mr Reynolds misled parliament over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan from attorney-general to the post of president of Irish High Court. It emerged on Monday that a day after defending Mr Whelehan Mr Reynolds had tried to persuade him to resign. As the Dail prepared for yesterday's critical session, the mood was summed up by one Labour MP: 'Its lies, lies and damned lies.' The public mood is one of almost total shock. Ireland has already spent a month agonising over the role of the Catholic Church, its most hallowed institution, after the first allegations about bungled extradition of a paedophile priest, later convicted in Northern Ireland on child sex abuse charges. This has been followed by a political crisis which a nervous public fear may undermine efforts to achieve an elusive peace in Northern Ireland. There is little public enthusiasm for a general election whose campaign could take the country right into Christmas week. Only two days ago the three-week-old political crisis seemed close to a resolution. A new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour seemed a foregone conclusion. The programme, inherited from the outgoing government, looked to be agreed. Both parties appeared committed to a high-growth strategy and to reducing the level of indebtedness. Fianna Fail and Labour seemed prepared to co-operate to co-ordinate policy on Northern Ireland. But now all this is to the hazard. The most immediate concern is that the crisis may hurt or slow down the Northern Ireland peace process. Dublin and London have yet to finalise the long-awaited framework document which is expected to form the basis for all-party talks on a new constitution for the province. It is also just a few days away from the first public meeting between UK officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Efforts to avoid a Christmas poll continued yesterday. Mr Spring announced he was restarting talks with Fine Gael, the main opposition party. With Labour holding 32 seats and Fine Gael 47, there is an arithmetical possibility of a coalition with one of the smaller parties. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, said yesterday that 'first of all we must get full facts out on the floor of the Dail'. With stronger leadership from Fine Gael, it is clear that the party could win broad support within parliament to lead a coalition with Labour. However, relations between Mr Spring and Fine Gael are not good, and a new accommodation may prove difficult in practice. The smartest political punters in Dublin appear to be laying their bets on a Christmas election.</p>

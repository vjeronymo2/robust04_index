			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Brazil, so near, but yet so far - In the Pink / David Roche suggests how to waken a sleeping giant David Roche, an expert on the emerging markets of south-east Asia, is president of Independent Strategy, a new investment research boutique. It would take so little to get things right in Brazil. This vast country has half the land mass, half the people and more than 45 per cent of the output of Latin America. If Brazil turns, it could be the tide that transforms the region into an alternative to Asia as a magnet for global capital. But while the country's economic potential is as immense as its area, it is untapped. The causes of Brazil's domestic economic failure run from inflation to under-investment, through low productivity to dreadful return on capital. This return (about one-third of that in booming east Asia) has driven the market to high price/earnings (P/E) ratios but with meagre price to book values (P/BVs). The Brazilian economy is the most sophisticated inflation-neutralising machine in the world. Indeed, it has shielded the bureaucracy, the army and the middle class from inflation's ravaging effects and made the rich even richer. The losers, of course, have been the poor. The incoming president, Fernando Cardoso, got elected for the popularity of his astutely-timed real plan which aims, among other things, to maintain the new currency's value by controlling inflation through tight fiscal and monetary measures. It has made the poor less poor by removing the inflation tax on their cash wages (the 12 per cent of Brazilians with bank accounts have them indexed against inflation). Now, he has to make it stick and deliver prosperity to all. When inflation was up in the sky, investment was slammed to the floor. The Brazilian economy is like a giant, under-capitalised, factory with rotten productivity, low savings and low investment. To change all this, inflation must fall to single digits and stay there; real return on investment would then rise. Free enterprise also needs to be rid of the dead hand of government. If these things were done, the productivity of capital and labour would rise and the impact on the equity market of rising real returns on capital, plus falling inflation, would be electric. Brazil has an expensive P/E but a cheap P/BV because the implied return on equity is only about 5 per cent. If it rose to the Spanish average of 11 per cent, stock prices would double. This, however, is a big 'if'. The pain of producing permanently low inflation could be too great for a Brazilian-style democracy. Indeed, I know of no case except Poland where a coalition government has opted for socially painful economic reform (and it happened there only because it marked such a decisive break with the hated Soviet system). Cardoso's new government is composed of really nice, honest, European-style social democrats who are closer to Germany's Willy Brandt than the UK's Margaret Thatcher. Undoubtedly, the country is going to get its best and most ethical administration in memory, But its members are more suited to intellectual debate on reform than implementing it. There is nary a 'doer' among them. Then, too, no one in Brazil thinks that wringing inflation out of the system will hurt. But it will - almost as badly as it has done in central Europe. Besides which, those who really matter have not suffered enough from inflation to bear the pain of reform. Worse still, those who did suffer may have felt it too much to put up with reform now. Government in Brazil is as big as Europe's (42 per cent of GDP) and a long way from east Asia's 18 per cent. But Brazil has revealed no big budget deficits, thanks to the inflation it created. Yet, once inflation stops, the government deficit rockets. That means spending - particularly on welfare, plus pensions and salaries for the bureaucracy  - must fall and privatisations must rise. Real wages have jumped and price rises have slowed - but productivity has not risen. If inflation stays down and state enterprises are privatised, over-employment - which I would estimate at a third of the labour force - will become impaled upon the horns of rising real costs and static productivity. Of course, productivity gains will follow, but only after rationalisation and investment. That is not going to happen tomorrow. Meanwhile, the social cost of economic re-structuring has not even begun to hurt. The popularity of reform among the poor is based on the blissful ignorance of a cruel fact: reform means job losses. The coming months will tell if Cardoso is the instrument, rather than the victim, of Brazilian reform. He has to strengthen the autonomy of the central bank, introduce tax reforms and balance the budget in real money terms. He must abolish wage indexation - the heart of the Brazilian inflation spiral. And he must privatise state assets. These changes are stepping stones across the spated river of Brazil's contrary history. It is not clear if Cardoso will, ultimately, fall in the flood or make it across. He could make all the right moves - and then see delivery fall short of market expectations. In that event, the equity market would follow the same pattern: up, and then down. Inflation would sink to around 50 per cent next year but then rise. And the real would depreciate by at least 20 per cent against the dollar by the end of next year. Yet, even annual inflation of 50 to 100 per cent over the next couple of years would be a big break with history - and it generates some interesting investment themes. There are some solid infrastructure plays, such as Usiminas in steel and Cemig in electricity. Electricity could be the first for privatisation, so Electrobas could have a great run. The major casualties of lower inflation would be the banks, with their huge cost structure and burgeoning bad debts.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hurdles to Mozambique aid - Poor management dogs recovery effort Peace has brought back prosperity to Mozambique's ports and railways, as well as corruption, drug-trafficking and a thriving trade in looted merchandise. Western embassies are alarmed at the flow of illicit drugs through the country's ports. Mr John Sunde, the South African ambassador, says his customs officers have impounded up to one tonne of mandrax a week from Maputo harbour. The hallucinogenic pills, manufactured in India, are widely consumed in South Africa's black townships. Diplomats also estimate that one-fifth of the total tonnage handled in Maputo is stolen. Storage areas are not locked, and security guards look the other way when women haul bags of maize and sugar over the harbour perimeter fence. Lax security and poor management are costing the state-owned Ports and Railways Company of Mozambique (CFM) business it can barely afford to lose. Coal mines in the Transvaal, which recently secured huge contracts to supply Turkey, say they will not use the port at Maputo - their shortest outlet to the sea - until security is improved. 'If South Africa doesn't use Maputo port, the World Bank will not fund an Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.5m) project to upgrade the railway line,' Mr Sunde says. Having spent hundreds of millions of aid dollars to rebuild Mozambique's war-damaged transport network, foreign donors have decided that the only way to stop the rot at CFM is by privatising its management. In the diplomatic language of the World Bank, the administration of CFM is in need of reform. Already, the Caisse Francaise de Developpement, the French government's overseas development agency, has threatened to halt the rehabilitation of the Nacala railway, the northern-most of the three lines which traverse Mozambique, unless CFM agrees to privatise the management of Nacala's deep-water port and railway services. The privatisation proposal provokes a vitriolic reaction from Mr Armando Guebuza, the transport and communications minister. 'CFM is Mozambique's biggest company and foreign exchange earner. Why should I hand over the country's wealth to foreigners without a full analysis of the options?' he asks. 'There may be management problems, but we are not obliged to accept every solution donors impose on us. Their objectives should coincide with ours.' The arguments are often clouded by emotion because Mozambicans fear they are losing their sovereignty to the dictates of foreign donors. In a country where aid receipts equal gross domestic product (a meagre Dollars 1bn), there is an undercurrent of resentment at the lecturing that comes with international assistance. Charges of weak management wound Mr Guebuza's nationalist pride. To surrender the railways to foreigners would bring back the not-so-distant days of Portuguese rule, when blacks were restricted to menial jobs. Seventeen years of civil war destroyed the few resources the Portuguese left behind. Rehabilitation only began in earnest after the signing of a peace accord in October 1992, and it has been financed entirely by external aid. The port and railway terminal of Beira, which handles Zimbabwe's foreign trade, has shiny new container and multi-purpose terminals, a fishing terminal with cold storage facilities, a new oil terminal and a deeper port thanks to some Dollars 435m of European Union and Nordic assistance. Freight traffic along the Beira corridor has doubled since 1991 to 950,000 tonnes; the tonnage handled at the port has risen by 60 per cent to 2.7m tonnes, as has container cargo. Mr Fernando Ferreira Mendes, a former CFM employee who is now a consultant with the World Bank, agrees that weak management is a problem, but mainly because all decisions are centralised in Maputo. 'Everything has to be referred to CFM headquarters, from the purchase of spares to the tariffs we may charge. We don't need to privatise management,' he says, 'just decentralise it.'</p>

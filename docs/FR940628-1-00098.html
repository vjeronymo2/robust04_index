The Act requires that such a proposed order provide for the establishment of a National PromoFlor Council. The Council would be composed of 25 voting members: 14 members representing qualified wholesale handlers of domestic and imported cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing producers who are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing importers who are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing traditional retailers of cut flowers and greens; and 2 members representing persons who produce cut flowers and greens.

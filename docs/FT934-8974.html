			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Birmingham Midshires acquires Pounds 18m mortgages Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has acquired Pounds 17.8m of housing association mortgages from the Bank of Wales for an undisclosed amount, writes Alison Smith. The portfolio comprises loans to 14 registered housing associations in Wales and one in Bristol. This is the society's first acquisition of this type of loan book, though it already has experience of lending to associations. Over the past 18 months, buying residential mortgage books from other sources, including Sumitomo Bank and the United Bank of Kuwait, has already taken the society's assets to more than Pounds 4bn. In the past five years it has bought mortgage books totalling just over Pounds 300m. The society sees acquisition as a faster route to increasing asset size than organic growth, and as an alternative to merger - although it does not rule out combining with the right partner.</p>

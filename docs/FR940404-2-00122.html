(``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BSE proposes to amend its listing requirements to impose more stringent criteria for initial listing of securities on the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BSE proposes to amend Chapter XXVII_Listing Securities_Requirements &para; 2260, Sec. 1, which outlines mandatory listing requirements for common stock. The Exchange generally proposes the following changes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The proposal would increase the company's tangible asset requirement to $2 million (up from $1.5 million) of $3 million in total assets. It would also specify that intangible assets shall include, inter alia, goodwill, patents, licenses, and trademarks and other assets as the Exchange shall deem intangible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The proposal would increase the required outstanding public float requirement to 750,000 shares (up from 500,000). It would also provide that the public float requirement shall be exclusive of shares held by directors, officers or other concentrated holdings of 5% (down from 10%) or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The proposal would increase the minimum number of beneficial stock holders required for listing to 750 (up from 500) beneficial stockholders exclusive of the holdings of directors, officers or other concentrated holdings of 5% (down from 10%) or more. Currently, with respect to companies seeking to list following an initial public offering, the Exchange must receive assurances from the company or its representatives that the minimum beneficial stockholder requirement be met following the distribution of the shares. If not met within six months of listing, the Exchange shall take immediate action to suspend dealings until the stockholder requirement is met. The Exchange proposes to add the following sentence to this section: Should the company fail to meet the requirement within 90 days of suspension, the Exchange shall file an application for delisting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The proposal would increase the minimum bid price per share to $2.00 per share (up from $1.00 per share) at the time of listing in the case of an initial public offering. It would also require a bid price of $2.00 (up from $1.00) to be maintained for 45 days (up from 30) prior to listing in the case of a company not involved in an initial public offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The proposal would increase the net tangible asset requirement to $2 million (up from $500,000). The proposal would, therefore, provide that the company must have either net income of $100,000 in two of the past three years or net tangible assets in the amount of $2 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change.

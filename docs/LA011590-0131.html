			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: AGGRESSIVE PROMOTION OF BALDNESS REMEDY CHALLENGED  </P> <P> Q. Why is the Upjohn Co. promoting its baldness remedy so aggressively?  </P> <P> When I first saw the ads for Rogaine, I called the toll-free 800 number just to  see what would happen. I have been bald for years, and what I've read in your  column about this drug is not very encouraging.  </P> <P> They sent a letter recommending three doctors in my area who could prescribe  Rogaine along with a $10 certificate to help pay for the visit. But $10 doesn't  pay for a doctor visit by a long shot.  </P> <P> I recently received a follow-up letter urging me to make an appointment and  redeem my certificate. I'm angry because I feel this is a violation of my  privacy. Are they so desperate that they have to keep hounding me? How do I get  my name off their mailing list?  </P> <P> A. Rogaine Topical Solution (minoxidil) has not taken the market by storm.  Although it is the sole FDA-approved baldness treatment, only about 30% to 40%  of the men who use Rogaine get noteworthy results.  </P> <P> Someone such as yourself who has been bald for a long time probably won't see  much improvement. And you'd be out a lot more than $10 to have a doctor tell  you that.  </P> <P> The full-page ads, toll-free numbers and $10 rebates are unusual tactics for  promoting prescription medicine. To get your name removed from their list, you  may have to write to the Upjohn Co., P.O. Box 9030, Opa Locka, FL 33054-9944.  </P> <P> Q. I read in a magazine article that Monistat, a prescription cream used for  vaginal infections, is the same as Micatin, an over-the-counter athlete's foot  remedy.  </P> <P> I checked Micatin at the drugstore, and it is much less expensive than the  Monistat my doctor prescribed last week. If these two drugs are really the  same, couldn't I use the Micatin instead of refilling my prescription?  </P> <P> A. This is a tricky one. The anti-fungal ingredient in Micatin athlete's foot  cream is miconazole, the identical drug in Monistat vaginal formula. Even the  inactive ingredients are the same.  </P> <P> A 30-gram tube of Micatin purchased over-the-counter costs about $8, whereas  the prescription 45-gram tube of Monistat is almost $20.  </P> <P> Vaginal infections should not be self-diagnosed. But if your doctor decides  that you need Monistat again, you might ask him about substituting Micatin.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (14): Degrees of discomfort - Machines and Tools IT REQUIRES a Roget's Thesaurus, opened at the entry for 'poor,' to describe current conditions - and immediate prospects - in world markets for the mechanical engineering and industrial equipment industries. Depending on the industry and the market, business can be flat, uncertain, weak, bad or downright dreadful. All too rarely, and for too few companies, can markets be described positively, and the remaining pockets of resistance against the general trend can hardly be deemed buoyant. 'The machinery business is bad, but not awful, at least outside the UK,' said Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley in a recent research note. 'In the US, demand has not picked up, but has at least stopped declining. In Asia, not an important market for most European companies, the trend is down, but not (yet) sharply.' In Europe, says Mr Hadas, sales are weak in most places outside Germany, but generally not declining any more, although Italy and Spain could be exceptions on the negative side. German demand, fuelled by reunification, had been 'incredible,' but has now fallen back into the credible range. Elsewhere, sales into eastern Europe and the former USSR have dropped to virtually nothing, he says, while the Middle East has not yet recovered from the Gulf war, although the latest signs from the region are more encouraging. Inevitably, there are exceptions to the general picture presented by broad reviews of current business conditions. Even in the UK, which has sunk into a recession in manufacturing of unequalled severity, oases in a sea of gloom can be identified. The machine tool industry, producer of the basic metal-cutting and forming machines used in manufacturing, is a case in point. A recent survey for Machinery magazine on sophisticated computer-numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools indicated a potential fall of more than 40 per cent in 1990/91 volume sales to the automotive sector, yet sales to the electrical/electronic sector may have grown by 21 per cent. Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine toolmaker, is doing relatively well selling to the North Sea oil sector, but it has been a grim year for many machine tool producers dependent on the UK market. Similarly, in continental Europe, the few machine tool builders to reveal financial results are awash in red ink. Maho, the German milling and turning machine maker which is one of Europe's biggest producers, plunged to a DM17.3m net loss for the year ended June, against a DM14m profit previously. Even Japan's Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of CNC machine tools, is feeling the pinch in many export markets, but is big enough to take the knocks of a cyclical business while hardly flinching. Another industry taking a hammering is construction equipment. Worldwide unit sales of the seven main product types slumped from around 200,000 in 1979 to 130,000 in 1983, and then began a slow climb to nearly 160,000 by 1989. But the recession, notably in the US and the UK, has prompted a renewed fall to below 140,000 units. Little wonder, therefore, that the big players in the construction equipment industry are scrambling for a good position in Germany, where market prospects have been transformed by reunification and the subsequent infrastructural investment. Corporate Intelligence Group, the London-based analyst, says the eastern market grew by 200 per cent in 1991, with perhaps a further 15 per cent increase this year. Caterpillar of the US, Komatsu of Japan and VME, the joint venture between Volvo and Clark Equipment, have all made acquisitions or joint venture arrangements with western German construction equipment companies to exploit the new environment. Local equipment suppliers such as Krupp and Liebherr have also moved smartly across the old border. The German effect is also at work in the agricultural equipment business, where the large eastern farms offer good long-term prospects to the big producers such as NH Geotech, Massey-Ferguson, JI Case Europe and Deere. Elsewhere in Europe, however, structural problems associated with the Common Agricultural Policy, and general recessionary factors, give little room for optimism. The US agricultural equipment market, which went through the wringer in the 1970s, is now steadier, but elsewhere equipment manufacturers are frustrated by a painful fact of life: Third World countries that need equipment most urgently have little money to pay for it. Amid all the gloom, however, it is important to remember equipment industries which operate on very different business cycles. Infrastructural spending is often immune to short-term economic factors, and power generating equipment producers are one group currently prospering from growing demand in the western world for new, cleaner generating methods. Meanwhile, ambitious power station programmes in China and elsewhere in Asia continue to underpin demand for coal-fired stations, while in eastern Europe there is likely to be plenty of work for western companies retrofitting Soviet-designed nuclear power stations. One curious aspect, at least prima facie, of the general downturn over the past year is that it has not generated a rash of big mergers. A strong underlying trend of restructuring in Europe - ahead of the Single Market - continues, but it seems most of the mega-deals prompted both by the 1992 effect, and by overcapacity in the heavy equipment sector, are now completed in good time for the implementation of the EC reforms. The completion in mid-1991 of the merger of Fiat and Ford's agricultural and earthmoving equipment interests to create NH Geotech, was the only mega-deal of 1991 for which global strategic factors were the prime motivator. Although grand strategy played a part in three other deals - the takeovers of Davy, Hawker Siddeley and Alfa-Laval by Trafalgar House, BTR and Tetra-Pak respectively - special circumstances dominated. In construction equipment, there has been an encouraging trend of realistic deals between Japanese and European producers which recognise that each side has its strengths. JCB, the fiercely independent UK producer, has announced a significant joint venture with Sumitomo Construction Machinery to attack the European crawler excavator market. A similar deal pooling Japanese - and US - technology with European distribution strength could be announced very soon between Deere, Hitachi Construction Machinery and Fiat. The deal would create a new European giant and leave NH Geotech to concentrate mainly on farm equipment - it will retain the Ford New Holland skid steer loader and backhoe loader line. What of prospects for the short- and long term? Clearly, the immediate outlook is weak: in the UK it could be 1993 before some machinery markets recover, and the US economy seems stuck between recession and growth. Rising interest rates and warnings of recession in Germany cannot be dismissed lightly. Longer-term, there is more reason for optimism. Industrial growth prospects in the Pacific Rim may waver occasionally, but the trend line is firmly upwards. The heavy capital investment required to rebuild eastern Europe's industries and businesses, along with the continuing investment needs in western Europe, ought to get the machinery sector moving in the mid-1990s, if the politicians can find the money.</p>

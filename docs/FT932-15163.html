			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: US-Canada disputes cloud Nafta talks US, CANADIAN and Mexican officials have started a series of negotiations on side agreements to complete the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the same time, however, US legislators were raising doubts about the binational dispute settlement mechanism already operating between the US and Canada. The US National Pork Producers' Council warned that a decision against their group by a binational appeals panel, the extraordinary challenge committee, has 'cast a shadow over the entire binational panel process' set up under the US-Canada free trade pact. The three-member committee ruled that, while a lower binational panel, which ruled against the US, 'may have erred' in its interpretation of a US Commerce Department application of the countervailing duty law, 'on balance the committee was not persuaded that the panel failed to apply the properly articulated standard of review.' 'The committee itself said the panel may be wrong,' said Mr Karl Johnson, president of the pork producers. 'Why have the extraordinary challenge committee process at all if a binational panel's blatant flaws cannot be overturned?' One issue was a decision by the original binational panel to refuse documents from the Commerce Department which were alleged to have shown how Canadian subsidies support the pork industry there. The committee said the refusal was 'somewhat surprising', in that a previous panel had ruled against the US on the grounds that there was not substantial evidence shown to support a Commerce decision. US parties have not done well in the binational process, according to Ms Joanna McIntosh, one of the attorneys for the pork council. Of the 10 cases brought concerning US agency determinations, six have gone against the US and three ended with no improvement - the US side has won just once. More than a third of the US Senate wrote to President Clinton in January, warning that a negative decision in the pork case 'could have grave implications for pending cases'.

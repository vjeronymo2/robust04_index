			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Guo'an (2621 0948 1344), Shaoyang (Hunan) </F> Branch, the People's Bank of China: "Serious Losses of Budgetary  Funds"]    [Text] A new and quite worrisome problem has arisen in  China's public finance, namely the retardation in several  regions of budgetary income increases, a fact which has most  seriously aggravated the difficulties of public finance, so that  even the normal allocation of funds for wages has become  difficult in certain administrative units. In marked contrast to  this situation, extrabudgetary funds have substantially  increased yearly, and are showing a tendency toward large-scale  inflation. In our search for reasons, we found that serious  losses are being incurred in the budgetary income of public  finance, and our investigations have revealed that there are the  following eight channels which are allowing budgetary funds to  be diverted to become extrabudgetary funds.    First channel: Diversions put in place through public  finance  budgets. Public finance is presently practicing a system of  separate administrative responsibilities, referred to as  "preparing one's own meals at separate kitchens." When preparing  their annual financial budgets, some regions will therefore try  to promote local economic developments and build up financial  resources by making appropriate provisions in their budgets for  "special-purpose funds" to support production. As we understand,  most of these funds are allocated out in the form of revolving  funds by the business departments of the public finance  agencies, without providing for reimbursements, from budgetary  accounts to extrabudgetary accounts, and are left deposited  there. In the process of transferring these funds to the  extrabudgetary deposits and allocating them for payment, it  happens quite frequently that the business departments within  the public finance agencies at every level retain some of these  funds and divert them for other purposes. This, then, is a way  of turning budgetary funds into extrabudgetary funds.    Second channel: Diversion through financial credits.  Financial credit is one form by which public finance agencies  use capital funds by means of fudiciary bank loans. In recent  years, there has been an increase in the locally retained funds,  and as a consequence, financial credit activities have also  expanded. Some public finance agencies are utilizing  intermittently available budgetary or surplus funds, on the  pretext of supporting production, and either directly loan such  funds out on budgetary accounts or employ an agency pattern in  extending loans. Some also invest the funds as shares in  enterprises, starting up all kinds of fiduciary loan activities,  and collecting "fund-occupancy" or "fund-use" fees.    Third channel: Diversion of income earned by administrative  business units by not turning over such income to the state  treasury. Income from administrative business units is an  important source of budgetary revenue of public finance.  However, in recent years, some units that earn budgetary income  use various kinds of pretexts for remitting less than due, or  for not remitting at all, income that should be paid into the  state treasury. Particularly serious are the cases of units  which themselves collect such revenue and spend it all by  themselves. They thus retain the total amount of such income and  turn these funds, that should have been administered within the  budget, into their own small money-chests and their own small  treasuries, and in this way provide the monetary resources for  unhealthy tendencies.    Fourth channel: diversion by not turning over to the  treasury  fines and confiscated funds collected by the state's law  enforcement agencies. Following more effective law enforcement,  income from fines and confiscated funds, collected by the law  enforcement agencies in the course of the performance of their  duties of exercising state controls, have increased yearly.  According to regulations, fines and confiscated funds must be  paid into the state treasury in full, while expenses incurred  during the investigation of the cases in question shall be  allocated and paid out of the budget of public finance, thus  collection and expenditures shall be two separate operations.  However, in actual fact, implementation of this rule is  difficult. Quite a number of units use as an excuse the fact  that circumstances had been exceptional, and that no money had  been available to investigate the cases, to make out that  revenue and expenditure have evened out. They will spend the  money as they please, and budgetary income funds will thus be  retained and misused for other purposes.    Fifth channel: diversion by dispersions and retentions  carried out by agencies in charge of finance, taxation, and the  imposition of levies. Investigations revealed that some agencies  in charge of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies had  opened special accounts, or rather, arbitrarily opened accounts,  with various banks and urban or rural credit cooperatives with  the intention of retaining budgetary revenue and willfully  diverting the money to other uses. These activities have assumed  serious dimensions. Especially some basic-level units in charge  of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies do not  administer affairs according to the provisions governing state  treasury administration. They do not promptly report and hand  over the full amounts of budgetary revenue, but will, without  authority, divert the budgetary revenue to other purposes or  privately deposit public funds with the intention of making  private profits for themselves or for their group. Particularly  serious are the cases where they act in complete disregard for  party discipline and state law by willfully and arbitrarily  misappropriating funds that belong to the state treasury.    Sixth channel: diversion by public finance agencies setting  up economic entities. During the last two years, public finance  agencies of various ranks have set up a large number of economic  entities, and, for the purpose of providing these economic  entities with the needed funds for running expenses, also as  capital and operating funds, some agencies in charge of public  finance have financed these economic entities with budgetary  funds in such forms as allocations from budgetary accounts, or  loans, or by taking up shares in these entities. A part of the  budgetary funds was thereby converted into funds owned by the  subordinate economic entity.    Seventh channel: diversions by finance and tax agencies  refunding paid-in budget revenue and refunding taxes. Taxes and  profits from enterprise units figure large in the budgetary  revenue of state finance. However, some districts merely take  their partial and local benefits into consideration, will  disregard the state's laws and regulations concerning public  finance, will concoct all kinds of pretexts, use a great variety  of forms, and will, in an arbitrary excess of their powers,  reduce taxes, refund taxes, and refund paid-in budget revenue.  They will, in particular, arbitrarily refund or reduce budgetary  revenue of the central government and revenue that belongs to  both, the local as well as the central government. In the  administration of budgetary revenue, there is also the problem  that the agency in charge of administering the state treasury  does not conscientiously carry out its official duties. In such  specific accounting processes as reporting and paying the proper  proportions in tax categories and tax items as pertaining to the  central government or the local governments, investigations and  checks are not strict. This too is responsible for diversion of  a part of the budgetary revenue, converting it from central  government to local government budgetary revenue, or to  extrabudgetary funds of enterprise units.    Eighth channel: diversion by enterprises cutting down on  payments to the treasury and claiming higher costs. When drawing  various special-purpose funds, some enterprise units will  arbitrarily expand the scope of the project and raise  significant proportions and criteria. For instance, when drawing  funds for the depreciation of fixes assets, they will shorten  the service life and claim depreciation before its proper date.  They will cut down on payments to the treasury and will use the  money for their own purposes, and they will increase cost  expenditure. By doing so they will correspondingly reduce  enterprise profits and taxes, and expand the source of  extrabudgetary funds of their own enterprise units.    To bring about a radical solution of the serious problems of  the above-mentioned conversion of budgetary funds to  extrabudgetary funds and to stop up loopholes, it is my opinion  that it is necessary to actively push on with the structural  reform of the finance system with a separate taxation system,  that we straighten out the distribution relations between  central government and local governments, increasingly  promulgate laws and regulation, as soon as possible produce a  law on budgeting, enhance the work at the state treasury, fully  bring into play supervisory and administrative functions of the  agency in charge of the state treasury, and effectively check  the administration of the state treasury and close loopholes.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP TEAM TO FEATURE CHANG, LEACH, BUT NOT AGASSI  </P> <P> Andre Agassi doesn't play the Australian Open and he doesn't play Wimbledon.  And after the U.S. team was announced Wednesday, Agassi doesn't play Davis Cup  either.  </P> <P> "I'm quite sure he does not consider this a slap in the face," said Agassi's  agent, Bill Shelton of International Management Group.  </P> <P> In something of a surprise, Placentia's Michael Chang and Aaron Krickstein will  play singles, and Laguna Beach's Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will make their Davis  Cup debut in doubles when the United States meets Mexico in a first-round match  Feb. 2-4 at LaCosta.  </P> <P> Tom Gorman, captain of the U.S. team, said he told Agassi that other players  deserved a chance.  </P> <P> "Our conversation is private, but I will tell you I told him that there were  others playing a lot better, and this was their opportunity to play," Gorman  said.  </P> <P> The U.S. team represents a complete break from the past since none of the four  players named to the squad played in this year's quarterfinal victory over  France or in the semifinal loss to West Germany -- when Agassi lost twice in  singles.  </P> <P> Boris Becker beat Agassi in a key match, coming from two sets down, as the West  Germans defeated the United States, 3-2, at Munich in July. The defending Davis  Cup champions entertain Sweden later this month at Stuttgart in a rematch of  last year's final.  </P> <P> The U.S. team defeated Paraguay, 5-0, and France, 5-0, before losing to West  Germany.  </P> <P> Chang, 17, played in his first Davis Cup last February against Paraguay and won  both of his matches.  </P> <P> Gorman said Chang and Krickstein are among seven Americans ranked in the top 13  who could have been chosen, but they were asked to play because their time had  come -- and it was the same with Leach and Pugh.  </P> <P> "There's a little bit of looking with an eye to the future, too," said Gorman,  whose job of picking a team to play Mexico became slightly difficult because of  (a) John McEnroe's decision to sit this round out and (b) Agassi's scattered  play.  </P> <P> Gorman scouted the No. 4-ranked McEnroe, No. 5 Chang, No. 6 Gilbert, No. 7  Agassi and No. 8 Krickstein last week in New York during the Masters  tournament, where Agassi drew more attention for the pink bicycling tights he  wore beneath his shorts and his black-and-pink polished fingernail than he did  with his tennis.  </P> <P> Agassi said then that he wanted to play in the Davis Cup, but his agent said  Wednesday that Agassi is happy with the team that was chosen.  </P> <P> "I just talked to him and he sounded great to me," Shelton said. "He'll just  spend his time getting ready for the tour."  </P> <P> Krickstein, 22, last played in the Davis Cup in 1987, when the United States  was beaten by Paraguay, 3-2. He lostthe deciding match to Victor Pecci.  Krickstein wasn't planning on playing against Mexico and had scheduled a heavy  workload around Davis Cup time. He plays at Sydney and in the Australian Open  at Melbourne, then in the Davis Cup and in an ATP tournament at Milan the  following week.  </P> <P> "But it's hard to say no to the Davis Cup," said Krickstein, who speculated on  why Gorman said no to Agassi.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's just a thing to make him work harder, to get him going again; that  he's not just on the team if he doesn't perform," Krickstein said.  </P> <P> Should the United States defeat Mexico, the next round would be in Europe  against either Czechoslovakia or Switzerland. Gorman said he may choose an  entirely different team after the Mexican matches.  </P> <P> "After that, nobody is guaranteed," Gorman said.  </P> <P> "I've told them all, the easiest thing in the world is a country where there  are only four players to start with," Gorman said. "There are no surprises  there."  </P> <P> For the U.S. team, the surprises began Wednesday.  </P></p>

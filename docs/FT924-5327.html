			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Lautro executive resigns MR KIT JEBENS, chief exec-utive of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, said he had accepted the resignation of his deputy after she had publicly expressed doubts about plans to reform regulation. Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer, told Mr Jebens last week she would resign rather than work for the proposed Personal Investment Authority, which is to replace Lautro, arguing that it would not take sufficient account of consumer interests. Her remarks touched off a storm of protests from the financial services industry. Lautro's board also strongly supports the creation of the PIA. In a statement yesterday, Ms Leisching said she believed that self-regulation had worked and that Lautro had been effective in raising standards in the life industry. Mr Mike Ross, managing director of Scottish Widows, the mutual life assurance group, said yesterday that he had resigned from the board of Lautro, which is checking on whether products sold to about 20,000 clients by Scottish Widows' tied agents were appropriate.</p>

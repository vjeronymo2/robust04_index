			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / CIS moves another step nearer break-up THE Commonwealth of Independent States took a step closer to dissolution yesterday when defence ministers of most of its member states agreed to limit their joint military command to strategic nuclear weapons. This means that the navy and air force, including the Black Sea fleet whose possession is disputed between Russia and Ukraine, will now be divided among the member states, with the bulk of it falling to Russia. Mr Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian defence minister, said all nuclear weapons had been removed from the Black Sea fleet three weeks ago. Talks have begun between Ukraine and Russia on the division of the fleet but there is no resolution in sight. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the CIS command, said the CIS would continue to maintain and control the nuclear forces until they were all returned to Russia. The other states with nuclear weapons - Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine - have agreed to do this by mid-1994. There still appears to be disagreement between Russia and Ukraine on the precise control of the nuclear warheads. General Leonty Kuznetsov, head of the Russian general staff, said Russia had been delegated responsibility for putting the nuclear forces on alert - and said that acts adopted by Ukraine on administrative control of the nuclear warheads 'put their safety in doubt'. Marshal Shaposhnikov said the forces remaining under CIS control were the strategic missiles; the strategic nuclear bombers; nuclear missile-carrying warships; the anti-missile systems and the technical back-up to the nuclear force. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, called last night for urgent talks on the worsening conflict between national guards and forces of the Russian minority in Moldova. Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, warned on Monday that his republic might have to declare a state of war with Russia because of alleged involvement of the Russian 14th army on the side of Russian forces in the self-proclaimed TransDnestr republic in the east of Moldova.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Sport: Imperious Lara knocks Border's plans into a spin - Kevin Brown watches some myths debunked in Sydney / Cricket FOR the third consecutive year, the annual Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground faded into a draw, but not without destroying a couple of long-standing myths. By the time Brian Lara wrapped up the match on Wednesday afternoon with a couple of overs of wobbly leg-spin - including a googly which the hapless Mark Taylor failed to pick up - Australia and the West Indies had racked up 1,226 runs, in spite of frequent interruptions for rain. It was a heart-stirring display batting exhibition, which included six 50s and three centuries, capped by Lara's imperious 277, widely lauded as one of the best knocks ever seen at Sydney. For those with a taste for history (which means almost all cricket watchers) it conjured up images of the golden age of batting between the wars, when Bradman and Ponsford, Hammond and Sutcliffe piled up so many towering scores. Lara's innings, in particular, announced the arrival of a great talent, fit to be spoken of in the same breath as masters such as Sir Garfield Sobers and Vivian Richards. After Lara passed 250, when it seemed almost impossible that any of the toiling Australian bowlers could remove him, Sobers' record Test score of 365 not out (against Pakistan at Kingston in 1957) seemed doomed to fall. Fittingly, it took a brilliant run out by Damian Martyn to send the modest 23-year-old back to the pavilion and a standing ovation they must have heard in Trinidad. Lara's achievement was all the more astonishing given the circumstances in which it was made. The West Indians came to Sydney one down in the five match series, having drawn in Brisbane and lost in Melbourne (mostly because of their abysmal catching.) After losing the toss, captain Richie Richardson watched Alan Border's Australians score 503 for nine declared, followed by the rapid removal of Desmond Haynes, the veteran West Indies opener, and Phil Simmonds, a heroic centurion in Melbourne. Richardson and Lara came together at 31 for two, facing what seemed like certain defeat. They parted at 324 for three, when Richardson mistimed a pull shot off the big-hearted trundler Merv Hughes and was caught in the deep for 109. From there, it was all downhill for Australia as Keith Arthurton chipped in with 47, and Jimmy Adams with a painstaking 77 not out. It was, of course, not supposed to happen that way. Australia's game plan was built on two beliefs about the West Indies which have acquired the status of received truths: they cannot play spin, and their heads drop when things are going badly. Border's team had two specialist slow bowlers, and Peter Leroy, the Sydney groundsman, prepared a brown strip which looked guaranteed to uphold the SCG's reputation as a spinners' paradise. Richardson, relying on all-rounders Adams and Carl Hooper for spin, could only echo fast bowler Ian Bishop's plaintive cry of 'Where's the grass?' when he saw the pitch. Richardson was too polite to say so, but he will not have failed to notice that the West Indies pace attack has been blunted by grassless wickets in all three Tests so far. This may not be in Australia's long term interests, since the next Australian tourists in the Caribbean are likely to find themselves batting (or more likely ducking) on the greenest wickets they have ever seen. But it did appear, when the captains walked out on Saturday, that all Border had to do was win the toss and score as many first innings runs as possible before unleashing his spinners on a crumbling wicket. Border duly won the toss, and Australia got what looked like enough runs, thanks partly to a sparkling 100 from Steve Waugh. But the script went wrong when Richardson and Lara, refusing to bow to seemingly inevitable defeat, treated Greg Matthews' flat off breaks and Shane Warne's more flighted leg spin with equal disdain. The manner of the result will give great heart to Richardson's young team, which is rebuilding after the recent retirements of stalwarts like Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon and Michael Holding. Wes Hall, the fast bowler who played for the West Indies in the 1960s, watched part of the match and was moved to comparisons with Clive Lloyd's inexperienced 1975 / 76 team, which was thrashed 5-1 in Australia but went on to become undisputed world champions. The experience will have been less uplifting for the Australians, and it must have been particularly difficult for Warne, who finished with one wicket for 116 off 41 overs - his single scalp the wicket of the struggling Hooper, who continues to promise more than he delivers. However, Warne may benefit in the long run if his failure lowers the expectations raised by his seven for 52 in Melbourne. That performance made him the latest candidate for the mantle of Clarrie Grimmett, the best in a long line of match-winning Australian leg-spinners the last of whom was Richie Benaud in the 1960s. Warne did not bowl badly in Sydney, and at the age of 23 he has plenty of time to perfect the leg-spinner's art, perhaps the most difficult in the cricketing lexicon. Already, for example, he is sufficiently confident to bowl the 'flipper,' a delivery which Grimmett practised for 10 years before he dared bowl it in a Test. However, Sydney has raised two big question marks about the slow men: will Warne's promise fade on less accommodating pitches in New Zealand and England later this year; and why does the West Indies no longer produce spinners of the calibre of Lance Gibbs, Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine? The first question will be answered soon enough; the second seems destined to remain a mystery. The teams move on to Adelaide and Perth with the West Indians requiring one victory to even the series and retain the Sir Frank Worrall trophy. Both venues are likely to offer more pace and bounce than the lifeless Sydney pitch, giving hope to the West Indies that their quick bowlers can finally match the increasingly confident batsmen. The Australians, deprived once again of the injury-prone Bruce Reid, will be hoping for further fireworks from Warne. But they may be hard pressed to hold off the resurgent visitors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- A new round of talks  between the intermediary bodies from the two sides of the Taiwan  strait may be held in Taipei in mid-July to discuss some  cross-strait issues, a mainland affairs official said Thursday  [23 June].    "We have authorized the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to  prepare for a working-level meeting with its mainland Chinese  counterpart as part of our efforts to promote cross-strait  dialogue and rapprochement," said Kao Koong-lien, vice chairman  of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).    It will be the fifth working-level meeting between the SEF  and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS) since the heads of the two semi-official  conduits for cross- strait exchanges met in Singapore in April  1993.    The meeting will focus on issues related to the repatriation  of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants as well as to  cross-strait fishing disputes, Kao said.    SEF and ARATS officials have met four times to discuss these  issues since the second half of last year, but no definite  results have been reached because of Beijing's reluctance to  recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over territories now under its  control.    Kao said the fifth round of talks will also discuss ways to  protect the safety of Taiwan travelers on the mainland. "The  issue has become pressing after the March 31 Qiandao lake travel  disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered," Kao noted.    The meeting will be held after the July 4-5 national meeting  on mainland affairs, but the exact date has yet to be decided,  kao said. "We hope it will take place before late July or early  August," he added.    The SEF is expected to inform ARATS of its intention to hold  the fifth-round working-level meeting in the next few days.    Kao said the SEF will also arrange for a meeting between its  Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, Chiao Jen-ho, and ARATS  Vice President Tang Shubei in the near future.    "The time, venue and agenda for the proposed Chiao-tang  meeting will be decided after further discussion by SEF and  ARATS officials," Kao said.    He added that he does not rule out the possibility that the  Chiao-Tang meeting will be held in Taiwan. Chiao and Tang met  for the first time in Beijing last November.    Kao said the Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF  operations, has never tied the holding of a second Chiao-Tang  meeting to the satisfactory conclusion of the fifth  working-level meeting between the two organizations.    "We hope the planned Chiao-Tang meeting will help create a  favorable environment for a new round of talks between SEF  Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS President Wang Daohan," Kao noted.    He denied that the presidential office has ordered the MAC  not to approve a Koo-Wang meeting within this year. "We have  never received any such instruction," he stressed.    During the first Koo-Wang meeting, several agreements were  signed to lay a framework for institutionalized dialogue and  communications between the SEF and ARATS.    As cross-strait relations have plunged to a low ebb in the  aftermath of the Qiandao lake tragedy, Kao said Taiwan hopes to  create a better atmosphere before a second Koo-Wang meeting  takes place.</p>

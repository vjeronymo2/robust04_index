			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Slough bids for balance of Bredero Slough Estates has launched a bid for the remaining 50.5 per cent of its associate, Bredero Properties, the developer which was all but sunk by its ambitious Centre West project in Hammersmith, London. The bid values Bredero at Pounds 3.7m, reflecting the company's precarious financial situation after it breached its banking covenants. Bredero's shares fell 4 1/2 p to 10 1/2 p on news of the 10p a share offer, which is recommended by the independent board. Like recently-collapsed Rosehaugh and Speyhawk, Bredero was hit hard by rising interest rates and falling property values at a time when it was proceeding with a highly geared property development programme. The company survived through a string of property disposals, and the ring fencing of one of its mainassets, Phase 1 of Centre West. It now has little left. At its 1993 year-end, Bredero had a negative net asset value attributable to its ordinary shareholders of Pounds 3.44m, compared with an asset value of Pounds 100m in December 1989. Yesterday, it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 194,000 (Pounds 77m) for the year to end-December after taking in a Pounds 908,000 exceptional profit from the write-back of previous provisions. Bredero's only significant remaining assets are a 50 per cent stake in a retail development in Buchanan Street, Glasgow, and the site for Centre West Phase 2 in Hammersmith. It has no firm income stream, following its recent sales of stakes in the Ashley Centre and Paisley Centre, which helped reduce bank debt from Pounds 53m to Pounds 8m. Slough bought into Bredero in December 1986, paying Pounds 14.6m for a 49.5 per cent stake. At the time, it launched a takeover offer at 145p a share. Even after a substantial rights issue, its stake now carries a value of only Pounds 1.8m. Slough Estates claims it is taking a long-term view of the properties, while protecting its investment - which includes a Pounds 10m preference shareholding. Mr Alan Chisholm, Bredero managing director, said the company had been negotiating alternative offers and refinancing, but these had fallen through.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 May (EFE) -- The illegal  appointment of Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president places the  Dominican Government in a new, truly uncomfortable position -- a  vantage point from which it has decided not to meddle in the  internal affairs of its neighboring country.    Today, the Dominican Government distanced itself from  international criticism of the Haitian coupists for appointing  Jonassaint as the new Haitian president. The government declared  this was "an internal matter" and a new twist in a crisis the  Haitian people must resolve themselves.    In statements to EFE, Dominican Foreign Minister Aristides  Taveras Guzman today said: "We understand the appointment... is  a move by the Haitian politicians, and, as a country that abides  by its government's policy, we respect the sovereignty and  integrity of the people."    With the backing of the military that seized power in a  September 1991 coup, Supreme Court Magistrate Emile Jonassaint  assumed the presidency of Haiti on Wednesday, drawing criticism  from the international community and causing fears of armed  intervention from abroad.    Aristides Guzman said: "Although we have endorsed OAS and UN  efforts to achieve the democratic transition of the (Haitian)  people, we have always stressed, in one way or another, that the  Haitians should be the sole protagonists in resolving their  problems."    This position by the Dominican Government, according to what  Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately, reflects their  impotence in face of a Haitian crisis that has no good or  acceptable resolutions from a Dominican standpoint.    The Dominican Republic is fated not to agree with but to  comply with UN and OAS sanctions against the Haitian military --  sanctions designed to return deposed President Jean Bertrand  Aristide to power. The Dominican Republic is hoping the crisis  will calmly die on its own, preferably by the end of the  constitutional term of the Haitian government-in-exile, which is  in February 1995.    All current developments in the Haitian crisis are  threatening the Dominican Republic.    Aristide was criticized because of his anti-Dominican  remarks  during the seven months he was in power. The military  government cannot be accepted, however, because of international  opposition, and the same is true for the illegal appointment of  Emile Jonaissant.    The economic embargo imposed by the United Nations and the  OAS has not resolved the problem and has discredited the  Dominican Armed Forces, which have been unable to prevent  smuggling across the border. The new embargo, which will be  implemented on 21 May, puts more responsibility on Dominican  surveillance and will require additional spending. The number  of Haitian exiles and refugees are increasing in the Dominican  Republic, while the Dominican Government is resisting pressure  to install refugee camps near the border. The Dominican  Republic also has been obliged to accept international  observers, who will arrive this week to oversee the fulfillment  of the embargo.    All of these problems were outlined to EFE today by Deputy  Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral, who confirmed the  acceptance of international observers, but he reiterated that  "the embargo violates the Haitian people's human rights. He  also said the embargo harms the Dominican Republic in view of  international accusations of "alleged violations" and by the  flow of Haitians.    Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Government dedicates  virtually 25 million pesos ($2 million) a month to maintaining  border security.    All of these inconveniences have been heightened in the past  months by the campaign for the upcoming general elections, which  will be held this coming Monday in the Dominican Republic.    U.S. diplomatic sources, who chose to remain anonymous,  confirmed to EFE that the Dominican Government "suggested" to  the United States that it refrain from making "any move" on  Haiti before the Dominican elections.</p>

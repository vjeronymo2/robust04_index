			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Drugs summit rebuff for the US US proposals to allow cross-border pursuit of drug traffickers in Latin America have been dropped from the draft declaration for the seven-nation drugs summit convening today in San Antonio, Texas. Unless revived at the two-day summit, the dropping of the US proposals represents a victory for the three Andean countries which produce the overwhelming majority of the world's coca, the leaf from which cocaine is derived. Peru, Bolivia and Colombia saw the proposals as potential US threats to their sovereignty. US-drafted 'talking points' used as the basis for pre-San Antonio negotiations earlier this month in Quito, had pressed for formation of a 'regional conference and action group' with wide powers of bilateral and multilateral sanction. Common jurisdiction over sea and airspace would, under the proposal, have allowed aircraft or warships of one member country to enter another's territory in pursuit of drugs traffickers. The Andean Commission of Jurists said that these rights 'would in fact be exercised by that member with the means and desire to execute them' - in other words, the US. All such controversial proposals have been eliminated from the joint statement, which merely calls for 'mutual co-operation .. with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our nations'. In addition to the US and the three Andean coca producers who met at the last drugs summit in Cartagena two years ago, the presidents of Mexico and Ecuador will attend. The Venezuelan president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, was also due to attend, although is reported to have changed his plans after this month's coup attempt. The draft declaration 'vigorously' reaffirms the Cartagena declaration of two years ago. It claims advances - some of which are disputed elsewhere - in reducing production of and demand for coca and areas under cultivation, in creating alternative development programmes and in dismantling transnational drugs trafficking organisations and financial networks. The declaration, however, admits that the Cartagena objectives on coca crop substitution 'have not been altogether fulfilled'. It expresses hopes that an 'important new initiative' for training, technical assistance in marketing and animal and plant health will improve matters. The Andean countries call for, and the US takes note of, the need for an 'Alternative Development Facility' under the umbrella of an international financial institution. This would provide short-term financing until alternative development plans mature. The heads of state call upon the countries of Europe and Asia, expanding markets for cocaine, to co-operate in the fight against drugs. But success in the fight is principally depicted economically, as dependent upon 'strong economies and innovative economic initiatives'.</p>

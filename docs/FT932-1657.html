			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / US privatisation fund for Russia to be scaled down US plans for a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) privatisation fund for Russia will be scaled back to about Dollars 500m at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, Mr Kabun Muto, the Japanese foreign minister, said yesterday, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. The US launched the idea, without warning, at the April meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo. Since then, US officials had suggested they were making headway in persuading other members of the G7 to contribute to the fund in spite of the deep scepticism among Japan, Germany and Britain. Mr Muto said in a speech in Tokyo that the idea of a Dollars 4bn fund was preposterous. He added that Japan would not contribute any new money to a smaller fund because of its territorial dispute with Russia over the four Kurile islands.</p>

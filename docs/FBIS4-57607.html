			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- The Haitian Army has  been on maximum alert since Friday, according to reliable  sources in Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, acting President Emile  Jonaissaint's government, which has no international  recognition, threatened to enforce grave punishment against  those who "contact the enemies of the homeland or one of their  agents."    Numerous groups of armed military, many of them in civilian  garb, circulated through the streets of the capital on Sunday.  Information, Culture, and Coordination Minister Jacques  Saint-Louis recalled in a communique that "contacts to let the  enemy enter the national territory" or seize military facilities  will be sentenced to "hard labor for life." The same punishment  may befall those who have "delivered blueprints" to the enemy,  the communique adds, without specifying who the enemy is.    The law will also be inflexible concerning those who try to  "undermine the fidelity of officers, soldiers, and Navy  members." The document states "any type of offense, insult, or  threat against a public force officer will be punished by  between one to six months in prison" and "between one to three  years" if the perpetrator is a member of the legislative branch.    If "the crime or felony of rebellion is confirmed in  speeches  or public documents, the perpetrator will be punished with a  minimum of six days and a maximum of one year in prison,  provided the rebellion did not occur," it adds.    "Revoked civilian or military officials who continue to  exercise their functions after their replacement will be  punished with between six months and two years in prison,"  warned Saint-Louis, although the government of Prime Minister  Robert Malval, who resigned, is the only one which received  international recognition.    The communique was issued 24 hours after the enforcement of  what is practically a total embargo against Haiti to force the  military to abandon power, while a small but influential  minority continually pressures the White House to intervene  militarily in the Caribbean country.</p>

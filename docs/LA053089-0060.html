			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAXMAN MAY ENTER RACE FOR NO. 3 POST OF HOUSE WHIP  </P> <P> With House Democrats possibly facing a complete overhaul of their leadership  team this week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said Monday that he may  jump into the contest for the No. 3 post of majority whip.  </P> <P> The current whip, Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), announced Friday that he is  resigning from Congress rather than go through a prolonged ethics inquiry into  a $100,000 junk bond investment.  </P> <P> Waxman, an influential leader on health and environmental issues, said that he  is getting a "favorable response" to the idea of joining what is now a  three-way race for whip and will make up his mind within a few days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Geographical Balance  </P> <P> The Californian, a liberal from the largest state delegation in the House,  argued that he would give "ideological and geographical balance" to a  prospective new House Democratic leadership team headed by moderates from  Washington state and Missouri.  </P> <P> With House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) expected to resign, possibly Wednesday,  in an ethics scandal over his finances, Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) is  regarded as certain to move into the job. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is  considered likely to succeed Foley as majority leader.  </P> <P> Waxman, explaining his contention that he would provide geographical balance as  whip, said in an interview: "Although Washington state is on the same coast as  California, no one thinks of them as the same. California is unique."  </P> <P> When reminded that Southern Democrats are insisting that their region continue  to be represented in the leadership after Wright's departure, Waxman asserted  that Gephardt could fill the role because "Missouri is, in some sense,  Southern."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big State Delegation  </P> <P> In any case, Waxman said, it is important for California to hold onto a  leadership post because its 27 Democrats make up more than one-tenth of the  House total of 260.  </P> <P> Already seeking the whip post are Reps. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.), David E.  Bonior (D-Mich.) and William H. Gray III (D-Pa.).  </P> <P> Coelho, who became whip in 1986, faces a preliminary criminal investigation by  the Justice Department concerning the purchase of a $100,000 junk bond,  underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with the help of a $50,000 loan  from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn.  </P> <P> If he runs for whip, Waxman may run into questions about his own involvement  with Drexel, which is facing federal charges of securities fraud.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a Drexel representative enlisted Waxman to write to the  Securities and Exchange Commission, demanding that the agency abandon efforts  to force Drexel to move its high-yield junk bond department from Beverly Hills  to the firm's headquarters in New York.  </P> <P> Signing the letter with Waxman were six other Los Angeles area congressmen,  including House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Senators Also Sent Letters  </P> <P> California Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson wrote similar letters --  Cranston at the request of Coelho, who had been contacted by Los Angeles Mayor  Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Waxman, who received $5,000 in speech honorariums and $500 in campaign  contributions from Drexel in 1987, said Monday that he did not expect the  letter to create problems because "I was only helping constituents" who work at  the Beverly Hills office.  </P> <P> In 1978, Waxman captured the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce  subcommittee on health and the environment in a brilliant but controversial  election coup. Opponents charged that Waxman had bought the plum post by making  campaign contributions to colleagues from a personal political action committee  financed by special interests.  </P> <P> Waxman acknowledged Monday that the contributions "did help me because the  people I gave to at that particular time would not have returned to office if  they had not had that support."  </P> <P> Like other ambitious House members, Waxman still contributes to numerous  Democratic candidates from his personal PAC -- a fund that is separate from his  campaign committee. As in 1978, the PAC contributions could provide crucial  support for Waxman if he decides to run for whip.  </P> <P> In commenting on the ethics uproar that has distracted Congress from most other  business, Waxman said that "we need to get an ethics bill passed that clarifies  some of the loopholes that seem to be in the law. We have to try to restore  some of the public confidence in government."  </P> <P> He supported ethics investigations into "legitimate problems," noting the  Wright case specifically, but deplored indications that both Democrats and  Republicans may seek further partisan inquiries.  </P> <P> "The House has a lot of important issues to fight about, but not this (ethics)  on a partisan basis," he said.  </P></p>

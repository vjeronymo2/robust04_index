			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (11): All change in deepest Leicestershire - At Caterpillar, near Leicester, the product line has been changed and the union has accepted derecognition / Construction Equipment I: Caterpillar (UK) Workers at Caterpillar's Desford plant near Leicester hit the headlines in January after accepting lump-sum payments in what was widely seen as a quid-pro-quo for union derecognition. In reality, says Mr Jerry Swan, managing director of Caterpillar (UK), it was recognition of employees' contribution to the company last year. It was also an acknowledgement after the event of a series of changes over the past few years at the plant, affecting everything from manufacturing methods to products and culture. The changes, in combination with a corporate reorganisation at Cat and the US company's much vaunted seven-year Plant With A Future (PWAF) programme, have brought big improvements in productivity and profitability, but have also shown the importance of listening to customers, For more than 20 years, the plant has been making lift-trucks, but production is now tailing off following Cat's decision to put its lift-truck operations into a global joint venture with Mitsubishi of Japan. Within months, therefore, production at the plant will be concentrated on small backhoe loaders and wheeled loaders. Cat began producing backhoe loaders at the plant in 1985, and decided it made best economic sense to be an assembly operation, buying virtually everything in from outside suppliers or other Cat plants. There is hardly a machine tool in the entire factory. It was not until 1989, however, when a reorganisation across Cat worldwide put the Desford plant into a new decentralised building construction products division, that it began to understand by talking to its customers why the market for smaller machines is so different from that for larger plant. 'That investigation had a big impact,' says Mr Swan, because Cat realised the vital importance of controlling costs in a market where margins are tight. Its backhoes cost about Pounds 26,000-Pounds 28,000, no more than a top of the range Rover 800, and customers are very price-sensitive. As a direct result of this, Cat closed a plant in Brampton, Ontario and set about aggressively reducing costs, working with its suppliers to change product designs, pruning support costs and only retaining activities that added value. At Desford, some Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m - a drop in the ocean compared with the overall Dollars 1.8bn for PWAF, which was completed last year - was spent on an automated storage system, and manufacturing has been reorganised, moving away from a straightforward production line to a flexible system where the machines are carried by self-guided vehicles from one team of multi-skilled workers to the next. Using modular assembly methods, the system gives the flexibility necessary to handle the different options available to customers, such as four-wheel drive etc. The new system of manufacturing came on line in August 1992, just after Mr Swan took over at Caterpillar (UK), with the introduction of a new backhoe loader model, the B series. Success now depends crucially on the German-built storage system, which is helping the company keep stocks to a minimum. After initial teething problems, it is working well, says Mr Colin Meddows-Smith, business manager for backhoe loaders. But it also depends on people. Mr Swan emphasises that a lot of time and effort has been put into developing employee involvement and creating a framework in which teamwork can flourish. The original management team of 24 has been halved as responsibilities have been delegated and the management structure flattened. The benefits of the new system were shown last year when a new product line  -small wheeled loaders - was switched to Desford from Cat's Gosselies plant in Belgium, which is more geared to producing larger equipment. The wheeled loaders are now being built almost entirely on the same assembly route as the backhoe loaders. This has enabled the plant to utilise its assets better, says Mr Swan. It also led to a small increase in employment, although overall employment on-site has fallen by 300 to 850 since 1991 because of the phased exit from lift truck production. In financial terms, the result of the changes has been a steady improvement in profitability, says Mr Swan. Aggressive targets have been set for return on assets and cash flow, and productivity has risen by about 15 per cent since the new manufacturing methods were introduced. Significantly, the plant is now structured in such a way that it can break even when demand falls - important in a boom and bust business such as construction equipment. Conversely, it has the flexibility to expand quickly when demand picks up - a high proportion of output from Desford is now being exported to the US which has recovered early, and strongly, from the recession.</p>

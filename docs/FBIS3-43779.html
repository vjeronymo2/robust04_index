Three hours of discussions failed to resolve the issue. In the  face of the seriousness of the situation and the urgent need to  find a solution as soon as possible, it was decided to form a  select committee charged with meeting the prime minister, with a  view to informing him of the demands of the Niger Schools'  Union. These demands are preconditions for a return to a normal  school situation.    It may be recalled that the Niger Schools' Union is  demanding  the reopening of the University of Niamey, the payment of  scholarship arrears of 1.5 billion CFA francs, the payment of  five months of allowances, and the payment of 96 million CFA  francs in registration fees. The school partners are to meet  the prime minister after the meeting.</p>

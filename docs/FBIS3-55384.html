			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov] </F>   [Text] The summit of the presidents of Russia and the  United States in Moscow on the 12-15 January will follow on the  heels of the conference of leaders of NATO in Brussels, where  the American concept of Partnership for Peace will be discussed.  Vladislav Kozyakov examines these two events and he writes:    It can safely be predicted that the talks between the  presidents of Russia and the United States, Boris Yeltsin and  Bill Clinton, will be influenced to a very large extent by what  happens in the two preceding days in the Belgian capital.    Russia is worried about information that Western leaders are  looking into requests by a number of East European countries for  membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On  Wednesday, an official reaction to this issue was made known by  the publication of a statement by a presidential press  secretary. The Russian president warned that an expansion of  NATO might lead to a military-political destabilization in key  regions of the world.    True, Washington says it does not intend at present to  support the admission of new members into the alliance. At this  stage, in place of full membership, America is offering the  concept of Partnership for Peace to the newly independent states  of Eastern Europe.    However, this American concept needs further clarification.  It has not been fine-tuned, so to speak, and details have not  been agreed between NATO's members.    The temporary character of the Partnership for Peace also  deserves some attention. After a period, according to this  American concept, all countries wishing to join NATO will be  admitted.    It's paradoxical that in the changing cirsumstances of the  present world, it's precisely NATO that is involved in  generating a feeling of apprehension in Europe. In its time the  establishment of this military bloc drew a corresponding  response and led to the establishment of the Warsaw Pact. Then  followed decades of confrontation. Now at the end of the Cold  War, when NATO has no Warsaw Pact to contend with, it's causing  anxiety with its prospects of an expansion of its membership and  drawing closer to the Russian borders.    The question arises, Why should the stereotypes of bloc  mentality be kept alive in Europe. If Partnership for Peace  intends to establish a system of security in Europe, Russia  including, then why must this system be based on a military  organization of Western Europe.    This question becomes more relevant as a new actual system  is  already in existence. It's the Council for North Atlantic  Cooperation, in whose ranks are NATO members as well as  countries in the former Warsaw Pact.    Why should not the Partnership for Peace see as its final  objective not admission of new members into NATO but the  creation of an all-embracing collective security in Europe and  in the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok, developing for this  project the North Atlantic Cooperation Council? This would be  quite in the spirit of the Council for Security and Cooperation  in Europe.    In Moscow there is support for the American concept of  Partnership for Peace. However, this idea must not be a  prisoner of the bloc mentality. It must take into account the  security interests of all governments without exception.  Partnership for Peace should orientate itself to the creation  of a new mechanism for the provision of security for Europe and  the world.    The new time and the new situation in Europe demands a fresh  untried approach to the problem of cementing peace and the  development of cooperation. To act from a bloc position in this  new era would be at least unrealistic.</p>

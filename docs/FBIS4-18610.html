			<p>BFN     [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has written to  President Clinton explaining the background to the IRA's 72 hour  ceasefire, according to a report today.    The report in today's Irish Times newspaper says the letter  is known to have been delivered in the past few days to a senior  member of the White House staff.    Mr Adams is said to have outlined to the president the  circumstances behind the IRA's suspension of violence -- still  holding on its second day -- and set out in detail the position  of Sinn Fein.    He is also reported to have emphasised that the IRA was  showing a willingness and flexibility despite criticism of the  brevity of the ceasefire.    Mr Adams sent a letter to Prime Minister John Major  yesterday  urging him to authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein, but Downing  Street again said there could be no such discussions unless  violence was halted permanently.    In today's report, the Irish Times said it was not known if  Mr Adams's letter had been read personally by the President.    But the U.S. Administration was not expected to respond, it  added.    It said leading Irish-American figures had been noticeably  silent on Sinn Fein's call for clarification of the Downing  Street Declaration.    Influential Senator Edward Kennedy is also reported to have  had a letter from Mr Adams and told the newspaper he hoped all  sides would redouble their efforts. But he stopped short of  calling on Britain to provide clarification.    Dublin premier Albert Reynolds, on holiday in Cyprus, has  repeated through a government spokesman his appeal to the IRA  for a longer ceasefire.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds hit by sellers AFTER announcing interim results, Lloyds Bank was left largely friendless, and the share price was driven down 25 to 557p in the highest turnover for several months at 9.3m. Some analysts were puzzled at the market's reaction to the figures, which they considered dull rather than too disappointing for a sector which is generally going through a tough period. At first the results were cautiously received; then a fuller slide took shape in later trading as profit-takers moved in. While many specialists believe the stock to be fully-valued at its present level, few were willing to take too negative a tack. Mr Richard Coleman at James Capel, retaining his hold stance, said: 'It is still very tough in UK banking as a whole - it is over-supplied. But Lloyds still has the highest yield in the sector.' One analyst said he was considering changing the recommendation on Lloyds from a switch/sell to a hold, while another added: 'I don't know what people were expecting. These figures were in line with forecasts.' Analysts meet the bank on Monday and will hold off any reviews of their gradings until then.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Yamaichi Securities names new president YAMAICHI Securities, one of Japan's big four brokers, yesterday appointed Mr Atsuo Miki, 56, to become its president in June this year. The move comes at a time when Japanese securities houses have not been able to restore their marred images from last year's stock scandals, and face faltering profits due to the ongoing slump in the stock market. Yamaichi is the only member of the big four - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi - to project a pre-tax earnings loss, the first since the company was restructured in the 1960s during a stock market crisis. The company expects a pre-tax loss of Y34bn (Dollars 255m) and a net loss of Y52bn. Mr Miki, currently vice-president of Yamaichi, will replace Mr Tsugio Yukihira, who will become chairman. With Yamaichi's shift in management, all of the presidents of the big four have been replaced within the past year. Mr Miki said he intends to place special focus on staff education and retail business to overcome current difficulties.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: MAKING LESS SEEM LIKE MORE FOR A MOTHER'S DAY FETE  </P> <P> Planning a Mother's Day lunch for dieting mothers is no easy task when finicky,  calorie-conscious guests will be invited. There are so many people today whose  tireless efforts to lose weight will not be recessed -- even on a special  occasion such as this -- that ingenuity on the part of the host is a  prerequisite.  </P> <P> It is, however, possible to make guests feel secure about indulging while still  making the occasion a special one. A simple menu built around salads or light  entrees is a delicious way to do it.  </P> <P> These are not the take-out variety of salads, which often are loaded with  hidden fat from ingredients such as mayonnaise, oil-rich dressings, bacon,  eggs, avocados and the like. This list includes recipes that capitalize on  creative combinations of taste and texture. A medley of warm and cold, sweet  and savory that will make everyone feel safe, yet satisfied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crowned With Slender Dressing  </P> <P> The glamorous recipes offered here take advantage of inherently low-fat protein  sources like skinned chicken, turkey and seafood and combines them with fresh  fruit and vegetables. Some moderately lean items such as beef and veal also are  featured. Each of the salads is crowned with a slender dressing, then served  with sparkling apple cider, crusty French bread and fresh fruit as fitting, but  optional, accompaniments to an elegant and festive bill of fare.  </P> <P> Select one or two or more from the recipes that follow and serve with a tossed  green salad and commercial diet dressing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPINACH SALAD WITH FRUIT AND BEEF  </P> <P> 1 pound beef top round steak  </P> <P> Poppy Seed Dressing or Sherry Vinaigrette or Honey-Yogurt Dressing  </P> <P> 1 bunch spinach leaves, stems removed  </P> <P> 2 medium oranges, peeled and thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 basket strawberries, sliced  </P> <P> Trim excess fat from steak.

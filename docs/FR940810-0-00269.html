Route of Entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Inhalation, ingestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> II. Toxicology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to asbestos is present in the form of several well-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers, family contacts of workers, and persons living near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos mines. These studies have shown a definite association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between exposure to asbestos and an increased incidence of lung  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, gastrointestinal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a disabling fibrotic lung  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease that is caused only by exposure to asbestos. Exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos has also been associated with an increased incidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and buccal cavity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancers. As with other known chronic occupational diseases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease associated with asbestos generally appears about 20 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the first occurrence of exposure: There are no known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acute effects associated with exposure to asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among exposed workers who smoke cigarettes is greatly increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the risk of lung cancer among non-exposed smokers or exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonsmokers. These studies suggest that cessation of smoking will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the risk of lung cancer for a person exposed to asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but will not reduce it to the same level of risk as that existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an exposed worker who has never smoked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. Signs and Symptoms of Exposure Related Disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The signs and symptoms of lung cancer or gastrointestinal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer induced by exposure to asbestos are not unique, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a chest X-ray of an exposed patient with lung cancer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show pleural plaques, pleural calcification, or pleural fibrosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Symptoms characteristic of mesothelioma include shortness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breath, pain in the walls of the chest, or abdominal pain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mesothelioma has a much longer latency period compared with lung  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer (40 years versus 15&hyph;20 years), and mesothelioma is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore more likely to be found among workers who were first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed to asbestos at an early age. Mesothelioma is always  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asbestosis is pulmonary fibrosis caused by the accumulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos fibers in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breath, coughing, fatigue, and vague feelings of sickness. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fibrosis worsens, shortness of breath occurs even at rest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diagnosis of asbestosis is based on a history of exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos, the presence of characteristics radiologic changes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end-inspiratory crackles (rales), and other clinical features of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrosing lung disease. Pleural plaques and thickening are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed on X-rays taken during the early sates of the disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asbestosis is often a progressive disease even in the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued exposure, although this appears to be a highly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individualized characteristic. In severe cases, death may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by respiratory or cardiac failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, exposure to asbestos have been linked to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer, and asbestosis among occupationally exposed workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adequate screening tests to determine an employee's potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing serious chronic diseases, such as a cancer, from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to asbestos do not presently exist. However, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, particularly chest X-rays and pulmonary function tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may indicate that an employee has been overexposed to asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing his or her risk of developing exposure related chronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diseases. It is important for the physician to become familiar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the operating conditions in which occupational exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos is likely to occur. This is particularly important in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating medical and work histories and in conducting physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations. When an active employee has been identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having been overexposed to asbestos measures taken by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer to eliminate or mitigate further exposure should also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower the risk of serious long-term consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

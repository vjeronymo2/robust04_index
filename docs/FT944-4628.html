			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Milestone for Australian investors - The country's first publicly-funded infrastructure project is about to start trading If all goes smoothly, the Australian stock market could pass a milestone during the next few weeks when shares in Hills Motorway, the country's first publicly-listed infrastructure project, start trading. A public market for infrastructure-related securities is nothing new to investors in the US, who have invested in development projects for decades. In the UK, the concept is also familiar: Eurotunnel, for example, floated seven years ago. In Australia, however, the notion of private infrastructure funding is relatively new, and the launch of the Hills Motorway Trust will be a closely-watched event. At the centre of this new-found interest is the M2 Motorway, a tranche of four-lane expressway with a two-lane busway and combined bicycle and breakdown lane, to be built on Sydney's North Shore. It will operate as a toll-road and run for about 20 kilometres. If planners' dreams come to fruition, the M2 will ultimately form part of an orbital ring road around the congested metropolitan area. The Hills Motorway Trust, which is responsible for financing the project, and the associated Hills Motorway Limited, which will supervise the construction and ongoing operation of the road, were set up by Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank. Its consortium won the right to handle the project from the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) earlier this year. The project itself is fairly straightforward. Construction of the road, due to be completed in late-1997, will be handled by Abigroup, a local publicly-listed construction group, and Japan's Obayashi Corporation. Subsequent operation and maintenance of the toll-road for the next 35 to 45 years will be parcelled out to Abigroup and Transroute, the European motorway operator. What makes the M2 noteworthy is the structure of the funding. Out of a total project cost of around ADollars 650m (USDollars 500.7m), the Hills consortium is finding approximately ADollars 500m. In casting around for these funds, bankers say they canvassed local institutional investors, and encountered a number of requests, including one for a yield from day one, and a request that there be a public market for the securities. Partly to meet these requests, the funding was spilt into three parts: ADollars 111m of term debt; ADollars 200m of inflation-linked, or 'CPI', bonds; and ADollars 155m of equity, with sponsors contributing a further ADollars 30m. The use of CPI bonds was fairly obvious, since increases in the tolls and the main operating costs will also be inflation-linked. More unusually, by using an internal infrastructure loan which takes advantage of tax concessions introduced by the federal government to encourage capital investments, the project will pay tax-free dividends on the equity units during the three-year construction phase. The yield, at the application price, will be 10 per cent. (Once the motorway is built, revenue from the tolls will provide the income stream.) Potential takers for the equity were found earlier this year, and the CPI bonds are underwritten. Now private investors are being offered the opportunity to subscribe for a small portion of the equity. The whole process has been not without controversy. On the one hand, environmentalists have objected to another big road cutting through Sydney. Part of the land on which the motorway will be built has also been subject to a native title claim. If this is successful, the RTA could be obliged to pay compensation to the Aboriginal people involved, although the motorway itself should not be affected directly. On the financial front, Macquarie admits some institutions were reluctant to commit funds. It blamed this partly on scepticism about the traffic projections and partly, perhaps, on unfamiliarity with this type of project. Some of the large life insurance companies were particularly hesitant, it says. More recently, there has also been dispute with the Australian Stock Exchange over what shares could be made available to the public as part of the listing process. The original plan was for about a quarter of the institutions' holding to be sold on to the public at a premium to the original application price. However, this would have meant that the remaining shares were subsequently 'escrowed' and untradable for a quite a while. In the end, Macquarie gave up 1.326m securities which it would have taken on to its own books. These will be sold to the public at the same ADollars 1 application price which institutions were offered. An even bigger question is whether this launch heralds a meaningful 'infrastructure' sector on the ASX. This seems a strong possibility. Changes to Australia's pension arrangements mean that institutionally-managed superannuation funds are booming. Having come from virtually nothing to ADollars 190bn over the past decade, they are forecast to reach around ADollars 400bn by the year 2000. Some of the larger fund management groups, moreover, have already earmarked infrastructure investments as an area for attention. Lend Lease, for example, has formed a joint venture with GE Capital to invest is such projects, while the AMP, the big life group, has formalised an infrastructure group within its investment division. On the other side, state governments, worried about budget deficits, are fairly keen to tap private-sector funds. Indeed, next off the block could be a much larger tollway project - the southern/western bypass around Melbourne.</p>

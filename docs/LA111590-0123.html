			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW 'ARTURO UI';  </P> <P> POWERFUL BRECHT;  </P> <P> THE DIRECTOR HAS MANAGED TO SQUEEZE ARTISTIC BLOOD OUT OF THIS POLEMICAL  TURNIP.  </P> <P> Should the theater be appropriated to promote the interests of politics,  religion, advertising or anything whatever, except art? One of the functions of  the critic is to raise that question.  </P> <P> Patrons arriving at the Studio Theater are confronted with huge placards  exhibiting blown-up newspaper and magazine articles entitled "The Roots of  Skinhead Violence," "The American Neo-Nazi Movement Today" and "Peril from an  Imperial President." The last, a denunciation of President Bush's current  Middle East policy.  </P> <P> A press release informs us that visiting director Frank Condon "has become  known as a master of blending exciting entertainment with politically  controversial and challenging content."  </P> <P> Inside is the worst dialectical theater piece Bertolt Brecht ever wrote, "The  Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui." Brecht himself had so little regard for this  play that it was never produced in his lifetime, never underwent final revision  -- much less the 20 to 30 revisions per play he was known for.  </P> <P> In the hands of a second-rate director, all of the above would be a recipe for  disaster.  </P> <P> But, in fact, Condon is an artist of a director. He has managed to squeeze  copious amounts of artistic blood out of this polemical turnip.  </P> <P> Sharp, clean, astringent, visually and aurally striking, with every theatrical  element dynamically fused, this is a textbook example, a paradigm, a veritable  monument to the art of Brechtian theater. An educational video should be made,  students from other schools should be bused in. One would have to go to Theatre  am Schiffsbauerdamm in Berlin to see Brecht this pristine.  </P> <P> All the famous Brechtian devices are lined up like an arsenal: naked lighting,  documentary film, placards, a narrator, alienation, musuk (background music  that does not engage the emotions), continuous brutality, graphic violence,  caricature, allusive names, agitprop crudeness and the brusque,  brain-staggering illogic of propaganda plays.  </P> <P> Set in Chicago (Germany) in the 1930s, a two-bit gangster Arturo Ui (Hitler)  and his gang (Nazis) wrest control of the Cauliflower Trust (wealthy landowners  and industrialists) from Dogsborou (Reich Pesident von Hindenburg), burn down  the warehouse (the Reichstag fire), kill Dullfet (Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss)  and take over the act in neighboring Cicero (Austria).  </P> <P> Ui, well played by Jason Cottle, is Chaplinesque. But lest we miss the point,  we are squarely hit over the head with several baseball bats in the form of  documentary footage of Hitler projected on a hanging video screen and ongoing  commentary by the narrator delivered in an odd style that can only be described  as manic smugness.  </P> <P> High production standards are provided by Michael Devine, scenery; Dunya  Ramicova, costumes; Tim Becker, lighting; Carol Whaley, makeup and hair design;  Michael Mortilla, music, and Ralf Remshardt, acting as dramaturge.  </P> <P> While slick packaging can momentarily sway judgment, ultimately the salient  truth here is that Brecht has survived when myriad agitprop playwrights have  fallen into obscurity. The reason is that Brecht at his worst still has enough  vestiges of artistic genius to cast a powerful spell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> SOLD OUT  </P> <P> "THE RESISTIBLE RISE OF ARTURO UI," by Bertolt Brecht, translated by Ralph  Mannheim, directed by Frank Condon. At the UC Santa Barbara Studio Theater,  Santa Barbara, through Nov. 17 at 8 p.m. Ticket prices $7, general, $6,  students and seniors. Telephone (805) 893-3535.  </P></p>

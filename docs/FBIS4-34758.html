			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Samper from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] At the latest working day of the second round table  held with the Cuban Government, which was organized by the  British financial magazine THE ECONOMIST, Cuban Foreign  Relations Minister Roberto Robaina explained the island's  foreign policies and other immigration and blockade issues.  Questioned by the media, Robaina said this type of meeting is  held only when a country inspires confidence and security for  businessmen, who have realized there are true investment  opportunities here. Due to Cuba's proximity to Caribbean Basin  countries, Robaina commented on Caribbean ties.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] Fortunately, we are climbing a  path toward normalizing and broadening relations, and we are  about to make a very important decision for the Caribbean and  Cuba, which not only receives from the Caribbean, but -- to be  modest -- also has many things to offer to the Caribbean. We  are about to create the Caribbean States Association, thereby  taking one important and valid step toward joining the process  to participate in the world economy.    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] and Cuba and the  United States could become trade partners in view of the first  [words indistinct]    [Robaina] I do not believe in establishing normal relations  with the United States. We have a document listing those  countries that were with us when we were being besieged. Those  countries that helped us when we were being blockaded will  continue to play a special role. As for establishing relations  with the United States, it may or may not happen; it may come or  it may not. To us, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada  will always be Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada, because  they supported us first.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Robaina] We will not negotiate the establishment of  diplomatic relations. These are things that go without saying;  they go without saying insofar as the process to establish  relations advances. We can say that we maintain diplomatic  relations with China and Belize and that we have contacts with  Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Establishing  ties, however, is not part of our plans. We do not want anyone  to feel pressured by Cuba, which maintains relations with 147  countries. I believe that should we talk about isolation, we  would be the most supported isolated nation.    [Reporter] As for last week's OAS meeting held in Belem,  Brazil, how do you view Cuba's role within the OAS? How do you  view Cuba's rejoining the OAS? What are the steps you think  Cuba will take in the near future?    [Robaina] As far as Cuba is concerned, we will not take any  steps. Being part of an organization that expelled us is not  one of our priorities. I believe it is the OAS that must decide  whether the conditions to amend an unfair decision have already  been met. I believe the OAS will have to make a decision; only  then will we issue our opinion. We have much more important  priorities than joining the OAS.    [Reporter] As for the U.S. blockade on Cuba, when do you  believe it will be lifted?    [Robaina] I believe this is an important question because  our  front-door neighbors are the ones blockading us. You will have  to ask the same question to the United States with as much  fervor as you are asking me now. I believe, however, that  sooner or later the U.S. blockade will be lifted; this is a  situation that cannot go on forever, but we do not expect the  blockade to be lifted sooner rather than later. I believe the  U.S. Government is still refusing to lift it. For the first  time, however, public opinion and U.S. businessmen and  businesswomen are beginning to reject this policy because Cuba  is not the only one that is blockaded; they are as blockaded as  we are. In the country of freedom, they cannot visit Cuba; in  the country of freedom, they cannot invest here. In other  words, we Cubans are blockaded, and so are they.    [Reporter] Can Cuba survive five more years of U.S.  blockade?    [Robaina] We already survived 35 years, and I think that, if  we survived 35 years under worse conditions, then five more  years is nothing. If you ask me, however, I do not want this to  happen; but we are willing to accept it. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Inn Style: The operators of inns and small hotels are using gadgetry from the  home and office to increase business. Some offer videotape rentals through gift  shops, front desks or vending machines, with outside contractors providing the  videocassette recorders and keeping tapes up to date. The arrangement frees  guests from the viewing schedules of cable television and pay-per-view movies  and, incidentally, threatens Spectradyne Inc.'s hold on the captive hotel  audience. For the business traveler, such amenities as fax machines,  photocopying and computer hookups are being offered by inns bent on competing  with the upscale chains. In a recent survey by Business Travel News, the  economy hotel with the highest rating among business travelers was Hampton Inn,  with Fairfield and Comfort Inns running second and third. Philadelphia  Inquirer, Business Travel News  </P> <P> Power Pinch: U.S. utilities seem to find themselves between a rock and a hard  place. Environmental regulations have slowed the construction of new power  plants, with many utilities running close to full capacity. At a national  conference of utilities executives, the chairman of Chicago's Commonwealth  Edison said new plants are needed to avoid blackouts similar to those  experienced in central Florida in December. Yet more stringent acid rain  legislation could prove expensive to utilities in the North and East, forcing  them to hike rates to consumers. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that  consumers would be happy about paying even more for new construction. The  outcome of debate over the federal Clean Air Act will determine the fate of  consumers' bills as well as the future of plant construction. St. Petersburg  (Fla.) Times, Des Moines (Iowa) Register  </P> <P> Too Little Snow: Mild weather in the Midwest may give farmers a chance to do  outside repairs, but it is also likely to hurt harvests in Minnesota and  Wisconsin, where the soil is as dry as has ever been recorded. Some of the  aftereffects may be fewer fish, weakened forests and higher prices for  livestock feed. Unless that part of the country gets some last-minute snow or a  very wet spring, everyone from farm equipment dealers to nature lovers will  suffer. St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch  </P></p>

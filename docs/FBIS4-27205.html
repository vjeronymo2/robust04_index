			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  has provided a total of 200 million yen to his Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] as political funds, according to Hata's report on  his assets Tuesday [31 May].    Hata has donated to Shinseito through his fund-raising  organization "Shinwakai," starting with a 20 million yen  contribution to Hata's newly created faction in the Liberal  Democratic Party in January 1993, immediately after he launched  his own group, according to Hata's Secretary Akira Makabe.    Hata's 50 million yen loan from banks, revealed in his  financial report, was lent to Shinwakai, and part of the money  was further donated to Shinseito, said Makabe, who also works  for Shinwakai.    It was the first, albeit partial, disclosure of Shinseito's  fund resources.    Shinseito, a key party in the ruling coalition headed by  Hata, is scheduled to disclose the balance sheet on its  political financing in September.    Moriyoshi Sato, director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa  Development Agencies, who handled the party financing, said he  also borrowed 100 million yen from banks last October and lent  50 million yen to the party.    "Mr. Hata and Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa are lending to the party  with borrowed money," he said. Ozawa is Shinseito's secretary  general and the main strategist in the coalition.</p>

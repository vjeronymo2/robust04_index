			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah  Khamene'i has consented to the cancellation of the holding of  the antipathy rally in response to a letter sent to the leader  by his representative and the head of the Iranian pilgrims Mr.  Reyshahri. It is worth reminding that the Saudi security  officials, by creating obstructions and by stationing forces in  combat gear and surrounding the headquarters of the  representative of the leader in the holy city of Mecca, are the  main factors in the adoption of the far-sighted decision by the  leader of the Islamic revolution. This is so because the recent  instructions of the leader of the Islamic revolution in  connection with the holding of the hajj ceremony included the  point that the Saudi officials should not be allowed to use any  pretext for breaking the sanctity of the holy House of God.    As has been cited in Mr. Reyshahri's telegram this year too,  the devoted and vigilant pilgrims from Iran and other countries  were ready to raise the secret banner of deliverance from the  idolaters and arrogance in the land of revelation by taking  inspiration from guidelines of the late Imam Khomeyni, peace be  upon him. But the Saudi military and security forces in a  provocative and irresponsible manner, and three days ahead of  the antipathy rallies surrounded the headquarters of the  representative of the leader and began controlling all movements  of the pilgrims, thus preventing the divine obligation from  being carried out.    It is surprising as well as shocking that the Muslims are  banned from holding the antipathy rally and announcing  deliverance from the pagans near the House of God. The Saudi  forces prevented the announcement of deliverance from polytheism  and arrogance headed by the U.S. and Israel by controlling the  movement of pilgrims around the headquarters of the leader's  representative and even prevented the headquarter's vehicles  from leaving or entering the area.    The oppressed silence of the world Muslims in the House of  God is far more effective than any cry and stronger than any  storm. The message of the Islamic revolution has now crossed  the geographical boundaries of Iran and has reawakened the  Muslims across the globe, giving them self-confidence. Last but  not least, the hajj rituals and rallies such as the antipathy  rally, on the one hand, provide the world Muslims to become  aware of their problems from close quarters and on the other, by  announcing their indignation over the Zionist domination, raise  the outcry of their common sufferings. Obviously unless these  sufferings and pains are treated properly to provide a basic  cure, any cry can only serve to be a temporary solution.</p>

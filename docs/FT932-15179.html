			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Attack fears after pull-out by Khmer Rouge THE WITHDRAWAL of Khmer Rouge officials from the Cambodian capital on Tuesday night has raised fears that the guerrilla group will step up attacks across Cambodia ahead of next month's UN-sponsored elections. Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, said in a letter yesterday to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who chairs Cambodia's interim Supreme National Council (SNC), that Khmer Rouge officials no longer felt secure in Phnom Penh, although the UN has blamed most of the recent violence in the country on Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The withdrawal will make it difficult for the 22,000-strong UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) to communicate with the Khmer Rouge leadership, except via Thailand. It was not immediately clear if Mr Khieu Samphan would be prepared to visit Phnom Penh to attend future meetings of the SNC, which brings together the four main factions and the UN. The attitude of the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of 1m Cambodians when it ran the country between 1975 and 1978, is regarded as crucial for the peace process because its guerrillas and the rival army of the Phnom Penh administration are the only substantial Cambodian military forces. The group has effectively pulled out of the peace process already, by seeking to disrupt the elections, refusing to disarm its fighters and rejecting UN attempts to gain access to Khmer Rouge territory. Seven UN peacekeepers have been killed in the past three weeks, and the UN blames the Khmer Rouge for most of the deaths. Yesterday Untac attempted to lure the Khmer Rouge back to its compound behind the royal palace in Phnom Penh by saying that UN forces could provide extra security for Mr Khieu Samphan and his followers. In Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries said the elections should go ahead. Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister, urged Untac to persevere because the alternative would be 'uncontrolled fighting again in Cambodia'.</p>

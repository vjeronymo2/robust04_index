			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Local pay offers for care workers Health care assistants are among the first workers in National Health Service Trusts to be offered local pay, a survey published today says. The survey of 70 trusts, published by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research organisation, showed that the health care assistant job was the one where the greatest progress was planned in the whole area of local pay. Unlike most other NHS employees, health care assistants have no national pay rates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emilio Sinclair] </F>   [Text] The National Central Organization of Panamanian  Workers (CNTP), which comprises three workers' federations and  16 unions for a total of 12,000 workers, has proclaimed its  determination to support Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares for the  presidency of the Republic.    In an "electoral communique" signed by CNTP Secretary  General  Luis Cobos R., the organization said it hopes that with this  decision "we will achieve the return of the Torrijist forces to  power to stimulate the process of national liberation."    The workers' organization also voiced its support for Andres  Vega Cedeno, also known as "Domplin," a radio commentator who is  running for mayor of Panama City; and recommended that "the  workers also vote for Felipe Cano, who is running for mayor of  San Miguelito."    As for the "candidates for 1994-1999 legislators," the CNTP  recommends that "workers and popular movements support the  candidates committed to our efforts and suggests the names of  two candidates from the Papa Egoro Movement: Norma Cano in  electoral circuit 8.6, and Rolando Miller in circuit 8.9, whom  the workers describe as "great fighters." [quotation marks as  published]    The CNTP feels that Norma Cano is a "labor leader with vast  experience," and that Rolando Miller is a union champion "who  showed ability and honesty in the struggle against the  neoliberal and persecution policies of the current regime."</p>

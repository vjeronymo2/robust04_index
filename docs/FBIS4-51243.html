			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing, May 26 (AFP)--Chinese dissidents  Thursday publicly challenged the government by calling on it to  overturn the official condemnation of the 1989 pro-democracy  movement.    Seven dissidents involved in the Tiananmen Square massacre  signed a petition submitted to the government by Wang Dan, the  former student leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy  demonstrations. [passage omitted]    Commenting on the petition at his weekly press briefing  Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the "best  judgement of an event... is history itself. For the past five  years China has been enjoying political stability, economic  development, and the living standards of its people have been  improving constantly."    China and its people wanted this to continue in the interest  of peace and stability in the region, he added.    The pro-democracy movement began April 15 and mobilised  millions of Chinese before being crushed by the People's  Liberation Army in central Beijing on June 4 1989.    According to an official version of events, 300 people died.  Dissidents and independent observers said several thousands were  killed in Beijing and the provinces.    Wang's petition said: "This movement was a popular,  patriotic  and democratic movement, based around students. We were  reasonable and non-violent throughout."    As proof of just how worried the authorities are as the  Tiananmen anniversary draws closer, Beijing police have been  placed on permanent alert and have beefed up patrols, especially  around the main campuses and the huge square itself, which was  occupied by students in 1989.    University professors have received orders to be especially  vigilant in the run-up to the annniversary.    In order to prevent public commemorations, the authorities  have detained a number of people in the past weeks, especially  members of the Chinese Association of Human Rights in Shanghai.    The most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, has been detained  by police at a government residence in a Beijing suburb.  [passage omitted]</p>

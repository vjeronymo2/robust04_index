			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Smith New Court The small proportion of shareholders who declined to take up Smith New Court's rights issue in June must be kicking themselves. Even after yesterday's round of profit-taking, the shares stand at almost double the 210p rights price. Rising world equity markets can take much of the credit. The upward march on the shares was notably halted in September and November, when UK equities were weak. While the market is bubbling, though, cost control is perhaps the biggest management challenge. On the basis of yesterday's half-year figures, Smith's traders and analysts will be among those City folk looking forward to bumper bonuses in the New Year. Since staff costs make up 75 per cent of Smith's controllable costs, wage inflation is a serious threat. But big bonuses will not worry shareholders if basic salaries and the formula linking bonus payments to profits remain firmly under control. Smith makes undisclosed provisions for bonuses throughout the year, so second-half profits should not buckle under the strain of one-off payments. The worry is that the shares still behave like a geared play on UK equities, despite its efforts at diversification overseas. It is odds-on that Smith will under-perform again should the London market hit a sticky patch.</p>

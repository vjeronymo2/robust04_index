			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Bringing PSBR back to balance Fiscal stance: The government aims to 'bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term' and ensure 'the public sector borrows no more than is required to finance its net capital spending'. Page 36 Spending squeezed: Planned general government expenditure next year is Pounds 3.8bn lower than previously forecast, Pounds 2.1bn lower in 1995-96 and Pounds 4.4bn lower in 1996-97. The control total for next year has been reduced to Pounds 251.3bn, Pounds 3.6bn below the level announced in March and a fall in real terms of 1 1/4 per cent. For 1995-96 and 1996-97 the control totals will be Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn lower. This should reduce total spending from 45 per cent of GDP this financial year to 41 per cent in 1998-99. Taxes up: The bulk of the fiscal tightening comes from higher taxes. Taxes go up by an extra Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95, Pounds 4.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6.1bn in 1996-97. Combined with the tax increases announced in March, total taxes will rise by Pounds 8.5bn next year rising to Pounds 16.4bn in 1996-97.

PSBR cut: Public borrowing, including privatisation proceeds, falls from Pounds 50bn this year to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95 - 5.5 per cent of GDP - Pounds 6.5bn lower than forecast last March. The 1996-97 forecast deficit is Pounds 21bn, 2 3/4 per cent of GDP and Pounds 13bn lower than forecast. By 1998-99 the PSBR should fall to  1/4 per cent of GDP, while taxes exceed current spending in 1997-98. The chancellor suspended the full-funding rule, saying he will sell Pounds 7bn fewer gilts next year than would otherwise be needed to fund the PSBR.

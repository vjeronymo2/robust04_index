			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OAK TREE IS SYMBOL OF A FREE ARMENIA  </P> <P> Just over two years ago, when sixth-grader Taleen Tertzakian visited her  ancestral homeland, she stood in awe of a statue of Mother Armenia in the city  of Leninakan.  </P> <P> "It was beautiful," she said. "I was real happy."  </P> <P> Just a month after her visit, the city was among those hardest hit by the  Armenian earthquake, killing approximately 25,000 and devastating entire  villages. But the statue of Mother Armenia survived. On Friday, that was a  special memory in Taleen's mind as she and just over 100 students at Ari  Guiragos Minassian Armenian School in Santa Ana remembered the devasting quake  on its second anniversary. Carrying Armenian and U.S. flags, the students  planted a new oak in front of a church adjacent to the school, and prayed for a  new, independent and prosperous Armenia.  </P> <P> "This is a symbol of how the new Armenia will grow," Taleen said after she had  placed a red rose near the newly planted oak. "I'm always going to stay  Armenian."  </P> <P> Although most students didn't know or had never met their relatives in the  hardest-hit areas, they said they felt a special kinship to them, especially  after the earthquake.  </P> <P> "I felt sad because all the innocent people died," said sixth-grader Hovsep  Dakirmenjian, 12, of Santa Ana, the student council president. "There was no  notice (of the tragedy). This tree will keep that memory alive and will grow  with the students."  </P> <P> "We have faith that one day we will go home and live in our home country that  will be our own," Hovsep said.  </P> <P> The ceremony also was filled with hope, particularly because of a new spirit of  nationalism that has arisen in the last few years.  </P> <P> "I feel kind of sad because of all the Armenians that died," said Taline  Khojikian, who is the fourth grade. "My family was sad. But pretty soon the  Armenians will be back to normal."  </P> <P> At a church service after the tree-planting, however, the students and some  parents were reminded of the hardships of Armenians because of the dismal state  of the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> "There are a half-million homeless," said Sarkis Yegenian of Cowan Heights,  president of the school board. "Two years now, they are still in tents."  </P> <P> "Right now, it's a complete mess, as are the other republics," said Taleen's  mother, Sylvie Tertzakian, who visited Armenia in October with her husband,  Garo.  </P> <P> On their most recent visit, the Tertzakians, who live in North Tustin, toured  hospitals and Garo, a urologist, treated dozens of patients. He had done the  same two years ago just after the earthquake.  </P> <P> But Sylvie Tertzakian said that even with the hardships, the people are excited  about their new freedoms. While she was in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, she  helped establish a sister-school relationship with School No. 58. Lillie  Merigian, the principal of the Santa Ana school, is planning to visit the  Armenian school next August.  </P> <P> While talking to school officials on her visit, Sylvie Tertzakian even  suggested that they name the school after an author or a poet. She recommended  Moushegh Ishkhan Hamazkayin, a writer whose works had been banned before  glasnost. The next day, the name was changed, a sign of how much freedom has  come to the country.

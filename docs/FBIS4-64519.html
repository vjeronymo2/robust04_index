			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and  Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi described their meeting  in Zurich today as positive. Papoulias said that Albania showed  signs of goodwill but he stressed that many problems remain  unsolved.    Papoulias stressed the issue of five Greeks being held by  Albanian authorities, an issue that Serreqi said is in the hands  of Albanian justice.    Serreqi raised the issue of the Tsamidhes [Muslims living in  Greece south of the Albanian border drawn at the end of WWII and  who assisted the communists during the Greek civil war] but  Papoulias replied that Greece considers them to be war criminals.    The meeting also discussed the latest border incident at  Episkopi, which the Albanian foreign minister described as a  terrorist act.    [Athens ET-1 Television Network in Greek at 1500 GMT on 3  May  carries a related recorded report from Zurich. Correspondent  Foivos Karzis notes that "a first step toward normalizing  Greek-Albanian relations, a step mainly directed at changing the  climate between the two countries, since no specific commitments  were made, was taken today in Zurich with the meeting between  the two foreign ministers, Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi.  In substance, this meeting reexamined the whole topic of  bilateral relations. A positive point to emerge from the  meeting is that Tirana appears to recognize the importance of  having good relations with Athens. But the distrust between the  two countries is widespread and Papoulias' hesitation shows the  Greek side's reservations."    [Papoulias is then cited as saying: "Goodwill was  ascertained  today at the negotiating table but it should be turned into  practice. There are many unsolved problems in Greek-Albanian  relations."]</p>

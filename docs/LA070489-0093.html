			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUSH FIRE DESTROYS 15 HOMES IN PUENTE HILLS  </P> <P> A swirling brush fire, fed by erratic winds, raged out of control in the Puente  Hills north of Whittier on Monday, destroying at least 15 homes, damaging  several others and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County fire officials said they would not know exactly how many  structures had been destroyed or damaged until the blaze is brought under  control and they could provide no estimate of when that might be. No serious  injuries were reported.  </P> <P> More than 970 firefighters -- initially hampered by high temperatures and  unpredictable winds -- battled to contain the spectacular blaze, which had  charred more than 1,500 acres by late Monday, fire officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nightmare' on the Hill  </P> <P> "It's burning like a maniac," was the way county Firefighter Bill Borthwick put  it.  </P> <P> "It's a nightmare at the top of the hill," said horse trainer Jill Snyder, 18,  of Hacienda Heights, as she led two horses and two goats to safety. "From the  horse trail, you could see flames everywhere."  </P> <P> County fire spokesman John Lenihan said arson investigators pinpointed the area  where the fire started shortly before 2 p.m. on the shoulder of Turnbull Canyon  Road near Skyline Drive and burned toward homes in the Hacienda Heights area.  </P> <P> "There's no reason for an area like that to be touched off," he said. "It's not  an area where you would expect to have a fire ignite."  </P> <P> About 250 families -- approximately 600 people -- were evacuated and sent to  three centers, Lenihan said, adding that they would not be allowed back into  their homes before this morning.  </P> <P> As night fell, firefighters were letting the blaze burn unchecked toward a  landfill in the Puente Hills.  </P> <P> "In this case, the dump will be our friend," Lenihan said late Monday.  </P> <P> "I know what catastrophe is like now," Roy Vann, 40, said Monday afternoon as  he sprinkled water on his roof while flames advanced to within 150 feet of his  home on Beech Hill Drive. "I thought I was going to lose my home."  </P> <P> His home was spared as backfires crews had set steered the flames toward a  ridge away from the street.  </P> <P> The burned homes were scattered along the length of Turnbull Canyon, where  houses valued as high as $1 million are secluded in heavily wooded areas,  Lenihan said. Two of the homes destroyed were on Skyline Drive off Turnbull  Canyon Road.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refused to Evacuate  </P> <P> Even though their street was sandwiched between two walls of flame, residents  on nearby Blue Sky Road refused to evacuate when deputies first told them to do  so at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> "I am trying to save my house," said John Anderson, as he, too, sprayed water  on his wood shingle roof from a garden hose as the flames licked fewer than 50  yards away. The homeowner tried to remain upbeat and joked about passing soft  drinks to firefighters clearing a break behind his house.  </P> <P> Firefighters and residents were hampered by low water pressure after pumps were  knocked out by a power failure as the flames hopscotched from ridge to ridge in  the rugged, chaparral-covered canyon, which officials said had not burned in  more than 50 years.  </P> <P> "This is the last stand of McGann," said Tim McGann as water barely trickled  out of his garden hose. "I'm going to save the house, man."  </P> <P> Behind him, fire crews worked furiously with axes and chain saws to cut a break  in the heavy brush as flames leaped 50 feet into the air no more than 10 feet  from his home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Winds Shifted  </P> <P> Fortunately for McGann, winds shifted and blew the flames away.  </P> <P> Chad Gonella said he was taking his girlfriend home when he spotted the smoke  from the Pomona Freeway and knew it was in his neighborhood.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies "told me to leave," he said. "But I came back anyway. I  ended up helping the Fire Department. They gave me a hose. The fire got pretty  close for a while, but it looks as though I'm going to make it."  </P> <P> Like other residents of Turnbull Canyon, evacuee Joyce White packed family  photos, small mementos and other memorabilia into the trunk of her car.  </P> <P> "We won't have a stitch of clothing, but at least we'll have these, our  memories," she said.  </P> <P> Pat Griffin, who lives next door to the local fire station on Turnbull Canyon  Road, said she was not worried about her home "at the moment. I hope they won't  let it burn down."  </P> <P> Looking up a ridge to where a neighbor was making a feeble attempt to water his  roof with a garden hose fewer than 100 feet from the flames, she said: "You  have to keep busy. He's just like me. I swept the porch. You do anything to  keep your hands busy."  </P> <P> Area resident Steve Benton said he spotted the fire shortly after it erupted.  </P> <P> "It started as a small brush fire on the Whittier side of the ridge, near  Turnbull Canyon Road," he said. "All of a sudden, the wind caught it, and it  was gone."  </P> <P> A column of blue-black smoke, billowing hundreds of feet up from the blaze, was  clearly visible from as far away as West Los Angeles and Hollywood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freeway Closed  </P> <P> Officials closed a section of the Pomona Freeway between the San Gabriel River  Freeway and 7th Street in Hacienda Heights because of the blaze, and traffic  was virtually gridlocked on surface streets in the area, sheriff's deputies  said.  </P> <P> Two "strike teams" of five engine companies each responded to the original  alarm at 1:43 p.m., officials said.  </P> <P> Five more engine companies and five water-dropping helicopters were dispatched  to the scene at 3 p.m. after the winds picked up, firefighters said.  </P> <P> By nightfall, firefighters from 10 departments -- some from as far away as  Orange County -- the U.S. Forest Service, were battling the flames with the  focus on saving homes.  </P> <P> As winds blew flames away from Blue Sky Road, county Fire Capt. Mark Morgan  said he was not sure the area was out of danger.  </P> <P> "We're just trying to make sure the fire doesn't get to the houses," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scurried to Safety  </P> <P> Just as two dozen firefighters reached the top of a ridge behind Blue Sky Road,  a burst of flame ignited the brush, forcing them to scurry back to the canyon  below, Morgan said. When the fire did not spread and it appeared safe, they  returned to the ridge to cut breaks.  </P> <P> Just as they crested the ridge a second time, "the fire just came around us and  made a run on us," said firefighter Steve King. "We had to get out of there  fast."  </P> <P> Raleigh Ornelas spent the afternoon helping firefighters, using a 3,500-gallon  water truck he owns.  </P> <P> He said he arrived home on Orange Grove Drive at 1:30 p.m. and went to the fire  station and volunteered. Fire officials sent him to Turnbull Canyon Road where  he sprayed brush that caught fire.  </P> <P> "You couldn't see nothing from both sides of the road," said Ornelas, 42,  adding that he helped neighbors spray their roofs.  </P> <P> "It's my neighborhood," he said. "I just want to help somebody."  </P> <P> The evacuees -- whose homes were in the vicinity of Turnbull Canyon Road and  Blue Sky Road, Descending Drive, Edgeridge Drive, Skyline Drive and Las Tunas  Drive -- were sent to nearby Los Altos High School, 15325 E. Los Robles Ave.,  St. John Vianney School at 1345 S. Turnbull Canyon Road and Wilson High School  at 16455 E. Wedgeworth Drive, county fire spokesman Joe Silva said.  </P> <P> "The Red Cross is here and has set up evacuation centers," Joyce Craig,  assistant superintendent of the Los Altos School District, said.  </P> <P> Residents, she said, "are kind of checking in and checking out. It's like a  message center right now. I don't think there are too many people there. They  are leaving messages for each other -- saying, 'I'm OK' or 'I have gone to  wherever.' "  </P> <P> Craig said the Red Cross was "really rallying their volunteers. . . . They have  their file system all organized. They're taking messages, and people are coming  in."  </P> <P> She said the residents sent down by the deputies seem to "be very much in  control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Concern on Their Faces'  </P> <P> "They are concerned, and you can see that concern on their faces. But right now  they're handling it," Craig said.  </P> <P> As firefighters focused attention on the Puente Hills, about 10 acres were  burned in a blaze near the Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles fire  officials said.  </P> <P> The fire started about 3:30 p.m. and was extinguished within an hour. One  firefighter suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, whose cause is under  investigation, officials said.  </P> <P> No structures were threatened.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Edward J. Boyer, Stephen Braun, John Kendall, John H. Lee  and Craig Quintana contributed to this story.  </P> <P> EVACUATION CENTER  </P> <P> Evacuees try to learn the fate of homes and relatives.

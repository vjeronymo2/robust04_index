			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in  Cambodian on 4 June carries the following reports in its  business section:    Concerning the domestic transportation of timber, the paper  says that 30 barges carrying processed wood to Phnom Penh have  been stranded at the Kratie provincial port for nearly a month  because the province's Department of Forestry and Wildlife has  refused to issue a permit. No reason has been given. The paper  calls on the department to explain its action, saying that the  government has not banned the transportation of processed wood  for local use and that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,  Wildlife, and Fisheries has even taken bids for the exploitation  of 29 forest lots across the country. Citing the extra fees  that the timber merchants are forced to pay because of the ban,  the paper calls on the department to announce future  transportation bans in advance.    In a report on the privatization of state-owned factories,  the paper says that of the 59 factories put into operation since  1979, 42 have been rented, 10 have been sold to the local  private sector and foreign investors, and seven remain under  government control. The paper cites the director of the Industry  Ministry's Planning Department as saying that many businessmen  are interested in renting the remaining seven factories, but are  hesitant because of the many preconditions and problems. For  example, they must hire all of the current workers in each  factory and do not have the right to fire any of them, even if  they break the rules or refuse to work. Also, they need to  renovate and modify the factories and the machines -- which are  not in good condition -- but the import of spare parts is time  consuming and involves many procedures.    On the destruction of Cambodia's forests, the paper blames  the government for granting logging concessions to foreign  companies. It says that although a log export ban has been in  effect since 30 March 1994, many foreign companies are still  cutting Cambodian trees and transporting logs out of the  forests. As an example, it cites a joint venture between  Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore located at Prek Prasap Leu  village in Prek Prasap District of Kratie Province. The paper  says the government and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,  Wildlife, and Fisheries might not know about the activities of  this company because even the Kratie provincial governor and  Prek Prasap District governor have pretended not to hear about  it. About 40,000 cubic meters of logs already cut by this  company are being transported out of the province. Forestry  officials have revealed that after the government imposed the  log export ban, the company stored logs temporarily at Prek  Phnoeu and is looking for other ways to get the logs out of  Cambodia. The company plans to export a total of 90,000 cubic  meters of logs in the 1993-94 period.</p>

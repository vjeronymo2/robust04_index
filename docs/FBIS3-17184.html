He believes he has to  learn a great deal and accumulate experience before becoming  ready for nomination. Sakhray said this in an exclusive  interview to Stavropol radio.    A number of problems regarding the improvement of the  economic, social and political situation in the multi-ethnic  region on the northern Caucasus was raised in the interview.  The settlement of the drawn-out Ingush-Ossetian conflict is  quite realistic on a basis of agreements signed last year by  plenipotentiary Ingush and Ossetian delegations, Shakhray  believes. However, practical implementaion of these fundamental  thoroughly-considered documents is yet far off.    The Ministries of Defence and Interior of the Russian  Federation have not yet fulfilled the provisions of the Russian  president's decrees and Kislovodsk agreements regarding  disarmament of unlawful units and confiscation of arms from both  conflicting sides. At least armoured equipment should be  urgently withdrawn from the zone of the conflict, Shakhray said.    Sakhray also toughed upon Chechen problem. He said the  experience on the development and signing of a treaty between  Moscow and Tatarstan should be used for this.</p>

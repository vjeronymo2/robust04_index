			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / People: Tregoning takes on unit trusts challenge Julian Tregoning, 46, an executive director of the Save and Prosper unit trust group, is to be the next chairman of The Unit Trust Association, which is fighting to find a role for itself in the fast-changing financial services industry. Old Harrovian Tregoning, who has spent over 20 years with Save and Prosper, cuts a more traditional figure than the outgoing chairman, Barry Bateman, 47, managing director of Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is one of the more aggressive fund managers, while S&amp;P is regarded by many as one of the industry's sleeping giants. Bateman, who joined Fidelity in 1981 after stints as marketing director of Datastream and research director of brokers Hoare Govett, leap-frogged a number of rivals for the UTA chairman's job two years ago. By contrast, Tregoning (right) has arrived at the top via the more traditional route of the deputy chairmanship of the UTA. However, one industry-watcher played down the differences in style and said that while Tregoning 'might seem a bit of an old buffer, he is really quite sharp'. Bateman has done a lot to modernise the UTA but his more combative style has sometimes upset powerful members. Tregoning will have to be more than a traditional industry figurehead if he is going to make his mark. The old demarcation lines between building societies, investment trusts and other financial services, are crumbling and unit trusts are facing increasing competition from overseas funds. As a result the UTA is changing its constitution and renaming itself the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Tregoning is not the only new face at the top of the UTA. Victoria Philip, 31, Fidelity's corporate affairs manager, is replacing Gavin Grant as head of public affairs. Grant is going to do the same job at Body Shop International. She is the latest in a number of new arrivals which include Sheila Nicol, director legal and fiscal affairs, who came from the Stock Exchange, and Simon Smith, taxation adviser, who was hired from Arthur Andersen.</p>

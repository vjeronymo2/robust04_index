			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Berisford offers 239p a share for Clark BERISFORD International's proposed bid for C&amp;J Clark would be worth 239p a share, the board of the private shoe company told shareholders in a circular posted yesterday. This is higher than the rumoured 205p a share, but includes 26p of deferred cash relating to the sale of surplus Clark's property. At 239p a share the company is valued at Pounds 184m. Clark said an offer of 239p would give a 165.6 per cent premium to the 90p at which the shares were last traded and represented 19.9 times the average of the last three years earnings per share. The board said the offer was 'fair and reasonable' and seven of the 11 directors recommended it to shareholders. Three opposed the bid and one said shareholders should be allowed to decide for themselves. However, some family members who are against the sale were yesterday consulting lawyers over the form of the proposals and legal action could follow. Clark board said that if Berisford, a food and property group, wins more than 50 per cent of the votes at a special meeting to be held on May 7, but its bid fails to gain 90 per cent acceptances, Clark would sell its business to Berisford for cash and then recommend the liquidation of the company. Berisford would only launch its bid if the proposal is approved at the meeting. It would then offer 213p a share in cash, Berisford shares or convertible loan stock. Surplus properties would then be sold and the proceeds distributed to Clark shareholders. Berisford said if Clark shareholders all took shares they would have a majority of Berisford shares. Berisford shares were suspended at 128p yesterday and will remain frozen until after the meeting. The seven directors who recommended the bid said that 'there are no other available alternatives which would provide a solution to Clark's long-standing problems' and that the Berisford proposal was 'in the best interests of Clark's'. A statement from the three dissenting directors, who are non-executives and family members, said Clark's three-year plan showed that the company could be turned round to produce good profits and that 'it is unnecessary and undesirable to sell C&amp;J Clark to Berisford'.</p>

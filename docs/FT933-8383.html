			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Emu may cost jobs, says study: European Commission paper warns large scale aid will be needed EUROPEAN monetary union could cause a substantial rise in unemployment, according to an internal European Commission study which was considered too critical to be published. The report said larger scale regional aid would be needed within the EC to tackle unemployment in uncompetitive areas after the introduction of Emu. The study, on the employment effects of monetary union, was produced last year for the then social affairs commissioner, Ms Vasso Papandreou. Although the commission, and DG 5, the social affairs directorate, are still committed to the Emu timetable, a number of officials in DG 5 have privately welcomed the likely delay of Emu and even the recent loosening of the exchange rate mechanism. 'Quite a few of us here are highly relieved that Emu looks as if it has been held up, given the sort of impact it could have on employment,' said one. Some of Europe's main trade union centres, which have considerable influence in DG 5, are also starting to review their support for Emu. The European Trades Union Congress still backs Emu, but Britain's TUC, for example, openly expresses doubts about when it can be implemented and which countries should qualify. The commission study says Emu will require greater regional transfers than those currently planned. Without such transfers a high degree of national fiscal flexibility will be needed if growth and employment are not to be adversely affected. It warns: 'The removal of the possibility of exchange rate adjustment when full monetary union is established will eliminate a major means of correcting supply imbalances across the Community and of restoring the competitiveness of particular countries or regions which suffer losses in trade shares. 'But the Maastricht treaty seems to rule out fiscal flexibility and to insist instead on compliance with the arbitrary ceilings imposed on budget deficits and government debt.' Doubts about the employment impact of Emu are commonplace outside the commission but still highly controversial inside. DG 5 has been dominated by French officials who have not wavered in their support for monetary union or the social chapter. But the combination of a new commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn of Ireland, a centre-right government in France, and an emphasis on competitiveness, has led DG 5 to take more interest in labour market flexibility.

He said in an interview with Interfax that Moldova would  "be paying for its recent errors for a long time."    "Many states' producers are happy to have a stable market  for  realization of their production. We voluntarily turned away  from the Eastern market," the premier remarked.    Sangeli emphasized that the current government was  energetically working to restore the relations with the eastern  neighbors and to enhance the relations with the Western states.    "It is very important that the law on investment start  working. We have it but we need political stability to make it  work. This is essential," Sangeli emphasized.    In his opinion, the coming parliamentary elections on  February 27 will allow to lay a foundation for stability in the  republic. "These are specific decisive elections. The problem  is: now or never," Sangeli said.    He believes that a political force must come to power which  will form the government and resolve other issues: the  constitution's adoption, the issue on Transdniestria and the  country's territorial integrity.    Sangeli is now on holidays due to the fact that he is  running  for the parliamentary elections from the Agrarian Democratic  Party's ticket.</p>

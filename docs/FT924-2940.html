			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hard times for soft sell - Gary Mead reports that there is little sign of a pick up in promotional spending If 1993 proves to be the year in which the international recession recedes, loud sighs of relief are likely to be heard around the advertising industry. But unlike earlier upturns, the next one may not be entirely to the liking of advertising agencies. For although there are signs that the nadir may have been reached in 1992, the return to growth is likely to be shallow and slow, according to research published this week by Zenith Media Worldwide, the UK-based media buying and planning operation of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Zenith's latest bi-annual review of trends in advertising expenditure* suggests that while 1992 will show another real decline of 0.2 per cent in global spending, nominal growth of 5.3 per cent - which Zenith hesitantly suggests will be marginally ahead of inflation - is forecast for 1993. The report counsels caution: 'This is possibly one of the hardest environments in which to provide an accurate forecast of trends. There is much sentiment that markets generally must turn up sooner or later. There is precious little hard evidence to support this view.' It points out that the 1990 review identified four factors adversely affecting consumer and business confidence - paralysis in US economic policy, a slowing Japanese economy, German reunification problems and the spectre of failed Gatt talks - that have yet to be resolved. The sole region where Zenith projects real, year-on-year increases above 2 per cent between now and 1995 is Asia-Pacific. Europe and North America, it says, will struggle to register any real increases at all. Zenith is forecasting aggregate growth in real terms of 8.2 per cent between 1993-95 for Asia-Pacific, against 2.4 per cent for Europe and 0.3 per cent for North America. The study projects global advertising spending through all media forms to rise from Dollars 284bn (Pounds 187bn) in 1991 to Dollars 351bn in 1995. Zenith's report is sceptical of any medium-term resurgence in advertising expenditure in Europe. 'In the 1980s, demand for advertising time and space was consistently greater than the market's ability to supply it,' leading to excess demand and price inflation. 'We believe this excess demand has, for the time being, evaporated,' says the report. 'Media is now available (in Europe) in sufficient quantity to satisfy advertiser demand, but at a time when advertiser demand has been severely weakened by recession,' it says. Rather than being driven by competition for media space, European advertising levels are more likely to be propelled by consumer expenditure and corporate profitability. The report detects in the UK a 'continuing malaise', with 1992 due to record the third successive year of real decline in advertising revenue, down by 2 per cent. Zenith expects 1993 to be 'little better, with growth of 2.9 per cent at current prices. The ignominy of another real decline is only averted by the exceptionally low forecast inflation rate of 2.6 per cent.' However, the UK's position is distorted by the imminent demise of some of the Independent Television network's franchise holders, such as TVS and Thames. According to one London agency chief: 'Some companies about to lose their franchises are willing to negotiate discounts of up to 25 per cent on their rate cards.' Peter Travis, joint managing director of the London-based agency Travis Dale &amp; Partners, says: 'It's a good time to advertise if you have the money and you feel there's a market because some TV costs will probably never be as cheap.' Moreover there are exceptions to the mood of caution. One of Travis Dale's clients, Swatch, the internationally-minded watch manufacturer, increased its advertising expenditure by 50 per cent this year compared with 1991. Jaguar cars has returned to television advertising in the UK after a break of 12 years, spending Pounds 2m. But Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group, says: 'The mood of our clients is very cautious. Many are saying: 'Our budget for next year is the same as this. Maybe in the second half of 1993, if we see the recession ending, we will increase it. But don't count on it'.' *Advertising Expenditure Forecasts, published by Zenith Media Worldwide, Bridge House, 63-65 North Wharf Road, London W2 1LA. Pounds 175.</p>

Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau, have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants from these 17 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG, Washington, DC 20447. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix B of this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

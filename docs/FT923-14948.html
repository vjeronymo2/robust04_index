			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A forced share sale I WORK for, and hold shares in, an unquoted company. Recently, when I asked to transfer some more of my shares into my wife's name (she already holds a few), the request was turned down simply because I had recently refused to sign a letter stating that should I leave the company for reasons other than retirement or illness, I would offer my share for sale. I consider this an unreasonable restriction. Thus, as I doubt that I can force the company to register the transfer - can I make some sort of declaration, which would be accepted by the Inland Revenue, that I consider my holding in these shares to be in joint names, thus reducing the taxation burden on the dividends and CGT on any sales? A solicitor could draw up a declaration of trust, saying that you hold certain of the shares in trust for your wife absolutely (not jointly because of the anti-avoidance legislation in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as amended), but there may be a problem if you predecease your wife. If you want to pursue this possibility, send the solicitor a copy of a company's memorandum and articles of association, so that he or she can check the restrictions on transfer and any pre-emption rights. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

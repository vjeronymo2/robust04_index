			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Vintage models help to put a spring in the market / Finding that collectors are willing to pay plenty for old-fashioned styles MOST people own a wrist watch, probably a quartz model powered by a battery. But some may still retain the first watch they ever had - which, almost certainly, will be of the wind-up variety. These old-fashioned mechanical models appeal far more to watch buffs than the mass-produced modern product. Add an element of power dressing  - through the clout of recognised up-market brand names combined with imposing multi-function displays on the dials - and you have the essence of a serious market for collectors. This goes some way towards explaining why a Patek Philippe perpetual calendar and moon phase wrist watch - one of only three examples in a platinum case - went on to sell for Pounds 308,000 after being taken into Sotheby's for a chance valuation. Patek is the leading name among the big six of the collectors' world (the others being Rolex, Vaucheron + Constantin, Jaeger le Coultre, Audemars Piguet and Cartier). Patek is the Rolls-Royce of the industry, while Rolex has the most rugged appeal and Cartier the edge for style. The undoubted cachet of Cartier - especially for watches in the now timeless Art Deco style, for which the company is known best - has meant that Cartier's are the only second-hand women's watches of serious market value. While women still prefer a new watch, vintage models remain a male preserve in much the same way as classic cars. Gone, though, are the days when current models of complicated watches produced by the big six (basically, reviving types made in the 1950s and '60s) habitually made more at auction than their list price. The three leading watch auctioneers - Sotheby's, Christie's and Antiquorum of Geneva - now report sales of current production models at or near list prices. This is a direct reflection of a slackening (but not collapse) of demand because of the recession, which has meant that manufacturers' waiting lists have all but disappeared. One exception is Rolex. Its Submariner and Daytona models still have long waiting lists - distinctly Italian-led - and anyone lucky enough to secure one can sell it for an immediate profit. Theme sales have been one way of trying to maximise results in an increasingly choosy market. The first of these, by Antiquorum for Patek in its 150th anniversay year, was nearly a sell-out. The same auctioneer concentrated this time last year on Breguet, but the market was much more finicky and the sale, although yielding a satisfactory total, was by no means a runaway success. Swatches have been the surprise ugly ducklings in this field since, in the public's mind, they mix mass production with a hyped fashion appeal. But not all Swatch models are made in high-number series; take, for instance, the two Velvet Undergrounds enveloped in black or white stocking mesh which sold for Pounds 7,000 at Christie's in London on May 8. This sum - at the bottom end of the estimate - for these 1985 models, produced in 500 examples only, was still a respectable performance in a themed section of a general sale which, the auctioneers admitted was not as buoyant as had been hoped, and contained a high level of casualties. Thus the Swatch market is coming of age. American, German and Swiss collectors have been concentrating on the more unusual examples, such as variants of production models, test pieces, prototypes, and hybrids such as those made by Swatch employees for their own amusement. One such 1984 hybrid made the highest price of Pounds 8,460 at the April Antiquorum sale. Pocket watches are a much older market which, at one stage, threatened to become inactive. While 18th and 19th century decorative watches are still not the hot properties they used to be, prices have held on to the 30 per cent rise at the start of last year. Thus, an Empire-period enamelled gold watch now makes Pounds l,800 compared with the Pounds l,200 it used to fetch. This, though, is still less than the Pounds 2,500 such a watch would have made late in the l970s. There must be bargains here, if only a new generation of people collecting decorative pocket watches could be inspired. Sotheby's in London seems to have a very good selection in its next sale on June 4, with more than 200 lots. But whereas decorative watches are plentiful, high-precision pocket models from the Iate 19th and early 20th centuries are in such short supply at auction that they always achieve good results. For example, Pounds 100,000 was paid at Antiquorum's April sale for a 1902 watch by Charles Frodsham of London. This 18-carat gold model was a minute-repeating, keyless pocket chronometer with one-minute tourbillon and seconds split chronograph with 60-minute recorder. Humbler hunter and half-hunter cased pocket watches still represent great value at auction, selling for little more than the gold value of their cases. Anything of this type with a reliable movement should be desirable. Antique clocks are a quieter market than 18 months ago, but the change of emphasis is in the speed of sales rather than price. Dealers report that interest has held up, but that each sale takes much longer to complete after the initial enquiry. Prices at auction are stable and, for some types of I8th and 19th century clocks, are even ahead of the supposed peak of the market late in 1989. But one investor, perhaps reflecting the view of many others, expressed surprise recently at the very reasonable price level of antique clocks; he said it was well below what it would cost to make an equivalent today. Of course, a newly-made clock can never have the same appeal as an antique which has stood the test of time in terms of design and mechanism while attaining a pleasing patina of age. These days, good style is much more important for buyers than the narrow historical band of 1680-1720 clocks upon which collectors concentrated in the 1950s, '60s and '70s. In this context, verge escapement clocks used to be the only ones considered; now, anchor escapement clocks of the Regency and Victorian periods no longer suffer from the snobbery of the past. A Regency chamfer top bracket clock of good colour and proportions can make just as much as a mid-Georgian verge bracket clock. It is on these lines that Garrard, the Crown jeweller, is organising its exhibition, Master Clockmakers: the Golden Age of English Horology 1680-1900 (May 18-30), with exhibits both on loan and for sale. The exhibition emphasises the essential quality of English antique clocks (regardless of the importance of the maker) as was required by the regulations of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers when it was set up in the 17th century in the City of London. Prices range from Pounds l,800, for a Victorian rosewood bracket clock, to more than Pounds 1m. Clocks by Tompion, Quare and Knibb and the other British 'greats' also are carried by Woodburn, near Tonbridge, Kent. These include a longcase clock by Gray and Vulliamy which makes an interesting comparison with one by the same maker at the Garrard exhibition. Meanwhile, Asprey, which deals also in continental clocks, is planning to show at the Grosvenor House antique fair a very grand ormolu-mounted empire period clock by Breguet which is very similar to one in the Queen's collection at Buckingham Palace. Bracket and longcase clocks are the staple of the English market. Bracket clocks are comparatively simple to set up at home, so long as they are on a level surface, but longcase clocks present greater problems. Once bought, there are the difficulties of getting the case to stand level and, having set up the movement in the case, getting the pendulum to swing evenly in beat. There is also the question of deciding if the movement and the case really belong together and if they require any restorative work. An auction usually will be the cheapest way of acquiring a longcase clock - providing you feel competent to assess what is on offer and cope with any work needed. If you are in any doubt, always ask the auctioneer for his opinion. A dealer, on the other hand, will offer fully-restored clocks in working order and with a guarantee of authenticity, for he is bound by the Trades Description Act. A working relationship with a respectable dealer can pay dividends, and he should be prepared always to buy back his old stock if your circumstances change. You can acquire a respectable, but not outstanding, long-case clock for up to Pounds 2,000 at auction, although you should reckon on having to spend at least a quarter of that again to put it into good order. But this is the lower end of the market; you can easily spend into five figures both at auction and at a dealer. Indeed, the more expensive the type of clock, the closer the prices at the saleroom and the dealer's. This, potentially, makes a fully-restored and guaranteed clock from a dealer very good value.</p>

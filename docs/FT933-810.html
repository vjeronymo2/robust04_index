			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Hedge fund managers look for change in Japanese sentiment LONDON's 12 Japanese equity warrant market makers will be joined today by DE Shaw Securities International, a subsidiary of the New York-based hedge fund DE Shaw &amp; Co. After the Tokyo stock market slump in 1990, several London securities houses pulled out of Japanese equity warrant market-making. The market's stronger performance this year - with the Nikkei index climbing to around 20,000 from 16,994 at the start of the year - has prompted speculation that the market may be on the way to recovery. But others are forecasting more sideways trading as long as political uncertainty lingers and economic recovery remains sluggish. This has some market participants wondering whether this is an opportune time for a new firm to enter the market. However, 'it would be foolish to ignore the Japanese market,' said Mr Lou Salkind, DE Shaw Securities' managing director. 'At some stage the switch into stocks has to happen,' added Mr Steven Fine, the firm's institutional sales manager. Moreover, he notes that many international investors are heavily underweight Japan but likely to reverse that stance when sentiment turns. DE Shaw plans to make markets in some 480 Japanese equity warrants, including many illiquid warrants in which few houses are willing to make a market. By setting up this trading subsidiary, its parent company, which started as a proprietary trading firm, wants to expand into more traditional investment banking activities. 'We were founded to do quantitative, low-risk trading and have a very scientific background, which is unusual in investment banking,' said Mr Salkind. The firm's decision to shift from its base as a hedge fund raises some interesting questions about the evolution of the market. When the Japanese equity warrants market had its peak year in 1989, the market attracted all manner of investors, both in the Far East and Europe, and was actively traded by marketmakers. Even after this year's rally, the Nikkei 225 index has only reached just over half its peak level of 39,000 at the end of 1989. In the lean years which followed, it has been the activity of hedge funds which has kept the market alive. Most investors abandoned the market in Japanese equity warrants, since the bulk of them were trading far 'out-of-the-money' - that is the exercise price of the warrants was substantially above the share price - with little chance that they would ever be worth exercising into the underlying shares. In a bear market for Japanese stocks, the market for such warrants was clearly doomed. But hedge funds are different because trades are usually market-neutral. In the equity warrants market a typical hedge trade is based on the purchase of a basket of warrants which is then neutralised by the simultaneous selling of index futures. It does not matter whether the market rises or falls: the out-of-the-money warrants and the stock futures exhibit different types of price performances, which allows arbitrage profits to be extracted from the trade. That, at least, is the theory. The problem has been that, although the Tokyo stock market has improved in price performance this year, volatility has been low. For the hedge fund manager it is volatility, rather than price performance, which affects the performance of the fund. Nevertheless, in a still uncertain environment for Japanese equities, the attraction of the hedge fund is that 'the investor does not have to take a view on which way the market is going to go,' says Mr Michael Campbell-Birkett, of Cresvale International Asset Management, which runs several hedge funds. The signs are that more investors are now prepared to take a view on the Japanese market, although they remain cautious. As one trader said, 'fund managers are shifting their asset allocation (in Japanese stocks) from massively underweight to, at best, neutral.' If the Japanese market does start to rally, equity warrants, many of which are trading cheaply according to dealers, could be in demand again. And more dramatic market movements would also be welcomed by becalmed hedge fund managers.</p>

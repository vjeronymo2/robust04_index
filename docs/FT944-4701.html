			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Magellan skips cash payout: Fidelity's Dollars 35bn US mutual fund cites tax rules as move unsettles markets Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, the US's biggest mutual fund, said it would not make a year-end distribution to its 3m investors, the first time it has not made a year-end cash payment since 1988. The news raised concerns about the cash reserves of Magellan, the US's biggest and most famous mutual fund with assets of Dollars 35bn (Pounds 21bn). The fund has been operating with little liquidity for most of this year. However, Fidelity, the Boston-based mutual funds group, said the lack of a cash distribution reflected US tax-accounting rules, rather than an internal decision to conserve cash. 'We don't pay out any more than what's required because there would be tax implications for our shareholders,' Fidelity said. 'The fund's goal is to provide long-term capital appreciation.' Under US tax rules, mutual funds have to distribute all dividend and interest income, together with net capital gains from buying and selling shares. Individual investors are then taxed on the cash they receive. For this reason, Fidelity said, it does not pay out any cash other than that required under the tax rules. It made an interim cash payment in May. The announcement comes three weeks after Fidelity had calculated a year-end payment of Dollars 4.32 a share for Magellan shareholders. The change 'does not reflect any recent portfolio activity', it said. Instead, it added, the original calculation had been an error. The Dollars 4.32-a-share payment would have amounted to a total cash distribution of about Dollars 2bn. Magellan's cash reserves amounted to just 2.2 per cent of its total assets at the end of September, compared to what Fidelity said was an average of 5-10 per cent in its mutual funds. If it needed to raise cash quickly, for instance to repay investors who wanted to withdraw their money, it could be forced into selling stocks - a move which, given Magellan's size, could depress prices generally. The recent decline in US stock prices, together with a modest recovery in bonds, has helped to stem the flow of cash into stock funds in recent weeks, though there is little evidence of cash being withdrawn. The most recent figures indicate that investors bought Dollars 8.3bn of shares in stock funds in October, net of sales, compared with Dollars 10bn the month before. Magellan's net asset value has fallen by 3.2 per cent this year. The news late on Monday had contributed to declines in world stock markets yesterday. In early trading, the US market also fell, partly in reaction to the news from Magellan, but it shrugged off the losses by midday.</p>

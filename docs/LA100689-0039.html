			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Dr. C. Everett Koop, the outspoken former surgeon general, will host a series  of one-hour specials about health care for NBC starting in May. The specials  are not being made by the network's news division. They were set by the William  Morris Agency, were announced by Brandon Tartikoff, president, NBC  Entertainment, and Rick Ludwin, vice president, specials and variety programs,  and will be from MacNeil/Lehrer Productions. In a statement released Thursday  by NBC, Koop, 71, said his plan with the programs is "to give an honest  appraisal of the nation's health concerns and to help Americans promote their  good health, prevent disease and find reasonable health care at reasonable  cost." Subjects will include the complexities of health care as medical costs  skyrocket, malpractice, AIDS and care for the aged. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

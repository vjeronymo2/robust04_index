			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase, Q&amp;A): Two jobs, one pension I HAVE two contracts with a private limited company. Under one I act as managing director; the other provides for me to offer services as head of research. Is it possible to retire from one post and to draw the relevant proportion of the accumulated pension funds while remaining active in the other? No specific retirement age is laid down. If your pension scheme gives you the right to retire and draw your pension there are no Inland Revenue or other rules to prevent you from receiving a salary, consultancy fee or other income from the employer providing the pension scheme. The common practice when a managing director retires from a small company and starts to draw his pension is for him to start a new contract as, say, non-executive chairman. In your case there is no impediment to your retiring and continuing to receive remuneration in whatever form may be agreed between your company and yourself. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

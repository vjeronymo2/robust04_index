			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Challenges for Swift - The big banks are looking carefully at the costs of message transaction Swift, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, still dominates the field of interbank messaging but it faces growing threats from other networks. The Brussels-based company was set up in 1973 to automate the function then undertaken by telexes. Owned by a consortium of about 2,200 banks, it consolidated its position with the launch in 1990 of Swift II. After numerous delays in delivery and considerable teething problems, Swift II re-established the organisation as market leader and standard-setter. The company's systems are used by around 4,300 financial institutions worldwide to process around 500m messages a year. Swift is now better positioned than it was to resist competition. The new IFT (Interbank File Transfer) tariff is seen by customers as offering a more attractive proposition for bulk transport than the older FIN service, which was prohibitively expensive for some smaller banks. Swift is also improving its service to customers in the trade finance sector and developing new EDI (electronic data interchange) systems to help it expand into trade services. It has extended its geographical coverage to around 115 countries and is shortlisted for the contract to run the Bank of England's Crest network for share settlement. However, although these steps have helped to persuade most banks to continue to use its services, others are looking for alternative lower-cost message carriers. Faced with big competitive pressures of their own, the banks no longer regard Swift as the only possible network service provider. 'This could prove a threat for the future, though it is not one at present,' says Roger Hedges, product marketing manager for ACT's Midas, one of the principal banking software systems. 'We are still connecting to Swift and we are not being wooed by anyone else. Swift's chief executive officer, Leonard Schrank, admits that the organisation had not hitherto been run on a competitive basis - 'a civil service mentality had crept in, but in the past two years we have substantially transformed the company,' he says. Prices have been cut by an average of 30 per cent. In June, Swift announced a 70 per cent cut in the joining fee in an effort to speed up the recruitment of firms in the fast-growing securities sector, as well as a 5 per cent rebate of the charge for FIN messages. The challenge could, however, come from several directions. The banks themselves may set up their own rival networks. A group has combined in a venture called Ibos (the Interbank Online System), run by six European banks. Ibos, which was founded in 1991 by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander of Spain, competes directly with Swift in its core business of international payments. The company's claim to offer a global service was strengthened in January when the US computer systems company, EDS, a subsidiary of General Motors which provides funds transfer services to financial institutions worldwide, acquired an equity stake. Ibos's managing director John Bertrand claims that its technology is 'the next generation' to Swift's, with much greater reliability - 'our error rate is zero,' he says. Mr Bertrand says Ibos has letters of intent from eight banks wanting to join the group, including four of the top 25 US banks. Ibos's objective is to capture 10 per cent of the international payments market, with a customer base of 500 banks, in six years, he says. Another challenge to Swift could come from the national telephone companies, either individually or as part of a group such as the Financial Network Association (FNA). FNA began intra-bank operations early this year, with a small number of banks participating. It has members in 14 countries and is expected to add several more soon. Another potential competitor is the UK-based company Scitor, set up in 1991 by Sita, the airline reservation system co-operative. It aims to meet demand for value-added network services in certain industries outside its main business, including finance. Sita's structure and technology are similar to Swift's and it covers more than 200 countries. However, Scitor's market development manager for financial services Peter Wagner says that Scitor's services are complementary to those of Swift rather than competitive. 'Swift has a narrower focus than we have,' he says. 'We are not trying to take Swift's main interbank messaging business, but we are interested in the branch-to-branch area and in offering cash management services.' In this area Scitor is more likely to compete with EDI service providers than with Swift. Although Swift has broadened its user base to include brokers and fund managers, it has not offered its services directly to multi-national corporations for fear of upsetting its shareholders. Shares in Swift are allocated by volume of message traffic. The top 35 banks are said to generate half the traffic and are therefore in a strong position to influence Swift's plans. Some big companies have lobbied Swift for access to its network for a limited range of transactions, particularly confirmations of payment. Swift has yet to clarify its plans, but its chairman, Eric Chilton, has recently acknowledged that a debate is going on within member-banks worldwide on this issue. Most corporates do not want to become banks, he believes. What they need is 'straight-through processing facilities' which would minimise their costs and create standards, he said. This is a key issue for Swift's management as it considers how best to respond to any competitive threat. Swift cannot afford to delay a decision too long. Some corporations, like the banks, are starting to look for possible alternative solutions.</p>

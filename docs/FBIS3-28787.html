			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry  proposed to the cabinet on Thursday [10 February] a fiscal 1994  defense budget of 4,678.8 billion yen, up 0.8 percent over the  initial fiscal 1993 budget and the smallest increase in 34 years.    In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the  ministry set aside 882 billion yen to acquire frontline weapons,  such as four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767 airborne  warning and control system (AWACS) planes, ministry officials  said.    The figure represented a 0.2 percent rise over fiscal 1993.  Of the contract-based figure, 24.1 billion yen will be used as  a down payment, with the remaining 857.9 billion yen payment to  be deferred in coming years, the officials said.    Pressed by sagging state revenues, the ministry "did its  utmost efforts to curb the Defense Agency-requested increases in  frontline weaponry in view of the generally favorable  international situation and the very serious fiscal conditions,"  an official said.    The agency initially requested an overall defense outlay of  4,734.5 billion yen for the fiscal year starting April 1, up  1.95 percent over fiscal 1993 that ends on March 31.    Despite a recent government proposal to trim levels of  defense outlays in coming years, the ministry is aware of "the  need to prevent possible policy decisions from dashing the  possibility of future defense outlay increases," an official  said. He was referring to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's  suggestion last year to review the level of defense spending and  consider defense budget cuts.    In view of that, the ministry sanctioned a Defense Agency  request to purchase an antimissile Patriot interceptor system  and a sophisticated computer system to enhance the intercepting  capability of the Japanese military's armory of Patriot missiles  to counter a threat from North Korea's "Nodong-1" missiles, they  said.    The Patriot missile system, including a radar and flight  control system, will cost 33.5 billion yen, while the computer  and computer software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said.    The computer system will enhance the capability of two of  Japan's 26 Patriot missile firing units to the level of the  "PAC-2" Patriots, which were used by U.S. troops during the 1991  Gulf War to repel Iraqi Scud missiles, they said.    One firing unit comprises four missiles and five launchers.    The Defense Agency has been pushing for purchases of an  improved version of the Patriots to counter the threat of North  Korea's missiles, which the 1993 Defense White Paper warned  "will be able to reach most Japanese territory if Pyongyang  deploys it to specific areas."    The draft defense budget accounts for 0.947 percent of  Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994.    The ministry boosted its allocations to help U.S. Forces in  Japan. The figure was increased from 400.9 billion yen in  fiscal 1993 to "more than 425 billion yen" in fiscal 1994, said  Hirofumi Gomi, a senior official who helped draft the budget.    Of the 425 billion yen, the ministry allocated 123.4 billion  yen toward "75 percent" of total labor costs of the some 22,000  Japanese employees working at U.S. bases in Japan, utilities and  other costs, he said.    The spending is mandated under the 1960 Japan-U.S. Security  Pact and the 1991 pact known as the Special Measures Agreement.  The outlays are meant to cement the security solidarity of the  two allies.</p>

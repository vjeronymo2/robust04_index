			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of safety and security affairs, Mr.  Sydney Mufamadi, has announced plans for a sweeping  restructuring of the police services to create a demilitarized  national and provincial force. Mr. Mufamadi also said that  interim structures had been created in the form of three bodies  to plan and oversee the process. The process will include  combining the South African Police [SAP] and homeland police  forces, removing military ranks, symbols and terminology, and  applying affirmative action to make the force and its leadership  more representative. It also aimed at removing discrimination  against women.    Mr. Mufamadi also announced that Lieutenant General Basie  Smit, the last of three police generals under investigation on  Goldstone Commission charges of alleged involvement in a third  force, is leaving the force within the next two days. Two  others, Major General Krappies Engelbrecht and Major General  Johan le Roux, have already retired. Mr. Mufamadi said an SAP  act would be promulgated to provide for the appointment of a  national police commissioner and commissioners in charge of  policing in the nine provinces.    Deputy Minister Joe Matthews said closer cooperation would  be  forged with South Africa's neighbors to try to curb arms  trafficking in the region. Mr. Matthews said that immunity  would be granted to those willing to hand in their illegal  weapons and ammunition to the police. He expressed the hope  that the level of illegal arms trafficking would drop with the  reduction in political violence.</p>

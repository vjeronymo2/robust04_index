			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Warning to bidders for tunnel rail link Any changes in membership of the consortia bidding to build the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link must be approved by the government, the Department of Transport said yesterday. It was commenting on an announcement from the GMB general union that the consortium headed by Hochtief, a German construction company, had invited UK unions to join the bidding team. No application for the unions to be allowed to join the Hochtief group had been received by yesterday afternoon, the transport department said. Some of the companies involved in the bidding have expressed irritation at the government's intervention in the make-up of the bidding groups. London Electricity said in June that it had withdrawn from one of the four bidding consortia because of a conflict of interest resulting from the fact that Sir Bob Reid, its chairman, was also chairman of British Rail. Meanwhile, Sofrerail, a French railway consultancy, is an adviser to, but not formally a member of, London &amp; Continental Railways, another consortium. Eurorail, a consortium comprising BICC, Trafalgar House and GEC, yesterday received the documents containing details of the tender competition 10 days after the other three consortia. The delay resulted from one member of the consortium, believed to be GEC, refusing to sign the confidentiality agreement because it was too onerous. The four consortia have until March 14 to submit their bids. The government has said it expects to award the contract by the end of next year.</p>

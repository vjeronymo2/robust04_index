			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Dole 'close to a deal' on Uruguay Round: Republican leader says fast track legislation may not be renewed by Congress next year Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, yesterday said he was close to a deal with the administration on passage of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation this year. Mr Dole is considered the key to approval of the Round; some lobbyists say he can bring 12 Republican votes with him. Sixty out of 100 votes are needed for passage of a budget rule, which would clear the legislation for floor action. Even with Mr Dole's support, the vote is expected to be close. He also suggested on television yesterday that Congress would not support a renewal of 'fast track' legislation next year. This could kill administration plans to negotiate further trade agreements with Chile and other Latin American nations. The so-called fast track is a promise by Congress that it will vote trade agreements up or down, without attempting to amend them. The administration was unable to get fast track renewal attached to the Uruguay Round implementing legislation this year, even with Democrat control of Congress. That failure is seen as having crippled President Bill Clinton on the trade front as he prepares to meet Latin American presidents at the summit of the Americas next month. Mr Dole met administration officials at the weekend and threw a new demand on the negotiating table. He has asked for 'assurances' from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, which would ease passage of a cut in the capital gains tax rate next year. This could be accomplished without cost to the budget, if the proposed legislation is 'scored' by the Treasury as a revenue enhancer rather than a loss, as Republicans have been arguing for years. As a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 Mr Dole is struggling to satisfy the concerns of the Republican right wing that the WTO would mean a loss of US sovereignty. He said he would 'fix' the legislation with amendments next year. 'I proposed a way to get out of the WTO if we have these arbitrary, capricious, adverse decisions coming from this secret panel,' he said. One of his suggestions is to establish a panel of US trade experts to report to Congress on rulings from WTO dispute settlement panels. Congress could pull out of the WTO after three rulings, unfavourable to the US, were deemed by the experts to be not in conformance with WTO rules.</p>

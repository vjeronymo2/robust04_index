			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Granda] </F>   [Text] Tingo Maria, 22 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army  continues its counterterrorist offensive that it began on 5  April in the Northern Peruvian jungle and is closing in on three  Shining Path [SL] columns.    General Alfredo Rodriguez, the counterterrorist front  commander of the zone, disclosed that the latest clash between  terrorists and two Army units took place near the town of San  Isidro.    Sources have stated that soldiers clashed with the SL "Red  Sea" column, which retreated to what the military call "Spring  Valley."    After the terrorists withdrew, Army troops occupied a SL  base  and are pursuing "Red Sea" fugitives who, according to military  sources, are headed by two SL leaders known as "Rayo" and  "Pescadito."    The military forces involve 380 men, of which 200 are combat  troops and 180 support troops. They are closing in on the  terrorists' retreat.    Gen. Rodriguez explained that the Peruvian troops are using  a  "pincer" move against the terrorists. He added that during 17  days of clashes, 14 terrorists have been killed and another 15  have been captured.    The military commander explained that these operations, on  the banks of the Huallaga River in Leoncio Prado Province,  Huanuco Department in the Northern jungle, have not affected  civilians living in the combat zones.    Gen. Rodriguez said the Army has seized from the SL members  220 hand grenades, grenade-launcher rifles, 14 FAL rifles,  bombs, shotguns, percussion caps, and a great quantity of  ammunition.    The terrorist columns are believed to comprise about 250  men.    Military sources have stated that during the past few days  hundreds of children, women, and elderly people who were forced  to support the SL in the Peruvian Northern jungle, have  surrendered to the Army.    The source did not disclose the number, site, nor exact date  when these people surrendered. These people "were slaves" of the  SL and were divided into "grass-roots forces" and "peoples'  committees."    The SL seems to have used the same system as in the central  region, where they enslaved thousands of indigenous Ashaninkas  who are now being gradually rescued.    In the next few hours members of the Congressional Human  Rights Commission and Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan, will  travel to the site of operations to try to verify reports on  alleged attacks against civilians by helicopter gunships.    The National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has witness  reports of helicopter-fired rocket attacks against towns along  the Huallaga River and a video in which bodies of the alleged  victims are shown.    Legal Defense Institute Director Ernesto de la Jara has said  that some 40 to 50 civilians died in these attacks and the  National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has requested the  intervention of the Red Cross, which has not been allowed to  visit the zone.    Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, travelled to  Tingo Maria with 30 journalists. Today they will be taken to the  combat zone.    Gen. Hermoza said the SL is dismantled, the Army is  obstructing its retreat, and the military chiefs are urging the  terrorists to surrender.</p>

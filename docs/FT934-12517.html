			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Takeover battle for dairy resumes THE takeover battle for control of Associated Dairies, the Victorian dairy products company, has stepped up again with the two rival bidders  - Australian Co-Operative Foods and QUF Industries - raising their offers, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Sydney-based ACF moved first, increasing its offer to ADollars 3.25 a share from ADollars 2.85 previously. This exceeded the ADollars 2.97 a share on offer by QUF. However, within hours, the Queensland-based company had announced it would pay Dollars 3.35 a share, or ADollars 81.3m (USDollars 54.6m) for Associated Dairies.</p>

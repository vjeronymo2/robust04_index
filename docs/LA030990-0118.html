Icahn's proposal  that USX Corp. spin off its steel division will be put to a vote of  shareholders, USX said in announcing an agreement on the matter.  </P> <P> In exchange for the vote, Icahn agreed not to wage a proxy fight or submit  other matters for consideration at the steel, oil and gas giant's May 7 annual  meeting, USX said. Stockholders will be asked whether USX should incorporate a  separate steel business and sell at least 80% of it, Icahn said in documents  filed with the SEC. The new company would carry no more than $1.5 billion in  long-term debt.  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: ANZ beats market expectations Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, the last of the big Australian banks to report earnings for the year to end-September, yesterday surprised the market with an ADollars 803.2m (USDollars 613.1m) profit after tax but before abnormals. The figure compared with ADollars 459.7m in the previous year. Including abnormals, the profit was ADollars 821.9m, up from ADollars 246.5m. Earnings per share rose sharply - from 30.8 cents to 54.5 cents, on a pre-abnormals basis. The final dividend is 14 cents (unfranked), compared with 10 cents a year ago, making a total for the year of 25 cents, up from 20 cents. The result was ahead of analysts' expectations, which had been pitched slightly below ADollars 700m. The shares jumped 8 cents to ADollars 3.75, helping to rally both the banking sector and the Australian stock market which had been rocked by Wall Street's overnight plunge. ANZ said the result came on the back of strong income growth and a sharp fall in the charge for doubtful debts. It noted a particularly strong recovery in the profits from its core Australian operations, which contributed ADollars 456.8m to the group's total, compared with ADollars 199.9m previously. International operations contributed ADollars 250.7m, against ADollars 163.9m, while the New Zealand business remained stable, with ADollars 95.7m. ANZ said the charge for bad and doubtful debts fell to ADollars 381.4m, from ADollars 633.7m a year ago, with Mr John Gough, chairman, describing the asset quality issue as 'well under control'. Net impaired assets at end-September were ADollars 1.93bn, down from ADollars 2.7bn in 1993. Operating expenses increased by ADollars 89.9m, with a reduction in premises and computer costs being offset by higher personnel and other costs. This meant the ratio of operating expenses for net operating income stood at 66 per cent, down from 69.2 per cent in the previous 12 months. ANZ McCaughan, the group's stockbroking arm, made ADollars 14.4m, up from ADollars 5.3m in 1992-93. In Melbourne, Mr Don Mercer, managing director, said ANZ hoped to overtake National Australia Bank - the strongest of the large Australian banks - in terms of returns on shareholders' equity. 'I fancy our chances of passing our major competitors on return on shareholders' equity,' he commented, although ANZ achieved only 15.2 per cent last year, compared with NAB's 17.5 per cent. He added that ANZ had no large acquisition plans, nor was it looking to divest any significant elements of its business.</p>

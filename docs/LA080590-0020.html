			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOSING WHILE WINNING: THE ABORTION ALBATROSS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT EFFORTS TO  OVERTURN ROE VS. WADE ARE A FORM OF POLITICAL RUSSIAN ROULETTE.  </P> <P> The only group in Washington more concerned than abortion-rights activists  about President George Bush's nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme  Court are the people who make their living electing Republicans to office.  </P> <P> Seared by the furor over last year's Webster decision, which merely gave states  additional latitude to regulate abortion, few ranking Republican operatives  still want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision  guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion.  </P> <P> But no one knows how to extricate the party from its commitment to do just  that.  </P> <P> Among Republican strategists there is widespread -- if still largely private --  agreement that a decision undermining Roe could rip open the GOP coalition. "I  don't think any professional in the party wants to see Roe overturned," said  Republican consultant Roger J. Stone. "In the post-Webster environment, you  could peel off young people, suburbanites, women and Jews -- I don't see any  anxiousness in our party to do that."  </P> <P> Until the Webster decision, most Republicans -- whatever their feelings on the  issue's morality -- considered opposition to abortion an electoral plus. It  allowed the GOP to crystallize the enthusiasm of anti-abortion forces and  conservative evangelicals who were surging into politics on the galvanizing  conviction that America had lost its moral bearings. And, party strategists  felt, the anti-abortion position cost them little with voters who disagreed --  as long as the courts did nothing to restrict abortion rights.  </P> <P> "It was easy to say in our platform Roe should be overturned when there was no  prospect of doing that," said Stone.  </P> <P> That was a shrewd, if cynical, calculation. The vast majority of Americans vote  not on abstract ideology but tangible reality. For abortion opponents, the  post-Roe world of 1.5 million annual legal abortions was distressingly  tangible. For abortion-rights supporters, by contrast, the GOP's rhetoric was  only an abstraction that in no way diminished their access to abortion. Many  Republicans truly embraced the anti-abortion cause; but others less sympathetic  understood that as long as the GOP failed to implement its restrictive agenda,  it could enjoy the best of both worlds.  </P> <P> Implicitly recognizing that dynamic, the Reagan White House never seriously  pushed an constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Bush has shown even less  interest in a frontal legislative assault.  </P> <P> But since 1980, the GOP platform has called for appointment of judges "who  respect . . . the sanctity of innocent human life." That commitment has  conscripted the GOP into a decade-long game of political Russian roulette. Each  time a vacancy opened on the Supreme Court, the Reagan White House put a bullet  in another chamber, waited for a case challenging Roe to come before the  justices, pulled the trigger -- and held its breath.  </P> <P> So far the cylinder has always come up empty, as the court refused to mount a  direct challenge to the legal right to abortion.  </P> <P> But with four firm anti-Roe votes in place, Souter's nomination could tip the  odds -- and force the GOP at last to redeem its long-standing debt to the  anti-abortion forces. "This was a deal with the devil where we thought we would  never have to pay the piper," said one nervous Republican consultant.  </P> <P> The conundrum facing the GOP is that while most strategists believe an adamant  anti-abortion position is a losing hand over the long term, the public and  personal commitments of many party leaders to the cause are too deep to easily  shed.  </P> <P> Though Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has spoken of making  the party a "big tent" on the issue, any White House move that diminishes the  party's official support for the anti-abortion cause would set off internal  civil war. "There is no graceful way for the party to remove itself from the  commitments it has made on this issue, especially since 1980," said Bill Price,  president of Texans United for Life, a leading anti-abortion group.  </P> <P> Many Republican strategists consider the Souter nomination a masterstroke  because his thin record on abortion sustains the hope of delaying a  confrontation on the issue at least through the November elections.  </P> <P> But those contests are only the first stage of an extended political process  whose stakes rise at each turn. In political terms, the impact of the Souter  nomination hearings on this fall's elections are dwarfed by the potential  fallout in 1992, if Souter wins confirmation and creates a majority for  reversing the Roe vs. Wade decision itself.  </P> <P> Analysts in both parties agree that a decision eliminating the legal right to  abortion could become a dominant -- even pivotal -- issue in the 1992  presidential campaign. If the court rejects Roe any time in the next two terms,  states across the country would be ensnarled in bitter debates over whether to  recriminalize abortion even as the presidential race unfolds.  </P> <P> At best, said one senior Republican strategist in close contact with the White  House, Bush might be able to argue by then that the decision is out of his  hands. But at worst, other GOP analysts say, Bush could be forced to run atop a  party hopelessly divided over the issue and facing intensely mobilized  opposition from abortion-rights supporters. By itself that probably wouldn't be  enough to topple Bush -- but, if the economy slips further, it could make him  vulnerable.  </P> <P> It's possible that Souter, if confirmed, may join the contingent that has  avoided a broad ruling on Roe, and thus delay the issue again. That's the quiet  hope of those Republicans looking for signs Souter may be a Trojan horse in  reverse -- a cipher whose blank slate obscures not opposition but support for  legalized abortion.  </P> <P> But if that turned out to be Souter's position -- either on legal, procedural  or moral grounds -- the pressure on Bush to name an explicitly anti-abortion  judge to fill the next vacancy would be overwhelming. And with two judges who  support abortion rights over 80, appointments could face Bush before 1992.  </P> <P> Clearly abortion opponents are expecting Souter -- and any additional Bush  appointments -- to bend their way. "When I came into the movement a decade ago,  we were losing (Supreme Court) cases 7-2 and 6-3," Price said. "Very shortly I  think we are going to be in a 6-3 (anti-abortion) position, and by the time  Bush is finished we could be in an 8-1 or 9-0 position."  </P> <P> Anything less would ferociously disappoint anti-abortion activists, who feel  their time has finally come. But as the precipice draws closer, voices are  rising among those GOP activists urging the party to turn away from what they  consider a politically suicidal and socially disruptive commitment to upending  Roe -- if Souter's nomination hasn't already sealed the issue.  </P> <P> "There is a system in place where we are headed in the direction of overturning  Roe," said Republican consultant John Buckley. "But we are not locked into it.  . . . There is a moment of reckoning coming for the GOP."  </P> <P> This reckoning is descending on unlikely shoulders. Bush, a late convert to the  anti-abortion cause, a conciliator who splits the difference the way a logger  splits firs, may nonetheless be the one who confronts the final eruption of  this social fissure. That would be a great irony. But the White House might be  too busy putting out fires to appreciate it.  </P></p>

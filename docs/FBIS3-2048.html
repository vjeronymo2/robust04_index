			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cheng Teh-Lin (6774 1795 2651): "Deng Xiaoping Hopes </F> That Retired Cadres Will Not Try to Earn Extra Income"]    [Text]  <H3>  Deng Cautions Others Against Exaggerating His  Contributions </H3>   According to a source, when meeting with party, government,  and military leaders during his stay in Shanghai from last  December to this February, Deng Xiaoping again and again urged  them not to blow out of proportion his part in promoting China's  reform, opening up, and economic development.    Deng said that it was mainly the leadership exercised and  the  part played by the collective comprising the party Central  Committee, the Standing Committee, and the Political Bureau that  made possible the rapid economic growth of the last two years  (1992 and 1993).    My opinions, including my office's opinions, are for  reference of the central authorities and the departments  concerned only, he said, adding that while those opinions which  are correct, reasonable, and positive could be seen as good  suggestions, those which are not on the right track, do not fit  in with China's actual conditions, and are unpracticable, should  be shelved, and those which are incorrect should be criticized.  He told them not to treat his opinions as directives. Only the  resolutions adopted by the central authorities can be regarded  as directives, he said.    "I am a member of the party, so I must unconditionally  submit  myself to the party central committee in words and deeds," he  stated.  <H3>  Deng Hopes Veteran Cadres Will Continue to Display Party  Spirit </H3>   Deng continued: "I consider it important for a party member,  especially leading party and government leaders, to display  party spirit and observe party discipline. If local party and  government leaders are not pure in party spirit and not strict  in discipline, they can achieve nothing even if the line and  policies are correct. This is a common occurrence, so it is  necessary to guard against it.    When meeting with a number of veteran cadres in Shanghai in  early February, Deng said: "We have gone into retirement now,  but we must not indulge in seeking ease and comfort. We should  do something solid for the party including propagating its  policies. We must not go too far in our words and deeds and  must see to it that our family members and relatives behave  well, because this is what the party expects of its members. We  must not earn extra money by obtaining nominal positions or  titles everywhere and attending ceremonies. The present party  leadership holds us in high esteem simply because we have made  contributions in the past. We must treasure our past and all  the more respect and support the incumbent leadership. I hope  you will set strict demands on yourselves, conduct yourselves  with dignity, and continue displaying party spirit.  <H5>  Macrocontrol Is Not an Expedient Measure </H5>   When speaking about central macrocontrol in Shanghai, Deng  said: "Strengthening central macrocontrol is a long-term policy  adopted by the central authorities. It is not a personal  decision, nor an expedient measure. Some local cadres thought  themselves clever in claiming that it is an expedient policy.  This shows they are not pure in party spirit and lack a sense  of organization and discipline. In this way they tend to make  big mistakes. The central authorities should criticize such  cadres. They should dismiss and punish those cadres who incur  losses producing great undesirable impact, because such cadres  must not sit on the leading body any more. If they violate the  law, they must be punished according to law. Otherwise, the  central policies and decisions will not be implemented in full  and the authority of the central authorities will suffer.</p>

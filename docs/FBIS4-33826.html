			<p>BFN     [Text] Jorge Schaulsohn, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, considers the controversy provoked by a meeting of the  corps of Army generals to be resolved.    On 1 June, the Army leaked information that Deputy Army  Commander General Jorge Lucar summoned the corps of generals to  assess the comments of Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo, who  referred to General Augusto Pinochet's trip to Europe. He said  the demonstrations against Pinochet show the world still  remembers the crimes he committed.    Schaulsohn held a meeting with Defense Minister Edmundo  Perez  Yoma because he believed the Army high command should not assess  comments by a legislator.    [Begin Schaulsohn recording] If this meeting did really take  place, Gen. Lucar, whom I highly respect, made a serious mistake  by calling it. [end recording]    Schaulsohn added that the Army was correct in channeling its  unrest to the defense minister.    [Begin Schaulsohn recording] The Army was annoyed by  comments  by honorable Deputy Naranjo and Gen. Lucar expressed the Army's  unrest to the defense minister through the appropriate channel.  [end recording]</p>

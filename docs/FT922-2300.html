			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unrest hits Polish copper mines LABOUR UNREST hit Poland's LGHM copper combine yesterday as miners at two out of three copper ore pits staged a token two-hour stoppage backed by workers at the combine's smelters. Unions leading LGHM's 40,000 strong workforce are demanding a 30 per cent wage increase and yesterday's protest precedes a shopfloor vote on June 24 to decide on whether to hold an all out strike to back the claim. The unrest came after a visit last week to LGHM by the board of Australia's Western Mining Corporation designed to examine a possible investment in the combine. Sir Arvi Parbo, the company's chairman says of the 18-month long dialogue Western Mining has been conducting with the Poles that 'we are still investigating the project' and adds that a joint venture would be on the cards 'under the right conditions'. Last month Asarco, the US metals producer, offered to sign a management contract with LGHM for three years after which decisions could be taken by the Polish authorities on whether to sell a share of the plant. Polish officials are telling prospective investors that foreign capital is welcome but that final decisions have to await the opening of competitive procedures for bids from foreign companies. LGHM is one of those rare Polish companies that are unencumbered by debt and last year showed a Zl 3,500bn (Pounds 140m) gross profit. Last year LGHM produced 23.7m tonnes of copper ore and 345,000 tonnes of refined copper, of which 241,000 tonnes was sold abroad, 18 per cent more than in 1990. Production plans this year are set at around 385,000 tonnes of which some 240,000 should be exported. Nearly 900 unionised workers at Noranda's copper refinery in Montreal, with yearly capacity of 335,000 tonnes, have overwhelmingly voted to accept a new three-year contract providing a 3 per cent average pay increase in each year, and improved fringe benefits, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The workers are represented by the United Steelworkers. The settlement is in line with Canada's expected inflation rate.</p>

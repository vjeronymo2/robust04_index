			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TOOL IN DRUG WAR: MONEY LAUNDERING NEWSLETTER  </P> <P> Business executives, bank officers, lawyers, real estate brokers and even car  dealers have been drafted into the war on drugs -- whether they like it or not.  </P> <P> Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1988, the  IRS and other federal agencies are forcing businesses and financial  institutions to help track the estimated $220 million in profits generated  daily by illegal drug sales in this country.  </P> <P> "All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turn it around. That  necessarily involves legitimate businesses," said Miami lawyer Charles  Intriago, who has started a publication that promises to make sense of the  regulatory maze and keep subscribers on the right side of the law.  </P> <P> "The government has conscripted the entire business community and required them  to submit their paper trails," Intriago said. "It's saying, 'OK, you're in the  war now -- play by the rules or face severe penalties.' "  </P> <P> Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter of advice,  statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the source of their money  and what government is doing to uncover their schemes.  </P> <P> As trade journals go, Alert has a sizable niche, says Intriago, a former chief  counsel for the House committee that oversees all banking regulatory agencies.  He has also prosecuted white-collar criminals and drug traffickers while an  assistant U.S. attorney in Miami.  </P> <P> Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence that interdiction  efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing into this country, money  laundering controls have become the government's weapon of choice, Intriago  said.  </P> <P> "The money laundering initiative has a higher probability of success than the  others, such as interdiction. It hits the profit motive," he said.  </P> <P> Enlisting the help of banks and other, often unwitting, handmaidens to drug  traffickers has yielded impressive results.  </P> <P> Days before billionaire Medellin cartel enforcer Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha was  gunned down in Colombia on Dec. 15, U.S. and Swiss officials traced his profits  and were able to freeze $61.8 million of his assets in several countries.  </P> <P> Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report large cash  transactions. Soon, the Treasury Department could also force banks to put names  and addresses on the estimated $1.25 trillion transferred daily around the  world on telephone lines. Details of that initiative are laid out in Alert's  November issue.  </P> <P> These new money laundering laws are in their infancy, and many have yet to be  enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businesses may be unaware of the penalties  they face, Intriago said.  </P> <P> Alert costs $295 a year, but Intriago notes that the Treasury Department can  now impose $500 fines for every negligent error a bank teller makes on one of  the required forms.  </P> <P> "Tell me these institutions wouldn't like to receive a publication that could  spare them thousands of dollars in fines, to say nothing of the bad publicity,"  Intriago said.  </P> <P> With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200 subscribers,  ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions to lawyers and accountants,  foreign governments and diplomatic offices.  </P> <P> Intriago doesn't mention "drug kingpins" on his list, and he bristles at the  suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful to criminals as to  law-abiding citizens.  </P> <P> "We don't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nor does the Wall  Street Journal," he said. "A number of criminal defense attorneys have  subscriptions, however."  </P> <P> One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial board as well: Neal  Sonnett of Miami, who represented Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega when  he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida.  </P> <P> "He's a very respected attorney," Intriago said, "no matter what his clientele  is."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> A SPECTACULAR LIGHTNING SHOW;  </P> <P> WEATHER: MORE ELECTRICAL STORMS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE COUNTY IN THE WAKE OF  SUNDAY'S DAZZLING DISPLAY, WHICH SPARKED BRUSH FIRES.  </P> <P> Lightning storms are expected to flash across San Diego County skies until  Wednesday, with thunderstorms and warm, humid weather predicted for the rest of  the week, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> Warm, moist air flowed into San Diego over the weekend, resulting in a  brilliant lightning storm late Sunday night, the second electrical storm of the  summer, National Weather Service meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "The activity was numerous and extremely brilliant. It was one of the most  brilliant in San Diego over the last couple of years," said Shigehara, noting  that the storm received the service's highest lightning-storm ranking.  </P> <P> "This is the popular time of the year for lightning activity," Shigehara said.  "August and September are the favorite times of the year for these storms, but  we're starting a little early."  </P> <P> He said the Sunday storm produced high amounts of energy, pushing temperatures  in some parts of North County into the 90s around midnight Sunday.  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric spokeswoman Barbara Burton reported that 14,000  customers were without power Monday morning because of the lightning. Most  power was restored by noon Monday, Ramona and northeast areas being the last to  regain power.  </P> <P> On Monday, the storm ignited at least one and possibly three brush fires in San  Diego County. Shortly after 8 a.m. Monday, a quarter-acre of brush in the  Cleveland National Forest in East County was blackened by fire sparked by the  storm. It was contained by late Monday.  </P> <P> A 200-acre fire in Cuyamaca State Park and a 150-acre one north of the Viejas  Indian Reservation in the Cleveland National Forest, both in East County, may  have been started by lightning Monday, fire officials said. No structures were  threatened by the blazes, but two firefighters battling the Cuyamaca blaze were  taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with second-degree burns, and two others  fighting the Viejas fire were injured. One suffered a broken arm and the other  may have broken ribs, according to spokesmen.  </P> <P> More than 190 firefighters, 15 fire trucks, one bulldozer, five air tankers and  one helicopter were called to battle the flames, spokeswoman Andrea Hagen said.  </P> <P> Campgrounds south of Green Valley Falls where the fire started were evacuated,  and California 79 was temporarily closed, then reopened at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Forty percent of the fire had been contained in the river bottom, but  firefighters have no estimate when it will be entirely extinguished because the  area is heavily timbered, and winds are erratic, Hagen said.  </P> <P> About 33% of the Viejas fire near the Viejas Grade had been contained by late  Monday, and firefighters expected to extinguish the rest by morning, said U.S.  Forest Service spokesman Edward McChesney.  </P> <P> The service sent more than 250 firefighters, 10 engines, two helicopters and  one bulldozer, he said.  </P> <P> San Diego can expect partly cloudy skies today with less than a 20% chance of  thundershowers and a high temperature of 81 and a low of 69. Thunderstorms  throughout the week may contain frequent lightning, winds gusting up to 40  m.p.h. and some heavy rains, the weather service reported.  </P> <P> Warm and moist air from Mexico circulating around a high pressure centered over  Nevada is bringing the thunderstorms to the area in what Shigehara calls the  start of the nocturnal thunderstorm season.  </P> <P> Weather through the week will continue being warm, humid and partly cloudy,  with chances of thunderstorms in the mountains and deserts, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Extended temperature for the week are expected to range from highs of 78 to 81  to lows of 66 to 72 downtown; highs of 72 to 77 and lows of 66 to 72 at the  beaches; highs ranging from 85 to 95 in the inlands areas to lows 63 to 68;  mountain highs 85 to 90, lows 55 to 65, and desert highs 105 to 112 and lows 75  to 85.  </P> <P> Shigehara said the lightning storm started in North County about 10 p.m. and  spread to most of the county by midnight.  </P></p>

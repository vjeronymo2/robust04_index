			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GINGRICH'S CORRUPTION ARGUMENT IS SO MUCH MALARKEY  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) is not satisfied by the prospect of nailing Jim  Wright's hide to the wall. In a succession of press sessions, he has been  arguing that the scandal that has enveloped the highest elected Democrat in the  land is just the tip of the iceberg. It's a symbol, Gingrich argues, of the  "institutional corruption" that is endemic wherever Democrats have been in  control for years -- whether in the House of Representatives or in city halls  from New York City to Chicago to Jersey City.  </P> <P> Like all conspiracy theories, this one works better as an outlet for  frustration than it does as a tool of analysis. The same man who sees the  Congress in which he serves as a cesspool of "institutional corruption and  abuse of power" can find nothing "systemic" about the instances of illegality  in the executive branch, whether it's the Pentagon procurement scandals or the  Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> But Gingrich has a problem in elementary logic. If the House has been as  thoroughly debauched after 35 years of control by the same party as he asserts,  it's hard to figure why the boss man of this corrupt institution is in such  trouble.  </P> <P> If you're examining the record without the partisan, ideological blinders that  Gingrich wears, the evidence suggests that the House has done a far better job  of dealing with its bad actors than the White House and the executive branch  have done in cleaning up their breaches of conduct.  </P> <P> In the past 10 years, the House has moved to expel four members for misconduct.  Three of them resigned to avoid that humiliation and the fourth was, in fact,  expelled. It has formally censured four members. Reprimands or other forms of  mild fault-finding were voted on another dozen members. That is hardly a  pattern suggesting a calculated, callous indifference to the rules of conduct.  </P> <P> It's politically tempting to say, based on the charges facing Wright, that the  House is corrupt from top to bottom. But the record shows that the House has  done a lot more to cleanse itself than the executive branch can claim. So spare  us, please, this "institutional corruption" malarkey.  </P></p>

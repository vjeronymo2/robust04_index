			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Revision of the Series 8 examination, specifications and content outline was recently undertaken by an industry committee composed of representatives from SROs (the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the National Association of Securities Dealers and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) and representatives from broker-dealers, including branch office managers, compliance personnel and corporate executives, in order to update the examination in view of changes in relevant laws, rules and regulations, the development of new products, and to reflect various changes in industry practices. The committee reviewed the examination specifications, content areas and item bank and developed new questions in new areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised examination continues to cover the areas of knowledge required to supervise sales activities in securities, however, the focus of the content of the examination has been shifted to concentrate more closely on supervisory duties. Accordingly, certain questions have been deleted which deal with routine calculations and basic product knowledge and questions on new federal and SRO rules and regulations have been incorporated into the exam, as well as questions on new products, supervision and changes in industry practices. The revised examination and specifications include coverage of these new areas. The examination will remain a six-hour, two-part, 200 question examination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

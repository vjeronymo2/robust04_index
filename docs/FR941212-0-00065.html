			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the development of Amendment 7 is moving forward quickly, it will likely take several months for it to be completed and implemented, if approved. However, because the primary multispecies stocks have reached dangerously low levels, the Council and NMFS believe it is imperative that fishing effort on these stocks be curtailed as much as practicable on an immediate basis. The Council and NMFS are also concerned about displaced effort resulting from vessels re-directing their effort from Georges Bank multispecies stocks into other areas outside of Georges Bank and into other fisheries, creating ever more competition for fewer and fewer fish. Further, more and more vessels probably will be displaced into the small-mesh fisheries where there is sometimes a high rate of juvenile and legal-size multispecies bycatch. Given this concern, on October 27, 1994, the Council voted to recommend that the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) take emergency action to implement immediate protective measures to slow the stock decline as much as practicable and to address the consequent effort displacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the very serious condition of the multispecies stocks and the need to begin addressing this crisis, NMFS believes that emergency action is warranted. These emergency measures build upon the existing provisions of Amendment 5 and are in no way a panacea for the multispecies fishery crises at hand. They are a set of initial measures addressing the immediate interim need to begin the process of curtailing fishing pressure on these stocks and addressing vessel displacement. The measures were selected among other options because they are relatively less controversial, as evidenced by the near unanimous support of the Council; the measures and the scope of their impacts can be relatively easily defined, given the emergency nature of this action and the need for a quick response, and the short timeframe available to implement emergency actions; and they are more narrowly focused and therefore more easily administered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has, therefore, determined it necessary to implement the following measures in the multispecies fishery as an emergency action. The first measure closes Area I (as defined in the Council's proposed FAAS 7), Area II, and the Nantucket Lightship Closed Area immediately and simultaneously. Because these areas all have historically high concentrations of various multispecies, closing them will help slow the decline of the stocks through a reduction in fishing mortality. Also, Area II is being closed earlier than currently required, and simultaneously with Area I and the Nantucket Lightship Area in order to protect against any effort displacement from one area to another while this measure is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second measure prohibits scallop vessels from the closed areas. Scallopers have been known to catch significant amounts of yellowtail flounder, as well as other multispecies. There have also been reports that scallop dredge gear disturbs the bottom and disrupts spawning activity; therefore, this measure will also help rebuild multispecies stocks in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third measure disallows any fishery utilizing mesh smaller than the minimum mesh size for regulated species, except for fisheries that have been determined to have a catch of less than 5 percent by weight of regulated species, and prohibits the possession of regulated species while fishing with small mesh. Current regulations limit possession of regulated species by vessels fishing with small mesh nets to the lesser of 10 percent of the total catch or 500 lb (226.8 kg). The Council is concerned about reports that this measure is being abused, resulting in increased mortality of juvenile multispecies stocks. Furthermore, recent anecdotal information indicates that there has been some perceivable recruitment in the Gulf of Maine haddock stock. This action will protect juvenile haddock, which if caught in a small-mesh fishery would have to be discarded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because fishing effort will likely shift to small-mesh fisheries as the result of this emergency action, prohibiting the possession of regulated species in all areas while fishing with small mesh will remove any incentive to target multispecies stocks. The Council proposed that no fishery using small-mesh nets ``be allowed that has not been verified to have a catch of less than five percent by weight of regulated species.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' The Regional Director has determined that the purse seine and midwater trawl fisheries in all areas, the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank regulated mesh area, the sea scallop net fishery in the Mid-Atlantic regulated mesh area, and the butterfish, dogfish, herring, Atlantic mackerel, ocean pout, scup, shrimp, squid, summer flounder, whiting, and weakfish fisheries in the Southern New England and Mid-Atlantic regulated mesh areas meet this requirement. The Regional Director may close these or other fisheries, based on a determination that the catch of regulated species is 5 percent or more by weight, or may exempt a closed fishery, based on a determination that the catch of regulated species is less than 5 percent by weight. Any such closure or exemption will be done through publication of a rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth measure requires all mobile gear vessels fishing in the Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge areas, with the exception of midwater trawl vessels, to use 6-inch (15.24-cm) square-mesh codends. This restriction is already in place under Amendment 5 during the period March 1 through July 31, and applies to the last 140 bars of the codend and extension piece. To address several recent concerns raised by the fishing industry_namely, small boats do not have nets as long as 140 bars_the Council voted to adjust this requirement such that vessels greater than 45 ft (13.7 m) must have 100 bars of square mesh in the codend and extension piece, and vessels 45 ft (13.7 m) and under must have 50 bars of square mesh in the codend and extension piece. Although this adjustment to the current FMP has not been submitted to NMFS, it is the clear intent of the Council and is, therefore, reflected in this emergency action. Because square mesh allows for better escapement of juvenile cod as well as other roundfish, this measure is being extended to protect this known productive fishing grounds; also, due to the area's close proximity to shore, this measure will serve as a protection against effort displacement. Further, protection is particularly warranted in light of recent research surveys by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts indicating the possibility that the 1993 year class of cod is better than expected in this general area. These new recruits will be very vulnerable to fishing in 1995 and this action has a high potential of protecting them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth and final measure requires that the minimum mesh size in southern New England, east of 72 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;30 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; W. lat., be set at 6-inch (15.24-cm) diamond or square, consistent with the mesh-size requirement in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank areas. Increasing the minimum diamond mesh size will increase the escapement of cod and other roundfish, thereby providing additional protection for juvenile and sub-legal fish. Vessels fishing near the boundary of the current Georges Bank Regulated Mesh Area will be required to use the same mesh as those fishing inside the area. Also, this measure will help protect an important component of the Georges Bank cod stock that migrates through the Nantucket Shoals area and waters south of Martha's Vineyard during the winter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of &sect;651.32 is temporarily suspended and paragraph (c) of &sect;651.32 is temporarily added to ensure that cross-referencing between regulatory text temporarily added and regulatory text remaining unchanged in 50 CFR part 651 is accurate and meaningful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

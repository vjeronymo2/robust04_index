			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Satellite links accord Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands have signed an agreement to smooth the path for organisations planning to link their European operations by satellite, writes Alan Cane. It will allow one-stop shopping for the necessary telecommunications licences. A single application to a co-ordinator in one of the countries will be sufficient for all four. The licence will allow voice and data transmission via satellite between the countries.</p>

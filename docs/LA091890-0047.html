			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 47;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMATIC FRONT:  </P> <P> In response to "very grave illegal acts" by Iraqis who raided Western embassy  buildings in Kuwait, 12 European Community governments agreed to expel Iraqi  military attaches and restrict the movements of other Iraqi diplomats. They  also agreed to pressure countries suspected of not respecting U.N. sanctions  against Iraq. Further sanctions also got a boost as President Bush endorsed  expanding the trade embargo to include air traffic.  </P> <P> In meetings with senior U.S. officials, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens  expressed concern about an expected $20 billion increase in U.S. arms sales to  Saudi Arabia and asked for additional aid. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and  Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations after a break of 52 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> Gen. Michael J. Dugan was fired as Air Force chief of staff for his blunt  comments about U.S. contingency plans for massive air strikes whose targets  would include Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his family. The four-star  general said he regretted any embarrassment that his comments may have caused  the Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostage Front:  </P> <P> Iraqi troops randomly seized young men fleeing Kuwait but let their sobbing  wives, mothers and older men continue into Saudi Arabia. Refugees said busloads  of men between the ages of 17 and 45 were seen being shipped north, toward  Iraq.  </P> <P> In Jordan, officials shut down the last of three infamous refugee camps and  moved the last of the residents to a clean, efficient village of tents to await  their turn to go home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trade Front:  </P> <P> Oil prices soared to their highest levels in seven years as supply fears and  further jitters over the Mideast crisis swept through the market. Oil futures  soared to record levels, above $33 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile  Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crisis Indicators:  </P> <P> * U.S. troops in/near Saudi Arabia: more than 150,000  </P> <P> * Personnel in Saudi army: 37,500  </P> <P> * Egyptian troops in Saudi Arabia: 4,000  </P> <P> * Iraqi troops in/near Kuwait border: 265,000  </P> <P> * Americans evacuated by charter plane: 1,380  </P> <P> * Total Americans in Kuwait: 1,280  </P> <P> * Total Americans in Iraq: 170  </P> <P> * High temperature in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: 102  </P> <P> * Retail gasoline (U.S. average per gallon): $1.265, up $.02  </P> <P> * Crude oil (spot price per barrel): $32.74, up $0.97  </P></p>

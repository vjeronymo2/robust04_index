			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTH TUSTIN;  </P> <P> DAY-CARE CENTER SUED OVER MISHAP  </P> <P> The parents of a 2-year-old boy left paralyzed and brain-damaged after tumbling  into a swimming pool at an unlicensed day-care center in the Orange County  community of North Tustin have sued the center's owners, the county and the  state, contending that stricter regulation of the facility could have prevented  the accident. Christy Kolbet, 40, and Derek Weston, 29, of Santa Ana, seek  unspecified damages for the accident March 30 at the Cowan Heights home of  Diane and Orvel Brooks. Jonathan Derek Weston and two other children fell into  the Brooks' pool when the couple's daughter, Carol, left them unattended. A  14-month-old boy, Arthur M. Griese, died about 24 hours after Orvel Brooks  pulled him from the water. Another 2-year-old, Melissa Dianne Polsfoot,  suffered permanent brain damage.  </P></p>

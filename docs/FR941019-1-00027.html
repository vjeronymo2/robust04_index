			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to the issuance of that supplemental NPRM, the FAA became aware that a necessary requirement, which was previously proposed in the initially-issued NPRM, was incorrectly omitted from the supplemental NPRM. The original NPRM was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 9, 1994, (59 FR 5966). That action would have required operators to test the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position due to side loads on the throttle levers; quadrants that failed the test (hereafter called ``the side-load test'') would be required to be modified or replaced. Those actions would have been required to be accomplished in accordance with the instructions contained in Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A600&hyph;0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes); or Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0374, Revision 1, dated September 30, 1992 (for Models CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that performance of this side-load test is necessary in order to adequately address the unsafe condition presented by the problems identified with the operation of the engine throttle quadrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators should note that the originally-issued NPRM would have required that throttle quadrants failing the side-load test be modified in accordance with the Canadair service bulletins released in 1992 (referred to above). However, in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadair service bulletins released in November 1993 (referred to above), throttle quadrants that failed the abrupt-movement check would be replaced with a new unit. The FAA has determined that it is not logical to require that the throttle quadrants be modified if they fail the side-load test and subsequently be replaced by a new unit if they fail the abrupt-movement check. The FAA has determined, instead, that both the side-load test and the abrupt-movement check must be performed, and units that fail either test must be replaced in accordance with the Canadair service bulletins dated November 1993. (Units that pass the tests would be required eventually to be replaced at a later time.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the compliance time for the proposed eventual replacement of the engine throttle quadrant on all airplanes was incorrectly expressed in the previous supplemental NPRM as ``1,200 flight hours.'' The compliance time for this proposed requirement should have been specified as ``4,500 hours time-in-service.'' (The ``1,200'' figure actually represented the number of landings that is approximately equivalent to 4,500 hours time-in-service for the majority of the affected fleet.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this supplemental NPRM would require:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A one-time test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if side loads on the throttles will cause the throttle levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle quadrant if it fails this test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A one-time functional check of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if a quick, sharp pull on the throttles will cause the throttle levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle quadrant if it fails this functional check; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Replacement of the throttle quadrant as terminating action for the requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, paragraph (e) of this supplemental NPRM indicates the corrected compliance time of ``4,500 hours time-in-service'' for replacement of the throttle quadrant. Expressing this compliance time in terms of ``hours time-in-service'' makes it consistent with the compliance terms for the other requirements of this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since certain of these changes expand the scope of the previously proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed side-loads test of the engine throttle quadrant would take approximately 17 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this proposed requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,250, or $935 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed abrupt-movement check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed functional check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $231,000, or $1,540 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

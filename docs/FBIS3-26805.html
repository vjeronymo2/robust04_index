			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Correspondent Tian Guo (3944 6665) and Reporter Wang </F> Dongmei (3769 0392 2734): "Wang Qun, secretary of the Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, Urges Effective  Investigation and Handling of Cases After Hearing the Regional  Procuratorate's Anticorruption Work Report"]    [Text] Recently, the regional party committee and the  regional people's congress standing committee respectively heard  the work report of the regional procuratorate. After hearing  the report, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee  and chairman of the regional people's congress standing  committee, made important instructions.    Wang Qun said: Last year particularly after the launching of  the anticorruption struggle, the procuratorial organs across the  region concentrated energy to investigate and handle a number of  major and appalling cases and made noticeable achievements.  However, the current situation cannot catch up with the  requirements of the party Central Committee and the expectations  of the people. This year, the procuratorial organs should  continuously regard the investigations and handling of the cases  that take place at leading party and government organs, judicial  departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and  economic management departments as their duty-bound political  task; conscientiously and effectively attend to it; and  unswervingly deal blows to serious economic criminal activities,  including corruption and bribery cases. We should give priority  to and attach primary importance to investigating and handling  the major and appalling cases that can produce great impacts and  big damages.    He stressed: All localities should proceed from reality, sum  up the experiences in investigating and handling cases,  strengthen the extent of attack, and thoroughly investigate the  cases no matter who involves. It is necessary to make a key  breakthrough in investigating major cases and to rapidly attack  the cases that have accurately been investigated. We should  ensure not to have the cases half-handled lest forfeit the  chance for combat should be forfeited. The anticorruption  struggle is extremely complicated. Those criminal offenders have  tried every possible means to avoid being attacked and adopted  various countermeasures against us. The procuratorial organs  should bravely carry forward the spirit of marching forward  despite hardship, weariness, and risks and deeply and constantly  wage the struggle against corruption.    In regard to the issue of strictly enforcing laws, he said:  Chief Procurator Zhang Siqing mentioned that at present, a tiny  number of localities and department leaders still have confused  understanding about the relationship between anticorruption and  the economic work and there still exist the phenomena of  replacing laws by words, using power to repress laws, practicing  local protectionism, and lacking the courage to face  difficulties. These problems warrant our attention. We should  firmly attend to the law enforcement work and attach importance  to grasping and publicly handling the cases of administrative  and law enforcement organs and financial departments not  strictly enforcing laws and seriously violating discipline. In  investigating and handling the major and appalling cases of this  category, the procuratorial organs should pay attention to  dissecting and analyzing the cases, draw inferences about other  cases from one instance, and transfer the cases that offenders  are not subject to criminal responsibilities to relevant  departments for handling. If these problems are not solved, it  will be difficult to create a new situation in waging the  anticorruption struggle.    He urged that the leaders of the party committees at various  levels should have a high degree of political responsibility,  smash all ideological obstacles, eliminate all interference and  obstructions, free themselves from the restrictions of personnel  relations, and enthusiastically and effectively support the work  of procuratorial organs in line with the principle of "being  resolute first and prudent second and being sure to do  accurately." Simultaneously, we should do our best to eliminate  the procuratorial organs' economic difficulties in handling  cases.</p>

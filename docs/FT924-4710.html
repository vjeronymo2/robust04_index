			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Scottish Power With coal contracts which last until 1995 already in the bag, Scottish Power can afford to watch the battle over British Coal with an air of detachment. It is vulnerable nonetheless. The threat is not so much that the government might stop it exporting to enable English and Welsh electricity companies to buy more British coal. Scottish Power's exports are also fuelled from domestic coal, so that would hardly solve the problem of pit closures. But with demand at home likely to remain flat through the rest of the decade, Scottish Power badly needs to increase exports. Better transmission facilities will more than double export capacity to the rest of the UK by the middle of the decade. It will show an attractive return only if Scottish Power can continue to undercut the English generators on price. With the government's energy review still unwritten, the price of electricity in the second half of the decade looks deeply uncertain. The company may not be as indifferent to the outcome of the review as it would like the market to think. Yesterday's interim figures suggest Scottish Power can keep pace with the sector for now simply by taking out costs. Its involvement in every stage of electricity from generation to transmission and supply arguably leave it more open to regulatory interference. There could be an appeal to the monopolies commission next year, for example, if the company gets a bad deal on transmission prices. Having been privatised on less attractive terms than its southern neighbours, Scottish Power has less to lose. With the market starting to focus on recovery, though, the limited downside will not support the shares for long.</p>

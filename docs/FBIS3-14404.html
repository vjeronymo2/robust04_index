			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ineffectual Treatment of Chronic Condition"] </F>   [Text] It was natural that the UN Security Council should  restate the need to keep the sanctions in place, having reviewed  the aberrant Baghdad regime's track record, which shows it to be  persistent in its wrong-headedness, flouting all rules of  international law. The Security Council has made Iraq's  compliance with its resolutions a condition for lifting the  sanctions. The nefarious calls that sought to crack the unity  of the international position and thus unleash the Iraqi beast  while it is still consumed with hatred and aggressiveness have  collapsed.    With the extension of the sanctions, the international  community must now be wondering about the point in seeking to  remedy the pathological mindset and conduct that have typified  Saddam Husayn's regime since his bloody coup in the early  seventies. Can we realistically hope that the wolf will change  its inherently treacherous ways? How much longer will it be  before the Western powers satisfy themselves that the treatment  is ineffectual and the cure impossible?    Our questions are prompted by a conviction supported by  evidence that a disease persists and that amputation is the only  cure to this corrupt regime. This is because the blockade and  isolation have changed nothing in Saddam Husayn's behavior and  mentality. He continues to issue threats. The dangers posed by  the Baghdad regime will only go with its disappearance, since it  has become a captive of positions based on treachery,  aggression, and empty heroics, which it hopes will, one of these  days, help him defeat the world!    The international community knew that the military  confrontation that ended in the Iraqi occupation troops being  driven from Kuwait was not enough to strike at the root of cause  of aggression. Now, four years into the life of the sanctions  and political isolation, this regime does not seem to have  changed a bit. In its adamant refusal to recognize Kuwait's  sovereignty over its territory, this regime is a peculiar mix of  aggressiveness and arrogance. It continues to hold Kuwaiti  prisoners as a bargaining chip, it flouts UN resolutions, and  works to regain its offensive capabilities in order to resume  the battle that has been weaved into its political fabric.    Trade sanctions and political isolation, as a form of  treatment for this fatal disease, have ceased to have any  healing effects. Every two months, the world will continue to  review the Baghdad regime's compliance with the Security Council  resolutions. However, the world will one day wake up to  discover that this beast, which is swayed by an aggressive  instinct, has unshackled itself to shed more blood; and herein  lies the responsibility of the international community.</p>

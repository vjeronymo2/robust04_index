Among those travelling, laborers seeking jobs outside their  provinces are a large proportion. As predicted by pertinent  departments, the total number of laborers flowing from region to  region during the Spring Festival this year will exceed 10  million. For this reason, persons in charge of various  localities and departments should make appropriate preparations  and concerted efforts to straighten out the flow of laborers  around the Spring Festival.    Over the past few years, along with the urban and rural  economic development, the shift of rural surplus labors to  nonagricultural sectors has gathered pace, and laborers seeking  jobs outside their regions have repeatedly increased. This has  become a phenomenon in China's economic life, which merits  people's attention. Thanks to the growth of agricultural  productive forces and the markets of production factors, the  emergence of such a phenomenon in China's economic life during  the transition period from an agricultural to an industrial  country, and from a backward to a modernized economy is, to a  certain extent, inevitable. On the one hand, it has accelerated  the mutually promotive and beneficial economic relationships  among various regions, which is conducive to the improvement of  peasants' lives and the enhancement of economic level as a  whole, but on the other hand it has brought forth problems  having an adverse impact on production, living order, social  stability, and so on, owing to the blind flow on a large scale.  In this regard, governments and functional departments at all  levels should fully exercise their role of macroscopic  regulation and control and play a positive part in actively  cultivating and fostering labor markets, providing services to  the rural population, and straightening out the flow of laborers  with a view to bringing about the development, utilization, and  rational distribution of rural labor resources, boosting  economic construction, and maintaining good social order.    The work to direct the flow of laborers during the Spring  Festival is difficult to tackle and demands high techniques for  its numerous links and concentrated tasks to be fulfilled in a  short period of time. On the basis of summing up past  experience, various localities and departments should study and  work out measures and emergency plans to direct the flow by  conscientiously intensifying leadership and meticulously  organizing the masses to ensure that all measures are carried  out in good time. In light of the quantity and direction of the  flow, the railway and communication departments should draw up  plans in advance and make proper arrangements for  transportation. In the arrangements of tickets, runs, flights,  and so on, efforts should be made to convenience the returning  laborers, and the communication system should undergo strict  technical and standardized examination to really ensure  passengers' safety. Departments in charge of labor power in  various localities should seriously perform their duties of  organization, management, coordination, and others so as to keep  abreast of the condition of the flow. Public security  departments should properly organize the police force to  maintain order in stations and ports as well as on traffic  lines, and severely crack down on road robbers and other  criminal activities so as to strengthen the sense of safety  among the masses.    The work to direct the flow of laborers is an important  policy issue. In treating the masses, first of all, it is  necessary to provide good services to them, pay attention to the  work method in handling the matter, take an amicable and cordial  attitude toward them, and refrain from being harsh and  impetuous, lest it should sharpen the contradiction.  Departments in charge of labor power and civil affairs should  coordinate with other departments in patiently persuading and  helping the transients to return home as early as possible.  Propaganda departments should vigorously publicize the  necessity of rational transference and orderly flow of rural  surplus labor, disseminate the good experience in transference  to work in local or nearby regions and organized exports of  labor, and make peasants realize the drawbacks of seeking jobs  in other regions. It is necessary to correctly explain and  implement the party's policies so as to prevent peasants from  misunderstanding these policies. In light of the seasonal and  periodic characteristics and law governing the flow of rural  laborers, leading cadres in various localities should pay close  attention to carrying out the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, while studying  the issue of agricultural development, study and formulate  policies and measures to facilitate the employment and  utilization of rural laborers and boost labor markets, so as to  take the initiative in settling the problem at an early date and  in an effective way.    The work to direct the flow of laborers around the Spring  Festival is a major event that has a bearing on the immediate  interests of and the social stability for millions upon millions  of peasants. All localities and departments should fully  realize its importance and take the work as a specific content  of transforming government functions, changing work style, and  doing practical things for the people. Hence, efforts should be  made to do the work appropriately so that the vast numbers of  people in cities and villages can spend a joyful and auspicious  Spring Festival, thus making a good start for the work in the  coming year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin and </F> Yuriy Tyssovskiy]    [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- "I would most resolutely recommend  to the Serbian side not to test the patience of the world  community," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today.  He was speaking to journalists at a news conference after his  talks with Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive  Committee and president of the Palestinian State.    It goes without saying, the Russian foreign policy chief  said, that we call for restraint from all sides in the conflict.    Kozyrev spoke highly of the initiative by French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, with whom he had a telephone conversation  this morning. A. Juppe has proposed that Russia, the United  States, the European Union, and the United Nations work out,  once and for all, a united stand on the conflict in Bosnia.  Andrey Kozyrev called this proposal "highly promising and  timely." We have long been striving for this, he said, and we  hope that under the present critical circumstances our American  friends and partners will treat this initiative seriously.  Ultimately, this is the minimum we have to achieve -- to have a  united and well-considered political stand. This could form the  basis for the formulation of demands to the warring sides, and,  at the same time, for initiatives that would open up  opportunities for them, specifically, the lifting of sanctions  as the demands of the world community are met.</p>

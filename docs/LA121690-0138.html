			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL INDEPENDENCE BOWL;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA TECH KICKS AWAY SHOT AT WIN, TIES MARYLAND  </P> <P> Freshman Chris Boniol kicked a 29-yard field goal as time ran out Saturday  night to give Louisiana Tech a 34-34 tie with Maryland in the Independence  Bowl.  </P> <P> Lorenza Baker, whose nine tackles helped him win defensive player of the game  honors, set up the game-ending kick by returning a short kickoff 41 yards to  the Maryland 40.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs (9-3) moved to the 11 with four seconds left, then decided to go  for a tie rather than make a last bid for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Maryland (6-5-1) took a 34-31 lead with 52 seconds left on Scott Zolak's  15-yard, fourth-down touchdown pass to Barry Johnson. Zolak, who completed 18  of 28 passes for 214 yards, was sacked on the previous play by Baker.  </P> <P> Louisiana Tech went ahead, 21-14, on Michael Richardson's one-yard scoring run  with 10:35 remaining in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Richardson, offensive player of the game, scored two touchdowns and rushed for  81 yards in 27 carries.  </P> <P> Maryland went 80 yards in seven plays to get within 21-20, with Troy Jackson  going the last 11 yards for his third touchdown, tying an Independence Bowl  record. Dan DeArmas, who made 47 consecutive extra points, missed the kick wide  left in what proved to be the difference of the game.  </P> <P> Gene Johnson threw seven yards to Bobby Slaughter with 5:52 left in the third  quarter to increase Louisiana Tech's lead to 28-20. The score came four plays  after Eddie Brown's 63-yard kickoff return.  </P> <P> Tech overcame a 14-0 deficit to tie the game, 14-14, on James Davis' three-yard  scoring run with 17 seconds left in the half.  </P></p>

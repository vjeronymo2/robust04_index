			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer sees return to growth Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said it expects to return to growth in the second half of the year after reporting a net loss for the second quarter, Reuter reports. 'Sales and earnings were below expectations, particularly in the US,' the company said. 'However, we anticipate returning to growth in the second half of the year.' RPR is maintaining tight control of operating expenses, while continuing to invest in new products and technologies that will drive its future growth. The company said it will start to see the beneficial results of its restructuring plan by the end of this year. The company said second-quarter sales dipped 3.5 per cent to Dollars 973m compared with the year-ago quarter, but were about equal after the negative effects of currency fluctuations and product divestitures are excluded. Sales in the US prescription business declined because ex-factory sales, particularly of key respiratory products, are not yet matching the audited prescription growth. Sales in the North American over-the-counter business were below last year. Sales in Europe, excluding currency fluctuations and divestitures, were level with the previous year.</p>

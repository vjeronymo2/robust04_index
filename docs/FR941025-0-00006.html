Comments on the proposal to shorten the payment periods in conjunction with the SEC's shortening of the standard settlement cycle were focused on three issues: whether the payment periods should be shortened, whether the proposed language clearly accomplishes this goal, and whether future reductions in the standard settlement period should be automatically accommodated or reviewed by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Shortening the payment period by two days. The Board is adopting the proposed amendments, subject to the clarification discussed in section b below. Many of the commenters who oppose shortening the payment periods had written to the SEC last year to oppose its T+3 proposal. The Board and the SEC both have responsibilities in the area of settlement and clearance. Shortening the Regulation T payment periods is consistent with (if not required by) the SEC's adoption of a three day settlement cycle. A failure to adjust the payment periods would lessen the overall benefits to be realized from the transition to T+3 and increase risk to the broker-dealer community since they will have to settle trades amongst themselves in the shortened time frame while allowing their customers' behavior and payment patterns to remain unchanged. Increased risk to broker-dealers also affects customers with cash and securities at those firms. Adoption of the proposed amendments by the Board does not reduce the two-day period currently provided to resolve payment problems, but merely clarifies that two days beyond the usual settlement date should be sufficient to resolve any mistakes in the payment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the commenters opposed to shortening the payment periods in conjunction with the shortening of the standard settlement cycle believe that the mail system does not permit funds to be delivered within this time frame. However, the increased use of fax machines and money market mutual funds provide alternate ways for customers to make prompt payment for their securities purchases. Although the Board shares the concerns expressed about investors who rely on the mail to pay for securities, it believes that most investors will be able to adjust to the shortened periods. Indeed, the Bachmann Task Force on Clearance and Settlement Reform in U.S. Securities Markets, which recommended to the SEC that the standard settlement cycle be reduced to T+3, stated that it ``believes that current customer behavior practices should not be an obstacle to shortened settlement provided there is strong leadership from within the industry and educational efforts to address customer and account executive concerns.'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Many of the commenters stressed the fact that the brokerage industry is already educating customers about the approach of T+3 settlement and the changes this will entail. The Board is of the view that the successful implementation of T+3 includes a reduction in the Regulation T payment periods. It is expected that broker-dealers will be working with customers who may have difficulty making prompt payment. A delay in the effectiveness of shortening the payment periods would not necessarily improve the educational process, which is already well underway at most firms, and might serve as an excuse for others to delay their educational efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR 27819 (June 22, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. Uniform payment period. The proposed term ``payment period'' was defined as the two business days beyond ``the standard securities settlement cycle in the United States.'' This phrase was meant to refer to the current five day settlement cycle for most securities transactions until SEC Rule 15c6&hyph;1 becomes effective next June, at which time the Board's regulation would be referring to the three day period established in the SEC rule. Additional language has been added to the definition of payment period to clarify this point. Some commenters believed the reference to a ``standard settlement cycle'' depends on the type of security being purchased, so that trades involving standardized options or government securities, both of which settle the day after trade date, would have to be paid for by the third business day after trade date. Although broker-dealers can require payment for transactions by settlement date of the particular trade, Regulation T establishes a standard period within which customers must make payment even though certain securities settle in less than the current five day period. It was not the intent of the Board to change this general policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Impact of further reductions in settlement periods. As noted in the request for public comment, one of the reasons for using the phrase ``payment period'' instead of a fixed number of days was to ensure that future reductions in the settlement cycle would be automatically reflected in Regulation T, without the need for further amendments. Commenters were evenly split on whether the Board should be forced to review the Regulation T payment periods whenever the standard settlement cycle is altered. The proposed language has been retained. In light of the fact that investors are expected to pay for securities on settlement date, tying the payment period to the standard settlement cycle merely codifies the Board's current position that two business days should be sufficient to insure that a failure to receive the customer's payment is not due to an error or other exceptional circumstance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Granting of Extensions of Time by a Broker-dealer's Examining Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a customer has not made full cash payment or met an initial margin call within the payment period, the broker-dealer must liquidate the customer's position. However, if exceptional circumstances exist, the broker-dealer can obtain an extension for its customer. Regulation T currently permits any self-regulatory organization (SRO) to grant these extensions. A New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rule recently approved by the SEC requires broker-dealers for whom the NYSE is the designated examining authority (DEA) to obtain these extensions only from the NYSE. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Although the Board could leave Regulation T unchanged and most broker-dealers would still be required to go to their DEA instead of any SRO, the Board proposed amending Regulation T to require that extensions be granted only by a broker-dealer's DEA. This decision was based on analysis of the comments received by the Board in response to its advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the current review of Regulation T and the SEC's consideration of the NYSE rule filing. No new information was presented in this area. The Board is therefore adopting the requirement that extensions be granted by a broker-dealer's DEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 434; SEC approval: 59 FR 26826 (May 24, 1994); Securities Exchange Act Release 34073 (May 17, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

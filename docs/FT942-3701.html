			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Kashmir abductors' 'safe passage' offer The kidnappers of two Britons in Kashmir were offered a 'safe passage corridor' by the Indian authorities yesterday to facilitate the quick release of their captives. Mr David Housego, father of a 16-year-old who is one of the captives, last night issued a statement, intended to be heard by the captors, detailing assurances given by the Indian authorities after meetings he had with them in Srinagar. 'Both the British government and I have received assurances from the state authorities that no operations will be carried out which will in any manner endanger the release of Kim (Housego) and David Mackie,' Mr Housego said by telephone from Srinagar. 'The assurances I have received also include giving a safe passage corridor to Harkat-ul-Ansar (the militant group) to enable the release of the two Britons within 24 hours or even sooner.' The assurances appeared to meet the concerns of the captors, who had said release was being hampered by the presence of Indian forces. Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, Pakistan-based leader of Harkat-ul-Ansar, yesterday urged Indian troops pursuing his fighters to pull back to create an opportunity for the captives to be released. He told the Financial Times in Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistani-governed region of Kashmir, that he had given instructions that the safety of the two 'guests' should be absolutely assured. But he was concerned that Indian security forces which had cordoned the area in which the militants were hiding had come very close. 'Nobody wants anything to happen to our guests because that would be a discredit to our organisation,' said Mr Kashmiri.</p>

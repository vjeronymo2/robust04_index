			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "British Parliament's Report Is Out of Step </F> With the Times"]    [Text] From last July to last February, a series of eight  hearings was held by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Select Committee. During these hearings, many men of insight --  including Cradock -- called for a "stance that Britain must  abide by the Joint Declaration," and they criticized changes in  Britain's China policy as "injuring others without benefiting  oneself." The Foreign Affairs Select Committee, however, turned  a deaf ear to these criticisms, and on 13 April published a  report entitled: "Anglo- Chinese Relations Before and After  1997." Following its publication, the report was widely  criticized by the media, which said that it "is "out of step  with the times," "lacks a sense of historical reality," and "is  irresponsible and erroneous." The Foreign Affairs Committee of  the China's National People's Congress also sternly rebuked the  report for flagrantly advocating viewpoints and suggestions  hostile to China, and expressed its strong indignation at the  report's wanton interference in China's internal affairs.    The British parliamentary report lacked a sense of  historical  reality. It could not but admit that the Chinese economy, with  a vast market, is developing at full speed and thus Britain must  maintain ties with China, but with the exception of this, all of  its viewpoints and suggestions were hostile to China's  flourishing development. Moreover, the report barefacedly  stated that it was necessary not only to reverse the Joint  Declaration, but also to repudiate the principles for  establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain. It  called for turning back Britain's China policy to the 19th  century to try to revive the old historical dream in which the  great British Empire wantonly interfered in and split up China.    The report confessed that "Britain undeniably has changed  its  ways." It said: "It should not be taken for granted that the  Beijing regime will last beyond 1997, so Britain should not draw  up a rigid China policy." That is to say, even though Britain  promised in the Joint Declaration to return Hong Kong to China  and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the  transition period, the report proposed that the above-mentioned  China policy "should not be formulated rigidly," which clearly  laid bare Britain's malicious intention to rack its brains and  to seize any opportunity to obstruct the implementation of the  Joint Declaration.    The article "Our Basic Stand on the Issue of Hong Kong" and  its annotations, which were published in the "Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping," showed very clearly that the British side would  not return Hong Kong to China willingly. The fact that at that  time, Mrs Thatcher put forward the "thesis of the validity of  the three unequal treaties" and the "thesis of exchanging  sovereignty for administrative authority" indicated Britain's  holy grail of extending its administration over Hong Kong, but  China warned the British side that if it did not change its  position, China could not but unilaterally announce its own  principles and policies for settling the Hong Kong issue. Only  under this situation did Britain acknowledge that Hong Kong's  sovereignty and administration should completely revert to  China, and did Britain sign the Joint Declaration. However,  Deng Xiaoping foresaw long ago that during the transition  period, it would be mainly the British that created artificial  chaos. It showed that the Chinese side was on the alert long  ago against the likelihood that the British side -- under  various pretexts and by all kinds of tricks -- definitely would  attempt to obstruct China's resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong. The report imputed the reason for  the change in Britain's China policy to the "Beijing  disturbance" in 1989, which was absolutely a sophistry. As a  matter of fact, this is the natural instinct of the British  colonialists. International agreements, once signed, should be  implemented, and no signatory should ever flagrantly interfere  in the other party's internal affairs and take the latter's  internal affairs as a pretext for not fulfilling agreements.  The raging tide of cracking down on separatist activities in  Northern Ireland and of mass resistance to the poll tax, as well  as human rights problems, also were seen in Britain, but China  had never made it a pretext for shirking its responsibility to  fulfil the Joint Declaration.    In her memoirs entitled "The Downing Street Years," Mrs.  Thatcher wrote that faced with China's solemn position, the  British side could not but "indicate that we did not anticipate  there would still be any power linkage between Britain and Hong  Kong, or that Britain would have any obligation in Hong Kong  after 1997. However, I felt sorry about that." For those who  "felt sorry about" the fact that the British side could not but  sign the Joint Declaration, the "Beijing disturbance" was a  misfortune over which they gloated, and they harbored the  illusion of a fluke rather than felt "sorry" about the  situation, and even did not hesitate to make a reckless move,  which was precisely a manifestation of colonialists unwilling to  retreat from the historical scene. The report attacked Articles  18 and 58 of the Basic Law, barefacedly opposed the fact that  China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, urged the European Union  to draw up anti-China policies, extended support to Patten's  unilateral action in his "three violations" political reform  package, and even flagrantly called for meddling in the Tibet  and Taiwan issues. All these attacks are a resurgence of the  die-hard nature of colonialism throughout history.    The report made various viewpoints and suggestions that  were hostile to China, demonstrating that some people in Britain  still try to employ tricks and to handle Sino-British relations  with the gestures of a past century. The extent of the  deficiency in their sense of historical reality and their  inability to keep up with the times is amazing. The report  said: "From the Opium War on, China has been forced to adapt to  a new order of the international community backed by the  international law, and this process is yet to be completed."  This remark really hit the nail on the head and fully exposed  Britain's motive in changing its China policy, that is, it wants  to revert to the historical stage, from the Opium War to the  years before 1949, when Britain plundered and split up China.  The new China, however, rejected the so-called "order" imposed  by Britain and other powers from the West. Hence, those  die-hard colonialists in Britain yearn for the likelihood that  the Chinese people's regime "may not last beyond 1997" and that  the "process" of extending British rule over Hong Kong will be  "completed!"    However, as China grows rich, strong, and prosperous, it is  fully capable of resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong on schedule. Moreover, Britain and other countries from  the West will never be allowed to interfere in China's internal  affairs or to split up its territory. While it has become a  historical trend for every country in the world to develop its  cherished relations with China, the British parliamentary report  attempted to organize an international anti-China coalition to  contain China, split it up, and obstruct it from resuming  sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, all these moves indicated  that they merely overrated their abilities. History will prove  that the British parliamentary report merely noted down the  dishonorable trouble-making scheme worked out by British  colonialists when they were withdrawing from Hong Kong, whereas  such a scheme is doomed to fail.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Stone plans to raise Dollars 386m in note issues STONE Container, the Chicago-based international packaging and paper group, is raising USDollars 386m with two note issues and considering spinning off its newsprint and groundwood papers operations through a public equity issue. Stone bought its Canadian, British and German newsprint and packaging operations in 1989 for CDollars 2.6bn (USDollars 2bn). It detached the profitable Europa Carton business in Germany, making it a direct subsidiary of Stone Container, Chicago. The newsprint mills in eastern Canada, Arizona and Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, were soon battered by the global recession. Stone has about USDollars 4bn debt and is raising USDollars 250m by the private placement of notes yielding 9 per cent and convertible into common stock at USDollars 11.15 a share It is also raising about USDollars 150m with a five-year note at 12.625 per cent interest. The net proceeds of the issues will be about USDollars 386m. The company confirmed it was pursuing a spin-off of its newsprint interests into a new public company as 'an attractive option'. The newsprint unit would include the Canadian, US and UK mills. A share issue would raise about USDollars 250m in new equity. The unit would have annual sales of around USDollars 1bn with annual capacity of 1.7m tonnes of newsprint and groundwood papers. Mr Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong hotel magnate, plans to buy Toronto's luxury Sutton Place Kempinski from a group of German investors for a reported price below CDollars 40m, or less than half book value. The hotel has been in receivership since December. Mr Ho bought a similar luxury hotel in Vancouver in 1988 and contracted management to Meridien, the Air France subsidiary. He is also a shareholder in Meridien. He has also contracted management of Sutton Place to Meridien.</p>

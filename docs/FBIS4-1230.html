			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by L. Braid] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 23 SAPA -- The new Government of  National Unity would have five years in which to lay the  foundation for a new South Africa, State President F W de Klerk  said on Saturday [23 April]. If this foundation was not laid  well, the country would pay an expensive price later. Mr de  Klerk was addressing a luncheon of the President 100 Club  attended by 450 people.    "We have a one-off chance to get it right. This is not the  time for people to vote for their little prejudices, but to vote  on a basis of principles and policies with regard to the major  issues which have to be addressed in the next five years."    He said a vote for the small parties with a narrow focus  would be wasted. "These parties focusing on specific issues  cannot be trusted because they over-emphasise only one aspect  and ignore the total picture.    "These are serious times and many of the smaller parties are  making a joke out of an election which will determine the course  and direction of the country."    Turning to the National Party's two main opponents, Mr de  Klerk said if the African National Congress had too much power,  it would play into the hands of the "wild ones" in the party. If  the ANC was cut down to size by a strong NP [National Party], it  would provide a balance of power which South Africa needed.    He said he was deeply disappointed that the Democratic Party  had found it necessary to demonise the NP as if it was the main  threat to the future. "I would have expected the DP to stand up  and fight the ANC and say that we should not waste time trying  to cut each others' throats, but instead gather support for that  which we believe in."    Although the NP could not claim all the honour for change,  it  had been the initiator and had had the guts and courage to  change itself from within. "I ask for a mandate to enter the  Government of National Unity to represent the moderates with  assertiveness because we will have a strong, wide, deep power  base," he said.</p>

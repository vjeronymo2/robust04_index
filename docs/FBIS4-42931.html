			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Owe Wiktorin, Armed Forces Supreme Commander </F> designate, by Sune Olofson; place and date not given]    [Text] [Olofson] You will be a supreme commander who will  probably have to pilot the defense forces into yet another  period of cuts. Money is tight and the JAS [multirole combat  aircraft] project, with the high rate of exchange of the dollar  and the low rate of exchange for the krona, threatens to explode  the defense forces' overall budget. How will you sort all this  out?    [Wiktorin] After the 1992 Defense Bill came the crisis  package, which reduced our scope for action. Then there was the  Navy's strained budget and the uncertainties of the price  compensation system that could possibly affect the Jas project.  These are uncertainty factors affecting how we are to deal with  things.    We should not be raising problems at the present time, for  when I look around in the defense forces I see optimism for the  future, drive, professional colleagues, and a strong sense of  loyalty. I think that we will be able to comply with the  Defense Bill if we are not hit by further cuts. Within the  framework of an almost unchanged budget, we have cut the  organization by almost one-third, with the concomitant stresses  for personnel. Now we need peace and quiet in which to work,  order and stability to put into practice the decisions already  made.    [Olofson] Do you really believe that the defense forces will  be able to afford to modernize 16 Army brigades?    [Wiktorin] The Defense Bill says that 16 brigades are to be  modernized up to the end of the century. I am assuming that the  decision reached by the Riksdag remains in force. There is no  other thrust I know of.    [Olofson] Since 1987 the number of Army brigades has fallen  from 29 to 16. The Social Democrats, with a majority of voters  behind them, are proposing 8 to 10 brigades. Sweden's land area  is large, its coast long. Are you prepared to administer just  any old watered-down military organization?    [Wiktorin] Regardless of the color of the government it has  the responsibility for the security of the country. It is  impossible to water down the Army's wartime organization just  any way. If the amount of money is cut considerably we will not  be able to modernize and sharpen the defense forces that remain.  We would then be in a very bad position. It is my view that we  are very close to the point of no return.    [Olofson] But is it not the case, Owe Wiktorin, that if the  modernization of the Armed Forces is to continue their concrete  organization must become even smaller?    [Wiktorin] I do not rule out the possibility that more such  steps could come; this depends to some extent on technical  developments and on what solutions we can find together.  Sixteen brigades, 16 Air Force divisions are not fixed figures  for me.    Regardless of whether we have an increased, unchanged, or  reduced budget it is possible that we might want to reduce the  number of units so that they are sufficiently sharp. It is the  overall defense strength and potential in a new security  situation that is decisive. Increases in quality must continue.    [Olofson] You have proposed a new sort of doctrine, the  three-dimensional war, which requires quicker and more mobile  units with different sorts of defense missions. Does this mean  that you advocate attack helicopters?    [Wiktorin] If we have fewer units we will have to  compensate for that weakness with increased mobility. Otherwise  things do not fit together. We would not be able to defend the  whole country. An orientation involving increased mobility was  laid down in part in the 1992 Defense Bill. That was when the  decision for 120 mobile tanks was taken and we hope to receive  an additional 80 in a later option.    Attack helicopters are a very desirable complement, but  given  the budget we have today reflection is needed. It is doubtful  whether we can afford these expensive systems at the present  time, but studies are being carried out.    For the time being at least we can make do with more  powerful  engines in the lightweight SK-60 attack aircraft. It is true  that they cannot do everything that helicopters can, but they  can do quite a lot.    [Olofson] We taxpayers pay out 40 billion a year to the  defense forces. But what do we actually get to know about the  defense forces' capacity and what we in the end get for our  money?    [Wiktorin] After the far-reaching changes in Central Europe  and Russia we can probably sleep pretty soundly at night. The  problem is that the situation could change rapidly, and as the  next supreme commander I would like us to be in an even better  position. But we are strong in several areas.    There is much of which we can be proud in the defense  forces,  but it is so un-Swedish to give oneself a pat on the back.  International experts shower words of praise on Swedish UN  soldiers. Our defense industry has never been at such a high  technical level as it is now. We must defend it.    [Olofson] In your years as chief of the defense staff in  Stockholm and military commander in southern Sweden did you know  about the defense forces' secret cooperation with NATO countries?    [Wiktorin] During my career as an officer I have never had  any impression or indication that we officers had overstepped  the limits of the security policy decided on by the government  and Riksdag.    [Olofson] The whole of the Swedish people has been thought  to have been duped; there has never been any real neutrality to  speak of, has there?    [Wiktorin] I have read the report of the commission on  neutrality policy with great interest and note that an  overwhelming amount of information exists at the political  level, in defense committees and elsewhere, but no one debated  the matter. On a broad front there was a "lid-on" approach that  we can be surprised by and criticize. After all we do want an  open society.    [Olofson] Will you, like your predecessor, Bengt Gustafsson,  be taking the step in the direction of a Nordic defense alliance?    [Wiktorin] In the current situation I see no base for such  an alliance; if such an alliance does come about, it is a  process that will have to be thrashed out in a political debate.  On the other hand I want a continuation and deepening of the  positive defense cooperation we already have in the Nordic area,  in the materiel field, for example.    [Olofson] Have you ever had any doubts about the submarine  violations?    [Wiktorin] Yes, about one or two individual events, but not  the overall picture. I have consciously adopted a doubting and  critical approach in order to be as unbiased as possible when  looking at analyses and reports.    [Olofson] What orientation does the Swedish military  intelligence service have after the fall of the Warsaw Pact?    [Wiktorin] In the past few years it has to a large extent  followed the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic region. The  new world that is now emerging has unfortunately led to a number  of new sources of conflict that we should also study.    [Olofson] MUST [Military Intelligence and Security Service],  the military intelligence service, claims that it will take  Russia at least 10 years to build up a new military force with  invasion capability. Is this not to underestimate the Russians'  potential?    [Wiktorin] It will probably take 10 years to build up the  military capacity that the former Soviet Union had. But the  resources for a directed military attack -- nuclear arms,  aircraft, tanks, and conventional arms -- are still there on a  frightening scale.    Russia's problems are probably more to do with low morale  and  a lack of discipline that lead to a deterioration in the  capacity to develop military effectiveness on a large scale.    It is not easy today to put forward long-term prognoses for  developments in Russia. Things could move off in any direction  at all and we should probably accept this uncertainty .    [Olofson] Have you ever noted that the defense industry, the  intelligence service, and the whole of the military  establishment have an interest in upholding a threat scenario?    [Wiktorin] Personally I have no need of this. If the world  moves in a peaceful direction and the surrounding world disarms,  we should do so too. There is no reason to maintain expensive  defense forces as a goal in itself. I am no preserver of  organizations.    [Olofson] Today the defense forces are too little in favor  of conscription. Many people want to do their national service,  but are not allowed to, others do not, but are forced to. How  do you want to solve this problem?    [Wiktorin] I am an advocate of universal conscription, not a  professional army. But combat units have to have quality and  training. Already today it is impossible within the defense  budget we have to go back to full universal conscription. This  would be too expensive and would lead to excessive numbers and  the quality side of training would be lost.    Nevertheless, if we choose to retain universal conscription,  a solution which could help to solve the problems is short-term  training for conscripts lasting two to three months for guard  duties in the framework of the Home Guard, for example.    But I will not be heavy-handed in pushing the call for  short-term training. The operational need militarily for guards  with short-term training is not particularly great.    Political talks about conscription, about how we should  solve  the problems, should be given greater depth. A new system of  conscription will not be on the agenda until after 1997.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Right Honorable the Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu  Mokhehle this morning held talks with leaders of all political  parties in the country on the current instability caused by the  strike action by members of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police and  the prisons service over salaries.    In his brief to the political leaders the prime minister  outlined the grievances that led to the police strike and that  several meetings were held between government representatives  and an eight-man police delegation to review the grievances by  the police. He said of the eight grievances presented to the  government he told the police delegation that seven were already  being addressed. The prime minister said he was disturbed that  the day after the police had started the strike action some of  them [words indistinct] and looted shops in Maseru, Mafeteng,  Leribe, and other main centers in the country.    Dr. Mokhehle said he called a meeting of the Defense  Commission to discuss the problems arising out of the strike.  He also met a delegation of the striking police, together with  the honorable minister of foreign affairs and home affairs. The  prime minister told the political leaders that after lengthy  consultations with the police delegation he told them that the  government could not afford to pay them the 60 percent salary  increase they demanded. He said all civil servants were due to  receive a 10 percent salary increase with effect from 1 April  this year, and that any salary increase affected all sections of  the civil service alike. In addition, the economy of Lesotho  was such that the level of salary increase demanded by the  police was not affordable.    Dr. Mokhehle said there appeared to be an understanding  between the government and the police delegation at the end of  the four days of talks. The government acceded to the police  assurance that they would not be victimized if they returned to  work. The prime minister said notwithstanding the agreement  reached between the government and the police, they decided to  continue with the strike and called a press conference in which  they declared that they would not continue work until their  demands were met. Dr. Mokhehle said some political parties in  the country, including the Basotho National Party, BNP, were  involved in fanning trouble over salary dispute.    He called on all the parties to declare that they were not  involved and welcomed the statement of Marematlou Freedom Party  saying that they were not involved. The leader of the BNP,  Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana, expressed disappointment over the  prime minister's allegation of BNP involvement in fanning  trouble in the police strike. Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana said he  respected the prime minister and was concerned that there were  some people who supplied him with misinformation.    After his remarks the BNP leader walked out of the meeting  together with some members of his party.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LIVELY ONE GOES EAST, EASILY WINS $100,000 KENSINGTON  </P> <P> Favored Lively One, who had been facing some of the best handicap horses in  Southern California, scored a two-length victory Sunday in the $100,000  Kensington Handicap for 3-year-olds and up.  </P> <P> The crowd of 16,346 wagered $3,671,433 on the 10-race program.  </P> <P> Trained by Hall of Famer Charlie Whittingham and ridden by Alex Solis, Lively  One rallied from last in the five-horse field to secure the winner's purse of  $55,000. The paycheck pushed the 5-year-old's bank account to $1,162,300.  </P> <P> Lively One was coming off fourth-place finishes in the $1-million Santa Anita  Handicap and the $400,000 San Bernardino Handicap. Both of those races were won  by Ruhlmann, a stablemate of Lively One.  </P> <P> Because of his record and the company he had been keeping, Lively One was  assigned high weight of 124 pounds in the Kensington. Shouldering the top  impost with no problem, Lively One ran very strongly down the stretch and  completed the mile and an eighth in 1:47 35.  </P> <P> A prohibitive 1-2 choice, Lively One returned $3.00, $2.20 and $2.10. Stalwars,  ridden by Ron Hansen, got up for second by a neck over Charlatan III and paid  $2.60 and $2.20. Charlatan III, with Antonio Castanon aboard, paid $2.40 to  show.  </P> <P> Owned by John Sikura, Lively One is a multiple stakes winner who has eight  victories, seven seconds and five thirds in 30 starts.  </P> <P> "He's a nice horse and he showed his class today," Solis said of Lively One,  who trailed by as many as 10 lengths early in the Kensington. "He (Whittingham)  told me to just leave him alone the first part and then we'll come running at  the end."  </P> <P> Glitterman opened a long lead at the home turn and held off favored Miami Slick  by a neck to win the $54,400 Tamarack Handicap at Miami's Calder Race Course  Sunday.  </P> <P> Shuttleman was third in a field of seven in the six-furlong ninth race.  Meanwhile, in the eighth race, a horrendous spill sent two riders to the  hospital and forced a 4-year-old filly to be destroyed.  </P> <P> Glitterman, ridden by Heberto Castillo Jr., was timed at 1:11 45 and paid  $6.80, $3 and $2.20. Miami Slick, the 6-5 choice, paid $2.60 and $2.20.  Shuttleman paid $2.40 to show.  </P> <P> In the eighth race, Win With Glory was leading at the 16th pole when her leg  shattered and she pitched Julio Felix to the turf.  </P> <P> Pach's Blend then fell, dropping Louis Monte, and Leprechaun Lynn, ridden by  Pedro Rodriguez, fell over Pach's Blend. Rodriguez walked away from the  accident, but Felix and Monte were taken to Hollywood Memorial Hospital, where  officials refused to release any details about their condition.  </P> <P> Win With Glory had to be destroyed at the track.  </P> <P> The owner-trainer-jockey combination of Ogden Phipps, C. R. (Shug) McGaughey  and Chris Antley completed a sweep of Aqueduct's weekend stakes Sunday when Lay  Down came from just off the pace to carry 112 pounds to a 1 1/4-length victory  in the $168,300 Excelsior Handicap.  </P> <P> The same connections took Saturday's Carter Handicap with Dancing Spree.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Lac Ouimet, who led into the stretch, held on to be runner-up in the  five-horse field, three lengths ahead of Doc's Leader. Chenin Blanc, the  odds-on favorite, was fourth after fading in the stretch and Joker's Farce was  the trailer.  </P> <P> The victory was the first in four starts this year for the 6-year-old gelding  by Spectacular Bid-Impish, who was timed in 2:02 1/5 in the 1 1/4 miles on the  fast track to earn $100,980.  </P> <P> Lay Down returned $7.60, $4.60 and $5.60. Lac Ouimet paid $3.80 and $4.40, and  Doc's Leader was $9.40 to show.  </P></p>

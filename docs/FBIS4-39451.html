			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Shalnev </F> from the "Itogi" program]    [Text] In Russia today the aid that is given by the United  States to Russia for our economic reforms--and especially  technical aid and technical assistance--comes from the United  States via the so-called Agency for International Development  [AID]. As was especially stressed recently at hearings of the  U.S. Congress, only about 200 million dollars have been used of  the 3.2 billion dollars that were allocated to us since 1985  specifically for economic and technical aid. If we focus on  Russia, that figure is 140 to 150 million dollars.    The scheme by which this money comes to us in Russia and to  other countries of the former Soviet Union is fairly simple: the  AID. The agency will earmark credits; to be more exact, it will  give grants to appropriate U.S. firms. The latter will send  their specialists and consultants here, who work with our  organizations, departments, individual enterprises, lawyers, and  other people.    In particular, a considerable bulk of such grants and  credits  has been sent to us as aid to develop our voucher privatization.  The interesting thing is that, since most of this money is paid  to U.S. firms, consultants, specialists, and technicians, it  means that the money, in fact, remains in the United States.  Say a consulting firm or some specialists arrive in Moscow or  in another town of Russia. Incidentally, they have enormous  perks and privileges since they have astronomic daily allowances  by our standards. They will stay in a luxury hotel, paying 200  or 300 dollars a night. They arrive on a first class or  business class flight. In other words, the main bulk of the  money--or a considerable proportion of the money allocated to  us--stays in their pockets and is spent in these nonproduction  areas.    The U.S. State Department recently evaluated the first  privatization period in our country. It noted our successes and  failures. It also noted where we have reserves [rezervy]. I  would like to draw your attention to one particular shortcoming  that was stressed by the State Department. From its point of  view, too many shares of privatized enterprises remain in the  hands of the workers and managers of these enterprises. Why is  this bad? Because the workers and managers of these enterprises  have no capacity any longer to improve production. They will  primarily take care of themselves and will not resort to  measures such as mass layoffs. Naturally, they will spare no  effort to preserve their jobs and to ensure bearable living  standards for themselves.    The second stage of privatization is going on now. As far as  I understand it, the agency has already earmarked some credits  and grants to U.S. consulting firms, including Price Waterhouse.  These companies are already busy trying to accomplish what has  not been accomplished during the first stage. What is now left  for us to do is to wait until the State Department takes stock  of this stage and tell us what we did well and what we did  badly. I think, however, that we will be able to see this for  ourselves quite soon.</p>

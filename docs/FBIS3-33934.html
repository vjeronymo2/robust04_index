It was one of the biggest single death tolls in the two-year  war between fundamentalists and the security forces.    The militants opened fire as police moved in to arrest them  late Tuesday at an apartment which had been under surveillance  in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' district, the ministry said.    Police fired back, killing seven of them, and discovered a  large amount of arms, explosives and remote control devices in  the apartment. None of the policemen was hurt.    The men were regarded as "amongst the most dangerous  terrorists" and belonged to militant groups based in the  southern province of Asyut, a fundamentalist hotbed, the  ministry said.    Four of them, named as Yasir 'Abd-al-Hakim, Yasir Zaki,  'Abd-al- Nabi Tayih and Tariq al-Qurashi, were suspected of  setting up these gangs.    Interior Minister General Hasan al-Alfi told Wednesday's  Al-Ahram newspaper that militants were "preparing attacks in  different regions of the country."    Tuesday's operation had been "one of the most important  confrontations with the terrorists," he said.    The latest clash raised the death toll in the battle between  Islamic militants and the government to 291, including 105  policemen and 95 fundamentalists.</p>

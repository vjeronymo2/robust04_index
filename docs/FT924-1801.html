			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Southern Electric improves to Pounds 15.3m SOUTHERN ELECTRIC, the Berkshire-based regional distributor, raised its interim profits through a combination of higher sales and reduced costs. For the six months to September 30 pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.3m, a rise of 11.7 per cent, achieved on turnover of Pounds 760.6m (Pounds 745.5m). Earnings per share rose by 13.5 per cent to 3.78p. Southern also announced an interim dividend of 5.6p. The 14.3 per cent increase was the highest announced so far in the electricity results season. But Mr Duncan Ross, chairman, said that comparisons with last year's pay-out were distorted by changes in the rate of increase in the interim and final dividends. He said the latest distribution was equivalent to a full year rise of 12 per cent. Analysts said the result conformed to expectations. The shares fell 2p to 419p in a market broadly down because of the sale of Welsh Water's stake in South Wales Electricity. Mr Ross said that unit sales had risen by 3.1 per cent despite the recession, much of the increase coming from industrial customers, including Honda which recently opened its new plant in Swindon. However, there had been no overall pick-up pointing to an economic recovery. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said costs had been contained partly through staff reductions, which would amount to some 530 this year, and also through tighter control of bad debts. Outstanding payments had fallen by 31 per cent, or Pounds 18m, giving a boost to cash flow. However, he stressed that the savings were not being achieved at the cost of customer service, which continued to be monitored closely. Mr Ross said he was pleased, though not surprised, by the clean bill of health the electricity regulator had given last week to gas-based electricity contracts. Southern is one of the regional companies which is most heavily involved in gas. It has three projects which will become operational after 1995. It is still negotiating a new set of long-term supply contracts and would prefer a five-year deal with the generators. Mr Ross said Southern would be drawing up its new tariff in February, and he was confident it would show an increase well below the inflation rate. See Lex</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Brascan may sell assets to ease financial burden BRASCAN, a kingpin of the industrial and financial services empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman brothers, is willing to put some peripheral businesses up for sale as part of efforts to ease the strain on its financial resources. Mr Trevor Eyton, Brascan's chief executive, said yesterday that the company had also asked its 41 per cent owned food and beverage unit, John Labatt, to seek outside investors to help finance any acquisition costing more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 869.5m). Brascan's earnings have been hit by the steep slide in Noranda's earnings, its mining and forestry subsidiary, and by the lacklustre performance of its financial services interests, which include Royal Trust, one of Canada's leading trust companies. Brascan yesterday reported first-quarter earnings of CDollars 11.6m, or 1 cent a share, down from CDollars 44.6m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Its share of group revenues slipped to CDollars 2.4bn from CDollars 2.6bn. The company said it did not expect a return to 'satisfactory' profitability until 1992. Mr Eyton said that, despite persistent rumours to the contrary, Brascan had taken no steps to sell its stake in Labatt, although the company had been approached by possible buyers since the rumours surfaced. Referring to future asset sales, he cited Noranda's pending sale of its wire and cable business to France's Alcatel Cable as an example of the type of business that may be put on the block this year.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> The frequency with which our military equipment is falling apart in Saudi  Arabia and the increasing number of accidents give Saddam Hussein much hope.  </P> <P> In a year's time, the mighty American military machine will have gradually  self-destructed because of hasty design and workmanship. No need for gas and  germ wars. The greed and corruption of American military contractors are doing  the job for him.  </P> <P> Now, if we can only get Hussein interested in buying the stuff, then we'll know  for sure that his bark is worse than his bite. His arsenal would look  impressive and intimidating, but the model glue holding the parts together will  melt minutes after the engines are fired up.  </P> <P> PAUL R. JACOB  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

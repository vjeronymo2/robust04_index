Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the </F> Government of the Russian Federation, by EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN  correspondent N. Dudorov; place and date not given: "The  Agrarian Reform in Russia"]    [Text] Our agriculture has never been in such a  dismal state. Why is the acreage sown and the livestock herd  being reduced, and the productivity of fields and farms going  down? How did it happen that plant-growing and especially animal  husbandry have become unprofitable for our countryside? What is  the explanation as to why not only collective, but also peasant  (private) farms have found themselves in such a difficult  economic situation, and some of them have gone bankrupt? Our  correspondent posed these and other questions to A.Kh.  Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian  Federation.    Aleksandr Kharlampievich Zaveryukha was born in 1940 in  Novosergiyevskiy Rayon in Orenburg Oblast. His first job was  that of a tractor driver. He graduated from the Orenburg  Institute of Agriculture and is a candidate of economic science.  He knows agricultural production inside out. Worked as a chief  economist and a kolkhoz chairman. For many years held management  positions in the Orenburg Oblast Party Committee and the  agro-industrial committee. Was the head of the  scientific-production association of the All-Russia Scientific  Research Institute for Meat Cattle-Breeding. Was elected a  people's deputy of the Russian Federation. He was appointed a  deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation in  February of this year.    [Dudorov] Aleksandr Kharlampiyevich, in your opinion, what  should be the main principles of the state economic policy with  respect to the APK [agro-industrial complex]? How are they being  implemented in practice?    [Zaveryukha] It is my firm conviction that the reform in the  agro-industrial complex and its transition to the market must be  based on fundamentally changing the totality of socioeconomic  relations in this sector of production. Why is a market  preferable to an administrative-distributive system? First and  foremost because it gives the peasant an incentive constantly to  strive to work more productively. He will show this concern  about "his own" not only on an independent farm but also when  participating on a voluntary basis in cooperative production.    That rural residents will be joining in various entities is  also beyond any doubt, because one person or even a large family  cannot compete with a cooperative, where responsibilities are  clearly assigned among its members. That is, it uses all the  advantages of division of labor among producers joined together.  Hard-working people will not tolerate among them a sluggard or a  drunkard and will simply "squeeze" him out, like a foreign body.    A question comes up: Why do we produce four or five times  less output per rural worker as compared with a similar peasant  or farmer in Europe--what is the problem? One of the main  reasons for this situation, in my opinion, is the deviation from  a normal correlation of prices for agricultural and industrial  products for the countryside. This and other reasons have led to  an impoverishment of the countryside; producing agricultural  output has become unprofitable. The state has begun to support  rural workers with money from time to time, but these were  considerably lesser amounts than what was being withdrawn. That  is why the sector has been deteriorating.    As a result, the only sovkhozes and kolkhozes that have  survived have been those managed by the most capable and  energetic administrators, who were able to create highly  profitable production through comprehensive mechanization,  introduction of modern crop-growing and cattle-breeding  techniques, and rational organization of production processes.  However, it has come to the point that even they are in need of  state support lately. Because even the 200-300-percent profit on  grain production will be eaten up by inflation if it runs at 400  percent a year or more. Because agriculture is a seasonal  sector; expenditures here run year round, while the output is  produced once a year or at even greater intervals. Over this  time much changes in the economy, and farms are left in the red.    The proof of that is the current financial situation of  grain  producers, to whom Roskhlebproduct owes almost 1 trillion rubles  [R] for the grain it has procured from them. One of the most  important conditions of forming a market in grain and products  of its processing is for the state to give up its monopoly on  sales of bread and bakery products, granting the right to sell  them at market prices and compensating in a variety of ways the  low-income part of the population, thus providing protection  from rising prices.    The government has appraised the situation correctly and has  issued to agriculture before the end of 1993 R1 trillion to pay  its own debts; this step should contain somewhat the process of  the impoverishment of the countryside. In order to stop this  negative process, however, many times more infusion will be  needed.    [Dudorov] What is the role of the public sector and other  economic forms in solving the food problem?    [Zaveryukha] If we keep in mind the rather sad experience of  the hasty decisions in the economic sphere, it will become clear  that the current fundamental change of production relations in  the countryside is something that will require not one and not  five years. The recent fashionable slogan on paying the debt to  the countryside simply did not work out because the government  did not have the necessary means. And the result of a complete  disintegration of the system of payments was that agriculture  began literally to visibly collapse.    The first victims were weak kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which  after their reorganization either merged with enterprises that  were better off financially or separated into private farms.  Betting on them, however--as many demand that we do--may pay off  no earlier than in five to 10 years, since most kolkhoz members  are not capable of engaging in independent production and are  not knowledgeable about things that a farmer should know.  Neither can we dismiss the fact that new farms now--the same as  collective farms--are experiencing extreme economic hardship. To  set things up, a farmer now needs to spend many millions, while  the government is unable to allocate these means.    Therefore, the public sector practically retains a dominant  role in agriculture. And collective farms, too--including  kolkhozes and sovkhozes reorganized into different forms--need  reliable protection from dishonest partners, both domestic (in  terms of payment for products) and foreign.    [Dudorov] The land reform is currently being implemented on  a  broad scale in Russia. What do you personally think of the  introduction of private ownership in land?    [Zaveryukha] The president of the Russian Federation's edict  "On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Economic Reform  in Russia" has caused a range of reactions in the countryside.  It is revolutionary in substance, and many people have not yet  appraised its subsequent effect on the entire process of  transition to a market. Its opponents are concerned over point 4  regarding private ownership in land; they maintain that people  with money obtained in a dishonest manner will begin buying it  up for speculative purposes or in order to create large land  holdings.    Their concerns are not groundless; at the same time,  however,  the edict has only set the general direction, while the  mechanism is being detailed in a package of legislative acts on  the land reform, which is to be prepared by the government,  after which these documents are to be adopted by the future  Federal Assembly. The same kind of acts are being prepared with  respect to economic activities on the purchased land. In the  event that it is used not in accordance with the intended  purpose, first the owner will be fined, and then the land may be  confiscated. Documents are currently being developed on  procedures of land plot buyouts, mortgages, taxation, and other  operations involving land, as well as using agricultural land as  a collateral.    [Dudorov] To what extent does the current infrastructure  meet  the needs of the APK market?    [Zaveryukha] The infrastructure needed to begin market  relations in this economic sector is already in place. Its  weakest link is the lack of a sufficient number of specialists  who have knowledge of the methods of managing an enterprise in  the new environment and the basics of marketing. Another  difficulty is that many APK sectors are overly monopolized. Take  for instance the aforementioned Roskhlebproduct corporation. We  need to demonopolize such entities.    Private sector organizations also intensively build a market  infrastructure. For instance, exchanges began to specialize in  individual commodities, moving away from universality, and join  into associations and unions. For instance, in the APK sphere  there is an association of exchanges that already has been  functioning for two years; it has prepared a program for the  development of a market of grain futures in Russia. I think that  the state should support such a constructive approach and  influence grain price regulation in a certain way through  commodity and financial interventions. Creating a market  infrastructure on the existing basis is more promising, since  reconstruction and modernization of it will cost less than  starting from scratch. I recommend that all businessmen who wish  to work with the APK in this direction contact the  Agro-Industrial Chamber for Reconstruction and Development of  the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, whose task is to coordinate  the actions of all forces, regardless of form of ownership, in  the direction of program implementation.    [Dudorov] What should be the economic relations in the  future, and what should be the infrastructure of the APK market?    [Zaveryukha] Having studied the experience of market  operations in the agrarian sector of the economy of many  countries in the world, we found out that the system that is  most suitable for Russia is the one used in the European Union,  which regulates the agrarian market through state institutions.  Their influence on the domestic agrarian market is exerted in  the form of direct commodity or financial intervention. We, too,  should find optimal transitional market mechanisms, which would  allow the market to take off without leveling to the ground  already functioning structures, to offer them better economic  conditions. They should be as follows:    --selling agricultural products at market prices;    --price regulation should not interfere with the market  nature of relations;    --state procurement prices (fixed) must be set after taking  exchange mechanisms into account;    --the state builds up a reserve supply of agricultural  products and foodstuffs in order to conduct a commodity  intervention in the event of sharp increases in product prices.    It is also proposed to conduct state regulation in the  market  environment through a system of collaterals, which includes  accepting the product as a collateral for a certain period of  time with payment at guaranteed prices, and also works through  preferential credits for commodity producers in certain sectors  by compensating part of the expenditures on the production of  grain products, and so on.    We also need to think about creating such financial  institutions as mortgage and land banks, payment and clearing  institutions, trust companies, and leasing firms. Their  development is held back only by the lack of a legislative and  normative base. We need to create organizational-economic forms  for certain APK sectors. This approach is built into state  programs "Soybean," "Grain," "Oil," and others. One of the  possibilities in this direction is organizing  industrial-financial holding companies with the participation of  state institutions and ministries. But this is a separate large  topic.    [Dudorov] How do you see the role of the mass media in the  successful conduct of the agrarian reform, raising the level of  the population's knowledge and literacy in matters of a market  economy?    [Zaveryukha] The role of the press and other mass media in  covering the APK problems is enormous. Unfortunately, quite  often the press, radio, and television are not objective in  their appraisal of a score of processes taking place in the  countryside. Some authors maintain that we need to speed up the  liquidation of large collective farms and create instead 5  million peasant (private) farms, which will immediately feed the  country.    Others, on the contrary, proclaim a lack of future for the  latter, since they allegedly are less efficient than large  enterprises. Such a diametrically opposite approach is  groundless and only harms the reform in the APK. Sometimes we  also see an incorrect appraisal of the current situation in the  countryside.    The mass media must reflect the real picture in the agrarian  sector, cover the experience accumulated in the regions and on  farms, reveal shortcomings, and publish the professional advice  of specialists and scientists on different aspects of the  economics of the national agro-industrial complex.    I believe that the EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN newspaper, which, in my  opinion, comprehensibly and quite objectively covers the course  of economic reform in our country, could be of substantial help  to the Russian agro-industrial complex in overcoming the  difficulties that it is currently experiencing. And I think that  top managers of the APK, farms, enterprises, and organizations,  as well as new commercial structures, will gladly share on the  pages of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN their experiences, providing tips on  the best approaches to the solution of some or other problems.  Both sides will benefit.    [Box, p 24]  <H5>  In the Mirror of Statistics </H5>   Reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes is  practically complete. It has been implemented at 24,000 farms  (93 percent). The collectives of 8,100 farms made a decision to  retain the existing status of their enterprise. Joint-stock  companies and partnerships of various kinds have become the  prevalent form of economic activity in the countryside. As of 1  October 1993, there were 11,300 such entities.    According to the data of the State Committee on  Statistics, as of 1 November of this year there were 268,000  private farms operating in Russia, covering a total area of 11.2  million hectares (42 hectares per farm, on average). Over the  past few months, the process of their creation has slowed down  perceptibly. Over January-October, more than 9,000 farms ceased  operations because of increased difficulties with material and  technical supply, the worsened financial situation, and other  reasons.    It should be noted particularly that the people's  interest in having their own personal auxiliary plots has  increased. The 18 million personal auxiliary plots, as well as  those belonging to enterprises, organizations, and institutions,  which are currently in operation in Russia, now produce 30  percent of the gross agricultural product. Over the period under  review, the herd of livestock and poultry on these farms has  increased by 5-12 percent.    As compared to 1991, in 1992 agricultural output fell  by 9 percent, while the national gross domestic product declined  by 20 percent. It is expected that the gross agricultural  product will decline by 5 percent in 1993.    The total yield of grain after processing is expected  to be 100-102 million tonnes (over the past two years the  average yield was 92 million tonnes). There has been more sugar  beet produced (by 23.4 million tonnes) than in 1992. Production  of sunflower seed, potatoes, and vegetables--counting the  production of these crops on personal auxiliary plots, is  expected to remain at the 1992 level (2.3 million, 38 million,  and 10 million tonnes, respectively).    A certain trend toward stabilization may be seen in  animal husbandry. Beginning with the second quarter of this  year, the rate of decline in the production of most varieties of  farm products has gone down. However, because of a continuous  drop in the number of livestock and poultry over 10 months as a  whole, selling livestock for slaughter has declined on farms by  14 percent; the gross yield of milk has declined by 4 percent,  and production of eggs by 7 percent.    The herd of livestock kept on the population's personal  plots continues to increase. This only partially compensates,  however, for the perceptible decline in the size of the herd at  agricultural enterprises. The share of horned cattle in the  hands of the population has increased from 23 percent to 26  percent; of cows--from 30 percent to 34 percent; pigs--from 29  percent to 33 percent; and of goats and sheep--from 32 percent  to 38 percent.</p>

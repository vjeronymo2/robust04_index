Not only should  the income index be assessed, but a full set of reform and the  establishment of a new mechanism and structure should also be  taken into account.    In Guiyang yesterday Chen Shineng and his entourage visited  the cadres and staff members of the Weixing Financial Office,  the Toutiao Taxation Office, the Jinhua Taxation Office, and the  Zhongnan Financial and Taxation Office. He expressed his Lunar  New Year greetings to them and all financial and taxation staff  members in the province on behalf of the provincial party  committee and government.    After listening to a feedback report by the Weixing  Financial  Office, Chen Shineng said: In the major reform projects to be  carried out in the province this year, financial reform will be  given top priority, and its success or failure will have a  direct bearing on the entire reform. Because there is no  ready-made experience to go by, we will carefully proceed with  financial reform according to Marxist-Leninist methods and  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, keeping in mind Guizhou's specific  conditions. We should not merely consider increasing indices in  task fulfillment, but we should also formulate practical and  coordinated measures and policies and should establish a new  financial and taxation mechanism and structure. [passage omitted]    Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of deepening  financial and taxation reform, financial and taxation  departments in all localities should consider new situations and  new problems. In particular, they should consider and resolve  prominent problems during the replacement of the old structure  by the new. In the meantime, we should do a good job in  promoting the economy at the county level.    In the Toutiao Taxation Office, which has won the  designation  of a nationally renowned taxation office, Chen Shineng wrote an  inscription, which reads: Learn From This Nationally Renowned  Taxation Office. In the Jinhua Taxation Office, which has been  cited as an advanced collective by the State Taxation Bureau,  Governor Chen Shineng explicitly indicated the need for all  financial and taxation departments in the province to learn from  the Jinhua Taxation Office in increasing revenue and improving  their mental attitude and professional quality. Chen Shineng  also took a group photograph with some financial and taxation  personnel.</p>

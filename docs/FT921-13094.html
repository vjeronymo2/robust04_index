			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker cuts estimate of 1991-92 sugar surplus FALLS in the sugar production of the former Soviet Union and Cuba have led ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, to cut its estimate for the world sugar supply surplus for 1991-92 to 1.58m tonnes from a September estimate of 2.06m tonnes. This compares with a surplus of 990,000 tonnes predicted last week by FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency, which stated categorically: 'There is no large surplus overhanging the market.' Man, which now puts production at 113.05m tonnes and consumption at 111.47m tonnes, points out that the revolutionary changes in the world political arena have plunged the sugar market into 'the greatest period of uncertainty over three decades'. The immediate impact has been the forecast decline in imports to the former Soviet Union, coupled with a fall in its trade with Cuba. 'A shift away from agreements that by-passed the international free market is a favourable development for the world sugar market but, coming at a time when the raw sugar import demand of the ex-centrally planned economies of East and Central Europe is falling, it is depressing for prices,' Man says in its latest sugar market report. It is assuming a 15 per cent fall in sugar consumption in the former Soviet Union to 10.6m tonnes of whites. Raw production is put at 7.5m tonnes. The consumption figure is conservative 'given the hoarding that has apparently taken place over the past two years and the estimated 2m tonnes of sugar that is used in making home-brewed alcohol'.</p>

CPPCC, the broadest patriotic united front formed in the  long  struggle of the Chinese people, played a vital role in history.  Before the eve of the founding of New China on October 1, 1949,  CPPCC exercised the power of the National People's Congress and  announced the birth of New China. After the convention of the  first National People's Congress in 1949, CPPCC has continued to  play an important role in the country's political and social  life.    The amended CPPCC Constitution further clarifies and  strengthens the position and role of CPPCC, pointing out CPPCC  is an important institution for multi-party cooperation and  political consultation under the leadership of the Communist  Party of China (CPC).    Observers here noted this marks a new development after the  addition of "the political consultation system will exist and  develop for a long time" to the constitution of the People's  Republic of China in an amendment last year.    Scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said  the  amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates the main functions of  CPPCC, including the main content, form and procedures of  "political consultation and democratic supervision." For  instance, consultations are necessary not only before decisions  are made on state policies, principles, important political,  economic and social issues but also during their implementation.  This shows that political consultations have become broader in  scope and richer and in content.    The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the  rights  and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members. The  stipulation that CPPCC participating units and individuals have  the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and  disciplines will further enable CPPCC organizations and members  to exercise the right of administering state and social affairs.    Wu Jianfan, a jurisprudence researcher of the Chinese  Academy  of Social Sciences, said that, though the CPPCC Constitution is  not a law, it has a binding force since the political  consultation system has been recognized by China's Constitution.    Wu regarded the amended CPPCC Constitution as an important  link in the development of China's democratic politics in recent  years.    Since China instituted reform and open policies 15 years  ago,  democratic politics has developed steadily. The country's two  basic political systems -- the people's congress system and the  multi- party cooperation and political consultation system --  have been improved and strengthened.    In the people's congress system, deputies to people's  congresses at the county level and lower are now directly  elected; and for the national people's congress, there are more  candidates than membership. China's Constitution stipulates  that the tenure of office of the president, chairman of the NPC  Standing Committee and premier should not exceed two terms,  terminating virtual life tenure of office of the past.    Other important steps taken in this direction include: in  the CPPCC organizations, CPC members should not surpass 40  percent; non- communist persons have been recommended to assume  posts in the government, establishment of a civil service  system, and the adoption of strict examination procedures for  the appointment, promotion and removal of officials.    A senior jurist said that the amended CPPCC Constitution  marks another milestone in the development of China's democratic  politics.    The amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates "participation in  running and discussing state affairs" as a main function of  CPPCC. The addition will not only expand the channels and scope  of CPPCC participation but also has a far-reaching significance  for the development in the country of socialist democratic  politics with Chinese characteristics.</p>

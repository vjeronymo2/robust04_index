			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Local council elections held today TODAY 3,798 council seats will be contested as about 23m voters are able to give their first political opinion since the general election. There are no contests in London, while all the 53 Scottish districts are being fought. Four of the 37 Welsh districts are being contested. A third of the seats are to be contested in all England's 36 metropolitan areas and 114 of the 296 non-metropolitan districts. The seats were last contested in 1988, which left Labour with 1,286, the Conservatives with 943 and the Liberal Democrats with 303. The opposition parties have a strong showing in town halls. Only one of England's metropolitan districts is Tory-controlled. Labour has 69 per cent of all metropolitan district councillors and the Tories controlling just 18 per cent of seats.</p>

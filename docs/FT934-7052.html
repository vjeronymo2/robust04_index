			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / How to win from the winter war / A look at special deals aimed at wooing customers Airlines desperate for business passengers to fill their aircraft in the slack winter season are vying with each other to offer the most attractive deals. Across Europe, airlines are wooing their most lucrative clients, the business executives, with special offers. German and UK residents, especially, are on the receiving end of the best prizes, ranging from price cuts to free flights and overnight stays in luxury hotels. The airlines' main weapon is the 'frequent flyer' programme. When taking flights, members of programmes earn points which can be redeemed for items such as free tickets or upgrades to business class. Anyone can join an airline's frequent-flyer programme and there is no reason why someone should not join several. In the UK, British Airways' 'Dream Ticket' promotion has the highest profile. But behind the hype this is simply a promise to double the number of points collected for a flight taken before the end of March. This means that one business-class return to New York would earn enough points for an economy return to Athens. In the summer, it would have taken two such flights. As always with UK residents flying with BA, the deal only applies for first, business and full-fare economy tickets. Many business travellers buy discounted tickets: in this case, US carriers such as American Airlines and United Airlines offer a better deal. Their double-points offer, for UK residents only, applies for virtually any fare available. On short-haul flights, British Midland also gives awards to buyers of economy-class tickets. For those living in Germany, this will seem tame stuff. BA and American Airlines will triple the points earned by German residents over the next few months. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based carrier, is offering enough points with one business-class return to the Far East between now and the end of December for a free business-class ticket within Europe on Austrian Airlines or Swissair. The desperation to attract German passengers may be because of the depth of the country's recession. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Paris-based travel agency Wagon-Lits, says that for the first time airlines are selling seats at less than published prices in Germany. Danish residents, too, can find discounted tickets: business-class fares on Scandinavian Airline System on some short-haul routes have been cut by 30 per cent. SAS is also offering business-class passengers starting from the UK a free overnight stay in a Scandinavian hotel, provided the trip is made before the end of March. Alitalia has a similar scheme for flights from Italy to London before December 31. Business-class passengers get a free night in a London hotel. This is only a selection of the deals on offer. And the tide of special deals is unlikely to ebb until spring. There is still a recession in the airline industry and over-capacity is widespread. That combination in recent years has meant fringe benefits and cost savings improve through the season. If - like a quarter of Europe's business air travellers according to a recent survey - your choice of carrier is determined by awards of frequent-flyer points, winter is a chance to push up your total quickly.</p>

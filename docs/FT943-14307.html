			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Law change mooted to smooth Ulster talks The government is willing to consider amendments to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act as part of the effort to secure a new political settlement in Northern Ireland. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today tell Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, that an explicit pledge by Dublin to modify the republic's constitutional claim to the province is vital to any hope of an agreement. British officials insist that it will be impossible to restart talks between the constitutional parties without a commitment by the republic to incorporate into article two of its constitution the principle of majority consent in Ulster to any change in the status of the province. Moderate unionist leaders have made it clear that they will not participate in a resumption of the 'three-strand' search for a political settlement without such a pledge from Dublin. But Mr Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment in advance of the conclusion of an overall accord between unionists and nationalists. As a result, talks between London and Dublin on a framework document to restart the talks process have become deadlocked. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to break that deadlock at their meeting today on the margins of the European summit in Brussels. In spite of recent gloom in both capitals about the prospect of a breakthrough before the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled in for late next week, officials in London have not ruled out the possibility that the two prime ministers will find a compromise. The expectation is that if they do not the summit will be postponed until September. British officials say that Mr Reynolds' recent public calls for changes in the Ireland Act have not yet been matched by specific suggestions for amendments. There is also some puzzlement as to why Dublin regards that legislation  - which predates the division of Ireland - as such an important symbol of Irish partition. The 1973 Northern Ireland Act is a much clearer assertion of Westminster's sovereignty over the province. The view in London is that as long as the principle of consent is not undermined the government is ready to consider changes to the 1920 legislation as part of a package to restart the process. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday that he saw no particular need for changes but was ready to consider any proposals. It is understood that the liaison group drawing up the proposed framework document has still to settle the form of the new cross-border groups demanded by nationalist politicians in the province as a quid pro quo for the creation of a new Ulster assembly. Some differences remain over the degree to which the two governments should seek to prescribe the form of devolved administration. The London government appears confident that they could quickly be resolved if Mr Major and Mr Reynolds break the deadlock over the constitutional claim. By contrast there appears little optimism in London about the prospects for an early end to violence in the province. Intelligence reports suggest that the latest escalation in attacks by the IRA might represent a deliberate show of strength as the precursor to a temporary ceasefire. The government still believes that the faction represented by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is looking for an escape route from the violence to allow it to join the talks process. But the apparent determination of hardline sections of the IRA to continue the killing has all but extinguished hopes of a quick 'clean' break with the past 25 years.</p>

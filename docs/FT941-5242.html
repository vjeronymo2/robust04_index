			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / PM sets up inquiry on Ulster talks leak Mr John Major has launched an inquiry into how details of his private meeting with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, at Downing Street on Wednesday evening were leaked to a Sunday newspaper. The prime minister said yesterday he had put inquiries 'in hand', the talks on tomorrow's debate for the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 'should not have been leaked'. It was important that such meetings could be held in private, he said. Mr Smith welcomed the move. In a letter to Mr Major which officials described as a 'nudge' at the prime minister's elbow, the Labour leader said he trusted the inquiry would be 'both thorough and comprehensive'. Downing Street said the prime minister was satisfied the leak did not emanate from Number 10 and had instructed the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office to hold similar inquiries. Labour regularly votes against renewal of the act but had wanted to see if its disagreement with the government over two specific measures could be bridged before tomorrow's debate, timed to coincide with a vote on whether to set up a select committee on Northern Ireland. Mr Major told BBC radio: 'We looked very carefully at what John Smith proposed. I decided it was not in the interests of the proper working of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to adopt the proposals he put forward.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday he was still confident of resuming all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland in spite of unionists' repeated refusal to take part. Mr Spring and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, are to make a more detailed assessment of the prospects for negotiations when they jointly chair a session of the UK-Irish intergovernmental Ulster Conference in London on Thursday.</p>

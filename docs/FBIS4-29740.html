			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa on Tuesday reiterated a demand that Pyongyang provide  information that would enable international monitors to verify  whether North Korea had extracted plutonium from its nuclear  facilities in the past.    Japan "would be able to extend a helping hand to North Korea  if the history of the operations of its nuclear facilities were  revealed to verify whether plutonium is clandestinely  stockpiled," Kakizawa told a house of representative panel on  cabinet affairs.    The foreign minister also expressed readiness to give  economic aid, including funds to finance construction of  light-water nuclear reactors, if Pyongyang is forthcoming in  divulging data on the history of its nuclear reactors.    He also reiterated Japan's resolve to seek the deletion of  an  "enemy clause" from the U.N. Charter in the process of ongoing  discussions on reforming the framework of the U.N. Security  Council.    The charter has described Japan, Germany and other states  defeated by the Allied Forces during World War II as enemy  states -- a description that has embarrassed these U.N. member  states, now seeking to contribute to global peace.</p>

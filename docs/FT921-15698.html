			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Downgrades slice into share prices IT WAS a case of 'more of the same' on the UK stock market yesterday, as the latest round of corporate downgrades from London securities analysts cut into the share gains achieved over Christmas. First reports on retail trading over the festive season, together with price competition in the UK travel industry, dealt a fresh blow to hopes that consumer spending will lead the way out of the recession in the domestic economy. The market fell by nearly 28 Footsie points in early trading and a later rally owed much to a firm opening on Wall Street. The early gain on the Dow Industrial Average had been pared to only 4 points, however, by the time London closed for the day. The final reading of 2,482.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a decline of 10.3. Trading was again two-way, with the institutions cautiously reshaping portfolios in the light of the sharp rise in equities over the holiday. However, with the banks and the oil shares suffering heavily from profits downgrades by a leading UK agency broker and last month's optimism towards retail stocks fast melting away, the equity sector lacked supporters in the final hour of trading. Pressure on the store and retail sector was renewed after Boots, the joint owner with WH Smith of the Do It All group, disclosed that sales had been below target in the quarter which closed on December 31. Gloom deepened in the sector, which faces further tests today when Dixons, another leading high street name, reports on trading, and it is also braced for disturbing news this week from Ratners, the jewellery retailer. However, the broader setback across the range of the market was fuelled by this week's bearishness towards the banking sector. Concern over bad debts was increased by the deepening of gloom over the retail sector and by disclosure by a leading accounting firm that bankruptcies among UK companies rose by 56 per cent last year. A further dip in the pound, taking it to its lowest permitted level against the D-Mark, reinforced worries that UK base rates may have to be raised to protect sterling inside its ERM range. Leading oil shares also continued to feel the pressure of downgradings by UK broking analysts, who have pointed to the bearish outlook for crude prices. Although losses in BP and Shell were relatively modest, both shares failed to respond to the initial upturn in the New York market. London based analysts of the equity market continued to express a somewhat cautious view of the outlook, in spite of the confidence displayed by share prices over the past three weeks. At Flemings Research, the strategy team warned of a 'hazardous route' to recovery in the second half of this year. Flemings believes that the UK market has not yet discounted the risk of a rise in base rates 'implicit in the government's refusal to devalue'. Nor does it think that the market has fully discounted the possibility of a change in government when the UK general election is held later this year. The economics team at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant bank, warned that the UK government may have little choice but to raise base rates ahead of the election and that many analysts are too sanguine about this risk.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Aldo Roveri, director of the National </F> Research Council's Targeted Telecommunications Project, by  RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE; date and place not given]    [Text]    [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] Professor Roveri, the Targeted  Telecommunications Project is nearing completion. What were its  principal objectives and what results have been achieved?    [Roveri] The principal objective was that of enabling the  national manufacturing industry and services sector to dispose  of new technologies necessary for the development of broadband  communications and consequently of competing in this sector at  international level, by taking into account the development of  the country and the strategic choices at European level.    Second, to promote the training, in a highly innovative  environment, of highly qualified technical personnel by having  researchers from various fields and disciplines participate in a  wide-ranging program. The results achieved on both fronts have  been satisfactory.    [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] In your opinion what are the  advantages of passing from N-ISDN (narrowband-integratd services  digital network) to B-ISDN (broadband-integrated services  digital network)?    [Roveri] Broadband ISDN definitely has more potential  compared to Narrowband ISDN: switching communications for  high-speed video and data links (over 100 Mbit/sec), data  communications without connections to connect local area  networks (LAN) and high-speed workstations, multimedia voice,  image, and data communications, and point-multipoint calls in  interactive and distributed communications services. As for  the ATM (asynchronous tranfer mode), it will be possible to use  this both as an interface for access to B-ISDN and in the  internal network section. ATM is the final result of 10 years  of studies into new ways of transferring information, with  B-ISDN viewed as a universal transport structure that is  independent of any particular type of communication offered.    [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] Professor Roveri, which are the  new  horizons in the world of telecommunications?    [Roveri] The 1990's will surely be characterized by an  accentuated internationalization of political, economic, and  social relations that will lead to an increase in user needs.    The producers will try to conquer new markets by offering  goods and services of increasingly higher quality but at ever  more competitive prices. I think that the future of  telecommunications is directed toward the creation of a  "personalized," reality that meets the needs of the single  person rather than the mass.    A sharp rise in the demand for mobile sevices can be  foreseen, services that guarantee that "ubiquity" that permits  the user to maintain his own personalization whatever the  terminal. This means that the user-terminal relationship, which  is still intrinsic in the current land radio mobile service,  will be broken.    The supply of such services requires a closer interaction  between fixed network infrastructures and primarily with the  intelligent network: One can imagine a scene where all the  terminals will be mobile, without wires, and connected via radio  to an antenna positioned nearby, which in turn is in contact via  optical fibers with a telecommunications center where the  signals will be processed.    [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] What therefore, are the new  research  needs of this sector?    [Roveri] The hypothesis of a CNR [National Research Council]  Targeted Project for Personalized Communications comes under the  framework of a series of specific research programs currently  being defined.    The study of the research topics on personalized  communications can permit, at a national level, an important  participation in research acitivities at international level.    In particular, at European level, these topics will form an  important objective in the EC's Fourth Framwork Program, which  is currently being drawn up. This indicates that even within  the framework of strategies directed toward ensuring national  industry a competitive role in the sector, the country will draw  obvious advantages from undertaking a research project that  focuses on personalized communications.    But at the same time it highlights the need for a decision  to  be made as soon as possible.</p>

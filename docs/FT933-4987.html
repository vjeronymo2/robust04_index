			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Poison pills lose none of their potency: Richard Waters examines shareholder suspicion of anti-takeover devices It could be another sign that takeovers in the US are coming back into fashion. The poison pill, a takeover defence that became one of the most potent symbols of the 1980s battle for corporate control, made a notable return last week as Dr Pepper, the US's third-largest soft drinks group, armed its defences against the UK's Cadbury Schweppes. The fact that companies rarely adopt such poison pill defences these days could be partly explained by the fall-off in predatory bids. However, there is a more powerful reason: most companies already have them. No less than 331 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have pills in place, most dating from the mid- to late-1980s. They follow a number of patterns, but all have the same ultimate objective: to deter unwanted bidders either by restricting their voting rights or diluting their stake by offering shares cheaply to other shareholders - the route taken by Dr Pepper. Add in the companies located in states that have takeover protection enshrined in statute, such as Delaware, and 87 per cent of listed US companies have some form of defence. Such devices still arouse passionate shareholder antagonism. The United Shareholders Association pressure group promptly denounced Dr Pepper's move, saying it was designed to protect incumbent management rather than shareholder interests. Could such antipathy be misplaced? Experience from the last merger and acquisition wave suggests that takeover defences do not stop takeovers, and may actually force aggressive bidders to pay more for their acquisitions. Certainly, poison pills did not stand in the way of the five biggest takeovers or mergers in the 1980s. RJR Nabisco, SmithKline Beckman, Kraft, Squibb and Warner Communications all had takeover defences in place: all were eventually dropped by the companies' boards to allow the deals to be finalised. Research published earlier this year by two economists from the University of Rochester in New York indicated that bidders have to pay an average premium of 30 per cent to acquire a company without a poison pill. Buying one with a poison pill in place adds 18 per cent to the premium. Such evidence is not conclusive, warns Mr Robert Comment, one of the authors. However, it at least seems that poison pills do not stand in the way of takeovers: companies' share prices do not suffer after they have adopted a pill, and those with pills are just as likely to be taken over as companies without them, according to the research. Nonetheless, a low-key war against poison pills continues. Most anti-takeover devices have a 10-year life, so few have had to be renewed so far. Some institutional shareholders have forced their companies to put their existing pills to a shareholder vote, and others are reported to have used pressure to stop pills being adopted in the first place. Even if shareholders vote against a pill, it is likely to have little effect. Unlike Canada, US boards can simply ignore their shareholders' wishes. Only a few - such as Westinghouse Electric earlier this year - have dropped pills in recent years. Dr Pepper said it would not submit its pill to shareholders for approval, adding that the measure was adopted to protect the interests of those same shareholders. Not surprisingly, big investors bristle when companies start suggesting that they are better guardians of shareholders' interests than the shareholders themselves. Lex, Page 22</p>

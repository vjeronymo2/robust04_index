			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Mexican poll under fire AS MEXICO prepares for its most important state elections of the year, seven groups of observers have jointly concluded that the 'necessary conditions' do not exist 'for the celebration of clean elections', while the leftist opposition appears to be preparing massive protests in anticipation of fraud. The states of Michoacan and Chihuahua will vote for new governors tomorrow in elections that are widely seen as tests of popularity of the opposition in its former strongholds, and of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's (PRI) commitment to a more open democratic system. The centre-left Party of Democratic Revolution is already planning to demonstrate in Michoacan against what it sees as the inevitable fraud. The army is ready to move in, and a tense and violent post-electoral period is expected. The protests will coincide with President Carlos Salinas's July 15 summit with US President George Bush in San Diego and, if they last, with his visit to the UK, Spain, France and Hungary later in the month. They will add to a growing list of worries afflicting him, including recent sharp drops in the stock market, and delays in wrapping up negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The election observers concluded that the 'apparent unlimited use of government resources, favouritism of electoral authorities and virtual monopoly in the media, among other factors, create a scene propitious for manipulating the popular will in favour of one party, and permit the federal government to decide in the political terrain the result of the polls.' The observer groups have offered no evidence for many allegations, such as electoral roll rigging. But no-one questions the huge disparity in resources between the PRI and opposition. The leftist PRD is expected to lose in Michoacan, which would be a considerable setback and make it difficult, if not impossible, to mount an effective challenge in the 1994 elections. In the border, and more urban, state of Chihuahua, the centre-right PAN is running neck-and-neck with the PRI in the polls. Mexico's consumer prices increased by 0.7 per cent in June, the lowest inflation rate for the month in 20 years.</p>

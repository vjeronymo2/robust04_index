			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Private jet made to order for a quick getaway to freedom IT WAS not the luxury to which Mr Asil Nadir was accustomed. The flight from the UK to sanctuary in northern Cyprus was aboard a small private jet. Its short range forced at least one stop en route. There was not even a hostess on board to serve the drinks and snacks from the mini-bar. Mr Nadir had spent the previous evening at his home in one of London's best addresses, Eaton Square, Belgravia, after his weekly visit to West End Central police station in Savile Row. The one-mile trip was one of the conditions of his bail. But by lunchtime on Tuesday, he was almost certainly at one of London's many smaller airports, boarding a white executive jet with few markings. Within an hour he was outside UK airspace, by early evening in Turkey and at 10.30pm local time, at Ercan airport in northern Cyprus. His escape plans need not have been laid far in advance. The secretive world of private jet charter and ownership thrives on the desire by business executives and politicians to travel at short notice and conceal their movements. Nor is there a legal obligation for anyone leaving the country to produce a passport. The requirement is only to have the right papers when entering the country. The British pilot's flight plan would not necessarily have been a guide to where an aircraft is going: flight plans can be, and are, changed during flights, most usually to avoid bad weather. 'There is nothing stopping anyone hiring an aircraft and flying anywhere,' said the Civil Aviation Authority. Once away from the main flight paths, an aircraft can travel unnoticed by air traffic controllers. By choosing the right route, it is possible to fly all the way from London to Cyprus without entering controlled airspace. There were reports yesterday that Mr Nadir's aircraft had followed a more direct route via France and Turkey. A quick first stop would have helped cover the escape trail: the aircraft's charterer need only have bought a small amount of fuel in the UK to avoid arousing suspicions that a long journey was planned. Nor was it clear last night from which airport he had left. There were conflicting reports that Mr Nadir travelled from Scotland, that he flew from the London area and finally that his aircraft had taken off from British Aerospace's private airport at Hatfield. BAe said yesterday that it believed the passengers on the six private jets that left during the day were regular travellers, well-known to the company. Only one aircraft was going to France, a Cessna Citation, and all three passengers on board were known to BAe. Hatfield has no permanent customs and immigration post. BAe checks that passenger lists and passports match.</p>

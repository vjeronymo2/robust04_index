			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Key Polish vote delayed Poland's centre-right minority government won a reprieve yesterday when parliament put off for two weeks a crucial vote on public sector pay which threatened to rekindle hyper-inflation, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. Meanwhile, new figures show a marked improvement in Poland's trade surplus and the first success for the policy of raising export competitiveness through devaluation. In the first quarter, exports rose to Dollars 3.3bn and imports fell to Dollars 2.9bn to give a surplus of Dollars 385m, against a small deficit in the 1991 first quarter.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The fault-lines show in the Grand Old Party: Jurek Martin looks at the many contenders aspiring to lead the opposition to President Clinton President Bill Clinton's assorted problems ought to be good news for the Republican party. In the medium-term, marked by this November's mid-term elections, this may prove to be the case. Regaining control of the Senate for the first time in 10 years is not out of the question. But many of the old fault-lines in the Grand Old Party so apparent in 1992 remain, to the point that it can be far from confident about recapturing the White House in 1996 - unless the incumbent hands victory to them on a plate. This much was evident in the content and reception of former vice president Dan Quayle's new book, Standing Firm. The volume was intended to re-launch Mr Quayle on the national political scene as a potential Republican nominee in 1996. Unlikely though it may seem, given the low esteem in which Mr Quayle was generally held, it has certainly served that immediate purpose, even if the boost proves ephemeral. As Mr David Broder's column put it in the Washington Post: 'He is running for president, with the Christian conservatives, against the press - and without the insignia of the Bush administration.' Certainly, Mr Quayle used his book to settle old scores with some past colleagues and future rivals, among them Mr James Baker, the former secretary of state (only concerned about himself and less influential than Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser); Mr Jack Kemp, ex-housing secretary (prone to run off at 'tangents' with 'no discernible point'); and Mr Bob Dole, still minority leader (a closet big spender and rude to boot). All three are proto-candidates - surprisingly for Mr Baker, who has never liked running for office on his own account. They are often on the rubber chicken circuit in New Hampshire and Iowa, the states which hold the first votes in 1996. So are Mr Dick Cheney, former defence secretary, Mr Lamar Alexander, former Tennessee governor, Governor Caroll Campbell of South Carolina, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts, Mr Bill Bennett, one-time education secretary and anti-narcotics czar, and a few others besides. This is not counting the talk show right, such as Mr Pat Buchanan and Mr Rush Limbaugh, who now register in GOP polls. The nominal leader of the pack is Mr Dole, whose position gives him visibility. But he will be 73 in 1996 and, even if he does not look or act his age, it is hard to imagine the party putting him up as anything other than a sacrificial lamb. He also deeply offended the right in a funeral oration commending the late President Richard Nixon's social policy activism. Mr Cheney generally ranks second in the polls. The party's biggest fault-line divides the Christian-influenced right, which part-shanghaied the 1992 Houston convention with its proclamation of conservative family values, from the broadly establishment middle, mostly old Bushmen. They will fight some bitter Republican primary battles this year - for example, in Virginia, where Oliver North is running for the Senate, California, where Governor Pete Wilson is seeking re-election, and Minnesota, in both the gubernatorial and senate races. The party also has sub-divisions. The libertarian strain is articulately represented by Governor Weld and, to a degree, Mr Kemp and Mr Bennett, whose own recent book on values gives him reasonable claim to be the new GOP philosopher king. But this wing finds itself pitted against the religious right on such issues as abortion and homosexuality, which libertarians feel should not be proscribed by law. On foreign policy, it finds itself at odds with the establishment middle, which has no truck with isolationism. Activists such as Mr Rich Tafel, who used to work for Governor Weld and now runs Log Cabin Republicans, the homosexual pressure group, claim to have made much ground since the divisiveness of the Houston convention. But any half hour spent tuned in to the Rev Pat Robertson's Christian broadcasting network demonstrates the depth of opposition to a party platform tilted towards tolerance. The problem for internationalists like Messrs Cheney and Baker is that they represent an approach explicitly rejected in the 1992 election. The Republican party was instrumental in getting the North American Free Trade Agreement passed last year. But since then party attitudes, not far out of step with the rest of the nation and egged on by talk show hosts, have turned more inwards. Evidence of this can be found in the recent behaviour of two party bellwethers. Congressman Newt Gingrich, certain to be the next House Republican leader, supported Nafta but will fight ratification of the Uruguay Round because of a perceived threat to US sovereignty that did not trouble him over hemispheric trade. Mr Dole got the Senate last week to vote in favour of a unilateral lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo. The healthcare debate is equally divisive. Having declared early in the year that there was no health 'crisis,' Republicans have been all over the lot since, united only in resistance to the detailed Clinton reform plan. The fear, sometimes acknowledged by Mr Dole and occasionally exploited by Mr Clinton, is of being blamed for blocking any bill, although the hard right would not mind this at all. Mr Kevin Phillips, former Republican strategist who publishes the American Political Report newsletter, sees dangerous historical parallels, with risk of 'incipient fratricide'. He writes: 'Keep in mind that when parties that have held the White House for two terms or more lose it, their next nomination race is often wide open, bloody and unproductive - the Democrats in 1924, the Republicans in 1936, the GOP in 1964 and the Democrats in 1972. That is the sort of situation the GOP seems headed towards. . . too many contenders with no obvious strong choice.' Unless, of course, one of them catches fire - or the economy or Mr Clinton self-destructs.</p>

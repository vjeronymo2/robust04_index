			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Tkachuk, deputy chairman of the </F> Committee for Legislative and Legal Issues, by Yu.  Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "Bagrov Won With  Kravchuk But Lost the Crimean Presidency" -- first two  paragraphs are KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction]    [Text] The Crimea has its own president. Although he has  been supported by the majority of the peninsula's population, he  has placed many uneasy questions before Ukraine's leadership and  alarmed the world.    The following interview was given on the eve of the Crimean  elections.    [Nepomnyashcha] The situation in the Crimea has been  precisely described beyond Ukraine's borders. The Crimea is  compared with Afghanistan as a potential threat to peace and  stability. Has everything been done in Ukraine to prevent this  threat?    [Tkachuk] Since the spring of 1992, our committee has been  delivering to the president and the Supreme Council documents  saying that events in the Crimea have been developing in a  different direction than was expected when Crimean autonomy was  proclaimed. We have come forward with proposals to cancel  certain presidential decrees, including the one on establishing  a free economic zone, and pointed out that the Crimean  Constitution contradicts the Ukrainian one, as well as signaled  that Ukraine's property have been illegally confiscated. The  president has kept saying: We know about all these issues and  are in control of the situation.    [Nepomnyashcha] Apparently, he has been afraid that a  tough position of the center would call forth a similar reaction  in the Crimea.    [Tkachuk] First of all, this is a characteristic feature of  Ukraine's mentality: It will be somehow... Second, every  politician has believed that he is the wisest. What has  happened with Bagrov is an appalling example. He won with  Kravchuk, having de facto established his own state -- an  independent Crimea -- and now, he also is outside the board.    [Nepomnyashcha] In Kiev, officials have bet on Bagrov,  expecting that he will win the elections and remember that the  center has showed support for him.    [Tkachuk] Yes, they have bet on him, which demonstrates the  weakness of our political prognoses. There is a certain common  law -- the expansion of power. If somebody assumes a certain  amount of power, this power tends to expand. Having granted  autonomy to the Crimea, we allowed the Oblast Council to be  transformed into a Supreme Council. However, this should have  happened by means of elections, since oblast councils have  completely different personnel and intellectual potentials than  a supreme one. It was naive to believe that the Oblast Council  would improve its way of thinking. This is our analysis. The  quicker the powers of Crimean authorities grew, the more  subsidies they demanded from the center. Today, although per  capita income in the Crimea ranks in the top 20 among other  oblasts, the region is in the top 10 in terms of consumption.    When Crimean deputies adopted a law on education, which  practically eliminated the Ukrainian language, we swallowed  this. We also swallowed an electoral law which eliminated  Ukrainian parties from the Crimean electoral process. They have  established their own banks and customs services to separate  even further from Ukraine. In Kiev meanwhile, we have observed  this and kept silent, hoping that Bagrov would not forget and  repay our services. Today, Bagrov has ceased to exist as a  political figure.    [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the position of  Yuriy Meshkov? Where will he lead the Crimea, having become  president?    [Tkachuk] I have heard several of his speeches delivered in  the Crimean Supreme Council. I will quote him by heart: The  yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag wants to once again tie a noose  around the necks of the long-suffering people of the Crimea...  This is his style.    [Nepomnyashcha] While signing the tripartite statement  on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the Ukrainian side put  emphasis on a paragraph concerning the inviolability of borders,  assuming that the statement will contribute to positive  resolution of the Crimean issue.    [Tkachuk] What does a statement mean? If they had signed an  agreement or treaty, which would have legal consequences --  meaning that it does not matter if Yeltsin or someone else is in  power in Moscow, and that a country is obliged to fulfill the  agreement... What, I repeat, is the legal status of a statement?    [Nepomnyashcha] What is your prognosis for the  development of events on the peninsula?    [Tkachuk] Unfortunately, one can smell gunpowder in the air  there. The situation will much depend on the Crimean Tatars'  position. The Russian population of the peninsula is not very  happy about returning there [to Russia]. Yuriy Meshkov  emphasized this issue during his campaign. Many Ukrainians who  have settled in the Crimea have lost their national roots, and  the mentality of our people is rather peaceful. Tatars, on the  other hand, have repeatedly stated in the Mejlis [National  Assembly] their intention to fight for national liberation.  Should this occur, we may see very unpleasant events in the  Crimea.    [Nepomnyashcha] Are there any possibilities to relieve  the tensions?    [Tkachuk] There are many possibilities. All that is needed  is the political will, since one should take harsh steps, in  particular, introduce presidential rule.    [Nepomnyashcha] ...which will trigger even greater  opposition on part of the new president and political forces  that back him.    [Tkachuk] Do you think that if we do nothing there will be  peace? We used to think that way. We argued in the  legislature, saying that it is better to listen to the noise of  microphones here than to the cannonade of automatic weapons  there. But, the latest assassination of Bagrov's aide testifies  to the fact that silence does not solve problems.</p>

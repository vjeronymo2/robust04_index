			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / DTI may ease small company auditing rules THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is considering removing the legal requirement that smaller companies be subject to annual audit, in a radical overhaul of company reporting. An estimated 250,000 companies below the threshold for paying value added tax - about one quarter of all registered companies - could be freed from mandatory annual external audits by accountancy firms. Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, said in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday that consultation on the policy had started. No firm decision had been made, but he supported the idea of reducing the coverage of audits and general thinking was moving in that direction. He said it might remain a condition that smaller companies would be required to retain the services of a professional accountant. All limited companies have been required to have an audit since 1908. The requirement was reaffirmed in the early 1980s after the introduction of the fourth European Community directive on small and medium-sized enterprises. Audit fees charged by accountants to the smallest companies often run into hundreds of pounds and the change in regulations could threaten income from many smaller practitioners. The plans under discussion would exclude from annual audits companies with turnovers below Pounds 35,000 - the level at which they currently become liable for VAT. It would increase in line with this limit, raised to Pounds 36,600 in the Budget on Tuesday. Mr Redwood said there might be a distinction drawn on the rules, with requirements relaxed for independent companies but not for those which are subsidiaries of other companies. The Treasury and the Inland Revenue are believed to oppose the idea saying it could jeopardise the efficacy of tax collection. It might also raise problems for regulators and those trying to detect fraud. Mr Joe Ryan, partner in charge of growing businesses at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, said most financial institutions would probably still require a regular independent check on a company's accounts.</p>

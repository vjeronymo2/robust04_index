			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Selling spree hits copper and coffee Commodities and precious metals prices tumbled yesterday in Chicago, London and New York as investment funds and speculators sold heavily. However, maize and soyabean prices, which rose so strongly in Chicago on Tuesday, held on to most of those gains yesterday after early set-backs. Coffee and copper prices, which have been the main beneficiaries of the recent buying spree in London, went into reverse. Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange dropped by Dollars 39.50 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,227.50. Traders suggested that a slowing in copper's rally, and its failure to move close to recent 16-month highs after a short, downward movement last week, possibly unsettled some speculators. Coffee prices slid by Dollars 56 a tonne in London in a round of profit-taking with the September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange down at Dollars 2,035 a tonne. The market was led down by an early slump in New York where traders were concerned about Friday's expiry of options contracts. But London trading was thin and volatile and in this case speculators and hedge funds were absent from the market. Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said that a combination of Tuesday's auction of stocks in Brazil which had failed to sell as much as expected, and a lower than expected drop in US stocks, had unsettled the market. US maize and soyabean futures dipped at yesterday's opening at the Chicago Board of Trade as speculators took profits after a weather-induced rally on Tuesday. However, evidence that unseasonably warm, dry weather was persisting in the upper Midwest crop areas bolstered prices after the opening. At midday, maize futures were little changed from Tuesday's strong closes, and soyabean futures were only 4 to 5 cents per bushel lower.</p>

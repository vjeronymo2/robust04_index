			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Greek socialists suffer poll setback The conservative candidate for mayor of Athens, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos, yesterday inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mr Theodoros Pangalos, a former European affairs minister who was standing for the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). Mr Pangalos conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed, when computer projections indicated Mr Avramopoulos, a former diplomat who entered politics only a year ago, would win with 55.1 per cent of the vote. Mr Pangalos claimed Athens had 'lost an historic opportunity' in Greece's nationwide local elections because left-wing Athenians failed to back him in the yesterday's crucial second round of voting. But he said he would lead a citizens' movement to improve the quality of life in the city. The Athens result reflected voter dissatisfaction with Pasok's restrictive economic policies since its return to power in 1993, but was also a protest against Mr Pangalos' campaigning style. Mr Pangalos, known for his outspoken comments about other politicians, appeared to have turned undecided voters against him because of repeated personal attacks on Mr Avramopoulos. His defeat may also have an impact on his chances of succeeding Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou as Pasok leader. The leadership struggle is intensifying, with Mr Papandreou expected to stand down as premier in order to run for the Greek presidency next spring. Mr Avramopoulos is a member of the opposition New Democracy party and his victory in Athens gives the party control of Greece's two largest cities as Mr Constantine Kosmopoulos, mayor of Thessaloniki, was re-elected in the first-round vote of the country's local government elections a week earlier. However, Mr Spyros Logothetis, the Pasok candidate, appeared set to win second-round voting yesterday in Athens' port of Piraeus. First returns also showed Pasok doing well in second-round voting in the countryside and for provincial governors.</p>

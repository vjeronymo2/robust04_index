			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Japanese students learnfine art of corporate bow THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese economy has claimed another victim, the pampered university student. In the feverish days of the late 1980s, the country's students were wined, dined and entertained at beach resorts by companies in need of young talent to stock their wildly ambitious expansion plans. But, as one youth magazine warned yesterday, the wind on the golf course has changed direction. Toyota Motor announced that its intake of non-technical graduates will be cut by 18 per cent this year, Nissan by 21 per cent, and Kawasaki Steel by 28 per cent. Companies are no longer devising ever more extravagant ways to entice reluctant students into the fold. Instead worried applicants are attending politeness courses, polishing their interview techniques and getting the depth and timing of those bows right. Meanwhile, the National Personnel Authority, which hires and fires bureaucrats, says this year's applicants will not be asked to identify their university. The policy change is an attempt to reduce the bias towards Tokyo University graduates, who take more than 70 per cent of posts in the choice ministries. The NPA's edict is likely to have less impact than the ailing economy. As the authority itself is overstocked with Tokyo graduates, the old-boy network which runs the Japanese bureaucracy will ensure that the outsiders are kept to a necessary minimum. For Toyota, the cut in graduate hiring is an inevitable reaction to a year-long slump in the domestic car market: 'We took in so many people when the economy was growing rapidly. Now the environment has turned sour and we must cut back.' The same sentiment was expressed by Hitachi, the electronics company, which says it is taking a 'macro view' and, instead of hiring for the sake of hiring, it is only hiring for 'necessary posts'. In the quest for these 'necessary posts', students have taken to consulting magazines such as Adole, which guides apparently inexperienced students in the fine art of the corporate bow. Young men should have hands at the side, coat buttoned, eyes down and take their bow slowly. As for capturing the look that appeals most to the average Japanese personnel manager, young men are advised to wear a pastel tie, 'not stained', carry a brief case, and avoid the double-breasted suit. Women are told that personnel departments don't like pierced ears and manicured nails while the skirt hem should not stray too far above the knee, and hair is best worn up. Shoe heels must be no thicker than 5cm and a leather document holder makes a good impression. Having slipped back into sensible shoes and away from vibrant flashes of individuality, the present generation of students is lamenting that their graduation will come one year too late. Last year, they could have anticipated at least one weekend contemplating job offers in a hot spring at company expense.</p>

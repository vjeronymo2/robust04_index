			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Industrial theatre: The threat of labour unrest in Germany The curtain goes up tomorrow in Germany on the last act of a brand-new production of the Threepenny Opera. The international audience is more than usually restive. So far, the piece has been entertaining because it has an unusual cast and the words and music have been completely rewritten. All except for the ending. And work starts on that tomorrow. In the story so far, the grand chorus of 360,000 steelworkers has taken on the combined might of the employers, government and economic establishment in a battle over pay. In the three months since the action started, the difference between the IG Metall union's claim and the steel industry's offer has been whittled down to around 10 pfennigs  - 3p - an hour. And there the music stopped. Union members start voting in a strike ballot tomorrow. The outcome will be known at the end of the week. There will then be a grand denouement, its length and content decided largely by which way the 3p drops. The steelworkers, normally walk-on players in the domestic pay round, have assumed a status, as one of their union leaders put it recently, 'beyond their economic importance'. Indeed, because they were first to the negotiating table and first to the ballot box, the influence of their votes could ultimately reach far beyond their own pocket books and the confines of dusty Duisburg, heart of the Thyssen steel empire. The whole of Germany, all its European neighbours, and other industrial partners could be affected. At worst, recovery from recession in Britain, France and the US could be slowed further. At best, German interest rates might come down, others could follow, and flagging economies would be given a boost. Can one little union branch carry so much clout? Yes, because it has a supporting cast of millions behind it. The scenario is straightforward. It has been decided in Bonn and Frankfurt, home of the Bundesbank, that if in current conditions the German economy is allowed to take another step up the pay-price spiral - last year's 6.7 per cent average wage settlement against annual inflation of 3.5 per cent was the first - the Bundesbank will leave interest rates at their current high level, or even put them up. Either way, hopes of recovery in Britain and elsewhere will be damaged. At present, there is a consensus that if German pay deals are held below 6 per cent this year, then Frankfurt's hardline guardians of monetary discipline will respond at the end of the pay round by reducing key interest rates from the peaks to which they were shunted just before Christmas. If not, early cuts are unlikely, and a further increase cannot be ruled out. Enter the steel workers. The 10 pfennig difference between the negotiators translates to a final offer of around 5.5 per cent from employers, up against a final demand from the unions for 6.5 per cent. It is the first, and certainly not the last, stand-off in the current round, which continues into the spring. The main body of IG Metall, numbering almost 4m engineers, and 3m OTV public service union members are standing to one side with demands for 9.5 per cent rises at the ready. Across the country, with the exception of coal miners pleading for a rise to cover 'inflation at least', unions have prepared claims averaging 10 per cent. IG Metall's steel section, which was thrown into the fray with an initial 10.5 per cent claim, has so far refused to play the part of the sacrificial lamb. Hard-line members say the employers are mistaken to believe they will be easy meat, their morale weakened by the advancing wave of job cuts brought on by the slump in steel markets. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of Thyssen, meanwhile, has stated quite openly that he would rather face a strike than pay more than 6 per cent. The employers have cast the IG Metall steel section in the role of the Trojan horse. They fear that if the steel workers are allowed to breach the 6 per cent barrier, the hordes will follow. The main IG Metall sections, one of which has already posted a claim for 9.5 per cent in talks due to begin in March, are unlikely to settle for less than their more lowly colleagues in the steel mills of North Rhine Westphalia. Government, industry and academics have warned repeatedly during the past six months that over-generous pay settlements will cost businesses dearly in lost competitiveness. The natural, inevitable result, they say, is that union members will lose their jobs. But the Bundesbank will not lose its nerve. It has coolly rebuffed all the many critics of its last turn of the interest rates screw. The value of the D-Mark, it insists, and the stability of the German economy are crucial to the well-being of the European Monetary System and thus of the European Community. Even a recession, in the Bundesbank's view, would be preferable to giving up its target of 2 per cent inflation. Inflation, long acknowledged in all walks of life in Germany as the devil most to be feared, may be a worry for the Bundesbank, but curiously it is not the main factor motivating the unions' large pay demands. It has been more of an off-stage voice, its message ignored in the clamour. At 3.5 per cent last year, and expected to rise to an average 4.5 per cent this, it has been relatively high by German standards. But there are more powerful forces at work. It has been displaced in shopfloor demonology this year by a more striking presence: a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity' levy on income tax. Imposed for 12 months last July 1 to help fund the costs of German unity, and rolled up together with a package of increased duties on cigarettes, heating oil and petrol, it had an immediate and dramatic effect. Growth in private consumption of 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year dived to 1.2 per cent in the third quarter, and ended the year at just 2.4 per cent. It is still a leading topic in pub talk, and the opposition SPD party keeps the arguments alive with constant claims that the levy should be retained. Despite fresh assurances yesterday from Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, that it will be withdrawn on schedule at the end of June, the country's workforce feels, and says forcefully, that it has been cheated. The tax levy cancelled out last year's pay increases, and cheated working people out of their share of the 'boom' profits earned by west German industry in 1991 as it worked at capacity to match pent-up demand from the east of the country. While popular resentment has hardened union attitudes, misjudgments made in last year's post-unification euphoria have at the same time weakened the employers' position. Government undermined industry negotiators by starting the round of settlements with a 6 per cent rise for what the bulk of trade union leaders say are 'unproductive' public servants. Companies wanting to avoid missing out on the unification windfall, avoided disruption only by paying out for an even more generous series of deals. This has led this year to an uncomfortable scramble among unions striving to restore differentials and the traditional pecking order. The government also blundered last year when it announced plans to increase value added tax to 15 per cent from 14 from the start of 1993. This measure, which is currently blocked in the opposition-controlled Bundesrat, served only further to fuel this year's pay demands. However, the differences over pay and taxation policy between industry and government have been put to one side for the moment. The motor industry, for example, is busy laying contingency plans for short-time working and lay-offs at its factories should the ballot lead to a strike. Government itself is drafting its strategy for dealing with the aggressive OTV public service union. Financial market observers, meanwhile, are occupying themselves in trying to cheer everyone up. They claim, almost to a man, that everything will turn out fine in the end with 5.5 per cent all round. In the freezing Duisburg fog yesterday morning, while 4,000 workers gathered to cheer their leaders, their optimism seemed a little theatrical. One veteran of the last strike outing in 1978, said, puffing out his cheeks: 'It's strike weather.'</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBOS hopes Growing optimism in the market that Royal Bank of Scotland will be the next big FT-SE 100 constituent to deliver a 20 per cent-plus dividend increase saw the bank's shares produce the leading index's best individual performance. They settled a net 21 higher at 428p, a rise of 4.9 per cent, following relatively large turnover of 3.1m shares. RBOS's interim results are expected tomorrow, with analysts looking for pre-tax profits at least double the Pounds 91m achieved last year. A big rise in earnings from Direct Line, the bank's insurance by telephone business and one of the jewels in the bank's crown, is expected. But it will be the size of the dividend increase that will determine the market's response to the results. Most bank sector analysts are looking for an interim rise of at least 20 per cent and there will be some disappointment if the increase does not match the 25 per cent increase in the payout total last year.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits UB's year ended with such a flurry of activity that it was difficult to keep a fix on the group. But its annual results confirm that, though much may have usefully changed at the margin, UB's fate will still be determined at the core. Here, both McVitie's and KP produced predictably creditable performances with promising growth in mainland Europe. Despite rationalisation, Ross Young's recorded its customary miserable return on assets. The swing element is Keebler. The troublesome US subsidiary, which saw profits drop by 60 per cent, accounts for 36 per cent of group sales. The speed and strength of its recovery will be the spur for UB's shares. The management's rhetoric seems right. Much can surely be achieved by applying marketing spend more appropriately and cutting wasteful lines. The closure of a Californian bakery hints at more regional retrenchment. Further expansion into the own-label market could provide the incremental sales increases needed to defray the costs of Keebler's expensive distribution base. This could provide UB with a recovery kick lacking in such sector stalwarts as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. But the US market remains fearsomely competitive. Investors may care to wait for a progress report at the interim stage before chasing the shares much further.</p>

Shevardnadze]? Yes -- 39.3  percent; no -- 60.7 percent;    The Cabinet of Ministers and ministries? Yes -- 13.2  percent; no -- 86.8 percent;    Journalists? Yes -- 56.4 percent; no -- 43.6 percent.    This sociological survey was organized by "Inform-Service"  among 500 citizens in Tbilisi on 21-23 January.    The results of the poll are unexpected, as it turns out that  citizens believe journalists most of all and the government  least of all. The reasons for such a lack of popularity  regarding information provided by the government must be, first,  that the heads of ministries are busy foisting materials in  praise of themselves onto the radio, television and press and,  second, that the head of the Cabinet of Ministers press center  is, in general, hostiley disposed toward journalists.</p>

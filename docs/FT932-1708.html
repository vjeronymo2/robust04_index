			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Clinton renews call to open Japanese markets PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that whoever headed the next government in Tokyo would still have to ensure that Japan pursues market-opening policies. In a radio interview given just two weeks before he is due to leave for the Group of Seven economic summit and for bilateral talks in Tokyo, Mr Clinton expressed little sympathy for Japan's government turmoil, putting it down to a long legacy of political scandal and corruption. 'It's pretty clear to me', he said, 'that no matter who winds up being prime minister of Japan, or whatever faction that person comes from, they're going to have to continue to open their economy to our products.' He added, echoing a consistent theme of US policy over recent weeks: 'They're going to have to continue to stimulate their economy because they don't have a budget deficit.' In an apparent attempt to encourage the internationalist strain among Japanese politicians, he went on: 'They can't withdraw from the world or shut us out now. They've got too much at stake in expanding into China and other countries and in doing business in a very complicated world.' He expected his bilateral talks to be 'challenging' but 'successful, simply because of the limits on their economic options'. Senior officials from both governments are due to hold the second round of negotiations on the proposed new bilateral 'framework' in Tokyo this weekend, following the first session in Washington 10 days ago. That produced no breakthrough, and US officials had not expected one, but the collapse of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government has raised new doubts about whether the whole process will now be able to go through on schedule.</p>

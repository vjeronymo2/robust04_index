			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAME TEAMS, DIFFERENT FACES;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: TORRANCE DEFEATED MORNINGSIDE, 13-12, ON SEPT. 14, BUT BOTH  TEAMS HAVE MADE SEVERAL CHANGES IN THEIR LINEUPS AS THEY PREPARE TO MEET IN  FRIDAY'S PLAYOFF GAME.  </P> <P> Morningside High's Ron Tatum, like all football coaches, prides himself on  preparing the Monarchs for their opponents.  </P> <P> And this week, as the Monarchs (9-2) prepare to play at Torrance (8-3) in the  CIF-Southern Section Division VIII quarterfinals on Friday at 7:30 p.m., it  would appear that Tatum's job is fairly easy. After all, Morningside played at  Torrance during the regular season and Tatum has vivid memories of the contest  (not to mention game film).  </P> <P> But that contest, won by the Tartars, 13-12, was played 10 weeks ago on Sept.  14. Tatum barely recognizes either squad today.  </P> <P> "We were so different when we played them," Tatum said, adding that he was  still experimenting with various lineups and strategies. "We had our big people  playing then and now we we are running with our smaller group."  </P> <P> Moreover, Morningside had yet to utilize the full talents of sophomore Stais  Boseman. A quarterback-flanker, Boseman has made a habit of performing a  statistical oddity: throwing for a touchdown pass and catching a touchdown pass  in the same game.  </P> <P> Boseman accomplished the trick most recently last week, in Morningside's 20-13  opening-round victory over Atascadero. Boseman, like many young players, has  improved as the season has progressed.  </P> <P> But Tatum also believes Torrance has made great strides since the second week  of the season, even if the Tartars are without running back Carlos Hilliard  (broken leg), who scored both of Torrance's touchdowns and rushed for 90 yards  in the first meeting with Morningside.  </P> <P> "They have a big offensive line and their backs have been running hard behind  it," said Tatum, whose team is seeded second in the division and riding a  seven-game winning streak. "(Jason) Kendall is one of the best quarterbacks in  the South Bay area, and he has done nothing but improve.  </P> <P> "Last time, their line really moved us around, and that was with our big people  in there. As a team, they've come a long way -- like we have."  </P> <P> Kendall, a junior, earned his first varsity victory as starting quarterback in  the Morningside game. He has since emerged as a polished offensive leader.  </P> <P> And Coach Rich Busia's running game, which disappeared after the loss of  Hilliard, has reappeared in the past two weeks in better shape than ever behind  the one-two punch of Tony Lomeli and Scott Hagerman.  </P> <P> Hagerman, who had 140 yards last week, provided the decisive margin in  Torrance's earlier victory over Morningside with an extra-point kick.  </P> <P> Other Southern Section quarterfinals involving area teams:  </P> <P> DIVISION III  </P> <P> Esperanza of Anaheim (11-0) at Leuzinger (8-3), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Two  second-half touchdowns gave Leuzinger a 20-16 road victory over Crespi in the  first round, with Marvin Johnson's 10-yard run providing the winning points.  Top-seeded Esperanza beat Alhambra, 47-0, at home last week, scoring 38 points  in the first half. Running back Jarod Smith carried only eight times in  Esperanza's Delaware wing-T offense, but made the most of his opportunities  with 174 yards and three touchdowns. Smith has eight touchdowns in the past  three games and is a 1,000-yard rusher.  </P> <P> Hawthorne (9-2) vs. Loara of Anaheim (7-4) at Glover Stadium (Anaheim), 7:30  p.m. Friday -- Running back Morrell Ollis (136 yards) had a typically  productive game as Hawthorne beat Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, 28-21, in the  opening round. Coach Goy Casillas is hoping the victory will provide some  momentum for his team, which entered the playoffs off a loss. Loara beat Villa  Park, 26-14, last week while piling up 298 rushing yards. Shawn Easter led the  way with 106 yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries.  </P> <P> DIVISION VII  </P> <P> Serra (9-0) at La Mirada (9-2), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Serra, rated No. 1 in the  South Bay by The Times and the top-seeded team in the division, survived a  scare last week. Trabuco Hills led, 21-20, going into the fourth quarter. But  Jerald Henry led the way for Serra, coming up with a key interception and a  78-yard scoring run in the final quarter as the Cavaliers won, 34-21. Actually,  the biggest scare Serra got was a knee injury suffered by Henry in the third  quarter that kept him out of a few defensive plays. But the injury proved to be  minor, and he is expected to be at full strength this week. La Mirada is going  for its second upset in a row. The Matadors knocked off San Fernando Valley  League champion Harvard, 21-14, on the road. The come-from-behind victory was  keyed by quarterback Carlos Jimenez, who threw touchdown passes to Mike  Moschetti and Scott Keawekane. La Mirada was a CIF semifinalist last year.  </P> <P> DIVISION VIII  </P> <P> Cabrillo of Lompoc (9-2) at Mira Costa (6-4-1), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Mira Costa  has won five of six games. Running back James Franks has keyed the resurgence,  rushing for 162 yards in a 28-6 first-round victory at Yucaipa. The Mustangs  have scored in double digits every week following a scoreless tie with El  Segundo on opening night. Top-seeded Cabrillo beat visiting Santa Clara of  Oxnard, 38-10, in the first round.  </P> <P> Bloomington (9-2) vs. Palos Verdes (6-5) at North Torrance High, 7:30 p.m.  Friday -- This game features a hot offense against a hot defense: Palos Verdes  has scored 90 points in its past two games, while Bloomington shut out South  Torrance, 17-0, in the first round. Running back George Felactu (12 touchdowns)  has set the pace for Palos Verdes all season. He appears to have regained the  early-season form that drove the Sea Kings to a 3-0 mark. Felactu had 116 yards  in a 45-18 first-round victory over Paso Robles, and quarterback Tim King  enjoyed his best game with 195 yards and four touchdowns passing.  </P> <P> Temecula Valley (8-3) at West Torrance (9-2), Friday 7:30 p.m. -- West has been  living on the edge. The Warriors' past four games have been decided by three  points or less and they have gone 3-1. For the season, West is 5-2 games  decided by five points or less. Furthermore, the Warriors are only seven points  away from a perfect season. West is led by Pioneer League MVP Alex Schultz, a  senior fullback and linebacker. Temecula Valley is going after its second  consecutive victory over a South Bay team, having defeated Rolling Hills,  39-28, last week.  </P></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Fire union votes for strike ballots THE conference of the Fire Brigades Union in Bridlington, Humberside, voted unanimously yesterday to authorise two separate strike ballots among its 49,000 members. The first concerns alleged government threats to scrap the 14-year-old guaranteed pay formula ensuring firefighters' pay remains in the upper quarter of male manual earnings. The second is over the threat of compulsory redundancies in the fire service. The FBU delegates, after a highly emotional debate, have set their union on a collision course with the government. Speakers emphasised that the issue at stake was not a demand for a pay rise that breached the 1.5 per cent government pay limit figure for the public sector, but the continuation of the pay formula. In his speech to the conference, Mr Ken Cameron, the union general secretary, stressed that the union was 'not about greedy fire service workers' pay but honouring an agreement'. Mr Cameron said the union was seeking an urgent meeting with the prime minister, Mr John Major, to explain the gravity of the situation to him if the government does not fully fund firefighters' pay increases and local authority employers fail to honour the 1978 pay formula agreement. The Home Office said yesterday that the date for the firefighters' pay award was not until November 7, and therefore it was 'premature for the union to go for strike action now'. The union's leadership seems unlikely to wait until November to hold its strike ballots. Conference resolutions have given the union's executive the authority to organise their votes 'when appropriate'. Mr Cameron would not be drawn on the date for holding the ballots, but he told a press conference that the union intended initially to stop short of an all-out strike if the union achieved majority support from its membership. In the meantime, the union will join ambulance staff and health workers on a demonstration in London on May 26 against threats to public services caused by government spending cuts. The union had its first national strike in 1977, which lasted for nine weeks and ended with establishing the pay formula, which the union initially opposed. As a result of the formula over the past 14 years firefighters' pay has improved substantially. Between 1979 and 1981, when the formula was introduced, firefighters' earnings rose 40 per cent, putting them in the top quartile of male manual earnings, where they have remained ever since. Many delegates argued yesterday that if the pay formula was abandoned by the government it would pave the way for an attack on firefighters' terms and conditions of employment and quality of the service. The union believes it is fighting a defensive campaign against threats to its very existence. Union leaders pointed out there has been a deterioration in the fire service in recent years, saying there had been a 64 per cent increase in emergency calls since 1980, while staffing levels increased by only 2.5 per cent.</p>

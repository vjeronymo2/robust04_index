The name list  was submitted to the council on 17 June.    Som said that the said organization was the result of the  negotiations made during the latest official visit to Singapore  of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. At the initial stage, the  council will concentrate on working out its framework before it  can realy start functioning in promoting free trade.    Som noted: "The Thailand-Singapore Business Council stresses  on cooperation between the two countries in business and  financial areas as well as industries concerned. More important  is that the council will promote good understanding and  cooperation between Thailand and Singapore as both countries are  striving to become financial hubs in the region. It is believed  that the council will help prevent conflict and competition."</p>

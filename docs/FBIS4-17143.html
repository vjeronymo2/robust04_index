			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The Russian Foreign Ministry  believes that the incident which arose in connection with a  publication of "an order by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin  on setting up military bases in CIS states and Latvia" is  closed. This was announced today at a briefing by Mikhail  Demurin, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information  and Press Department.    He underlined that "all the necessary explanations have been  provided at the necessary level. We will not provide any  further explanations".    M. Demurin reiterated that "no one has seen this document"  at  the Russian Foreign Ministry. Therefore, he said, "it would be  very strange to carry out some or other investigation at the  Foreign Ministry with regard to a document prepared by the  president's administration, if that is indeed the case."</p>

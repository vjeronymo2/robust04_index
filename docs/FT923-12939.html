			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Bonds: BASF launches Dollars 200m issue aimed at retail investors NERVOUS conditions in the international bond market ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting kept most investors and potential issuers on the sidelines yesterday. With most investment institutions waiting to see if the German authorities will tighten monetary conditions before committing funds, the only new issues were aimed at retail investors and denominated in North American currencies. BASF, the German chemicals and industrial group, launched a Dollars 200m seven-year deal, lead-managed by Deutsche Bank. The 7 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par. At this level the yield was 45 basis points more than US Treasury paper. The pricing was seen as too tight by underwriting firms with a predominantly institutional client base. However, banks with strong retail placement into Germany and Switzerland, including the lead manager, reported no problems in selling the bonds. BASF does not carry an official credit rating, but has been assigned an implied AA2 rating by Moody's Investors Service without its permission. Goldman Sachs raised CDollars 150m five-year funds through a deal which it lead-managed. The 8 1/2 per cent bonds were also aimed at retail investors and priced to yield a full 1 per cent more than Canadian government paper. The yield was seen as generous by participants and the bonds sold quickly. Comision Federal de Electricidad, Mexico's state-owned electricity distributor, launched a Dollars 100m five-year issue lead-managed by Citicorp Investment Bank. Although the issue was the first by this borrower, the bonds were priced to yield 210 basis points more than US Treasury bonds  -in line with the secondary market yield of other Mexican state agency bonds. Matsushita's Dollars 1bn 10-year global bond issue was priced to yield 41 basis points more than Treasury bonds, at the tighter end of an indicated 41-43 basis point range already considered tight by some bankers. However, co-managers reported no problems in placing their relatively small allocations of bonds. Most said demand from Japanese investors was stronger than anticipated, with European investors showing less appetite for registered, corporate bonds. The deal was the first global bond issue by a corporation. Lehman Brothers, which joint lead-managed the transaction with Credit Suisse First Boston and therefore underwrote a larger slice of the deal, said it sold some large blocks of bonds to European institutional investors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gdansk, June 15 -- Several customers of a bank in  the Gdansk province have been approached recently by Nigerian  institutions and asked to agree to have big money transferred on  their accounts. In return the Nigerians offered 30 percent of  the transferred amount, a bank staffer told PAP on Wednesday.  The bank customers rejected the Nigerian proposal and notified  the bank whose authorities believe the Nigerians were trying to  launder money in Poland. The Nigerians wanted to transfer many  million dollars to each account.    The proposals came from the Nigerian Federal Ministry of  Industry and Trade and the Federal Ministry of National Defence.  The Nigerians justified their proposal with the unstable  situation in their country and asked to keep the operation in  secret.    A similar proposal was reported on Wednesday by the  "DZIENNIK  BALTYCKI" daily which wrote that the Nigerian Construction  Ministry and the Nigerian national oil corporation wanted to  transfer 57 million U.S. dollars. They wanted to pay 17.8  million U.S. dollars for the transaction and sacrificed further  4.2 million dollars for the servicing costs, read: bribes.</p>

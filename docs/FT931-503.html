			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Women's pay expected to suffer if wage councils go THE ABOLITION of wages councils will increase the gap between men's and women's rates of pay throughout the economy, a study by the Pay Equity Project, a pressure group, warns. Wages councils are due to be scrapped under the bill on union reform and employment rights going through parliament. The bill will come in for a third day of scrutiny in committee today in the House of Lords. The group's analysis of official government data found that last year women manual workers in wages council industries earned 81.3 per cent of comparative male wages. This compared with 71.5 per cent across all industries. The lowest 10 per cent of women non-manual workers covered by wages councils earned 90.5 per cent of equivalent male rates, compared with an all-industry figure of 79.2 per cent. All the figures are for average hourly earnings. Overall, the gender gap on pay has been narrower in wages council industries than the average across all industries for each year since 1979, found the Pay Equity Project. The group claims that the scrapping of wages councils will lead to wider differentials between wages of men and women in those industries, which 'will, in turn, create a knock-on effect on the earnings ratio for all industries'. The councils set wages floors for 2.5m low-paid private-sector workers in industries such as catering and hairdressing where most workers are women. The group acknowledges it could be argued that the male-female pay gap is narrower in wages council industries because male wages are also depressed due to the high numbers of women workers. However, the Pay Equity Project has also compared similar female-dominated industries and still identified larger gaps between male and female earnings in those that are not covered by the councils. The Trades Union Congress, backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, is lodging an official complaint with the European Commission over the planned abolition of wages councils. It is claimed that the government is infringing its commitment to EC equal pay legislation for women. The government argues that wages councils are arbitrary and outdated and prevent the creation of jobs. Narrowing the gender pay gap. Pay Equity Project, c/o Liberty, 21 Tabard Street, London SE1 4LA.

The ongoing 50th session at Geneva  last night adopted a consensus resolution to this effect despite  Islamabad's intense behind-the-scene lobby to thwart it. The  resolution for the first time recognizes the effect of terrorism  on human rights, a point which has been hammered at by India at  all the international fora in the wake of transborder export of  terrrorism into Jammu and Kashmir. According to observers, the  decision will have serious implications for Pakistan-sponsored  terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir. The resolution  reiterates the United Nation's unequivocal condemnation of  terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as acts of  aggression aimed at the destruction of human integrity and  security of states, destabilizing legitimately constituted  governments, and having adverse consequences on the economic and  social development of the states. It calls upon the states to  take effective measures to prevent, combat, and eliminate  terrorism. The resolution urges the international community to  enhance cooperation to fight terrorism at various levels.    India has urged the UN Human Rights Commission members to  vote against the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. Addressing the  ongoing session of the commission at Geneva last night, veteran  diplomat and former foreign secretary, Mr. T.N. Kaul, said that  the resolution has serious and dangerous implications that could  allow any country to infringe on the national independence and  sovereignty of others. Mr. Kaul was exercising the second right  of reply to Pakistan's allegations against india on the Kashmir  situation.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Georgia peace negotiations break down ATTEMPTS to agree a ceasefire in the violent struggle for the port of Sukhumi in the Georgian province of Abkhazia broke down yesterday in Moscow. At the same time, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, warned in the Black Sea port that he was prepared to take harsher action to put down the revolt in the province, where separatists have waged an 18-month struggle to secede from Georgia and join the Russian federation. Mr Shevardnadze, who has twice come under shell-fire at his army headquarters in Sukhumi, said on Sunday: 'Perhaps we must look at resolving this conflict through a combination of military and peaceful means. Until now we have tried to use only peaceful means.' Hopes for a negotiated ceasefire through the mediation of Mr Boris Pastukhov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, faded yesterday on Abkhazian demands. These insisted that an Abkhazian parliament and other institutions be permitted to return to Sukhumi and begin work as soon as a ceasefire was agreed, a condition unacceptable to the Georgian side, which still claims authority over Abkhazia. Most of the province is now in secessionist hands, except for the disputed capital of Sukhumi and the town of Ochamchira. Russia is accused by many Georgians of supplying military and other assistance to the Abkhazian side. However, Mr Shevardnadze at the weekend said that Mr Tengiz Sigua, the prime minister, had been wrong to threaten to break off diplomatic relations with Moscow. Such a move was 'unthinkable'.</p>

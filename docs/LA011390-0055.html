			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 500 FLEE BLAST AT PETROLEUM CENTER  </P> <P> An explosion and fire at a petroleum distribution center just east of this  rural Ventura County community forced the evacuation of about 500 area  residents Friday, but no one was injured, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Firefighters said that there was an explosion in a shed area at the Clark  Corp., about a half mile east of town, shortly after 7 p.m. The cause of the  blast was not immediately known.  </P> <P> County Fire Department Dispatcher Vicki Crabtree said a tanker truck driver,  who had been unloading gasoline nearby, managed to shut off the tanker's valves  and run for his life. His truck was not involved in the fire.  </P> <P> Flames from 50 to 100 feet high glowed orange against the rainy sky.  </P> <P> About 85 firefighters, manning 17 engines, three support units, and a hazardous  materials squad responded and battled the fire for more than an hour. There was  no immediate estimate of damages.  </P> <P> At the evacuation center set up by the Red Cross at Santa Paula High School,  Manuel Aguilar, a Santa Paula resident who lives near the Clark property, said  he was baby-sitting his nephews when he heard an explosion.  </P> <P> "The house shook, and I looked outside and there was a huge column of smoke  about 100 feet high, and a ball of fire in the sky," he said.  </P> <P> Aguilar said he and his nephews, ages 7 and 8, ran outside, and were told by  firefighters to evacuate the area.  </P></p>

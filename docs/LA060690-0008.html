			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L. A.  </P> <P> To honor the Southern California lifestyle, the city of Manhattan Beach bolted  a sculpture of dumbbells to a seaside bench last year.  </P> <P> Problem is, thieves keep lifting them -- most recently the other night.  </P> <P> "This wasn't a case of them being knocked off by mistake," said Howard Spector,  the city's public arts administrator. "Not only were they bolted to the bench,  they were epoxied, too."  </P> <P> The 25-pound cast-bronze dumbbells were snatched from the same bench last  September. They were returned that time after a local group, the Friends of the  Arts, offered a $500 reward, no questions asked.  </P> <P> In case the same thieves were thinking of making the sculpture a regular source  of income, the Friends are offering no reward this time.  </P> <P> The weights, titled (and spelled) "Ddumbbells" by creator Ann Preston of Santa  Monica, cost the city $7,000, which is one reason some citizens have criticized  Manhattan Beach's public arts program as ddumb.  </P> <P> If race car drivers competing against Tim Capaldi are extra careful about  careening into him, you can't blame them. Capaldi's dragster bears the logo of  his sponsor, Legal Rights Defenders, a local lawyer's group.  </P> <P> Election Day has evolved into something a bit more stately -- and even more  honest -- than it was in 1850s L.A.  </P> <P> For one thing, there was no list of registered voters.  </P> <P> Pioneer Harris Newmark recalled how various candidates would round up newly  arrived workers "like so many cattle, confine them in corrals (usually in Boyle  Heights), keep them in a truly magnificent state of intoxication until the  eventful morning" and then cart them off to the city's only polling place in  stages.  </P> <P> Citizens who wanted to cast two (or more) ballots, Newmark added, were not  above voting once and then "cutting off the hair, shaving (the) beard or  mustache, re-clothing or otherwise transforming (their) appearance."  </P> <P> At least, there were fewer complaints of voter apathy.  </P> <P> This being Southern California, it was inevitable that our proposed "Malathion  Song Book" would attract various ethnic entries. Our favorites so far are  Miguel Novelo Jr.'s "Medfly Nortena" ("Medfly of the North"), which he points  out "would go perfect with ranchera music," and Ed Bissot's "Club Medfly," an  original composition with a Caribbean beat and these lyrics:  </P> <P>  Come to the Club Medfly,  </P> <P>  Where malathion fills the sky.  </P> <P>  Come to the Club Medfly.  </P> <P>  You can spray, you can pray.  </P> <P>  But the fruit fly won't die.  </P> <P>  In El Layyyyyyy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> After reading here that Baskin-Robbins is dedicating its flavor of the month  for July to the Soviet president, Ken Freehill of Alhambra wonders why the  company isn't also offering a variety of Raisan Gorbachocolate.  </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The 59-year-old Los Angeles Theater was built with a soundproof upper chamber  for viewing by children and/or adults -- a crying room.  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: So many questions - The big building society merger WHEN TWO of the UK's largest building societies announce they are to merge, their 7.3m customers are entitled to ask what it means for them. But they will get few answers at the moment from the Leeds or the National &amp; Provincial, which plan to tie the knot by next spring. If the move is approved by their 3.3m members, the resulting society would be the UK's third largest. The two say a merger is the best way to get the investment needed to provide higher levels of customer service through 'an expanded range of products and services'. By combining, they will have a wider distribution network as well. They are, however, unable to say yet what the expanded range would comprise. 'The announcement of the merger has come before we are able to answer a lot of questions,' said Mark Whiting, of the Leeds. 'But speculation regarding the merger was getting rampant and we decided to make an open statement.' What is certain is that there will be fewer branches, with the 769 they have now being reduced to between 600-700. The societies stress that this is a genuine merger and not a takeover of N &amp; P by the Leeds. N &amp; P will lose its name - the merged society will be known as the Leeds Permanent - but its distinctive bee logo will remain and its chief executive, David O'Brien, will take up the same position in the new society. Savers Building societies are owned by their members and in recent years, when a smaller society was swallowed by a larger one, a bonus has often been given, partly as compensation for handing over ownership to members of a larger society. Bonus payments are a recent innovation, though: it was Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester which set the trend when it took over the Guardian building society in 1989. Since the Leeds/N &amp; P deal is not a takeover, members may find expectations of a bonus misplaced. A final decision depends on the level of reserves and the effect on the society's capital ratios. Some savings accounts will certainly disappear since the two societies say they will be eliminating duplication. N &amp; P is one of the few societies to have committed itself to telling investors when an account is closed and replaced by a new one. It says the merged society is almost certain to continue this policy. At the moment, the level of interest paid by each society on its savings accounts is similar. Each, for instance, offers 5.6 per cent gross on Pounds 25,000 in its instant access account, so savers should not be affected unduly. Borrowers People on fixed rate mortgages from either society should not see any change. Both societies claim they were among the first in the fixed rate market and say they are committed to providing innovative products. The standard variable rate at both is 7.99 per cent. Where the two differ most is on their policy towards credit cards. Visa cardholders at N &amp; P do not pay an annual charge but this could change since the Leeds has a Pounds 12 fee. Interest rates at N &amp; P are lower, too: 21.6 APR compared with 22.4 at Leeds. N &amp; P was also the first society to issue credit cards with photographs in an attempt to beat fraud. It says this is 'exactly the kind of innovative service and product which we would not want to lose' after the merger. N &amp; P will be writing to its customers within the next week and has set up a free customer helpline for those with queries: 0800-404 041.</p>

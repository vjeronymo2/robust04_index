			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: EC may act on Korean chip dumping - Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar could face restrictions THE EUROPEAN Commission is considering possible anti-dumping measures against three Korean manufacturers of semiconductors after recently concluding a preliminary investigation into charges that the companies had been dumping memory chips into the EC. The commission said it has notified the parties involved of the findings of its investigation into the dumping charges brought two years ago by the European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA). The charges were against Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar of Korea, and Intel of the US, which supplied memory chips manufactured by Korean companies that were bought by the EECA on behalf of Siemens, the German electronics group, an EECA representative said. Although the commission will not make the results of its investigation public until inquiries are completed, it said that discussions with the parties concerned over possible measures to be taken were being complicated as one of the Korean companies was disputing its findings. Meanwhile, Intel says that the commission has accepted that the US company was not involved in exporting the chips. The Korean anti-dumping case, which remains unresolved two years after the charges were brought, highlights the difficulty of trying to apply the outdated anti-dumping guidelines of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to an industry that is rapidly evolving. The EC's own anti-dumping regulations are based on Gatt guidelines, which are more than 20 years old. The case also underlines the dilemma that the commission faces over possible anti-dumping action as it attempts to balance the demands of Europe's semiconductor manufacturers and users. The Europeans claim that the Korean manufacturers have been selling dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMs) into the EC at prices lower than those charged in their home market. However, trying to determine whether dumping has occurred - according to Gatt guidelines - involves a very complicated and time-consuming process. 'The Gatt guidelines are old-fashioned and out of date,' says Mr Byron Harding at Dataquest, the high-tech market consultancy. They were set down 23 years ago when the electronics industry was very different. For example, manufacturers can now set up facilities throughout the world, making it very difficult in some cases to determine country of origin of products. The method the commission employs to determine dumping also leaves the findings open to debate, says Mr Harding. For example, the commission will consider even a 1 per cent price differential as substantial enough to determine that dumping has occurred. But a manufacturer could argue that a 1 per cent price differential was merely the result of a technical difference. While the options for action that are open to the commission are restricted by the Gatt guidelines, European users of semiconductors have been unhappy with the measures the EC has taken. These include imposing anti-dumping duties or obtaining voluntary undertakings not to sell products in the EC below a certain floor, or reference, price. These undertakings are backed by residual anti-dumping duties. In the latest anti-dumping case, the Commission suspended anti-dumping duties against 11 Japanese manufacturers which were accused of dumping DRAMs and erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs) in return for the Japanese agreeing reference prices. This was partly after consideration of the interests of European semiconductor users, a Commission official said, as imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese-made DRAMs would raise their costs and hurt their competitiveness. However, reference prices still add to the costs of European semiconductor users. Although DRAM prices have been falling in world markets for years they have been held up in Europe due to the Japanese DRAM reference price, Mr Harding says. For the Koreans, a Japanese reference price combined with aggressive marketing on their part, is likely to have helped to increase their share of the European market. Samsung for one raised its European market share by nearly 40 per cent last year. The share of Korean manufacturers of the worldwide 4-Megabit DRAM market also rose strongly last year to over 13 per cent from just under 5 per cent in 1990, according to Dataquest. Having to agree a reference price would therefore be a blow to the Koreans who will have to rethink their strategy and may even have to consider setting up a DRAM facility within the EC, says Mr Harding.</p>

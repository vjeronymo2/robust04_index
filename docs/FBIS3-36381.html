All these major events took place beyond Russia's boundaries  but were very closely linked to the Russian domestic political  life, Itogi host Yevgeniy Kiselev said.    The bloodiest tragedy of the civil war occurred in Bosnia  last week, where an explosion in the market place in Sarajevo  killed 68 people and injured nearly 200. According to Kiselev,  the event prompts an association with the tragic shot in  Sarajevo in 1914, which triggered off the first world war.    The attitude of the world community to the conflict in the  former Yugoslavia began to change radically lately, Itogi said.  Calls to lift the blockade of Sarajevo, besieged by the Serbs,  are becoming increasingly frequent, as well as calls to use  armed forces for the purpose. But some experts believe that the  use of the military could make the knot of the conflict still  tighter. Extremists are seeking to goad politicians into making  ill- considered decisions, Kiselev said.    The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its indignation at  the  act of terror in Sarajevo, Itogi said. The ministry said in a  statement that a prompt and impartial investigation should be  conducted immediately and those guilty should be punished  exemplarily, regardless of who they are.    Within the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian-  Georgian summit was undoubtedly the key event, Itogi said.  According to the ITV correspondent, who covered Boris Yeltsin's  trip to Tbilisi, it was "a strange visit", whose high-sounding  declarations left unanswered the key question about Russia's  strategy in the Caucasus.    ITV experts and presidential council members Emil Pain and  Andrannik Migranyan commented on the visit. The upshot of their  comments was summed up by Kiselev as follows: Many specialists  view the visit as Yeltsin's desire to extend personal support to  Eduard Shevardnadze.    During Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, twenty-five documents  were  signed. Of prime importance was the Treaty of Friendship,  Goodneighourliness and Mutual Assistance, the significance of  which was seen in different light by various political parties.    According to Sergey Shakhray, the preservation of the  Georgian state's integrity met Russia's strategic interests.  But Shakhray pointed out that the flame of the civil war in  Georgia could be extinguished only through the recognition of  the federal character of Georgia and the granting of more  autonomy to Abkhazia, Ajaria and Ossetia.    Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy criticised  the treaty caustically. "We do not have such a state as  Georgia," he said straightforwardly.    Russia's Choice Chairman Yegor Gaydar expressed concern over  the transfer of Russian arms to Georgia. He said these weapons  could be used to bolster the internal strife.    Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said this document  "can destabilise the situation in the entire Caucasus".    According to Pavel Felkengauer, an analyst for the newspaper  SEVODNYA, "Russia is more and more getting involved in conflicts  which it is unable to resolve. Russia's policy in the region is  undergoing continuous changes. Russia does not have a well-  thought-out military political conceptual framework for its  actions in the Caucasus."    The presidential elections in the Crimea, another major  event  last week, brought to power as the Crimean republic's first  president a pro-Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov. The  electoral campaign on the Crimean peninsula was accompanied by  "an unprecedented wave of crime," Kiselev said.    Yuriy Meshkov said in an interview directly after the  results  of the elections became known, that one of his first steps would  be to sign a trade and economic agreement with Russia and to  work towards a qualitative improvement of relations with Ukraine.    According to some experts, the results of the elections in  the Crimea have raised a question about the preservation of  Ukraine's territorial integrity and have posed a threat of  disintegration which can provoke a conflict on an unprecedented  scale.    Chairman of the Ukrainian Popular Movement Vyacheslav  Chernobyl declared that Ukraine "should not have permitted the  presidential elections in the Crimea. Former Ukrainian Prime  Minister Leonid Kuchma said "neither Moscow nor Kiev has any  reason for playing the Crimean card. Because any dispute  between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea would be tantamount  to the greatest tragedy".    A public opinion survey has revealed that 58 per cent of  those polled reject the possibility of a Russian-Ukainian  conflict over the Crimea, Itogi reported. Nonetheless, "The  tension is likely to increase in the triangle  Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol because of the growing nationalist  tendencies in the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia.    Itogi interviewed Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian  leader who was sacked by the parliament but said he did not  intend to leave the political arena. He said he pinned all his  hopes on the new elections. As concerns relations with Russia,  he said the parity of prices, above all those of energy  resources, was one of the chief aspects. "We are spending 14  per cent of our budget to clean up the effects of the Chernobyl  tragedy, while Russia is spending a mere 0.5 per cent. This is  not quite fair, if you see what I mean", Shushkevich said.    Itogi reported on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's trip to the former  Yugoslavia, during which he advocated the establishment of the  East- European community of all Slav peoples.    Voskresenye reported the celebrations of the 90th birthday  of  outstanding Russian test pilot Valeriy Chkalov, remembered in  Russia and the United States. One of his colleagues,  Colonel-General Baydukov recalled their flight across the North  Pole to the United States in the thirties.    Russia's chief prosecutor Anatoliy Kazannik appeared on  Voskresenye to talk about his recent visit to the Lefortovo  prison, where he met Ruslan Khasbulatov and others. "I felt  terribly sorry for these people," Kazannik said.</p>

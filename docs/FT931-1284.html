			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Belgium raises rates to protect franc BELGIUM'S central bank was forced to raise official interest rates yesterday to support the franc after the resignation of the coalition government triggered strong selling of the currency inside the European exchange rate mechanism. Belgian government bonds and share prices also came under pressure as financial markets remained uncertain about the future of the country's fragile ruling coalition and its commitment to reducing the looming budget deficit. King Baudouin was consulting senior politicians on whether to accept the resignation of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, and his centre-left coalition. Mr Dehaene offered to resign on Tuesday night after coalition partners failed to agree on how to bring the country's budget deficit into line with the economic criteria for European economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty. The Belgian national bank raised its central interest rate from 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent and its end-of-day rate from 9 per cent to 10 per cent to protect the Belgian franc as the currency weakened against the D-Mark. Belgium's central bank has an informal commitment to peg its currency closely to the D-Mark to underline its commitment to monetary union. The rate rises triggered support for the Belgian franc, which closed unchanged on the day at BFr20.62 against the D-Mark. The BEL-20 index of Belgium's largest stocks slipped by 9.41, less than 1 per cent, to 1,246.91, and the yield on government bonds opened higher and changed little during the day. Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, insists that all four government parties - Socialists and Christian Democrats from both sides of Belgium's language divide - are committed to reducing the deficit. Political analysts suggested he had offered to resign because he wanted to make all four parties realise the potential gravity of the dispute. The king is thought most likely to refuse the resignation offer and insist that the coalition partners reach a compromise on budget measures, which are aimed at raising BFr110bn (Pounds 2.3bn). But opposition parties called for new elections as soon as possible. Editorial Comment, Page 21 Currencies, Page 31</p>

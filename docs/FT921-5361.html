			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tories determined on Schools Bill THE GOVERNMENT is deter-mined to get the Schools Bill through parliament before the election in spite of the defeats in the Lords, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, said yesterday. Privately, ministers sounded unruffled by the setback. If they lost the bill, or this element of it, because of lack of time before the general election, an incoming Tory government could re-introduce it immediately afterwards. Mr Clarke was adamant that the bill would become law in a 'sensible, workable form', and emphasised that his priority was getting the parent's charter through, including performance league tables for schools. Peers decided on Monday night that the chief inspector of schools, rather than individual governing bodies, should decide who should carry out inspections and that local authorities should still be able to inspect schools they maintain. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was said to be 'disappointed' at the decisions. The government could try to overturn the defeats at the bill's report stage next Tuesday, or use the opportunity to dilute the involvement of the chief inspector. The provisional date for the final Lords stage is Monday March 16, but if an election was announced before then it could be taken earlier. Labour believes that it will benefit politically whatever ministers do. Either the government is defeated - through trying unsuccessfully to insist on its way or by having to compromise - or it is seen to be behaving high-handedly in pressing ahead with an unpopular policy.</p>

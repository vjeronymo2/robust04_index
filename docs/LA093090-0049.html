			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH FOOD SAMPLES LOADED WITH PESTICIDE RESIDUES  </P> <P> Health foods contain more pesticide residues than any other foods tested by the  Ministry of Agriculture, the ministry said Friday.  </P> <P> In a sampling of food available in health food stores and supermarkets, the  Ministry of Agriculture found that 60% of nuts, beans, seeds and legumes  contained traces of pesticides.  </P> <P> About half, or 51%, of the dried and semi-dried fruit contained pesticide  traces, it said.  </P> <P> The health foods sampled were not organically grown and many were imported,  said Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman, Christine Jude.  </P> <P> "With health foods like nuts, pastas and seeds, they are mainly non-U.K.  produced and in many cases they have quite a long journey," she said. "They are  fumigated to prevent them from rotting or becoming pest-infected."  </P> <P> The lowest level of pesticide residue was found in fresh fruits and vegetables  from regular grocery stores, which showed 20% containing traces of pesticides.  </P> <P> The pesticide traces found in the health foods were well within maximum residue  levels set by the government, Jude said. Of 4,000 food samples, 64% contained  no detectable traces of pesticides, the ministry said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised method of allocation, described in detail in the FY 1993 final rule published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669), allocates the LLW costs between two groups: large generators (power reactors and large fuel facilities), and small generators (all other LLW-producing licensees). Waste generators in the large group are each expected to generate more than 1,000 cubic feet of LLW per year. The allocation of LLW costs to the two groups is based on the historical average amount of waste disposed by the two groups. The result is that 82 percent and 18 percent of the costs are allocated to the large and small generator groups, respectively. Within each of the two groups, all licensees pay the same LLW fee (surcharge). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amounts of the surcharges for the two groups using the revised method for FY 1991 are shown in &sect;&sect;171.15(c)(3) and 171.16(f) of this final rule. For FY 1992, the amounts of the surcharges for the various fee categories using the FY 1993 method are shown in &sect;&sect;171.15(c)(4) and 171.16(g) of this final rule. The revised LLW surcharges for small generators of LLW are $1,400 for FY 1991 and $1,500 for FY 1992. The surcharge for FY 1991 is the same for small generators ($1,400) as that assessed in FY 1991. For FY 1992, the LLW surcharge of $1,500 is $100 less than the $1,600 paid by the small generators in FY 1992. The revised surcharges for large generators of LLW for FY 1991 and FY 1992 are $62,300 and $61,700, respectively. These surcharges are lower than the $143,400 and $155,100 paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992, respectively, by some large fuel facilities. Based on the FY 1993 LLW allocation method, the revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992 for operating power reactors and small fuel facilities (fee Category 1.A.(2)) are greater than those paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992. The increase will not be assessed because no additional charges established under this final rule (i.e., a later enacted rule) can be retroactively assessed due to applicable judicial precedent. However, refunds will be made for certain large generators because their fee burden is lower under the revised allocations. The amount of the refund for individual licensees will represent the difference between the amount paid under the previous rules and the revised amounts for FY 1991 and FY 1992. The NRC expects the refunds to the large generators to be made by June 30, 1994. For the approximately 1,000 small generators who paid a FY 1992 LLW surcharge, each will receive a $100 credit on their FY 1994 bill for cost effectiveness reasons. The total amount of the refunds and credits for both fiscal years is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million. If any entity no longer holds an NRC license, but is eligible for a refund or credit, it should write to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of the Controller, License Fee and Debt Collection Branch, Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Administrative Procedure Act: Waiver <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No additional charges will be assessed for FY 1991 and FY 1992; instead certain licensees are eligible to receive either refunds or credits based on the difference in the amount of the revised surcharges and the amounts initially paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992. To expedite the issuance of refunds and credits, the NRC has determined that good cause exists to waive the 30-day deferred effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). This final rule will therefore become effective immediately upon publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for the final regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

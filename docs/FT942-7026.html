			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Carlton quality turns off ITC: Attracting large audiences, even among ABC1s, will not always win praise The bitter row which broke out yesterday over the Independent Television Commission's severe criticisms of the largest ITV company, Carlton Television, can be symbolised by its attitude to two Carlton programmes. One, Hollywood Wives, the commission denounced as 'essentially glib and superficial' and the other, the documentary Thoi Noi, was described as 'an excellent picture of present-day Vietnam'. The Hollywood Wives series, which Carlton says won a higher proportion of ABC1 viewers than the South Bank Show arts programme, attracted an average of 10m viewers and a rating for one programme of 11.5m. Thoi Noi, which was shown in prime time, was watched by 3m people. A Carlton executive, who did not wish to be named, yesterday accused the ITC of being like King Canute in trying to hold back the tide of commercialism unleased by the Broadcasting Act 1990 with middle-class ideas of what constituted quality programming. The row over Hollywood Wives - the ITC did not like the editing into very short sequences - is likely to grow. The ITV Network Centre, also criticised by implication, has commissioned a four-part follow-up series called Hollywood Kids which has already been filmed at a cost of Pounds 1m and is due to be shown this autumn. The ITC gave Carlton considerable credit for its regional programmes and acknowledged that, after an uncertain start, its London News Network operation had had a successful first year. The commission reserved its main criticism for Carlton's network performance which was described as 'well below expectations'. It added the stinging verdict that, with some exceptions, the nationally shown programmes that appeared under the Carlton Television name were neither distinctive nor of noticeably high quality. The commission noted that Carlton had proposed supplying a total of 521 hours to the national ITV network in 1993 and only about 128 hours of new programmes had actually been transmitted. This had been partly because the Network Centre, rather than any individual company, decides what goes out on the network, and also because Thames Television, which lost its licence to Carlton, continues to make so many programmes for ITV as an independent producer. The ITC did praise Frank Stubbs Promotes and Carlton's Good Sex Guide, and children's programmes such as Old Bear Stories, though it noted that Dave Allen had caused concern on taste and decency grounds and said that The Big Story had been variable in quality and had covered no significant foreign stories. Overall the ITC said it wanted to see 'a significant improvement in 1994 and beyond' - a judgment not nearly so severe as the formal warning given to GMTV, the commercial breakfast station. Under the Broadcasting Act, the ITC lost its responsibilities as a broadcaster. It still has a legal duty to make sure ITV companies fulfil their licence obligations - one of which is to broadcast a range of high-quality programmes. The commission attack on Carlton makes clear it is prepared to criticise the quality of individual programmes. Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, said yesterday it would otherwise be very hard to define quality. The ITC has a variety of sanctions to back up its idea of quality and performance. It can fine an ITV company a maximum of 3 per cent of its annual revenue for a first offence and up to 5 per cent for a subsequent transgression. This could cost one of the bigger companies millions of pounds. The ITC can also shorten the licence held by any company and in extreme cases actually take it away and readvertise the franchise - though there was no sign yesterday of that being considered. There was turmoil at Carlton yesterday, and disagreement about how the company - which buys in most of its programmes from independent producers - should respond. Mr Paul Jackson, director of programmes in 1993 and now managing director of Carlton Television, said yesterday he had no intention of resigning. It is believed Mr Nigel Walmsley, the chairman, wanted to issue a conciliatory statement. In the event, the company's response was couched in more defiant terms. 'While we do not shy away from criticism, we regret that the ITC's review did not acknowledge the quality of the four films in Desmond Wilcox's series The Visit,' Carlton said. At last night's annual programme awards of the Royal Television Society, Margi Clark won the best female presenter's award for The Good Sex Guide and Old Bear Stories picked up the children's entertainment award for Carlton.</p>

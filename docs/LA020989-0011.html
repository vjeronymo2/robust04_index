			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVIVAL  </P> <P> Nicholas Daniloff makes a statement which has challenged me: " . . . The world  saw more clearly than before that Armenians are deeply emotional and possibly  paranoid. Like the Jews, they fear extinction" ("A Shock to the Soviet  Foundation; In Armenian Rubble, Moscow's Ethnic Problems Grow," Editorial Page,  Jan. 28.).  </P> <P> But isn't that "normal" and shouldn't anyone become deeply emotional and on  guard when their very existence, their identity is at stake? How else could  Armenians and Jews have survived despite their tumultuous histories? Why not  give credit where credit is due and salute those who survive with style?  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Major Gabor Nagy, deputy military attache at the Hungarian  Embassy in Bucharest, and (Jozsef Gotz), vice president of the  Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania [UDMR] in charge of  cultural and religious affairs, participated in a religious  service held at the Reformed Church of Sighetul Marmatiei.  Wreaths were laid today at commemorative plaques in Cluj-Napoca  in honor of two of the prominent figures of the revolutionary  events of 1848, Sandor Petofi and Nicolae Balcescu. Andras  Kelemen, secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  a delegation from the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest, and  several UDMR leaders participated in a festive meeting and a  gala show at the Targu Mures Palace of Culture tonight.    A religious celebration and wreath-laying ceremony took  place  at the Monument of the Martyr Szecklers in Targu Mures this  afternoon. The wreaths carried the emblem of the Hungarian  state as well as sashes with the colors of the Hungarian  national flag.    Gyorgy Tokay, UDMR deputy from Arad, addressed a ceremony  held at the Monument of the 13 Generals at the Arad Citadel. He  emphasized the worldwide historical significance of the freedom  won by the Hungarians in the wake of the 1848 revolution.  Wreaths were laid on behalf of UDMR-Arad branch, the Hungarian  Embassy to Bucharest, the Town Hall of Arad Municipality, the  Democratic Organization of Bulgarians from Arad, the German  Forum, and various Hungarian journalistic, cultural, and youth  organizations from Arad.    The series of UDMR actions pegged to the 1848-1849  revolution  concluded in Covasna County this afternoon. Wreaths were laid  at the monument in the center of Sfantu Gheorghe Municipality,  after which a commemorative show took place at the Little  Stadium. In this connection, Mr. Adrian Vlad Casunean, prefect  of Covasna County, told the press that in his opinion today's  actions are anomalies of a revanchist nature. Both in Targu  Secuiesc and Baraolt the demonstrators carried the Hungarian  flag; in Baraolt, the Romanian flag was covered with a black  ribbon in several instances. The Covasna prefect said that he  will ask the town halls and the police to take legal steps  against the UDMR organizers and he also emphasized that Law  60/1991 on organizing and holding public meetings should be  amended in order to avoid the repeat of such antinational  actions in the future.</p>

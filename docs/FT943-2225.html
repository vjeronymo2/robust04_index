			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Ronson could manage salvaged Heron: Investment group offers creditors cash or minority equity stake Holders of Pounds 378m of debt in Mr Gerald Ronson's property group Heron International were yesterday offered Pounds 142m in cash, or the chance of taking a stake in the group which could continue to be run by Mr Ronson. HNV Acquisition, which is controlled by US entrepreneur Steven Green and has Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Michael Milken's family trusts as backers, yesterday released details of an offer, which will give it at least 51 per cent of the group. This follows the collapse of the Pounds 1.4bn bank restructuring finalised last September. Mr Green has proposed that the day-to-day management continues under Mr Ronson's guidance and that he remains an executive director, but no employment terms have been agreed. The board of Heron said it was 'highly probable that failure to implement the proposed offers will result in receivership and/or the instigation of bankruptcy proceedings in some or all group companies'. Both the board and the company's bankers, have concluded from separate studies that the rewards of receivership would be substantially lower. Mr Basil Vasiliou, chairman of Vasiliou &amp; Company, which speaks for a large number of non-bank bondholders, welcomed the offer as 'extremely positive'. It follows what has effectively been a two-year receivership that has cost Heron about Pounds 50m. HNV is offering Pounds 450 or 300 HNVA shares for every Pounds 1,000 of senior debt, Pounds 60 cash or 40 shares for every Pounds 1,000 of junior debt, and Pounds 7.50 or five new shares per old Heron share. HNVA is committed to achieving a listing in the future, but the banks are likely to take cash, and Mr Green is expected to be left with at least 70 per cent of the company. The offer is conditional upon the approval of bondholders and all bank which provide facilities to any head office division of Heron, and also on waivers from the bankers to Heron Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which control around Pounds 200m of debt tied to Heron's more valuable assets. The majority of the HCP banks are similarly exposed to the parent company debt. Mr Green emerged from a small group of bidders to become the 'preferred buyer' last June, but the complexity of dealing with more than 80 banks has delayed progress. As one merchant banker involved said: 'It has been the devil's own job persuading all the sets of bankers that there was no leeway, that it was choice between this or liquidation.' HNVA will end up with a company with properties valued at Pounds 312.5m and a manageable debt structure, compared with its negative net value of Pounds 172m, in March 1994. Heron's only remaining operating business, Heron Motor Group, is up for sale. HNVA plans to subscribe for a Pounds 17m convertible debt issue, to provide further working capital, and has the right to increase this to Pounds 30m. The announcement was accompanied by Heron's profit figures for the year to March, in which the group made an operating loss of Pounds 6.8m, against a profit of Pounds 30.2m in 1992-93. The loss after exceptional items and taxation fell from Pounds 218.8m to Pounds 92.3m. The full offer document is expected to be released next month. The Heron board has agreed not to consider any other offer until November 30.</p>

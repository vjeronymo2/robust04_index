			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial  actions in Cuba between 25 April and 9 May.    Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 25 April reports that "state  enterprises have become the principal supply source for the  black market, not only because they handle the greatest quantity  of resources but because of their lack of control over the goods  for which they are responsible. To this we must add that there  are also authorities so corrupt that they are capable of  stealing raw materials and merchandise in order to supply the  underground economy with the sole purpose of enriching  themselves illegally and enjoying a lifestyle very greatly above  their real means." The report refers to theft from the Detergent  and Soap Enterprise, formerly Sabatez, in Cerro Municipality,  Havana City Province. The Crimes Against the Economy section of  the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit, upon learning  that detergent had been unloaded at a residence near the  enterprise, searched the home of Lazaro Ruiz Cutino, who has a  criminal record and a history of terrible social conduct, and  seized 40 sacks of detergent. Four enterprise workers -- a  warehouse inspector, warehouse chief, and two loader operators  -- had stolen the detergent through the negligence of the  production area's brigade chief in transporting the sacks to the  warehouse.    The radio notes: "In certain thefts of merchandise that have  occurred at state enterprises, police investigators have  verified participation in crimes on the part of people in  positions of responsibility, to the sole end of illegally  increasing their personal wealth." The seven citizens arrested  had shared 50,000 pesos for the stolen detergent. They will be  tried for the crime of serious theft. The detergent was  recovered and the money seized from the defendants was turned  over to the court.    Radio Progreso Network at 1100 GMT on 9 May reports that two  men were arrested for trying to steal five arrobas of potatoes  to sell on the black market. The men, Ignacio Andres Gorrero,  manager of a grocery store that sells agricultural products, and  Faustino Paz Cabrera, driver of the municipal harvesting  company, were caught by the police, who recovered a portion of  the stolen potatoes. The driver had already dropped off over  five quintals of potatoes at the grocery store in question, to  be sold by the corrupt administrator at six pesos per pound.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK heading for clash over California tax BRITAIN and the US are heading towards a confrontation in the long-running dispute over California's system for taxing foreign companies. The British government still wants to resolve the issue in talks with the US administration, but Mr John Major, the prime minister, is under mounting pressure from backbench MPs and from business to take a much tougher line. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, was due to raise the issue in Washington last night with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary. British critics complain that the government has lost credibility and must order immediate retaliation against US companies if it is to be taken seriously in negotiations. Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on trade and industry, has warned that the Clinton administration's 'appalling' decision not to file a brief in support of Barclays Bank, whose suit is the test case on California's system of taxation, 'leaves the British government with no credible option but immediately to retaliate'. Mr Major is also understood to have been advised by his diplomats to set the clock running on a threat of retaliation. California's system of worldwide unitary taxation assesses taxes on companies not on the profits they actually make in the state, but on a proportion of their worldwide earnings. Barclays has won several rounds in its 10-year legal battle, but lost most recently in the California Supreme Court. It stands one more chance of having that decision reversed in the US Supreme Court. Past US administrations have always supported Barclays' position, on the grounds that the California law interferes with tax treaties signed by the federal government with other countries. But President Bill Clinton is understood to have decided to back California, motivated largely by worries about the state's budget crisis. The state, which faces a Dollars 8.6bn budget deficit next year, claims it stands to lose Dollars 800m if the decision goes against it, including taxes it would have to repay Barclays and others. In 1985 the UK passed a law authorising retaliation, but has never triggered it. Sir Michael claims that the US has ceased to believe in that threat.</p>

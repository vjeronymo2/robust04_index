			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / ICI will announce split and Pounds 1bn rights issue today IMPERIAL Chemical Industries will today announce it intends to carry out the biggest restructuring in UK corporate history by splitting itself into two separately listed companies and raising Pounds 1bn through a rights issue. The new money will be raised through a newly created company, Zeneca, containing ICI's pharmaceutical operations, confounding the widespread rumours that ICI itself would make the rights issue. Following a board meeting held yesterday to finalise the details of the demerger, the group will today say it intends to give shareholders one Zeneca share for each ICI share they currently hold. Investors will also be asked to subscribe for additional Zeneca shares, to raise about Pounds 1bn. That could make the deal the second biggest rights issue in UK corporate history, lagging behind the 1987 BP issue. The demerger and money-raising process is likely to take a couple of months. It will be orchestrated by SG Warburg, the group's financial adviser. Warburg decided that the most efficient way to raise Pounds 1bn was through Zeneca. However, before the demerger, Zeneca will inject an equivalent sum into the rump of ICI, so that this traditional chemicals business can prosper during the recessionary trading conditions. Brokers are forecasting that Zeneca will make pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 500m in the current year and that ICI profits would be less than half that level. ICI and its advisers are braced for criticism from some of its shareholders about the proposal to demerge, so they have prepared a detailed marketing campaign. The most widespread concern in the City is that Zeneca is not quite big enough to compete with the world's biggest drug companies. The company has been contemplating a demerger for almost two years. In July, it announced plans to split, but since then doubts have emerged in the City about whether it was possible. But ICI's executives, led by the chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, and the chief operating officer, Mr Ronnie Hampel, have been debating the plan in great detail with the non-executives, who include Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank. Yesterday a board meeting at the group's London headquarters gave approval for the demerger to go ahead. ICI will also disclose its 1992 results today. Brokers believe that its pre-tax profits fell last year to around Pounds 550m, compared with Pounds 843m in the previous year. However, the group is expected to maintain its dividend. Its share price rose yesterday from Pounds 10.74 to Pounds 10.82, valuing the group at Pounds 7.73bn.</p>

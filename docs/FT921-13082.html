			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Appointments: North South divide When Michael Cleary and Bob Burns, managers of and shareholders in Kembrey, a Swindon-based electrical components manufacturer, promised institutional investors an exciting time as they introduced the company for a full stock exchange listing in 1990, they had hardly bargained for the excitement they delivered. In a deal completed at 2.30 am yesterday morning, Cleary, ousted as chief executive in an apparent boardroom coup at the beginning of December, and Burns, who resigned as chairman earlier in the year over strategy differences, clawed their way back into the driving seat of the company the two had originally secured in a management buy-in during 1986. Each had held onto their respective 13 per cent stakes in Kembrey during the upheaval in the hope of making a comeback. While Cleary is once again chief executive, Burns returns as a director, and a new non-executive chairman will be found shortly. The seeds of discord had been sown following the reversal of Kembrey at the end of 1989 into Coated Electrodes, then a struggling USM-quoted company. Alan Hinchcliffe, who was operations director of Kembrey but had previously been chief executive of Coated Electrodes in Sheffield, and Robert Jakeways, previously a Coated Electrodes director who had been acting chairman for some months after Burns' departure, resigned yesterday from the Kembrey board. So did David Frith, who had been chairman for exactly seven weeks. Frith has a Sheffield business in the unrelated field of scientific ovens. While cagey as to the precise details of the upheaval, Cleary acknowledged a 'clash of personalities'.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS' BURRIDGE CHECKS SLUMPING KINGS WITH 3 GOALS  </P> <P> As part of a checking line assigned to stop Wayne Gretzky, Boston's Randy  Burridge put on a memorable offensive show.  </P> <P> Burridge scored three goals for his first National Hockey League hat trick and  assisted on another Thursday night as the Bruins beat the slumping Kings, 4-1,  for Coach Terry O'Reilly's 100th career victory.  </P> <P> Burridge got his first career hat trick as goalie Reggie Lemelin, playing in  his 400th NHL game, had 18 saves, including a spectacular dive to stop Gretzky  on a third-period breakaway.  </P> <P> The Bruins outshot Los Angeles, 32-19, in extending their home record against  the Kings to 11-0-1 since Jan. 24, 1981. In their last 10 games overall, the  Kings are 1-7-2. The loss dropped the Kings into third place in the Smythe  Division, one point behind Edmonton.  </P> <P> "I guess I was lucky, particularly on the third goal that hit me and went into  the empty net," said Burridge, who is in his second full NHL season.  </P> <P> "Andy Brickley was covering Gretzky most of the time and that enabled Greg  Johnston and I to go two-on-two a lot down low," Burridge said. "It worked out  very well. I'm really happy.  </P> <P> "I've never had a hat trick with the Bruins, so I never think of things like  that. Then, after the second goal, I thought things were going my way. It  turned out they certainly were."  </P> <P> Johnston also scored while Gretzky, covered by Ken Linseman and Craig Janney at  times on multiple shifts, managed just three shots on goal while going  scoreless for only the fifth time in 54 games this season.  </P> <P> "Boston played better than us," said Steve Kasper, traded by the Bruins to the  Kings on Jan. 27. "Boston played a game I know they're capable of playing. They  forechecked really well, and they really limited our offensive chances."  </P> <P> Lemelin, beaten for six goals in the NHL All-Star Game Tuesday night, was on  the verge of handing Los Angeles its first shutout of the season. However, his  bid for his 10th career shutout was spoiled by John Tonelli's score midway  through the third period.  </P> <P> Tonelli took a pass from Doug Crossman, skated down his left wing, eluded a  Boston check and fired his 28th goal past Lemelin.  </P> <P> Greg Johnston took the puck from goalie Glenn Healy behind the net to set up  Burridge at 4:03 of the first period. Johnston passed to Burridge, who scored  his 14th goal into an empty net.  </P> <P> The Bruins made it 2-0 as Johnston tipped in a pass from Burridge for his fifth  goal.  </P> <P> Tonelli pulled the Kings to within 2-1 at 10:49 of the third period, but  Burridge struck back less than 3 minutes later, sending a 15-foot shot over  Healy's glove.  </P> <P> Then, after Healy had been pulled for a sixth skater, Burridge got his third  goal when John Carter's shot deflected off his skate into an unguarded net.  </P></p>

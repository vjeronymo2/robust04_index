			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Overseas posting I AM an officer in British Army on the Rhine and I am treated as resident for tax purposes. My wife has no job and will be here for several tax years. Her unearned income from building society accounts in the UK exceeds her personal allowance. Is she allowed to open an 'overseas' account that would pay interest gross? If so, would such a course alter her entitlement to a personal allowance for UK income, and my entitlement to the married couple's allowance. The tax office say an overseas account is 'inappropriate' but I cannot pin them down to whether it is allowed. While we cannot give investment advice (in view of the Financial Services Act 1986), we invite your wife to consider whether it would not be more convenient for her to move her accounts offshore, say to the Channel Islands or to the Isle of Man. The administrative burden which the Inland Revenue is imposing on UK building societies and banks with members and depositors who are nor ordinarily resident in the UK makes it increasingly unattractive for anyone who is living overseas to keep their account in the UK. You will no doubt have seen reports that some UK building societies are already telling their overseas members and depositors to take their business elsewhere. Although others have offshore associates happy to take over the provision of account facilities for a) overseas depositors and b) UK depositors who, for example, want to receive untaxed interest rather than to wait for tax refunds (with consequent loss of interest). The location of your wife's accounts etc does not affect your entitlement to the married couple's allowance. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

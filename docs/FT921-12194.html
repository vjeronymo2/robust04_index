			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Pressure rises over who must pay: The row over gas-fired power plants UP TO 30 unnecessary gas-fired power stations are being builtin what is known as the dash for gas - and the electricity consumer will have to pay for them. That argument has been advanced repeatedly during meetings of the Commons energy committee this month. It contradicts the view of Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, that the new stations springing up since electricity privatisation are a sign of competition. In December Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said the new gas-fired power stations were of second-rate design and wasted energy. The Coalfield Communities Campaign has said the stations were unnecessary because there was surplus generating plant. They would force competitive coal stations out of the market. British Coal told the energy committee that existing coal stations, fitted with scrubbers to meet environmental standards, could produce electricity as cheaply as 2.2p a unit. The new gas-fired power stations would produce at 2.9p a unit, British Coal estimated. MPs took those arguments seriously and asked Mr Wakeham whether electricity consumers would end up paying for the new stations. They believed that might happen because many of the 12 regional electricity companies had signed long-term contracts with the new stations. That would mean that even if the stations could not compete in the electricity pool - wholesale market - the regional companies would be bound to buy their power and would then pass the cost to the customer. If so, Mr Wakeham said, the regional companies would be breaching their licences, which oblige them to buy electricity for consumers 'economically'. His remarks did little to settle the row over whether the stations are economic. So far, 11 projects have signed gas deals and look likely to go ahead, and a further four are optimistic that they will do so. Others are embryonic or are temporarily frozen by planning constraints or a shortage of gas at the right price. The regional electricity companies fiercely defend the competitiveness of the power they will buy from the new stations, and argue that British Coal's figures make no sense. Mr Gregory Fenby-Taylor, power purchasing manager for Norweb, which signed a deal with Lakeland Power, which in November became the first independent project to come on stream, says: 'If anyone offered me a 2.2p contract I'd take it - but believe me, there's no such beast.' Mr Richard Stubbs, a director of Lakeland Power, says: 'I don't think you'd get a regional company to sign a deal at 2.9p.' The regional companies say that prices from the new stations are more likely to be close to 2.75p a unit, the price at which Nuclear Electric sold power contracts recently. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, told the energy committee last week that Killingholme, south Humberside, his new gas-fired station, would produce electricity at 2.5p a unit, compared with 4.5p for the old coal-fired plant it would replace. Critics say that power stations that signed gas deals after British Gas increased its prices, on the so-called LTI 3 pricing schedule, will have to sell their electricity for more if they are to make decent returns. Some say they may produce electricity at more than 3p a unit. A consultant to several new gas station projects says: 'I would say at LTI 3 you are getting to an electricity price level of close to 3p, as high as anyone expects the pool price to be.' He and others point out that other factors, such as the site of the project, and the efficiency of the plant, can also influence its economics. Since no one can predict what the pool price will be in 15 years, it is hard to tell exactly which of the new stations will be competitive. That question will only begin to be answered in mid-century, when several should be running and bidding into the electricity pool. Meanwhile, Mr Wakeham faces two more difficult questions. The first, from those who believe gas is a good idea, is why the government is dragging its feet over allowing imported gas into the UK - it has insisted on tying imports to exports. The second question, from the coal and environmental lobbies, is whether he believes the electricity market is making the right investment decisions. They argue that not only is the market's half-hourly price system an inadequate way of deciding what kind of fuel and plant Britain will need in the long term, but the new gas-fired stations are indifferent even to that system because they have signed long-term contracts.</p>

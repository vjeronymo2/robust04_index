			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Averyanov article under the "Pacifism" rubric: </F> "There May Be No Next Call-Up Unless There Is a Law on  Alternative Service"]    [Text] The legal vacuum in the sphere of alternative  service for induction-age youth threatens trouble for the  Russian Armed Forces. Under the Constitution, "every citizen of  the Russian Federation, if his convictions in the matter of  faith contradict with military service.... has the right to  substitute it with an alternative civil service." (Article 59,  Item 3).    In the meantime there is still no law on alternative service  (as, naturally, there is no alternative service itself), and any  youth of draft age may turn to the president and demand that his  constitutional rights be observed, and demand the right not to  serve at all because "objectors" protected by the Constitution  are not called up today for alternative service. If things  continue this way, the number of those wanting to capitalize on  the "flawed" legislation may snowball by the time of the autumn  draft.    The State Duma committees on public organizations and  defense  have prepared two alternative drafts on alternative service.  The man in charge of the first one, Vitaliy Savitskiy, chairman  of the subcommittee on religious organizations and cochairman of  the Russian Christian Democratic Union, said on his arrival in  St. Peterburg that an agreement has been reached with Defense  Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov to merge both drafts -- the  result would be passed on to the Duma for consideration. But  how does one combine them when they differ in their approach  right from the start? For example, the draft Mr. Savitskiy is  in charge of and which was developed by a group led by Anatoliy  Pchelintsev, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, and  Vladimir Rikhovskiy, director of the Christian Juridical Center,  is remarkable for a much more liberal approach.    It is doubtful that the "defense people" will easily agree  with the articles of their "rivals'" draft, but Mr. Savitskiy  looks to the future with optimism: The Defense Committee, whose  draft he thinks looks "rather raw," is simply up the creek. A  further non-passage of the law may simply result in a disruption  of the autumn draft on quite legal grounds, let us note. All  this makes the Defense Committee work together with the authors  of the first draft if only it nears the main goal -- the passing  of the law as soon as possible.    If the new committees really manage to produce a joint  draft,  it is not ruled out that the law on alternative service would be  passed by the Duma rather quickly. Those in the Defense  Committee realize that procrastination is fraught with a  disruption of the new draft for an army which is thinning out as  it is, whereas the committee on relations with religious  organizations hopes that, in addition to everything else, the  new law would humanize the army. "With its passage the army  chiefs would have to try and see that the horrors of military  service do not make draftees seek alternative service," the  subcommittee head, Mr. Savitskiy, thinks. "Conditions of army  service should not be worse that working in hospitals, and then  the only ones who would try to get into the ranks of alternative  servicemen would be those who cannot take up arms for their  convictions."</p>

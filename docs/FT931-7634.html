			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium and platinum prices suffer 'body blow' JAPANESE SPECULATORS, whose buying recently sent the price of palladium soaring to its highest level for 32 months changed their minds yesterday and their panicky attempts to sell sent the metal's price plummeting. Palladium, one of the platinum group metals and used mainly in consumer electrical goods and as a dental alloy, fell in London by Dollars 7.90 to close last night at Dollars 101.10 a troy ounce. Speculators had driven the price from Dollars 85 to Dollars 119 an ounce on fears of production difficulties in Russia, which supplies about half the world's palladium. Yesterday's panic selling was triggered partly by carefully-timed statements from some big Japanese car companies last week. They told the Reuter news agency that, because their production was falling, not only did they not need Russian platinum group metals, they might even sell some of their present surplus. The car companies are more interested in platinum than palladium - only 12 per cent of palladium sales are used for anti-pollution car catalysts whereas 40 per cent of platinum is used this way - so the platinum price has also been falling fast - by Dollars 8.50 an ounce last week. Yesterday it closed in London at Dollars 348.50, down Dollars 10.75 from Friday's close . The palladium price had been weakening on the Reuters' report but the trickle became a flood yesterday after the yen strengthened against the US dollar, the currency in which palladium is traded internationally. 'When the yen price started to fall because of the dollar's weakness, speculators tried to sell. But there is no physical demand for palladium so the price fell even faster,' said one trader. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that the Russians had consistently maintained that their exports recently were delayed by administrative tangles and bureaucracy. Palladium was a by-product of Russia's nickel production and the country had little use for it. 'So we must assume they have ample stocks and their explanation is credible.' He said the car companies' statements came as 'a body blow to bullishness'. Mr Smith said the palladium price was still indicating that supplies were tight. There was a premium for metal for immediate delivery and the cost of leasing palladium was very high at 10 per cent. 'There is a mysterious squeeze on the market,' he said.</p>

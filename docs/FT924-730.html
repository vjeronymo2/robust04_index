			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices surge to fresh 13-month highs WORLD COFFEE prices surged yesterday as New York's March arabica contract pushed decisively through the 80 cents a lb barrier in heavy early trading. Late yesterday the March contract was trading at 81.75 cents a lb, more than 2 cents ahead, with some observers looking for 85 cents ahead of the Christmas break. In London, the March robusta contract closed at Dollars 1,067 a tonne - a 13-month peak. Sentiment has turned bullish in the coffee markets on expectations of a lower crop in Brazil and a tightness in Colombian exports. Brazilian exports for 1992 are expected to be down 17 per cent at 16.3m bags (60 kg each), and to fall further to 14.4m bags next year. However, strong resistance to the 80 cents barrier halted a recent run of prices. Once that level was breached, New York commission houses started buying heavily. 'There has been no sign of origin selling today,' said one London trader who would be 'very surprised' if the New York market fell back below 80 cents. Ms Judith Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said the market had made a 'very strong, very orderly move' through an important psychological barrier. 'We could begin to see this market really pick up momentum,' she added.</p>

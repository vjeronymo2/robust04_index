			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: Intrepid impro and talent - Glasgow Jazz Festival Glasgow itself may not be the most prepossessing of places, but it knows how to put on a jazz festival. For the first ten days of July corners of the old merchant city like the Old Fruit Market and the Ramshorn Kirk as well as its innumerable friendly bars and cafes, resound to a canny mix of local mainstream talent, intrepid impro and big budget, sure fire sell-outs. This year we had the extraordinary reeds and bagpipes partnership of Dick Lee and Hamish Moore occupying the same stand on different days as experimentalist Lol Coxhill. Hardy perennials BB King and Al Green mingled with hard-as-they-come boppers Horace Silver and Max Roach. Like all proper festivals, Glasgow has a composer in residence. This year's choice, altoist Bobby Watson, is at first an unusual one coming after grand strategists George Russell and Carla Bley. But Watson is an accomplished arranger - he was musical director of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers - and is someone who can juggle several projects at one time. Glasgow was clever enough to get the lot: the 29th Street Saxophone Quartet, Horizon and also Watson as featured soloist with the Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra. On top of that Taylor Made, a seventeen piece conjunction of 29th Street and Horizon, performed a suite commissioned by the Scottish Art Council. Afroisms - The Spoken Word, a series of sweet running movements which reflected the composer's key influences, featured swooning horns and bright toned solo spots from trumpeter Melton Mustafa to baritone saxist Jim Hartog. Watson, wiry and angular in appearance as in alto technique, maintained momentum with his (apparently) breathless and beseeching choruses. Earlier in the day, a collective breath of the Fruit Market was being taken away by the live guitar playing of Martin Taylor's Spirit of Django, a return to the group's setting for the virtuoso guitarist. It is impossible not to be hypnotised by Taylor on Reinhard - his links with the gypsy guitarist are strong through a long association with Stephane Grappelli. Accompanied by John Goldie on rhythm guitar and Alec Dankworth on acoustic base guitar (not a base fiddle as is usual for 'Danktone') and the mellifluous tenor sax of Dave O'Higgins, Taylor's treatment of classics like 'Nuages' and 'Minor Swing' is transcendental. Look out for a new album in October on Linn Records. In the dark of the Ramshorn Kirk a different kind of meditative exploration was going on. Clarinettist, saxophonist Tony Coe and pianist John Horler are two of our best but most illusive musicians. Putting them together for an hour or two of sparse, gentle invention demonstrates inspired programming. Coe, looking deceptively shambolic in his old cardigan, has a blue, burred tenor sound and an intelligent, sneaky way with the clarinet that hooks the listener and won't let go. Horler, missing an E flat on the keyboard, sprinkled gold into improvised standards such as 'Blue N'Green'. That duo's sympathetic insinuation was a far cry from the bombardment put up by Herbie Hancock's new band at the Royal Concert Hall. Keyboards are a strong feature of the Glasgow Fest with Ahmad Jamal, Horace Silver, Joe Zawinul and Bheki Mseleku all at the ivories at sometime. Hancock, the Water Melon Man, had three playing simultaneously in his highly funked outfit. Heavily electronic, crushingly percussive new material from Dis is da drum sees Hancock returning to pop territory. The pianist has always had an ear for the deep groove and his tunes of 30 years back are sampled by today's hip-hoppers. Now he plays them at their own game using samples to beef up his own afro-Latin sizzlers. In keeping with the mood of the moment the new numbers take no prisoners, but where Hancock's playing could be disinterred from the rhythm overkill, it sparkled still.</p>

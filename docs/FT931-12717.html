			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Big Three may act over car imports THE Big Three US car makers yesterday threatened to file 'unfair trade' cases in order to get stiff dumping duties imposed on all Japanese cars. Mr Steve Harris, a Chrysler spokesman, said the companies had long been monitoring the pricing practices of Japanese companies. However, a final decision on whether to go ahead had not yet been taken. 'At the very least, the situation is unfair,' he said. 'If we determine that it is also a violation of US laws, we will take appropriate action.' The New York Times reported yesterday that the car makers had already decided to bring dumping action against all car imports. Mr Harris said they were 'not looking closely' at filing cases against European producers. Since the election of President Bill Clinton, the Big Three have been considering various strategies which they believe are now possible in a more receptive climate. They were the only industry group received by the president in Little Rock during the transition. At the time industry officials said they wanted to ensure that the president fulfilled his campaign promise to raise import tariffs on Japanese mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. But clearly wider action against imports was under consideration. Company spokesmen yesterday were emphasising the 'chronic' US motor trade imbalance with Japan. They said even US-produced Japanese cars contained only 40-50 per cent US parts - the equivalent of another Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m) in imports. 'The Japanese have to address this problem,' said Mr Al Chambers, director of corporate communications for Ford Motor Company. 'The fact that they maintain these imbalances year after year means they are not acting like good trading partners.' The car companies could have much to gain from dumping suits, according to Mr Jim Bovard, a trade expert and author of The Fair Trade Fraud. Although the suits will cost the car companies millions of dollars, it is easy to prove dumping in the US. 'Almost everything is dumping,' he said. 'Normal business practices are considered unfair dumping.' Whereas foreign companies are assigned an 8 per cent profit margin in the calculations, 'the Big Three have lost lots of money and that's legal'. Sales of US-made cars and light trucks are running above last year's levels.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats extends offer after only 0.69% acceptance COATS VIYELLA, the textile group which is in the throes of a Pounds 194m hostile bid for Tootal, announced yesterday that it was extending its offer after receiving acceptances representing 0.69 per cent of its target's ordinary shares. Coats, which already owns 85.65m ordinary shares, or 29.41 per cent of Tootal's equity, has received acceptances for a further 2.02m shares. It also has acceptances for 3.67m (62.35 per cent) of the preference shares. This means the level of acceptances received by Coats from Tootal shareholders has fallen slightly since the previous closing date. Tootal yesterday issued a statement claiming this meant its arguments were 'winning the day'. The Pounds 194m bid has effectively been put on ice until May 10 while the Office of Fair Trading considers whether to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Tootal may then issue additional information, such as a profits forecast, and Coats could mount a second offer. Tootal's shares were unchanged at 76p yesterday, still higher than Coats' offer of 65p cash. Coats' shares slipped 2p to 137p.</p>

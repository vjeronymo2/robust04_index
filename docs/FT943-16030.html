			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Associated Nursing at Pounds 2.3m Associated Nursing Services' nil-paid rights shares fell 1 1/2 p to a low of 3 1/2 p yesterday as the nursing homes operator announced figures for the year to March 31, writes David Wighton. Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.58m), slightly ahead of the estimate that accompanied the Pounds 10m rights issue last month. Turnover rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.9m). The existing shares have fallen back to the rights issue price of 255p and were unchanged on the figures. The issue, which closes on July 19, was fully underwritten by Henry Ansbacher. Dr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said occupancy rates recovered quickly from the disruption caused by the implementation of Care in the Community with owned homes averaging 93 per cent last year and now running at 94 per cent. The joint venture homes, where a number of extensions were built during the year, averaged 90 per cent. The homes division increased operating profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.95m with average fees rising by 3.5 per cent. A final dividend of 1.5p is recommended, making a total of 2p (1p), payable from earnings of 17.5p (14.3p) per share. The rights issue cash will be used to fund the group's continued expansion beyond this year although it intends that most of its new homes will be developed with existing and new joint venture partners. The group plans to move from the USM to the main market later this month.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television The BBC used to be very supercilious about running comedies in tandem; it was considered rampant commercialism and unimaginative. Now here is BBC1 running three comedies with only the Nine O'Clock News to break them up. Waiting For God is Michael Aitkens' excellent series, set in a retirement home where the inmates include Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden, a tremendously strong pairing. Will that continue now that they are sharing quarters? One Foot In The Grave (9.30) concentrates upon the same age group, though Victor and Margaret Meldrew live in their own home. Today's repeated episode is the one where Victor turns to the phone book for help over the hole at the bottom of his garden. Absolutely Fabulous is another repeat, transferring from BBC2. Jennifer Saunders plays a manic PR woman in the fashion industry and Joanna Lumley effortlessly steals every scene. (10.00). BBC2 shows what it is like to be a comedian in A Stand-Up For Life. American Al Lubel gave up his job as a lawyer in order to become a comic (9.30).</p>

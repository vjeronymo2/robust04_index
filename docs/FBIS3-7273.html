Considering the role and importance of the Pailin area in  the  fields of politics, psychology, economics, and foreign affairs,  and in a spirit of high responsibility for the destiny of the  population in general and of the entire Cambodian people, the  Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has decided to make the  Pailin area a development zone.    With this noble goal, along with preparations to organize  various tasks, the RGC has the honor to issue the following  official statement.    1. Concerning the army officers and men who are currently  still under the Khmer Rouge leadership, the RGC continues to pay  attention to their destiny, rights, freedom, and interests, that  is, by the royal government issuing successive appeals.    Therefore, Khmer Rouge officers and men who have been  dispersed in the Pailin area, please hurry and show yourselves  to the KRAF and relevant authorities present in the area. You  will receive attention and protection for your lives, rights,  interests, position, and role -- the same as the royal  government has given thousands of former officers and men who  have awakened and joined the royal government.    2. Concerning any compatriots who have been threatened and  forced by the Khmer Rouge to go with them, the royal government  is paying considerable attention to your difficult and arduous  life. Please endeavor to solve the problem in line with the  royal government's appeal issued on 4 March 1994, namely get in  touch with the KRAF in order to free yourselves from the grip of  the Khmer Rouge group. The royal government will set up  relevant authorities to receive you and organize appropriate  living conditions for you by legally granting you land and  housing.    3. As for compatriots who have fled to live temporarily on  the territory of the Kingdom of Thailand, the RGC will directly  get in touch with the representative of the Royal Thai  Government to accept you back to the territory of the Cambodian  motherland. For those compatriots who want to continue living  in the Pailin area or who want to change to other places, the  RGC will do all it can to accommodate your wishes.    In this respect, the RGC would like to welcome various  international organizations, such as the HCR [High Commission  for Refugees] and the International Committee of the Red Cross,  who have volunteered to provide assistance to the RGC.    4. As for Thai companies and investors who signed business  contracts with the Khmer Rouge group in the Pailin area, the RGC  would like to solemnly inform them that the RGC will genuinely  guarantee their interests by recognizing their rights in the  contracts in the event that the owners of these companies (?put  forward proposals) to the RGC. The RGC hopes, and is firmly  convinced, that the royal government will receive a welcome and  wide support and assistance from national and international  public opinion for the this noble cause.    [Signed] First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh    Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 25 March 1994</p>

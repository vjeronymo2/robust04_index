			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Unified Budget brings discipline to cabinet negotiations - The new system helped the Treasury claw back power and prestige within Whitehall Until this week Britain's new unified Budget had a generally bad press. The decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, to combine public spending and revenue decisions in one Budget late in the year, in place of the Autumn Statement on spending and the March Budget covering taxation, was criticised on several counts. Many commentators, seeing government spending plans seemingly cast in stone for three years at a cabinet meeting in July, condemned the new system for apparently failing to allow debate within the cabinet on the relative merits of spending and taxation. There were fears that the new Budget could dampen consumer confidence ahead of Christmas and, in current conditions, put recovery at risk. Some Tory politicians, doubtless remembering past glories, argued that a November Budget destroyed the possibility at some point in the future of the government announcing big tax hand-outs and calling a snap spring election. But yesterday, as the Treasury dusted itself down after the exertions of Tuesday, both Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, said the unified Budget had helped cut public spending below previously planned totals in the two coming financial years. Talking to journalists, Mr Clarke admitted that he 'had a slight change of mind' about the prospects for cutting public spending after taking over as chancellor in May. His first reaction was that the pre-set control totals for 1994-95 and 1996-96 were so tough that it was an achievement to win cabinet support for them in July. As the autumn unfolded it became clear that it might be possible to cut them further. Mr Clarke said that putting tax and spending together into the same Budget 'had a big effect' in winning cabinet support. Although negotiations on spending and taxation did not take place together, the unified Budget created a 'context' in which spending ministers were aware that tax increases would be a necessary alternative to any failure to control spending. 'It got lower expectations into the system,' the chancellor said. Mr Portillo said that the unified Budget, combined with the process of negotiating changes to spending plans within a control total that could not be breached, built 'a very strong collective willpower' among cabinet members on the need for spending cuts. Discipline had 'become a habit', he said. However, Mr Clarke's ability to cut next year's control total by Pounds 3.6bn to Pounds 251.3bn and lop Pounds 1.5bn off the 1995-96 control total to Pounds 263bn also owed much to the way the negotiations were carried out between the Treasury and spending departments. The chancellor began the Budget process at the end of July when, at a meeting with Treasury ministers and senior officials at the government's grace-and-favour mansion at Dorneywood, he determined to cut the PSBR by a 'substantial' proportion of GDP. This decision guided the Treasury in its negotiations with the spending departments. As the talks progressed it became apparent to the Treasury that the overall numbers for tax revenues and spending were moving in relation to each other, enabling Messrs Clarke and Portillo to push down the control total for 1994-95. They arrived at the final figure for next year's control total after refusing to allow any transfer to departmental budgets from the Pounds 7bn contingency reserve originally budgeted for the coming financial year. 'The public spending was conducted as a zero-sum game without recourse to the reserve,' commented one official. When the Treasury halved the reserve for 1994-95 to Pounds 3.5bn, the Pounds 3.5bn of funds that were liberated were available to cut the control total. This year's spending round was completed by the end of October, leaving Mr Clarke a month to draw up his final tax plans. The government's spending plans, unlike its tax measures, were settled through a process in which the chancellor and the chief secretary shared power with other senior ministers in the EDX cabinet committee chaired by Mr Clarke. But the final outturn, with the control totals cut from previous levels, will have clawed back for the Treasury some of the power and prestige within Whitehall that was lost in September last year when Britain was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism. In these circumstances, Messrs Clarke and Portillo are unlikely to tamper with the system of the unified Budget, which they believe helped the Treasury achieve this success.</p>

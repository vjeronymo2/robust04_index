The enemy's prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, today toured the  occupied border region. He met in Marj 'Uyun barracks with  Antoine Lahd, commander of the agent militia, and a number of  his military commanders.    Radio Voice of the South, the mouthpiece of Lahd's South  Lebanese Army, carried a statement by Rabin in which he  insinuated that peace with Lebanon will come after the  resistance is eliminated, particularly Hizballah; after the  Lebanese Government proves its ability to maintain security  north of the border area for six months; and after the soldiers  and officers of Lahd's militia are absorbed in the Lebanese  Army, as Rabin put it.</p>

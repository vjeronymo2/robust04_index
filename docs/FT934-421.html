			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors regain that ring of confidence It has been a great year for UK stock market investors. But how did it match up to our monthly director confidence ratio? From January to June, directors showed little interest in acquiring their own shares - indeed, the level of buying was, more or less, matched by selling throughout that period. Historically, that is a fairly bearish statistic. Boardroom sentiment improved dramatically in July, though, with the buy/sell ratio moving back up to 2.5/1. Shortly thereafter, the market moved out of its 2,800-2,950 trading range and breached the 3,000 barrier. The only other month when the buy/sell ratio hitched over 2.5/1 was November - and we know how well the market has performed since the Budget. Overall, the balance between buying and selling by directors continues to provide a remarkably accurate indication of stock market trends, although there were fewer wild fluctuations in the ratio during 1993 than in previous years. That might be explained by the relative maturity of the present bull market phase. Yet, many of the stocks that featured prominently last year have re-appeared at various stages throughout 1993, and not always with the same story. Martin Sorrell's WPP was tipped widely as a prime beneficiary of increased advertising spending during the year, so the bulls had a field day when he bought 100,000 shares at 55p in January. The previous year, he had acquired 200,000 shares at between 34.5p and 39p. In September, the price hit 105p, but Sorrell sold 850,000 at 92.5p in November and the price has fallen since. Richard Peskin, the high-profile chairman and managing director of Great Portland Estates, a leading property group, has shown equally deft timing. Peskin has long been critical of the stock market's reluctance to rate property shares more highly, and he has sought equally consistently to capitalise on this perceived valuation discrepancy by buying significant chunks of his own stock. His largest purchase was a line of 500,000 shares in December 1991, but he continued to buy throughout 1992 at prices as low as 104p. The subsequent performance of the property sector has proved him right, and Peskin sold 750,000 at 225p three weeks ago. Many of his peers in the sector also have found it difficult to resist the temptation to take profits in recent weeks. Tom Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Automated Security, is another who has cause to celebrate 1993. In March, he sold 200,000 shares at 157p, taking a handsome profit on the 173,000 he had bought in the previous year at 85p. The third-quarter results announced in October revealed profits down sharply, and the shares fell dramatically. Buffett seized the opportunity to buy back, picking up another 250,000 at just 101p. That purchase already seems been timed sweetly. This finely-timed execution is usually shown by individual directors, but there are occasions when the whole board deals just as effectively. In April, nine directors of of insurance broker Steel Burrill Jones sold over 1m shares at 234p. In September, the company announced losses at the interim stage, catching the market unawares. The share price decreased rapidly and 10 directors bought a total of 125,000 at 144p. As a general rule, you should always be wary when directors sell heavily at the top and then re-invest only a small proportion of their proceeds, so Steel Burrill Jones will be an interesting one to watch. The above are examples of two-way trading by directors, but many have absolutely no inclination to buy back into shares they have sold. One such would be Melvyn Marcus, deputy chairman of Queens Moat Houses. When he sold 1.1m at 57p just days before the company entered its closed period in February, there was little obvious sign of trouble. Subsequent events, including the departure of Marcus, have shown that the company was virtually insolvent and its fate now lies in the hands of the receivers. Just as Marcus is in no position to sell more shares, even if he wanted to, the three directors who bought stock in Erskine House in April are in a similar position. Having bought heavily at around 31p, directors of the troubled photocopier group made a killing only weeks later when they agreed to be taken over by US-based Alco at the equivalent of 90p. Ordinary investors can only marvel at this sort of conspicuous success. Inevitably, while there are countless examples of directors making a killing, there are also one or two occasions when their timing is a little less than perfect. Probably the most unfortunate of these was Lord King's purchase in Babcock International, where he is chairman. During two days in July, King spent almost Pounds 150,000 acquiring stock at around 36p. The interim results in October revealed recovery was not as advanced as had been hoped, and he is still nursing a paper loss. Doubtless, 1994 will continue to provide us with many more examples of directors enhancing or protecting their wealth - and perhaps one or two cases where they prove that they, too, are fallible.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                    Sector     Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Abbeycrest                 Misc    5,432,071    3,911        1 Berkeley Group             C&amp;C        15,000       73        1 Booker                     FdMa        8,088       33        1 British Land               Prop       60,000      257        1* CALA                       C&amp;C       852,533    1,006        2* Compass Group              C&amp;C        45,219      289        1* Critchley Group            Elcs       70,000      290        1 David Lloyd Leisure        H&amp;L        40,000       80        1* Diploma                    Elns      257,000    1,414        2 Grand Metropolitan         Brew       88,446      399        2* IMI                        EngG        9,000       27        1* Jarvis Porter              Pack       76,651      207        1* Lambert Howarth Grp        Misc        6,500       20        1 Marks &amp; Spencer            Stor       10,000       44        1 Moorfield Estates          Prop      100,000       47        1 Morris Ashby               Metl       17,632       31        1 Norbain Electronics        Misc       50,000      145        1 Oriflame Intl              Stor       50,000      160        1 Osborne &amp; Little           Misc      100,000      227        1 Oxford Instruments         Elcs       90,000      266        1 Pearson                    Med        60,000      354        1* Radio Clyde                Med       100,000      357        1 Standard Chartered         Bank       50,000      611        1* Sterling Publ Grp          Med       250,000      410        1 Vaux Group                 Brew        8,000       22        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Abbeycrest                 Misc       50,000       36        2 Baird (William)            Text       20,000       46        1 Blenheim Group             Med        20,000       65        1 CALA                       C&amp;C        95,000      112        3 Caledonia Inv              OthF        5,000       31        1 CrestaCare                 Hlth      300,000      102        2 David Lloyd Leisure        H&amp;L        40,000       80        1 Dorling Kindersley         Med        50,000      115        1 F &amp; C Eurotrust            InTr       68,000      149        1 Greenalls Group            Brew      150,000      594        1 Mayborn Group              Hlth        9,299       20        1 Mercury World Min'g        LRI       335,000      335        6 Royal Bank of Scot         Bank       28,000      123        1 Stirling Group             Text       75,000       41        2 Vendome Luxury Grp         Stor      100,000      341        1 Wellman                    EngG      296,900       58        2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

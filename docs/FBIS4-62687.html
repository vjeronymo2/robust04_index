President Aliyev mentioned that Azerbaijan stands for a  settlement of the conflict on the basis of the principles of the  CSCE. He said that the representative of the CSCE Minsk Group  must take part in Moscow's meeting of Defense Ministers between  Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which is scheduled for  today.    As far as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh is concerned,  President Aliyev said that this matter must be discussed in the  context of territorial integrity and inviolability of  Azerbaijan's state borders.

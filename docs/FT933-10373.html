			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rally extends to ninth trading session THE UK stock market managed its ninth consecutive daily advance yesterday, although there were signs that, with the promised interest rate cuts slow to manifest themselves, the longest rally in the Footsie stocks since before the 1987 crash was in danger of faltering. Share prices traced a mixed pattern throughout the session and the closing FT-SE 100 Index gain of 3.3 at 2,945.0 was below the day's best. Equity traders remained convinced that the ERM is on its way to the breaker's yard and that interest rates are about to fall throughout Europe; optimism was enhanced yesterday by an easing in repurchase rates in Germany. However, the calmer trends in the French equity market underlined acceptance by investors that interest rate cuts may not come as soon as the optimists would like. Both Germany and France are likely to resist calls for stringent rate cuts, according to UK equity analysts. Trading in equities remained high in London, with the Seaq network recording turnover of 799.8m shares, against 727.1m on Monday, when retail business, worth Pounds 1.37bn, was also good. A trading programme of around Pounds 100m was seen in the first half of the session and appeared to reflect a reshaping of an institutional portfolio towards high yielding stocks. Pressures on second rank issues brought a further peak in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which ended 3.1 higher at 3,338.4. Business in non-Footsie issues made up 62 per cent of the total Seaq volume, significantly higher than usual. Support from a firm UK government bond market buttressed underlying confidence that equities have further progress ahead of them, and are only waiting for more solid news on the fate of the ERM and the prospects for interest rates. Dealers reported that UK funds were still moving cash towards the other European equity markets and that the steadiness of the UK market owed a good deal to activity in stock index futures. Retail and consumer shares, directly hooked on to hopes of lower base rates, at first extended the gains of the past week, but lost heart as the day passed without news of any reductions in key rates in the leading ERM countries. The international blue chips lacked strength, in spite of a firm performance from Wall Street overnight. Early in its new session the New York market showed a dip of 3 points on the Dow Average. Oil shares lacked strength as sector specialists continued to weigh up the outlook for crude prices, and the much-battered drug sector remained on the sidelines. With some analysts now suggesting that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, may hold back a base rate cut until his autumn budget, the strength of sterling became a discouraging factor for the big export stocks. Indeed, some analysts now fear that a base rate cut is needed to take the upward pressure off sterling. But the renewal of optimism in the stock market helped banking shares again as National Westminster unveiled its profits statement. The sector made some further recovery from the doubts cast over the past fortnight by warnings from several UK brokerage houses that the recovery in the sector had been overdone, causing individual stocks to look overrated against the market.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Cost of phone calls to US to fall Large cuts in the price of transatlantic phone calls are likely after the government yesterday confirmed it would allow a new form of telecommunications competition between the US and UK. International simple resale (ISR) allows telecoms companies to resell to their customers capacity leased from the main transatlantic carriers at a discount to present tariffs. They can then connect the calls into the public networks in both countries. With leased-line prices only a fraction of existing transatlantic tariffs, new telecoms operators are expected to offer cut-price services. This is likely to force the main telecoms operators - including AT&amp;T of the US and British Telecommunications and Mercury of the UK - to cut transatlantic prices to fight off competition. The government has licensed 19 companies to offer ISR services, and other applications are likely. Business users, who account for most transatlantic telecoms traffic, are likely to be the main winners - particularly small and medium-sized businesses that have gained less than large companies from competition in the telecoms market. Announcing the decision, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said ISR underlined the UK's status as one of the world's most open telecoms markets. It is also likely to increase the pressure on mainland European governments to open up their telecoms markets, most of which remain monopolies. At present, voice telephony will not be subject to competition in most of the European Union until 1998. International simple resale is already permitted between the UK and Australia, Canada and Sweden. Other ISR agreements are likely to follow as liberalisation spreads internationally.</p>

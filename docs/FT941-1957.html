			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Observer: Change first Did NatWest know what it was letting itself in for when it decided to snap up New Jersey retail bank Citizens First? It's a pity nobody thought of asking Andy Nemes, in the UK clearer's international trade and banking services division, for a worm's eye view of the proposed acquisition. When NatWest recalled Nemes to London after 2 1/2 years in the US, his wife Janet closed her Citizens First account. Could she have the money in sterling, she inquired? Sure thing; she was promptly directed to the bullion counter.</p>

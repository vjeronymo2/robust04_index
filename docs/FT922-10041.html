			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / German unions to step up action: Kohl stands firm on public sector pay in spite of budget divisions GERMANY'S trade unions stepped up their verbal onslaught on the embattled coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday, as public sector workers promised 'rougher and broader' strike action next week. Airports, including those at Berlin and Dusseldorf, are expected to be hit by the strikes from Monday. There could be power cuts on the railways and interruption in television broadcasting, the oTV public sector union warned. At the same time, leading members of the government were locked in recriminations after last week's upheavals, following the announcement of the impending resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), accused Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister and vice-chancellor-designate from the rival Free Democrats (FDP), of 'impudence and effrontery' in calling for more budget cuts. Mr Waigel was responding to a 16-page document from Mr Mollemann, warning of huge new budget costs from German unification, and calling for cuts in areas such as social spending. Mr Waigel said in a letter that it was 'shameless' because the economics ministry was itself asking for a budget increase in 1993 well above the government's 2.5 per cent ceiling on growth. He did not reply to Mr Mollemann's budget calculations, that unification will cost an additional DM50bn up to 1995, because the figures are still being considered inside the finance ministry. In spite of the divisions in the coalition, there is no sign of central government willingness to negotiate with the public sector unions. The unions have been on strike for almost a week, seeking a 9.5 per cent pay rise. There are indications, however, that the states and local authorities led by the Social Democrats want to make a new offer. May Day rallies across the country brought support from other key union leaders. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, of the 4m-strong IG-Metall engineering workers' union, pledged his own workers' readiness to strike further in support of a separate pay claim. 'If the employers want a fight, then they will get a fight,' Mr Steinkuhler said. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, militant leader of the oTV, said the public sector strike, which has already brought public transport and refuse disposal in most major towns and cities to a standstill, would now get 'broader and rougher'. So far the employers have refused to go beyond a 4.8 per cent offer. Editorial Comment, Page 8 Man in the news, Page 8</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher doubts Results from Kingfisher at the top end of analysts' expectations failed to ease concern over trading in the UK businesses. The shares slipped with the market, ending the day 9 down at 561p with turnover reaching 6.5m. With business at Woolworth, Superdrug and B&amp;Q all proving disappointing, Kingfisher's strategy of 'every day low prices' combined with cost cutting and product innovation as a means of improving margins, divided analysts. The more optimistic observers believe the group will emerge from the current flat period in strong market positions. Others are not convinced, with one analyst complaining that the company strategy kept promising 'but never seems to deliver.' All agree, however, that the crucial test for the short-term performance of the shares will come in the next three weeks when the management embark on a big series of presentations to insitutions and analysts. A meeting between NatWest executives and bank sector analysts to explain the rationale behind the acquisition of Citizens First, the US bank, appeared to reassure the stock market and NatWest shares edged up 2 to 466p in a generally dull sector. TSB dropped 5 1/2 to 217p on heavy turnover of 8.3m shares, unsettled by an agency cross at 215p. HSBC fell back from an early 804p to end the session unchanged on balance at 783p. Standard Chartered closed 32 lower at 1074p following what was described as a badly-handled selling order from one agency broker. Sharelink, the stockbroker, fell sharply, the shares slipping 29 to 325p after some stock was sold into the market at 313p. ICI was one of the few Footsie stocks to remain in positive territory the shares benefiting from a Goldman Sachs recommendation and adding 5 at 811p. Reuters Holdings improved 7 to 2048p on buying ahead of the share split in April. BAT Industries shed 10 to 459p after a US House sub-committee voted to raise the Federal cigarette tax by Dollars 1.25 a pack to help finance a health care reform bill. Among leisure stocks, Thorn EMI and Rank Organisation were among the worst hit. Dealers said that as well as being among the best performers in the sector in recent months, last week's consumer spending figures had hit sentiment. The shares retreated 24 to 1083p and Rank fell 17 to 398p. Poor results from whisky group Burn Stewart sent the shares down to 129p. Media stocks continued weak with United Newspapers which is to announce full-year figures today, falling 24 to 636p, Pearson, which reports on Monday, sliding 13 to 615p and Reed International losing 12 to 826p. Carlton Communications, downgraded by Nomura slid 24 to 906p. RPC eased 2 to 160p after announcing that Barclays Venture Nominees and Railway Pension Venture Capital were behind the selling of a 6.7 per cent stake in the group on Tuesday. British Aerospace was among a handful of stocks that managed to resist the market trend, the shares closing 1 1/2 ahead at 515p, on talk that the group may benefit from increased tension between North and South Korea. Korea is believed to have defence equipment on order from BAe and there were suggestions that the orders may be brought forward. A sharp increase in full year profits from engineering company TT Group helped the shares jump 12 to 384p.

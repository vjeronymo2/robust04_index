			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Busier groves of academe: Funding higher education will be difficult More than one in four of the 16-year-olds in the UK who received GCSE grades yesterday will be off to university in two years, on government projections. Of their parents' generation, barely one in 10 went on to higher education. In the mid-1980s, only one in seven 18-year-olds did so. By the year 2000 it is expected to be one in three. The challenge facing Britain's universities is to create a system of mass higher education in about a decade. For all the current preoccupation with schools opting out of local authority control, financing and building that system is the most pressing policy issue on today's education agenda. Most of the expansion will be met by existing, not new, institutions. While educationalists argue about falling GCSE and A-level standards, vice-chancellors are drawing up urgent plans to increase their student intakes. The political pressure behind them is intense: Mr John Major sees higher education as the key to his 'classless society', and not just for school leavers. The number of mature students nearly doubled in the 1980s. In 1990, for the first time, more mature than young students embarked on courses, and the trend appears to be continuing. In a research paper published this week by the National Commission on Education, Professor A H Halsey of Nuffield College, Oxford, argues that Britain is moving towards 'an American concept of higher education as embracing all post-compulsory or post-secondary schooling'. It is also moving towards American-size lecture crowds and American-style student finance, with students borrowing or working their way through college. Already, student maintenance grants are fixed, with a larger proportion of state funding taking the form of loans each year. Fees for full-time UK students studying for first degrees are still paid in full by the state, but some vice-chancellors want to charge top-up fees to boost their colleges' income. The government is resistant, but if one prediction can be made with confidence, it is that financial support from Whitehall will not rise by the one-third necessary in real terms to keep pace with the rise in full-time student numbers over the next eight years. The increased numbers will not, however, be spread evenly across the system. Glossy new signboards will not miraculously change South Bank Polytechnic into Oxford. In reality a threefold division between research, teaching and 'mixed' universities will soon be as firmly fixed as the old divide between universities and polytechnics. The former polytechnics (now dubbed 'new universities') have borne the brunt of expansion, some doubling in size. Student numbers at Leeds Polytechnic will rise from 16,500 to 19,000 in the next year alone, on top of annual increases of between 12 and 15 per cent in each of the past four years. At the other end of the spectrum, between 1989 and 1994 Cambridge University is planning to increase its full-time undergraduate numbers from 10,190 to just 10,600. Cambridge is determined to defend its research capacity, and believes that to be incompatible with any large increase in student numbers. The new funding methodology used by the Universities' Funding Council, which directs research grants disproportionately towards highly rated research institutions, will enable it to do so without financial penalty. Only about a dozen other institutions will be similarly privileged: the rest  -including most of the 'old' universities - will have to pack in the students to earn their cash. 'We have coped by putting immense pressure on the working week,' says Mr Frank Griffiths, deputy director of Leeds Polytechnic. 'Our day now lasts from 9 am to 9 pm. But the next increase will require more space - and capital funding will have to be found from somewhere.' 'Somewhere' will increasingly be the commercial banks. The University (formerly Polytechnic) of North London (UNL), which plans to double in size over the 1990s, is completing a building project funded by the government. For the rest of the decade its expansion will have to be funded largely by loans and an appeal to mark its centenary. The university wants to maintain its 1:10 ratio of bedspaces to students and is anxious to prevent its staff:student ratio - at 1:20, already far worse than for state secondary schools - from deteriorating further. Says Mr Cliff Wragg, UNL's secretary: 'Five years ago we were not involved in the commercial borrowing market: now, if we are to increase access, we have no choice.' His main worry is the government rules that restrict universities from borrowing against assets originally paid for by government grants. The recent Pearce report on higher education expansion recommended a relaxation of the rules, but the Treasury has yet to respond. The 'old' universities have not been immune from the pressure. According to estimates by the Association of University Teachers, last year's 'unit of resource per student' was about Pounds 4,000 at Cambridge; but at Keele, which is growing rapidly, it was Pounds 2,300. This year, half of Keele's students are funded on a 'fees only' basis, with no contribution to their overheads forthcoming from the Universities Funding Council. Spending on repairs and maintenance in the 'old' university sector fell by about 50 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1990. Visit a university, however, and you will find at least as much enthusiasm as gloom. Vice-chancellors are full of ideas for moving to semesters to use the year more productively, for using their buildings more efficiently, for innovative use of information technology and distance learning, for the franchising of courses, and for conference and research companies to maximise income. 'Universities are big business, and we are less financially dependent upon the government with each passing year,' says Mr Colin Campbell, vice-chancellor of Nottingham University. How long that process can or should continue is one of the principal issues of the next decade. Additional reporting by David Hook.</p>

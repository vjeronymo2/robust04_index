			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Government urged to curb regulators REGULATION of privatised utilities has reached a crisis and the government should include a new list of principles for their regulation in a white paper, Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, said yesterday. Mr Helm, a consultant to the energy industry, has added his voice to growing calls for the reform of regulation. 'We've given regulators enormous discretion over the utilities without the appropriate accountability,' he said. He called for the merger of the gas and electricity industry regulators Ofgas and Offer, as the two industries were now so interdependent. Mr Helm, speaking at the launch of the group's utility index, which tracks the performance of UK utilities, said there should be considerable restraints placed on the powers of the regulators. 'Regulatory behaviour and uncertainty over regulation is increasingly a cost to the utilities. Investors need protection from regulators using their discriminatory powers,' he said. Mr Helm stressed that the problem for regulators was that prices to customers which were set at privatisation - for supplying gas, electricity and water and providing telecommunications services - were often too low to encourage competing companies into the market. 'Regulators face the inconsistency of the need for high prices on the one hand to encourage competition, but the pressure to keep prices low on the other hand to protect consumers.' The utility index provides a record of the financial performance of the utilities, weighting them by the size of their core utility business and excluding their diversified interests. The consultants believe it will be a useful tool for regulators and investors. Mr John Dorken, deputy director of Ofgas, said he did not feel the need for greater co-ordination with Offer. 'They are separate industries with some interactions, but those are not so great as to imply the need for a single regulator.' Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of Offer, agrees with Ofgas that regulation should be separate for both industries. 'The gas and electricity markets are distinct and at different stages in their evolution towards competition.'</p>

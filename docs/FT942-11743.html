			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Freeport-McMoRan to separate units Freeport-McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources company, will split its two principal businesses, copper and gold mining and agricultural minerals, into two independent financial entities which will be distributed in a complicated transaction to existing shareholders. Shares of the two new companies are expected to be more valuable than when they were combined as Freeport subsidiaries. The two businesses are quite distinct, and their fortunes often move in opposite directions. Mr Clarence Morrison, analyst with Prudential Securities, said the split would offer investors a clearer play in either copper mining or fertilisers. Mr James Moffett, Freeport-McMoRan chairman, said the proposed restructuring would benefit the companies and their securities holders by improving access to the credit markets, reducing debt service costs and eliminating possible liability cross-overs between the two companies. Freeport's earnings have been recovering, partly because copper and gold output in Indonesian operations rose in the first quarter, and because the company has insulated itself from copper price volatility using derivatives-based price protection. On the agricultural side, Freeport is in a joint venture with IMC-Agrico that is expected to produce cost savings of Dollars 95m by the end of its second full year. During the first quarter Freeport had net earnings of Dollars 12.3m, or 9 cents a share. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold had operating earnings of Dollars 53m, and Freeport Resources Partners, the agricultural division, had operating earnings of Dollars 21.1m. The restructuring, which one Wall Street analyst called a 'fair transaction', will have the effect of converting much of the company's debt into equity without any share dilution. Freeport will distribute to its existing shareholders all of its interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold in a transaction it hopes will be tax-free. The deal is contingent on a favourable ruling by tax authorities, debt restructuring and shareholder approval. After the distribution, Freeport-McMoRan's business will consist solely of its 51 per cent interest in Freeport-McMoRan Resources Partners, a company which specialises in fertilisers and agricultural minerals. As part of the deal, Freeport said it would begin to distribute Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold shares to shareholders in lieu of first-quarter dividends at a rate of one Copper and Gold share for each 80 Freeport-McMoRan shares.</p>

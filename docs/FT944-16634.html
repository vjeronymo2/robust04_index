			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: HK newspaper chief may face ban Mr Yu Pun Hoi, chairman of newspaper group Ming Pao and Hong Kong's most mysterious media mogul, was yesterday notified by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange of disciplinary proceedings after it was revealed that he had a previous and undisclosed criminal record. It is a listing requirement in Hong Kong that directors notify the stock exchange of any previous criminal convictions. Failure to do so could lead to disqualification. Share trading in Ming Pao and South Sea Development, a property developer and investment company, was suspended on Monday after a newspaper revealed Mr Yu's previous conviction. In its statement about the pending inquiry, the stock exchange said trading would resume today. Mr Yu, 35, owns 60.5 per cent of Ming Pao, and 36 per cent of South Sea. Late Monday night Mr Yu confirmed that he had served a four-month prison term in Canada in 1979 after being convicted of credit card and cheque fraud, and possession of a firearm. 'I deeply regret my behaviour in my youth and in regard to my past behaviour I have already paid for my wrongs and learnt my lesson from this,' he said in a statement. The revelation of his past wrongdoing has focused public attention on one of Hong Kong's most shadowy business people. The source of his funds for the acquisition of control of Ming Pao in 1991 remains unknown and subject to much speculation, especially given his youth. One source of his wealth and influence may be mainland China. Through his privately-held CIM, Mr Yu has joint venture car dealerships for Ferrari and Toyota. He also has joint ventures in magazine publishing, advertising, and cable TV - all 'sensitive' areas where China's Communist party likes to keep tight control. CIM is also Mr Yu's vehicle for satellite TV. By the end of this year analysts expect Asia Integrated Management, a subsidiary, to be broadcasting two Mandarin Chinese channels to Taiwan and possibly further afield. He has cable TV ambitions in Hong Kong. But the jewel in his crown still remains Ming Pao. It publishes the Ming Pao Daily News, arguably Hong Kong's most prestigious Chinese language daily.</p>

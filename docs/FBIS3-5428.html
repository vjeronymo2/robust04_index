			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kota Kinabalu, 31 Jan--The MCA [Malaysian Chinese  Association] has decided not run in the state election on 18 and  19 February in order to ensure the victory of the National Front  (BN) candidates from districts where the majority of voters are  of Chinese descent. MCA President Datuk Seri Ling Liong Sik said  the decision was made after talks about the subject were held  among MCA federal and state leaders and a detailed study was  made of the party's chances.    Nevertheless, he said, the MCA, which is one component party  of the BN, will not be idle but will use its election machinery  to help BN candidates, particularly in districts where the  majority of voters are of Chinese descent. "All MCA leaders and  supporters will work hard to give unified support to ensure that  BN candidates win in this election. I believe the decision we  have made will increase support for all BN candidates by people  of the state," he told reporters upon his arrival here at noon  today.    When asked about the possibility that the MCA will give  support to the Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), a new party  formed in the state, he said, "Our commitment to the BN is  clear. If they (the SAPP) join the BN, we will certainly give  undivided support to their candidates." As for the possibility  that its decision will hurt the morale of Sabah MCA members and  their support for BN candidates, Dr. Ling said the matter has  been accepted with true BN spirit. He said he has received  pledges and undivided support from them so that all BN  candidates running in this election will gain absolute victory.    "MCA members agree that they still need time before taking  part in an election, although support for the party is on the  increase in the state. For them, a BN victory in this state  election is quite important for ensuring that economic growth  and development in Sabah moves smoothly," he said.    The MCA expanded its influence to Sabah last year, two years  after UMNO [United Malays National Organization] formed a branch  in the state. Meanwhile, Sabah MCA Chairman Datuk Dr. Fong Chan  Onn, said that all party members in the state agree with the  decision that was made and have reiterated their support for the  BN. MCA was the second BN component party to announce it would  not put any candidate in the state election on 18 and 19  February.    Yesterday, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced that  it would not participate in this election in order to make way  for SAPP candidates if the SAPP joins the BN before the state  election. LDP President Chong Kah Kiat said his party will  support the leadership of SAPP, which is headed by former Deputy  Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee.    It was reported yesterday that Yong said the SAPP will apply  to join the BN before the general elections in the middle of  this month. Meanwhile, Sabah UMNO Information President Karim  Ghani welcomed the decisions of the MCA and the LDP as a  willingness to sacrifice for the sake of the BN.</p>

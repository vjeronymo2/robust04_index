			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK suffers again from China comments BUYING by foreign investors and public funds, and short-covering and arbitrage trading buoyed share prices and increased volume on the Nikkei average, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index rose 242.83 to 17,680.74, a gain of 1.4 per cent on the week, surpassing the 200-day moving average of 17,431 for the first time since November last year. The index opened at the day's low of 17,508.02 and rose to the day's high of 17,712.04 just before the close. Volume rose to 300m shares from 234m. Advances led declines by 704 to 293 with 150 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 17.92 to 1,343.77 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose by 2.13 to 1,093.22. While the 200-day average has been considered a technical resistance level, some traders were cool over the Nikkei's rise. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'The index closing above the 200-day moving average doesn't have much technical importance, but will have some positive psychological effects.' High-technology issues were bought by foreign investors. Toshiba gained Y9 to Y645 and NEC rose Y11 to Y696. Traders said foreigners were adjusting positions ahead of a possible cut in the official discount rate during the Christmas holidays. Investors were encouraged by reports that the Bank of Japan was supporting Hyogo Bank, an ailing regional bank based in west Japan, as it reflected the financial authorities' willingness to bail out troubled financial institutions. Banks were higher despite denials of financial aid by the central bank. Hyogo Bank rose Y100 to Y610, while Sumitomo Bank, a creditor of Hyogo, gained Y30 to Y1,910. Large-capitalisation issues were higher on purchases by public funds. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y5 to Y299 and NKK gained Y7 to Y266. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 159.76 to 19,089.77 in volume of 39.7m shares. The index closed above the 19,000 level for the first time in five trading days on buying by public funds and foreign investors. Roundup HONG Kong again came under pressure following comments from the Chinese leadership. Seoul was closed for the presidential elections. HONG KONG fell sharply after China launched an attack on the Jardine Group over its support for Governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms. The Hang Seng index fell 136.80 to 5,192.66, 1.15 per cent down on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 3.04bn. Jardine Matheson plunged 9.5 per cent on the news before recovering slightly to close down HKDollars 2.75 or 6 per cent at HKDollars 42.75, while Jardine Strategic was HKDollars 1.10 lower at HKDollars 19.40. SINGAPORE closed higher in late trading as foreign institutions came into the market. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 23.49 to 1,491.80, a 3 per cent improvement on the week.

Combined turnover was 216.3m pesos. PLDT gave up 20 pesos to 825 pesos.

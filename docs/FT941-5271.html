			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Moves afoot to lift politician's immunity: Construction industry inquiry widens Japanese public prosecutors are considering whether to lift a former construction minister's parliamentary immunity after his refusal to answer questions on alleged bribery. Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a lower house member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, yesterday defied investigators seeking fresh evidence in a widening inquiry into corruption in the building industry. This will test whether investigators are determined to arrest Mr Nakamura. So far, more than 30 construction company executives and local politicians have been arrested in what has become the biggest corruption scandal since the second world war. But the prosecutors have so far stopped short of seizing a national politician or bureaucrat. To obtain Mr Nakamura's arrest, the public prosecutor's office would have to ask parliament's permission to lift his immunity, a tactic last employed 26 years ago. Prosecutors want to question Mr Nakamura about allegations that while construction minister he had received Y10m (Pounds 64,100) from a leading contractor in return for persuading the Fair Trade Commission to drop a 1991 investigation into bid rigging. The FTC subsequently announced it would file no complaints against any of the 66 companies involved, fuelling US anger over covert barriers to foreign competition in the building industry. This is the latest sign the purge against corruption is being stepped up, following the appointment of a new prosecutor-general, Mr Yusuke Yoshinaga, head case officer on the Lockeed scandals of the 1970s. His office announced yesterday it had assigned seven extra staff to the construction case, enlarging the team to 35.</p>

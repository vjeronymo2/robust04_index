			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARING THE WEALTH;  </P> <P> 4 WINNERS WILL GET $17.1-MILLION SLICES OF RECORD LOTTERY JACKPOT  </P> <P> A 41-year-old Simi Valley woman with six children, 11 grandchildren and a host  of unpaid bills will share a record $68.56-million Lotto jackpot with at least  three other Southern California residents, lottery officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> There were four winning tickets in Wednesday night's Lotto 6/49 drawing, each  worth $17.1 million. Other winning tickets in the lottery's largest payoff were  purchased in Laguna Niguel, West Los Angeles and Long Beach.  </P> <P> Lydia Neufeld, an employee at a Simi Valley collection agency, said her winning  ticket was one of 15 she purchased at a nearby 7-Eleven store. She said her  good fortune came at a time when she was just making ends meet.  </P> <P> "Believe me, we have gone through some struggles," Neufeld said as friends,  relatives and television news crews descended on her home. "For a while, our  house was in jeopardy and my husband was unemployed because of an accident he  had at work."  </P> <P> Neufeld's husband, a plasterer, recently returned to work.  </P> <P> After taxes, the four winners will collect annual payments of $685,000 for 20  years, lottery officials said. Neufeld said that sum will be a considerable  improvement over the $50,000 she and her husband, Dave, earned last year.  </P> <P> Other winners were Joan Young of Laguna Niguel and Michael Yang of Valencia,  who purchased his ticket at a West Los Angeles gas station and mini-market.  </P> <P> Lottery officials said the holder of the fourth winning ticket, purchased at  Ranch Liquor &amp; Deli in Long Beach, had not come forward as of Thursday  afternoon.  </P> <P> But store manager Frank McDonald said an elderly pensioner and frequent  customer had come to the store with his wife to tell workers he had won. "He's  still in kind of a state of shock," McDonald said. "He looked kind of tired. I  think he's been up all night."  </P> <P> McDonald said he could not remember the man's name. But Barbie Tizon, the  store's night manager, said the man and his wife had bought several hundred  dollars worth of tickets only hours before the drawing.  </P> <P> In Orange County's affluent Laguna Niguel neighborhood, a winning ticket was  purchased by Young at a Circle K store.  </P> <P> After the numbers were announced on television Wednesday night, Young called  the Circle K to check the numbers and make sure she was a winner, according to  the store's manager, Maher Altahan.  </P> <P> "It was a wonderful surprise," Altahan said. "When the customer called and told  me (she) had all six numbers . . . I didn't know what to say. I was so  excited."  </P> <P> The winning tickets also are valuable to the four stores that sold them. Each  retailer will get 0.5% of the value of the ticket sold, or more than $80,000.  </P> <P> Altahan said Circle K corporate officials will have the final word on what  happens to the store's winnings. "It's up to the company," he said. "I think  some of it should be divided among the employees."  </P> <P> The odds of picking all six winning numbers in the lottery are formidable -- 14  million to 1. But that didn't stop Californians from lining up across the state  in record numbers to buy lottery tickets.  </P> <P> More than 6.2 million of the $1 tickets were sold between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  Wednesday, shattering the old single-hour record of 4.5 million tickets set  only two hours earlier, lottery spokesman John Schade said.  </P> <P> Wednesday's ticket sales started at 5 a.m., an hour earlier than normal. When  sales closed at 7:45 p.m., more than $50.5 million of Lotto tickets had been  sold at a rate averaging 951 tickets a second, breaking the single-day record  of $31.5 million set Oct. 29, 1988.  </P> <P> California's previous jackpot record was $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988.  Forty-eight people shared the prize, including a group of 15 San Diego County  hospital workers.  </P> <P> Wednesday's jackpot was the third largest in the nation and the second largest  for the game of Lotto, eclipsed only by a $114-million jackpot at a keno-type  lottery game in Pennsylvania and a $70-million Lotto jackpot in Illinois.  </P> <P> "It's been very exciting these last few days," lottery spokeswoman Joanne  McNabb said. "It's like working on the Olympics or a political campaign. . . .  The most fun part is getting to talk to the winners."  </P> <P> Neufeld, the Simi Valley winner, said she plans to retire after 27 years of  working to support her family. She had her first child at age 14 and now has  four daughters and two sons, the youngest of whom is 22.  </P> <P> "My mother-in-law is on Social Security and she needs taking care of," Neufeld  said. "I'm still in shock. I'm getting all of these phone calls and now the  reality is starting to set in. I guess I'll really believe all of this has  happened when I get that first check."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Shelby Grad contributed to this story.  </P></p>

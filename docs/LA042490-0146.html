			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEARING DATE BRINGS REMINDER OF DEATHS;  </P> <P> CRIME: TWO MEN CONVICTED IN TWO PARTICULARLY BRUTAL MURDER CASES IN 1973 ARE UP  FOR PAROLE MAY 17. OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT NEITHER SHOULD BE RELEASED.  </P> <P> The two killers came from different backgrounds, but their paths to crime bore  striking similarities, and the murders they committed one day apart in 1973 are  still considered among the most vicious in Orange County.  </P> <P> Robert Michael Sesma, an enforcer for a drug syndicate, was sentenced to life  in prison for beating one man to death and fatally shooting another as he  begged for his life.  </P> <P> John Benjamin Tidwell, a pimp and bounty hunter from Ohio, robbed an Orange  County teen-ager, then took him to a remote canyon area and shot him twice in  the back with a sawed-off shotgun. The youth, mortally wounded by the  double-ought buckshot, bled to death on the side of the road. Tidwell was also  sentenced to life in prison.  </P> <P> Now, seventeen years later, Sesma and Tidwell are both scheduled for parole  hearings May 17.  </P> <P> Both men, who have been turned down for parole before, say they have been  rehabilitated and are ready for life on the outside. Orange County Sheriff Brad  Gates and other law enforcement officials, however, are pleading with state  prison officials not to release them.  </P> <P> "Both of these crimes were very blatant, and to release these convicted  murderers on parole would certainly create a danger to the citizens of the  county," Gates said.  </P> <P> "We vehemently oppose their parole," said Jay Moseley, an Orange County deputy  district attorney who represents the district attorney's office at state parole  hearings. "I think they are extremely dangerous."  </P> <P> Sesma, 38, formerly of Albuquerque, N.M., first became eligible for parole in  1981. He has been turned down in seven previous hearings before the state Board  of Prison Terms. Tidwell, 41, formerly of Warren, Ohio, became eligible in 1984  and has been turned down twice.  </P> <P> Both have pleaded passionately for their release from the California Men's  Colony East at San Luis Obispo. Coincidentally, officials say, both have  trained as jewelers and hope to pursue that profession if released.  </P> <P> "What I need is that one chance to prove to you, my family and most of all to  me that I can be a productive human being in the community," Tidwell wrote in a  July 21, 1989, letter to Walter W. Charamza, the Orange County Superior Court  judge who sentenced him for the Dec. 13, 1973, murder of Harold Reinhart, 18,  of Midway City.  </P> <P> But Charamza, now retired, has recommended that Tidwell remain incarcerated  indefinitely, saying in a letter to prison officials: "The murder for which he  was convicted was planned, committed in cold blood and done in the commission  of a robbery."  </P> <P> In statements to prison psychiatrists, Sesma has said he regrets the murders of  Vaudra Dewey Nunley, 28, and Rue Eugene Steele, 29, on Dec. 12, 1973, and that  he believes he can safely be returned to society.  </P> <P> "He views himself as someone who got involved with the wrong people," an Orange  County Probation Department official wrote in a pre-sentencing report in 1975.  </P> <P> However, James K. Turner, the Orange County Superior Court sentencing judge,  has asked that Sesma never be released.  </P> <P> "These were brutal and horrible killings," Turner, also now retired, wrote  after sentencing Sesma in 1976. "I sentenced this defendant . . . so that he  will be incarcerated as long as possible."  </P> <P> The lives of Tidwell and Sesma, both of whom declined interviews, took many  similar turns, according to Orange County Superior Court records. Both were  U.S. Marines who saw combat duty in Vietnam during the late 1960s. Both grew up  in working-class families. And both fell in with criminal elements during the  early 1970s when the drug subculture was flourishing.  </P> <P> Their crimes also had similarities. Tidwell's victim was a burglary suspect who  was high on drugs the last night of his life, court records show. Sesma's two  victims were drug dealers who were part of an Orange County-based marijuana  syndicate.  </P> <P> Sesma was paid $2,000 for his role in the killings. Tidwell was to be paid half  the $35,000 he took from his victim. However, Tidwell kept all the money that  Reinhart, his victim, had taken in a burglary.  </P> <P> Court evidence would show that Reinhart was a "naive and vulnerable" young man  who fell into a trap set by a woman he had begun living with three weeks before  his death. The woman arranged for Tidwell to rob Reinhart of his share of the  money from a recent burglary in Oregon, court records show. Reinhart and two  female accomplices had taken a total of $98,000 hidden in the freezer of a  home.  </P> <P> Tidwell by that time was a seasoned criminal. He was under investigation in  Warren, Ohio, for the July, 1973, shooting deaths of wealthy industrialist  Walter Holmquist, 78, and his wife Dorothy, 77, during a burglary at their  home. Tidwell was convicted five years later in the case. He killed Dorothy  Holmquist first, then fatally shot her husband, who was crippled and walked  with a cane.  </P> <P> Tidwell was living in Las Vegas and working as a bounty hunter when the woman  enlisted his help in robbing Reinhart. Tidwell rented a car under an assumed  name, drove to Orange County and met with the woman and Reinhart at her Midway  City home.  </P> <P> The woman had told Reinhart that Tidwell was a "fence" who would launder  Reinhart's stolen money. Instead, Tidwell pulled a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun  and demanded all the money. Then he drove Reinhart to a remote spot in Santiago  Canyon, forced him to his knees and shot him twice in the back, court records  show. An autopsy showed that Reinhart bled to death from his wounds. Tidwell  returned to Las Vegas and eventually to Ohio.  </P> <P> Back in Ohio, Tidwell kidnaped a 19-year-old woman in May, 1974, and forced her  into his prostitution business. He was convicted a few months later of assault  with intent to commit rapes in the case and sentenced to Ohio state prison for  five to 15 years. While in prison, he confided to a cellmate about the Reinhart  murder in Orange County.  </P> <P> Those admissions led to his arrest and conviction in 1978 of Reinhart's murder.  He was convicted a short time afterward of the Ohio double murders. His life  sentence for that crime runs concurrently with the California sentence. With  credit for time served in California, Tidwell also will be eligible for parole  if returned to Ohio.  </P> <P> In a pre-sentencing report in 1978, an Orange County probation officer wrote  that Tidwell exhibited "a pattern of violent conduct representing a serious  danger to society. If not imprisoned, the defendant would be a danger to others  within the community."  </P> <P> Prison psychiatrists have labeled Tidwell a sociopath with "a severe antisocial  behavior disorder." But in a 1989 evaluation, prison staff psychologist Robert  K. Bolin described Tidwell as "bright and friendly" and said he exhibited no  further evidence of a psychological disorder. Bolin said Tidwell had done  "well" in the prison system and that he seemed psychologically fit. Tidwell is  engaged to be married a third time.  </P> <P> "The fact that I am 41 years old, getting married to a wonderful woman who is  very respectable in the community, my showing of maturity and growth over the  years of my rehabilitation and having been in prison for 15 straight years,  should all add up to something worthwhile," Tidwell wrote in his appeal to  Charamza.  </P> <P> Sesma had been serving as an enforcer and distributor for Orange County  marijuana kingpin John Solis in 1973 when Solis ordered him and an accomplice  to "hold" Nunley, a fellow drug ring member who purportedly was planning to  kidnap Solis and his family.  </P> <P> Prosecutors later discovered that Sesma's accomplice, Michael L. Thompson, had  fabricated the kidnap threat. Thompson had wanted to get Nunley out of the way  so that he could be with Nunley's wife.  </P> <P> On the day of the murders, Sesma and Thompson confronted at gunpoint Nunley and  Steele, a reputed drug dealer from Boston who happened to be in the wrong place  at the wrong time. Nunley and Steele were tied up at Solis' house and viciously  beaten. Steele died during the beating. Nunley was presumed dead when he and  Steele tossed him into the trunk of a car and drove him to a Tustin residence  to bury him. When they opened the trunk, however, the men discovered that  Nunley was still alive.  </P> <P> Sesma took a .22-caliber pistol and aimed it at Nunley. Randall Pierce, who had  been commissioned to dig a grave for the victims, later testified in court that  Nunley "raised his hands to shield his face and simply said, 'I don't want to  die.' Sesma said only, 'Close your eyes, man,' then shot him in the forehead."  </P> <P> The bodies were buried in a grave behind the Tustin home. The murders did not  come to light until nearly a year later, when an informant tipped off police.  In 1975, Sesma, Thompson and Solis were convicted of murder and other charges  in a six-month trial that at the time ranked as Orange County's longest  criminal proceeding. Only Solis has since been paroled.  </P> <P> Turner, the judge who sentenced Sesma, said he regretted not being able to send  Sesma to the gas chamber. The death penalty had not yet been reinstituted.  </P> <P> "I never thought I would see the day when I was sorry I could not sentence  someone to death," Turner told Sesma.  </P> <P> In court testimony and later interviews with psychiatrists, Sesma claimed that  Thompson committed the killings and that he was an unwilling participant. He  said he fell in with the drug crowd because he needed money to support a wife  and infant daughter. Sesma called his involvement with Solis' organization "the  biggest mistake" in his life.  </P> <P> Sesma's parents and siblings in New Mexico say they believe that he has been  punished enough.  </P> <P> "We want him back home," Sesma's sister, Roberta Sesma, said in a recent  telephone interview from her home in Albuquerque. "He's in our prayers every  night. He's a very good person. He's a loving person. Every chance we get we go  to see him."  </P> <P> Prosecutors describe Sesma as "cold-blooded" and find it difficult to believe  that he is rehabilitated.  </P> <P> Robert D. Chatterton, now an Orange County criminal defense attorney,  prosecuted the case against Sesma and the others. Chatterton said that although  Sesma says he regrets the killings, his refusal to admit that he committed them  is a sign that he is not ready to be released.  </P> <P> "That to me is one of the crucial things he must come to grips with,"  Chatterton said. "He was the one who personally killed both of the men."  </P> <P> </P> <P> UP FOR PAROLE  </P> <P> John Benjamin Tidwell  </P> <P> Born: July 18, 1948, in Warren, Ohio.  </P> <P> Background: Grew up in working-class family in an Ohio automobile factory town.  After high school, Tidwell joined the Marine Corps and served in combat in  Vietnam before being honorably discharged in 1968. He then married and moved to  Westminster, where he worked 13 months for a cable television company. He moved  back to Ohio in 1970 but spent the next three years bouncing from Ohio to Las  Vegas to Orange County.  </P> <P> Criminal history: In 1971, Tidwell pleaded guilty to using a stolen credit card  in Garden Grove and was sentenced to one year's informal probation. Two years  later in Ohio, he was convicted of attempted rape and sentenced to state  prison. He was charged in the 1973 double murder of a wealthy Ohio  industrialist and his wife, but his 1974 trial ended in a hung jury. While he  was in an Ohio prison serving time for the attempted rape conviction, law  enforcement authorities learned of his involvement in the 1973 killing of an  18-year-old Midway City man. Orange County prosecutors filed murder charges in  the case in 1977,  </P> <P> and Tidwell was convicted of the killing by a jury on Oct. 5, 1978. He was then  retried and convicted of the double murder in Ohio.  </P> <P> Present status: Serving a life sentence in California Men's Colony East at San  Luis Obispo for the Orange County murder conviction. He also received a life  sentence in the Ohio case, but he is serving the sentences concurrently. He has  been turned down twice for parole. He will be eligible for parole next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Robert Michael Sesma  </P> <P> Born: July 16, 1952, in Albuquerque, N.M.  </P> <P> Background: Grew up in Albuquerque in a working-class family. After high  school, he joined the Marine Corps, where he served four years in a variety of  duties including combat in Vietnam before being honorably discharged in  November, 1973. While still assigned to military duty at the El Toro Marine  Corps Air Station, Sesma married and the couple had a daughter. Upon discharge  from the Marines, he worked for a tortilla delivery company.  </P> <P> Criminal history: In 1973, to make ends meet, Sesma began working part time in  the organization of reputed marijuana kingpin John Solis of Santa Ana. Sesma  helped distribute drugs and collect drug debts. He was charged and convicted in  1975 of the shooting and beating deaths of two men: a fellow drug ring member  and a Boston drug  </P> <P> dealer. The killings took place in Orange County in 1973.  </P> <P> Current status: Sesma is serving a life prison term. He has been turned down  for parole seven times but will be up for parole again next month.  </P></p>

According to an official with the Shanghai Municipal  Committee for Restructuring the Economy, a total of 9 billion  yuan will go to 18 projects in their technological upgrading  this year.    The investment and output value of all these projects reach  200 million yuan and one billion yuan, respectively.    Scheduled to fulfill these projects at the end of this year,  the city will have a capacity of 150,000 Santana sedans, 150,000  videos, 2.1 million program-controlled switchboards and 400,000  air compressors. That will result in an annual increase of 17.8  billion yuan in output value and 3.5 billion yuan in taxes and  profits.    Another 32 projects which exert great impact on the city's  industrial restructuring can also get 5.5 billion yuan to renew  their old facilities. When they are completed, their output  value and taxes and profits will jump by 8.2 billion yuan and  1.1 billion yuan, respectively.    The municipal government hopes that the projects will help  Shanghai regain its leading position as a pilot in the country's  industrial development and narrow the gap compared with  developed countries.    The city has injected nearly 40 billion yuan into  technological improvement of some 500 projects since 1988. As a  result, the annual growth in these projects' output value and  tax and profits has accounted for two-thirds of the city's total  industrial output value and profits increments.</p>

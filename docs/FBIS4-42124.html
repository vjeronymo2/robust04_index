			<p>BFN     [Text] Sotirios Kiriazatis, the president of Omonoia, who  was forcefully brought in for interrogation yesterday afternoon  by the Albanian police, was finally released this morning. At  the same time, the Albanian authorities brought in for  interrogation other immigrants, including Vasilios Bileros,  Delvine's elected nomarch.    Yesterday, some Albanian newspapers and the state television  published a forged letter attributed to Kiriazatis which he had  supposedly sent in 1992 to Konstandinos Mitsotakis, Greek prime  minister at that time, in which he supposedly thanked him for  his help in Hellenizing North Ipiros. In a statement today, the  president of Omonoia stressed that the letter published by the  Albanian newspapers was forged and it was obviously intended to  incriminate him.    At the same time, the Albanian Foreign Ministry yesterday  launched an attack against Greece, saying that with its  statements the Greek Government is trying to create another  Bosnia in the southern Balkans.    In a statement to Albanian television today, President Sali  Berisha claimed that he has a positive attitude about resuming  the dialogue with Greece and stressed that the Greek minority in  Albania enjoys all its rights.    It should be noted that the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN  today reports that NATO has asked the Albanian Government to get  rid of its nationalistic elements.    Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis in Gjirokaster has the  following report:    [Begin recording] [Kirousis] The Albanian Government's  provocations against the Greek minority in North Ipiros  continue. The head of Omonoia here in Sarande, Sotirios  Kiriazatis, was arrested. He was questioned for several hours  by interrogators sent from Tirana and then was released.    [Kiriazatis] We are indeed going through difficult times.  This is because there were mass interrogations, which cause a  climate of fear, so to speak, and concern in general within the  Greek community. What we can advise during these situations is  to find solutions through good judgment. [end recording]</p>

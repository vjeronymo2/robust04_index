			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Old clan rivalries fuel bloodshed in Somalia: Julian Ozanne reports from a land of mistrust and blood feud now threatened with widespread famine BITTER clan rivalries, the divisive legacy of a brutal dictator, and a fiercely individualistic culture of suspicion and revenge have fuelled Somalia's disintegration into bloodshed, famine and horror. The country has fragmented into fiefdoms controlled by feuding clans and has ceased to exist as a nation state. Many Somalis cannot explain the civil war between clan-families who share the same language and religion. Most, however, blame Gen Mohamed Siad Barre, the cold war gladiator who ruled Somalia ruthlessly for 21 years. They also blame Moscow and Washington, who supported his repressive rule with military and economic aid as they played cold war politics by proxy on the continent. Barre destroyed all the political and civic institutions in Somalia. Terror and fear became widespread as security agencies meted out arbitrary and brutal punishment. The other clans, a complex, genealogically based social structure which evolved historically from family groups, soon began to see violent rebellion as the only way to seek a share of power and wealth. An attempted coup led by officers from the Mijeerteen clan was brutally repressed by Barre in 1978. The Mijeerteen suffered horrifying reprisals and a year later became the first clan to desert Barre and go into insurrection. They set up the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, a clan-based movement which today controls the north-east. Over the next decade other clans went into armed rebellion. The northern Isak clan formed the Somali National Movement, the Ogadeni formed the Somali Patriotic Movement, and the Hawiye, who dominate Mogadishu and central Somalia, formed the United Somali Congress (USC). Each controls a piece of what was once Somalia. Moscow first and then Washington sat by as the country disintegrated, continuing to pour arms and ammunition into Somalia, then considered a strategic piece of 'real estate' on the cold war chessboard because of its Red Sea port at Berbera and its position in the Horn of Africa. Recent estimates suggest 180,000 Somalis are armed today and there is enough ammunition left over from arms stockpiling to last another 20 years. As long as the east-west conflict endured, Barre contained the mounting clan-based rebellions with increasing human rights atrocities. However, as his support from abroad ended after the cold war, his fragile power base was exposed and the oppressed clans stepped up their rebellion. When Barre shot his way out of the capital in January 1991 after a victorious assault by the USC, Somalia lay divided and in ruins. Barre took most of his Marehan clan with him and continued fighting in southern Somalia by forming the Somali National Front. All the clan-based armed movements have split into mutually antagonistic groups. The most destructive of these splits has been in the Hawiye-based USC which controlled Mogadishu. The Abgal under Ali Mahdi Mohamed now control the north of the city and the Habir Gidir under Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed control the south. It is difficult to explain why the two sub-clans, who are the most closely related in Somalia, have followed the warlords who lead them. Somalis say there have always been clan disputes. These were traditionally contained by the absence of modern weapons. They also say Somali culture is steeped in revenge, which has exacerbated the violence. A well known Somali saying sums it up: 'My clan against the enemy, my family against the clan, my brother and I against the family, me against my brother.' Aid workers, seeking to get food to 1.5m Somalis on the brink of starvation, are now trying to pick their way through this violent climate of mistrust and blood feuding.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONNAIRE MAY HERALD INSURANCE PRICING CHANGES  </P> <P> In what could foreshadow a new approach to pricing auto insurance, the  Automobile Club of Southern California is sending a detailed questionnaire to  its policyholders, asking them such questions as whether they drink or smoke,  exactly where they park their car and how many miles they commute each day to  work.  </P> <P> The aim, said the Auto Club's director of underwriting, Alan Morris, is to  compile a more precise personal record on each of the club's 1 million  customers in preparation for enforcing Proposition 103's mandated downgrading  of territorial rating -- the ZIP code where one lives -- as a key pricing  criterion.  </P> <P> "There is a clamoring in the public saying, 'I want my premium to be based on  me, not where I live,' " Morris said. "But we've found there is a reluctance to  answer some of these questions."  </P> <P> About 40% of those receiving the club questionnaire have not returned it. The  questions include whether policyholders have "consumed alcohol" or "smoked  tobacco" in the last 12 months, or whether those 55 or older have taken a  Department of Motor Vehicles-approved eight-hour "Mature Driver Improvement  Course."  </P> <P> The organization recently sent out a "second request," telling its  policyholders: "Please reply promptly. The questionnaire includes new  information we must have for rating purposes under Proposition 103."  </P> <P> Other major companies, such as Farmers, say they are waiting to see exactly  what regulations on new methods for pricing policies are promulgated later in  the year by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for 20th Century, Rick Dinon, said Monday: "One thing that's  very clear is that the data our company is going to need from its policyholders  will have to be broader and more accurate, as well as more timely. . . .  </P> <P> "Under 103, you do need more information and it needs to be specific to that  individual."  </P> <P> Proposition 103 states that beginning Nov. 8, 1989, the most important criteria  for pricing auto insurance, in order of priority, must be "the insured's  driving safety record, the number of miles he or she drives annually (and) the  number of years of driving experience the insured has had."  </P> <P> Only after those three factors is the insurance commissioner allowed to "adopt  by regulation" other factors she believes "have a substantial relationship to  the risk of loss." She can assign a "respective weight" to be given to each of  these other factors, but none of the additional factors can be as important in  pricing as the first three factors.  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the Proposition 103 campaign, said this week  that he believes that the Auto Club's questionnaire, about which he said he had  heard many consumer complaints, is premature, since the commissioner has not  yet issued any regulations. And he suggested that the questionnaire is too  nosy.  </P> <P> But the Auto Club's Morris said, "We will reach a point when we start surveying  our policies that come up for renewal in November that we will have to have  sufficient information to comply with whatever rating plan the insurance  commissioner promulgates."  </P> <P> This is presuming that the state Supreme Court upholds that part of Proposition  103 when it rules on its constitutionality sometime this spring. State Farm's  general counsel, Pete Ingham, said Monday that his company, the largest seller  of auto insurance in California, is delaying sending out any questionnaire  until it sees how the high court rules.  </P> <P> But the Auto Club is getting ready now, and customers are being told that a  response is necessary by a specified date.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detailed Questions  </P> <P> The form is quite detailed. It asks, for instance, whether the insured vehicle  is parked mostly on the street or in a driveway, a carport or a garage.  </P> <P> Other questions concern whether the vehicle has an anti-theft device that  either emits an audible burglar alarm signal, cuts off fuel or defeats  ignition; whether it has been structurally or mechanically altered; whether it  is driven more than once a week in a business, occupation or profession, or  whether it has any special equipment such as four-wheel drive, winch or  hydraulic lift.  </P> <P> As for the drinking and smoking questions, Morris said, "We have been asking  them on new policies since early last year, but we never captured that  information on our existing policies until this time.  </P> <P> "We don't know what rating factors the insurance commissioner will, in fact,  permit or require," Morris said. "But if, for example, the commissioner would  say that a nonsmoking discount is justified, we need to have that in our data  base."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drinking Habits Asked  </P> <P> If a policyholder answers that he has "consumed alcohol" in the last year, "it  would not (immediately) affect the rates or our willingness to insure," the  Auto Club official added. "The reason we've put that question in there is to  determine sometime in the future if there's a correlation between nondrinkers  and drinkers in claim frequency.  </P> <P> "If you ask the question, 'Are you a heavy drinker?' no one will say yes." So,  Morris said, policyholders have been asked whether they drink at all on the  assumption that most will answer that question honestly.  </P> <P> One of the most important questions being asked, he indicated, has to do with  annual mileage. "Currently, we don't charge by annual mileage," he explained,  "but under Proposition 103, that becomes an important factor."  </P></p>

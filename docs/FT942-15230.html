			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Senate hands defeat to Berlusconi The Freedom Alliance headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi yesterday failed to obtain a majority vote in favour of their candidate for the key post of Senate speaker. This represented a serious rebuff to the Alliance and underlined the difficulties a proposed Berlusconi-led government would face in obtaining the necessary vote of confidence in the Senate. 'The government cannot govern if its policies are not shared by both houses of parliament,' Mr Berlusconi warned after the vote. 'If this happens, there is no choice but to go to the polls to seek a new majority mandate. . . but I hope this can be avoided.' In two rounds of voting yesterday on the opening of Italy's 12th post-war legislature, Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, the Alliance candidate, obtained fewer votes than Mr Giovanni Spadolini, outgoing speaker and former Republican premier. On the first round, Mr Scognamiglio, an economist and former Liberal senator who defected to Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, obtained 153 votes against Mr Spadolini's 156 from a total of 315 elected and 11 life senators. On the second round, each obtained one more vote. The Alliance - composed of Forza Italia, the populist Northern League, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance and the small Christian Democrat Centry Party - on Thursday decided to back its own senate candidate rather than seek a broader agreement with other parties. This position had been strongly canvassed by the League and was accepted with reservations, since some within Forza Italia had wanted to back Mr Spadolini as an institutional figure. Another round of voting will be held today. . If the Alliance loses the vote again, it may have to drop Mr Scognamiglio. Ms Irene Pivetti, the Alliance's 31-year-old candidate for chamber of deputies speaker, looked set to be voted in. Andrew Hill adds from Verona: Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's outgoing prime minister, yesterday warned that a new government should not tamper with the broad framework for economic recovery established in the last two years. Mr Ciampi told 2,000 Italian entrepreneurs there were 'no short cuts on the road to economic well-being'.</p>

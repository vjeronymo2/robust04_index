			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Asian economies head for growth spurt: Asian Development Bank survey credits strong performance from China DEVELOPING Asian economies are likely to grow at more than 7 per cent a year in 1993 and 1994 and to continue outperforming other regions of the world, according to Asian Development Outlook, the annual survey published yesterday by the Asian Development Bank. Gross domestic product in the 26 Asian countries covered by the report increased by 7 per cent last year, up from 6.1 per cent in 1991. The Manila-based ADB attributes Asia's success to: Strength of the Chinese economy. Growing importance of intra-regional trade and investment. Continuation of rapid export growth through greater market penetration and diversification. Rise of domestic demand. Upgrading of technology and increased productivity flowing from foreign direct investment. Widespread adoption of policies promoting competition and efficiency. Exports from developing Asian countries rose 13 per cent last year - twice as fast as world exports - to reach Dollars 555bn (Pounds 367.5bn), while inflation fell to 6.7 per cent from 8.4 per cent in 1991. The Asia-wide figures embrace divergent performances: the Chinese economy grew by a remarkable 12.8 per cent last year, after 7.5 per cent in 1991, while the growth rate for the four newly industrialising economies (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan) slipped to 5.3 per cent, the lowest since 1985 and down from 7.3 per cent in 1991. South Asian economies recovered strongly last year, with the regional growth rate rising to 4.7 per cent from 2.1 per cent. Although the ADB praised the broad thrust of economic policy in Asia - and published a section in its report analysing the continuing development of capital markets and the tax reforms being undertaken throughout the region - it also warned that future growth could be stunted by the deadlock in world trade negotiations and by a shortage of investment in infrastructure. Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, ADB president, criticised the congestion and pollution suffered by Asian cities in his foreword to the report. 'The pressing need for additional infrastructure investment is apparent nearly everywhere,' he said. 'If not addressed quickly, bottlenecks in power, transport, communication and urban services could well become a drag on future economic growth.' Chinese economic growth is forecast to remain in double digits, but the ADB predicts that the rate of expansion will decline from last year's level because of such bottlenecks and a rising rate of inflation. 'To avoid the emergence of excess demand and an overheated economy' the report urges China to establish a strong, market-oriented system of macroeconomic management that uses indirect instruments, including interest rates and bank reserve requirements, rather than direct controls on credit expansion. The report forecasts that Chinese exports will continue to grow at annual rates of 15 to 16 per cent, largely as a result of new production financed by foreign investment. Chinese imports will rise even faster - at 20 or 25 per cent a year - and the current account surplus is expected to shrink this year and poss-ibly turn into a deficit in 1994. India's economy is expected to grow by between 5.5 and 6 per cent annually over the next two years, the ADB says, while Malaysia and Thailand are likely to be the star performers in south-east Asia with annual GDP growth of around 8 per cent. The report acknowledges the validity of some Asian fears about the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, noting that manufacturing wages in Mexico are highly competitive with those of Asian exporters and that investment funds might be diverted to Mexico from Asia. But it says that proposed lower tariffs within Nafta may have only a minimal effect in diverting trade from Asia because tariffs between Mexico and the US are already 'quite low'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       ASIA AND THE WORLD ECONOMY                       (Real GNP annual % change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            1991   1992   *1993   *1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World                                       0.1    0.5     1.5     3.5 Industrialised countries                    0.5    1.5     1.9     2.7   US                                       -1.2    2.1     3.2     3.3   Japan                                     4.0    1.5     2.1     2.5   Germany                                   1.0    1.4     0.0     2.7 Developing countries                        3.4    5.1     5.5     5.8   Africa                                    1.5    2.0     3.0     3.2   Asia                                      6.1    7.0     7.2     7.4   Latin America                             2.8    2.4     2.5     3.0   Middle East and Europe                    0.0    6.1     7.0     7.2 Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union     -9.7  -16.0   -10.0     5.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecasts Source: ADB  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

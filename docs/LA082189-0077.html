			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> William Hunt Files Plan: William Herbert Hunt, one of two former billionaire  sons of wildcat oilman H. L. Hunt who is under protection from creditors, has  filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court that would pay less than half  of the $300 million in back taxes that the government claims he owes. The  Internal Revenue Service, Hunt's largest creditor, previously has said it would  settle for about $150 million, but Hunt's most recent plan would pay the IRS  $120 million -- half from the proceeds of a liquidating trust and half from  earnings after he emerges from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a Peruvian mining company  filed a plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas saying it would settle  for $80 million of the $132 million it lost on Hunt's failed silver  speculation.  </P></p>

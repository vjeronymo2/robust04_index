The full-scale exercise will involve army, navy, and air  force units, and conclude with a landing on the northern  Sporades Island of Skyros. The American units will be led by a  helicopter carrier.    The joint U.S.-Greek maneuver will be similar to an  all-forces exercise held by American and Greek units on Greek  territory last year under the code name "Alexandros."    Preparations are also being finalized for a full-scale  exercise in the Central Aegean involving all branches of the  Greek Armed Forces later this month.    This exercise will begin on January 17, and conclude on  January 22 with a landing at Argolis. It will be the first  military exercise comprising the army, navy, and air force in  several years.</p>

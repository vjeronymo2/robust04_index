			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agricultural situation not sustainable, Major warns THE AGRICULTURAL industry has to face up to change because the present situation is simply not sustainable, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the National Farmers' Union's annual general meeting in London yesterday. Pointing to the deadlock in the Uruguay round of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as well as the escalating cost of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy, he said: 'Consumers and taxpayers both spend a good deal more, and yet what happens to that? Farmers earn less and less, food is in surplus, trade is distorted, developing countries are damaged, the pressures on the environment increase and the costs grow out of all proportion to the benefits'. The government had intervened so often and so much in agriculture that it could not wash its hands of the agricultural industry. While both Gatt and CAP reform were not wholly within the remit of the UK government to solve, said Mr Major, it would 'be working hard for solutions which do not put an undue burden on our own farmers and on our own industry'. Earlier Mr David Naish, the NFU president, attacked governments for dithering over Gatt and CAP reform, which he described as 'a danger at any time'. He said: 'With UK farm incomes at rock bottom, they threaten the very being of our industry'. Investment was collapsing, and incomes were in long term decline. Each week 250 people left the land, said Mr Naish. Mr Major - the first prime minister to address an NFU AGM - said that agriculture had been a distorted market for decades, and the best long-term answer was to reduce the distortions. Farmers would then have to adopt business practices to succeed. The future would be more competitive, 'and those who succeed will be those who adapt and prepare and meet that competitive market head-on'. Mr Major said agriculture was not a declining industry, but a changing industry. 'Acre for acre, crop for crop, and herd for herd we still have the best farming industry in this country that you can find anywhere in the world, so you can compete and the opportunities for us to do so are clearly going to be there.' Planners, farmers and conservationists will next month attend a government seminar examining countryside planning controls, the prime minister told the NFU.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 21 Mar (TANJUG) -- Veljko Knezevic, head  of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb, said today that he and an  eight-member bureau delegation were to travel to Zagreb this  week. He told Belgrade radio's "An Argument More" program that  humanitarian questions, the reestablishing of telephone and  traffic links, payment of pensions, and other similar questions  would be the primary tasks for the bureaus in Zagreb and  Belgrade. Knezevic said it was necessary to raise the relations  between Yugoslavia and Croatia to a higher level, which would  imply opening of consular missions.    Commenting on the talks scheduled for tomorrow at the  Russian  Embassy in Zagreb between representatives of the republic of  Serb Krajina and Croatia, Knezevic said it was very positive  that the Serb side had agreed to the talks and was leaving with  a clear aim to end combat activities as soon as possible.    The head of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb believes that very  important issues, such as the opening of traffic and telephone  links between Croatia and Yugoslavia, were impossible to resolve  without the consent of the republic of Serb Krajina, since they  cross its territory. The solution for these problems, Knezevic  stressed, can be found only in direct negotiations between  Zagreb and Knin. A solution for Serb-Croat relations should be  sought in the same context, he believes.    Slobodan Jarcevic, the foreign minister of the republic of  Serb Krajina, told the same program that at the talks tomorrow  with Croatia in Zagreb, the Serb side would demand from the  other side first of all to sign a peace agreement, but not to  the detriment of the republic of Serb Krajina. A withdrawal of  the Croatian army and police from the occupied Serb territories  will be demanded, Jarcevic said. He recalled that the United  Nations had guaranteed territorial delimitation between the two  ethnic communities on this territory in 1991. "If the world then  provided guarantees for the borders it should now preserve  them," Jarcevic said. Asked if he feared the trip to Zagreb,  Jarcevic said: "We do not fear travelling to any foreign  country, not even to Croatia."</p>

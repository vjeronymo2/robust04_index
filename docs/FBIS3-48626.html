			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) on Thursday [27 January] denied a  newspaper report that it is planning to tie up with American  Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT and T) and Apple Computer Inc.  in the fields of multimedia communications and miniature  personal computers with telecommunications functions.    "No talks are under way between NTT and the two U.S.  companies on the reported tie-up plans," said a spokesman for  the domestic telecommunications giant.    NTT announced Wednesday it will acquire a stake in General  Magic Inc., a California-based multimedia software development  house, in a move to develop multimedia technology.    Among main investors in General Magic, which was founded in  May 1990, are American Telephone and Telegraph Co., (AT and T),  Apple Computer Inc., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony  Corp.    The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major business daily, reported  in  a front-page article Thursday that NTT is considering teaming up  directly with AT and T and Apple.    NTT and AT and T are expected to set up a joint venture to  launch multimedia communications services in Japan that is  likely to offer advanced electronic mail services similar to  those to be supplied by AT and T in the United States from this  summer, the daily said.    In order to commercialize new businesses involving advanced  telecom services and miniature personal computers with telecom  functions in Japan, NTT thinks it essential to introduce  techniques for software development from leading U.S. firms,  according to the newspaper.    In the area of miniature personal computers, a subsidiary  called NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc. (NTT Docomo) is  planning to link up with Apple on interface technology linking  such gadgets with pocket pagers, the daily said.    NTT Docomo will develop modem cards with paging functions to  incorporate them in Apple's Newton miniature personal computers  with telecom functions, it said.</p>

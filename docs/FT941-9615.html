			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Justifiable way to boost exports Sir, In your editorial, 'Arms and the dam' (February 8), you urged MPs investigating the Pergau project to consider also more general questions about the purpose of the aid budget, and whether it should be used to boost non-military exports. British contractors working in international markets would welcome a public discussion of these issues. Our main competitors have no inhibitions about using bilateral aid to promote their own exports. Britain has for many years given less bilateral aid, both in value and as a proportion of total aid, than any of its main competitors. This is a handicap for British contractors, and for the large network of suppliers and subcontractors throughout the UK which depend on them. The Aid and Trade Provision (ATP) was set up in 1978 specifically 'to finance sound development projects in circumstances where British firms were having to contend with aid-backed offers from their competitors'. It is an internationally-recognised form of aid, covered by stringent OECD guidelines, and currently accounts for less than 5 per cent of the total Overseas Development Administration budget. It has enabled a number of sound development projects in Asia and Africa to go ahead which would otherwise not have done so, to the benefit of their economies and of our own. We believe it would be in the interests of the taxpayer for more of our aid budget to be spent in this way, and we are more than willing to participate in public debate on this issue.

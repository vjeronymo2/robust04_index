			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian crop gloom deepens as drought persists Official forecasts for Australian wheat production were lowered again yesterday, because of the continuing drought, which is crippling key growing areas on the east coast. The country's overall winter crop production is now expected to be the smallest for 12 years. According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, the government forecasting and research agency total winter crop production is likely to more than halve from last year's 28.2m tonnes, to just 13.08m tonnes. Wheat production, meanwhile, is forecast to be a mere 8.3m tonnes. If the latter prediction proves correct, this will be the smallest harvest since 1972-73 and a reduction of over 50 per cent on the 1993-94 figure. Abare had already cut its forecast for winter crop production several times, as key planting seasons were missed. It said that the latest predictions reflected the continued deterioration in cropping conditions in all major Australian regions and an expectation that rainfall would remain below average until at least autumn next year. In Queensland, which has been hit hardest by the climatic conditions and where farmers are now facing their fourth year of drought, the wheat crop could be as little as 200,000 tonnes, said Abare. The last time production fell to this sort of level was in 1970-71. The Queensland barley crop, meanwhile, was estimated at 30,000 - a level not seen since the mid-1930s. In New South Wales, the other state very seriously affected by the drought, winter crop production was estimated at only 750,000 tonnes, some 7m tonnes less than in 1993-94. Wheat production was forecast to fall by 91 per cent, to 440,000 tonnes - well below levels seen in the 1982-83 drought. NSW barley production was put at 135,000 tonnes, one of the lowest figures on record. Even in Western Australia, which is forecast to provide the lion's share of 1994-95 wheat crop, Abare noted that crops were being stressed by hot temperatures and below average October rainfall. However, it said that the predicted 5.4m tonne crop would still be above average.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Brusin transcript of comments by Gennadiy </F> Kalistratov, chairman of the State Duma Energy Subcommittee,  under "In the State Duma" rubric: "Gennadiy Kalistratov,  Chairman of the State Duma Energy Subcommittee: Law Still Not  Written for Reactor"]    [Text] Nonpayments and the shortage of fuel and resources  needed for normal operation are paralyzing the nuclear power  industry. But even the country's first-ever Law "On the  Utilization of Nuclear Power," which would have helped to  eradicate many problems, passed two readings in the Supreme  Soviet and...sank into oblivion.    The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov, chairman of  the State Duma Energy Subcommittee, to tell us what, in his  opinion, the legislative line on nuclear power should be.    [Kalistratov] To begin with, the draft of the stillborn law  must be resurrected. Section 1 of it describes the evolution of  a nuclear facility from conception to dismantlement. Mutual  relations between the center and the regions are specified in  the organizational and financial respect. Section 2 comprises  compensation (moral, physical, and property) for both  individuals and territories in the event of accidents. The  responsibilities of components and authorities are set out.    A number of problems not covered in the draft law should be  considered legislatively. For example, long-term storage of  solid and liquid waste on the territory of stations and  construction of regional burial sites. As well as questions of  operating AES's [nuclear electric power stations] and market  conditions. It is worthwhile to work out and incorporate into a  normative document a mechanism for denationalizing nuclear power  units. It is useful to utilize foreign experience here. Thus,  in ancient "market" countries -- Britain and France -- the  nuclear power industry is run by the state. This is evidently  the most acceptable option for Russia. But the practice of  private U.S. companies operating nuclear facilities is premature  for us, bearing in mind the economic and technical might of  these companies. In a period of reform and instability it makes  more sense to leave the running of AES's exclusively to the  state.    It is no less important to legislatively stimulate specific  territories' interest in the construction of AES's. The  three-stage coordination which exists in our country is  retarding the solution of this question. The West has switched  to a two-stage system: the local council and the government.    The funds received in the form of taxes from AES's are  almost  completely seized by the oblast. Sometimes the profits tax is  shared out as follows: one-third to the republic budget, almost  two-thirds to the oblast budget, and a mere one-tenth to the  rayon in which the AES is located. Consequently the rayon has  no objective interest in the AES. It undoubtedly makes sense to  review the proportions of payments to the budget.    Furthermore, there is now an acute need to define the legal  status of the 30-km zone's area and to indicate its rights in  relation to a station and the economic foundations of  development.    A special question is posed by the legislative definition of  legal responsibility for circulating incorrect data on the  effects of operating an AES and its effect on the environment.  It is not only a question of ethics and politics but also one  of economics. The point is that our country is one of the five  world leaders in theoretical physics, technologies, and reactor  construction, and in the spheres of enriching uranium and  operating AES's. Russia has great export potential, and export  earnings could maintain nuclear power collectives' prosperity  for the entire period of market reforms and could even cover  Western credits. Our country is now at the epicenter of a  fierce clash between Western reactor construction competitors  for a place in the market. A particularly keen struggle is  going on for the East European, Near East, South Asian, and Far  East zones of influence. An even more insidious aim is being  set: To squeeze Russia out of...Russia itself. That is, to  replace domestic equipment with Western equipment, payment being  made in clean energy conveyed via a power line. And we are  "kindly" being left with the nuclear waste. If this happens our  domestic scientific and technological and operational experience  will disappear forever.    Therefore an "ideological" struggle also lies ahead on the  legislative level. Russia must have a national nuclear energy  development program which matches its potential. A law  approving this program is bound to become the mainspring of a  whole package of normative documents in this sphere.</p>

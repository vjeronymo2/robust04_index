			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> Your article on high school publications (Metro, Nov. 29) casts a light on a  growing problem facing many public high schools across the nation.  </P> <P> I am editor of the Beverly Hills High School publication Highlights, which is  one of the few remaining weekly newspapers around.  </P> <P> Beverly's paper has existed for several decades and has always been funded  generously by the school district.  </P> <P> However, we, too, are beginning to feel the effects of a financial crunch,  especially since the defeat of a parcel tax initiative last June. Not only have  high school newspapers traditionally served as trademarks and symbols of pride,  but they also breed very bright and talented journalists, many who will someday  face the essential responsibility of running the media.  </P> <P> Newspaper writing has been one of the most educational and fulfilling  opportunities for me. I exercise my writing ability on the paper much more than  in any academic class. It is a shame to think what a few more decades hold in  store for the future of high school newspapers and the experience these  students will miss.  </P> <P> ALEX KARASIK  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

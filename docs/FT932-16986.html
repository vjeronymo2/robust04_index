			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P cuts debt rating at top Finnish banks UNION Bank of Finland and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's two leading commercial banks, yesterday had their debt ratings cut by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, as a result of the continuing crisis in the Finnish economy. S&amp;P lowered its senior ratings of both banks from BBB plus to BBB and their subordinated debt ratings from BBB to BBB minus. It said the decision reflected the impact of the weak Finnish economy on the banks' asset quality and financial performance. KOP suffered a FM3.7bn (Dollars 6.16m) loss in 1992, while Unitas, the holding company for UBF, reported a FM2.7bn deficit. 'With the economy likely to remain depressed for a prolonged period, high levels of credit write-offs and non-performing loans will persist into the medium-term,' S&amp;P said. It said that the Finnish parliament's strong commitment to supporting the banking sector meant that the outlook for both KOP and UBF was now stable.</p>

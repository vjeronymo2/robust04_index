			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Alberto Neto, president of the Angolan </F> Democratic Party; Milton Kilandamoko, president of the Angolan  Social Democratic Party; and Paulino Pinto Joao, president of  the Angolan National Democratic Convention -- place and date not  given]    [Text] The opposition parties have been talking about the  need for peace. Certain leaders, notably Alberto Neto,  president of the Angolan Democratic Party, PDA, have expressed  the belief that they should be present at the talks in Lusaka.    [Begin Neto recording] (?There is talk) that peace will be  achieved by any means. Let us add that, to that end, there must  be trust and dialogue. Dialogue is something which is already  happening, so there is the need to do away with lack of trust  now. This is why we believe that other civilian political  parties, including the PDA, should be attending the Lusaka peace  talks or other subsequent talks so we can contribute toward  peace and national reconciliation, as stated in the Law on  Political Parties and in the Angolan Constitution. National  reconciliation cannot be achieved by two political forces alone.  [end recording]    The following is what Milton Kilandamoko, president of the  Angolan Social Democratic Party, PSDA, said:    [Begin Kilandamoko recording] In principle, we (?believe the  talks will lead) to a cease-fire accord that will end  hostilities and that will allow us to return to our normal  lives, so that we can really turn to thinking about national  unity. [end recording]    Paulino Pinto Joao, president of the Angolan National  Democratic Convention, CNDA, made the following comment:    [Begin Joao recording] There is a clear need for achieving  an  agreement in Lusaka: First of all, because the Angolan people do  not want war any more. We all aspire to peace and that is our  message to our brethren negotiating in Lusaka at this stage.  Second, because democracy is not achieved through war. To make  democracy, there has to be peace. People must accept and  tolerate differences so they can look for areas of consensus  concerning solutions to the nation's problems. [end recording]</p>

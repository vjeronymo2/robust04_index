According to information available, Moscow has organized the  talks at the request of the Armenian side. Another attempt to  bring about a change in the political regulation of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict will be made at the meeting with the  participation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    A pre-meeting dialogue by the heads of foreign offices of  Azerbaijan and Armenia will take place in Moscow as well.    The questions discussed by the foreign ministers will be the  same for the presidents.    Diplomatic experts believe that Moscow and Yerevan will try  to force Baku to agree to a plan that has been worked out by the  adviser of the Russian president, Andranik Migranian [name as  received]. According to this plan, Azerbaijan will have to  guarantee the granting of status of broad self-government and  the according political status to Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan's  terms also include the creation of the so-called "humanitarian  corridors" from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh through Lachin and  Kelbadzhar in exchange for peace.    Moreover, this plan envisions the creation of a  "demilitarized zone" along all the perimeter of  Nagorno-Karabakh."    The proposal also envisages measures providing regular  transport of energy and free flow of communications in the  Transcaucasian region. In particular, the plan also sees the  creation of a railroad command post that would provide strict  management of the railways.</p>

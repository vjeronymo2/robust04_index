			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>   [Text] Hasici, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 19 (AFP) --  Maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic has his back to the wall as  Bosnian Government forces, freed by a temporary truce with  separatist Serbs, move to regain control in his fiefdom of  Bihac. Near the frontline hamlet of Hasici, Abdic's men were  hastily digging a new network of trenches Sunday following the  news that the village of Todorov, three kilometres (two miles)  down the valley, had just fallen to the Bosnian Army 5th Corps.  The battle for the Bihac pocket in northwestern Bosnia, where  the millionaire businessman has declared autonomy from Sarajevo,  has stepped up as his Serb-backed forces fight desperately to  contain the Bosnian Army advance. The guns in Bosnia, which  elsewhere have fallen generally quiet since the temporary  ceasefire of June 10, are still clearly audible in this  "autonomous province" proclaimed by Abdic last September. With  the ceasefire taking effect along the front line between  separatist Serb and Bosnian Army forces, the Army's 5th Corps,  entrenched in the southern part of the enclave, launched a new  offensive which Abdic's raggle-taggle troops appear unable to  contain.    UN military observers said that unless they received men and  equipment from separatist Serbs in the neighbouring Krajina  region of Croatia, Abdic's forces would be unable to contain the  advance of the 5th Army Corps for much longer. Rebel troops in  Hasici wore an air of unease as they manned their posts. "The  last civilian fled this sector two days ago," the commanding  officer explained nervously. Some of his men had no uniforms.  The nearby woods and surrounding fields echoed with automatic  weapons' fire. "The balance of forces is very unfavourable for  Abdic, 500 men against 15,000, a group of men little better than  a militia up against a war-hardened army," a UN observer said on  condition of anonymity. UN reports say that Krajina Serbs have  been shooting at the Bosnian 5th Corps for several days, despite  denials by Abdic's spokesmen. "I'm not sure the support of Serb  guns is enough to redress the situation," the UN observer  commented.    In Velika Kladusa, Abdic's stronghold near the Croatian  border, the dull thud of gunfire was clearly audible. These  were 122mm or 132mm guns, according to a UN European officer.  The 5th Corps has lost about 70 men in the battle for Bihac,  diverse sources agree, and although the toll among Abdic's men  is not known, it is likely to be much higher. Almost 400 of his  troops have been taken prisoner. Several civilians fleeing the  fighting were seen near Velika Kladusa on Saturday, the first  sign of a collapse in morale in territory that he controls.  "There is no massive exodus nor any housing problems for the  time being," said Monique Fufelli, head of the local mission of  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "Houses are  very dispersed in the rural region and people have been put up  by relatives," she said.</p>

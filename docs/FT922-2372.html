			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Iraq halts domestic flights Iraq said yesterday it was halting all domestic flights because of a lack of spare parts caused by United Nations sanctions, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Mr Noureddin al-Safi, Iraqi Airways director-general, said the airline had lost more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 108m) as a result of sanctions and more than 4,000 employees were idle. The sanctions have closed Iraq's airspace to international flights and grounded its civilian aircraft, permitting only two flights daily between Baghdad and the southern city of Basra using Ilyushin turbo-prop transport aircraft. Mr Safi appealed to Iran, Tunisia and Jordan, where 33 of Iraq's civil aircraft are stranded, to allow the aircraft to return home. They were flown to sanctuary before the Gulf war began.</p>

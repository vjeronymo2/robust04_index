			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Orders for US goods up 4.4% New orders for US manufactured goods jumped 4.4 per cent to Dollars 286.5bn (Pounds 182bn) in August, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The increase more than offset a 2 per cent drop the previous month, and is the sharpest monthly increase in nearly two years. The rise included an unexpectedly steep increase in orders for non-durable goods, which rose by 2.5 per cent in August to Dollars 132.3bn. This was the 10th month in succession in which non-durable goods orders increased, with all leading industries except leather contributing to the rise. Orders for durable goods rose by 6.1 per cent to Dollars 154.2bn, a fractionally bigger increase than the Commerce Department had announced in its advance durable goods report a week ago. Coupled with the 0.6 per cent rise in the August index of leading economic indicators announced by the department on Tuesday, the rise added fuel to the financial markets' growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. But some economists pointed out the factory orders data still relate to August, before any effect was likely from the Fed's last interest rates increase on August 16. More attention is likely to be paid to tomorrow's employment statistics, which will give the first substantial information on the economy's strength in September. The Commerce Department said overall shipments of manufactured goods rose by 4.5 per cent in August to Dollars 287.9bn, after dropping by 1.1 per cent in July. The backlog of unfilled orders dropped by 0.3 per cent to Dollars 447.2bn, cutting the ratio of orders to shipments to 2.89 - the lowest in 30 years. With inventories dropping by 0.1 per cent to Dollars 387.1bn, the ratio of inventories to shipments fell to 1.34, the lowest ever recorded.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Amato wins confidence vote after stormy Senate debate ITALY'S embattled prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato won the backing yesterday of the four partners in the fragile coalition government after a turbulent parliamentary debate on his moves to find a political solution to the corruption scandals. Scuffles broke out during the debate when an opposition senator threw handfuls of false banknotes - bearing the effigies of some of the main figures involved in the corruption scandal - into the Senate chamber. A later vote of confidence appeared to defuse some of the political tension that has built up since the dramatic events of last weekend when President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign a decree. This would have allowed most of those implicated in the corruption scandals to get off with administrative sanctions. But Mr Amato's weariness from battling to keep alive his eight-month old coalition showed yesterday when he revealed he would quit politics once he stepped down from the premiership. 'The end of this experience as prime minister - come as it may within days, a month or whenever - will also be the end of my political career,' he said. Mr Amato also castigated the hypocrisy of those clamouring for him to resign. 'How can one go on when one gets private entreaties to stay and public calls to go?' he asked. In an impassioned speech, frequently interrupted by the opposition, he also spoke bitterly against those who had encouraged a political solution to the corruption scandals but had withdrawn to the sidelines once the proposals proved unpopular with the public and the judiciary. The government now has to reframe legislation to enable the judiciary to deal more quickly with the increasing load of investigations and prosecutions in the corruption scandals. But Mr Amato yesterday said his government's top priority was to ensure that parliament agreed quickly on a new set of electoral laws. Ms Nilde Iotti, the former leader of the chamber of deputies and a member of the opposition Party of the Democratic Left, was yesterday appointed head of the joint parliamentary commission on constitutional reform. In his Senate speech, Mr Amato denied the government's proposals had amounted to an amnesty for the corruptors and corrupted. But he conceded it had been a mistake to frame the proposals in a decree against the advice of Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister, rather than as a law which could be amended by parliamentary debate. Mr Scalfaro invoked the formal excuse that the decree, which covered new provisions on party financing, would have conflicted with the referendum on April 18 calling for the abolition of public funding of political parties. But it has become clear that the opposition of the Milan magistrates involved in the main anti-corruption investigations forced Friday's cabinet decision to be overturned by Mr Scalfaro.

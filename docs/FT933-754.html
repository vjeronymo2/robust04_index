			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Japanese provincial governor held: Bribery alleged in construction contracts JAPANESE prosecutors last night arrested another leading provincial politician as their investigation into a network of alleged bribery by construction companies gathered momentum. Mr Shuntaro Honma, 53, governor of Miyagi prefecture, north of Tokyo, was arrested for allegedly receiving Y20m (Pounds 125,000), while prosecutors also took into custody an official of the Liberal Democratic party and two executives of Taisei, a large contractor based in Tokyo. The move by prosecutors followed the arrest last week of Mr Teruzo Yoshino, patriarch of Japan's construction industry and chairman of Shimizu, the largest contractor, for allegedly bribing a different provincial governor. Prosecutors are expected to target national politicians in the next few weeks, and the investigation could be embarrassing for members and former members of the LDP, which has traditionally had close ties to the construction industry. In the Miyagi case, Mr Honma, a former journalist, is alleged to have received money from the two Taisei officials in January this year in connection with contracts to build a medical complex and a sports stadium in the prefecture. In the past three months, 22 provincial government officials and construction company executives have been arrested, providing evidence for US trade negotiators, who are demanding that the Japanese government reform bidding procedures for public works con-tracts. At present, only designated companies are allowed to bid, but it is often unclear why certain companies have been designated and others excluded from a contract. The US wants open bidding for all public works projects.</p>

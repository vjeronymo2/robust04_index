			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Mining survey finds that fewer than half of redundant miners have found jobs Fewer than half of redundant miners questioned for a survey have found jobs and those now working outside the industry have taken taken an average pay cut of more than Pounds 70 a week, Michael Smith writes. The survey by Coalfield Communities Campaign, an all-party association of coalfield local authorities, found that 89 per cent of former miners were worse off. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the report demonstrated the cost paid by miners for the government's failure to back their industry. A total of 878 former miners at five pits closed since October 1992 responded. This represented 30 per cent of questionnaires which were sent out between December last year and April this year. About 56 per cent had not found new work. Of those in work the largest proportion were in factory or warehouse jobs.</p>

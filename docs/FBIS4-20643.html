			<p>System   <F P=102>   43070064E Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Fall 93 p 6 </F> <F P=103> 43070064E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NASDA REPORT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] In July 1993, the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer  and Return System (chaired by Shigebumi Saito, Professor  Emeritus of the University of Tokyo) of the Space Activities  Commission (SAC) concluded a report on Space Transfer and Return  System. The report pointed out that, considering the variety of  space activities in the 21st century, the research and  development on an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle launched by  an expendable launch vehicle to meet the needs of the early  2000s should be started. It also pointed out that it is  important to conduct a flight test in this century using a  transportation technology test vehicle.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-31A>      FIGURE </FIG>     The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) is  conducting the space transportation system research in  accordance with the SAC guidelines described below.        -  Design study on a transportation technology test  vehicle which can be launched by H-II launch vehicle to  establish system technology covering subjects from the launch of  an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle to atmospheric re-entry and  landing is being conducted.    -  The experiment vehicle, Orbital  Re-entry Experiment (OREX), which simulates the structure of the  nose portion of a winged space transportation vehicle, was  trial-produced and is being serviced at the launch site for the  orbit re-entry experiment. OREX will be launched by the H-II  Launch Vehicle Test Flight No. 1 scheduled for launch on  February 1, 1994. It will acquire data related to structural  materials and designs which resist high temperature when it  re-enters the atmosphere from orbit.    -  Preparation is being made  to launch lift vehicle by the J-I rocket for flight at an  altitude of 100km to acquire flight data during hypersonic  flight (at mach 15) of the winged re-entry vehicle.    -  Preparation  is being made for small-scale automatic landing experiments. A  scale model of the winged transportation vehicle will be  released from a high altitude and allowed to automatically land  on the runway using a fully automatic guidance control.</p>

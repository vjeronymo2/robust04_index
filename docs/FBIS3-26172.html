			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday a U.S.  State Department report that criticised Beijing's human rights  record, labelling it "utterly unreasonable" and a gross  distortion of the facts.    China's constitution guarantees its citizens every  democratic  right and it is "utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible  for the so-called human rights report ... to turn a blind eye to  that fact," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly  press briefing.    The U.S. report, published February 1, said that while China  had made limited progress on human rights last year, it had  still engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and other  abuses.    The report aimed to "distort, criticise and attack the  domestic situation in China," Wu said, adding that the United  States has no right "to make irresponsible remarks" about the  internal affairs of China or any other country.    The publication of the U.S. report came as China and the  United States are continuing negtiations on renewal of China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, which Washington has  made conditional on significant progress in human rights.</p>

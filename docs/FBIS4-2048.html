			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 March, Zhang Huanwen, president of the Liaoning  Provincial Higher People's Court, delivered "the work report of  the provincial higher people's court" to the second session of  the eighth provincial people's congress for examinations and  discussions.    After reviewing the 1993 work done by the provincial higher  people's court, he said: In 1993, under the leadership and  supervision of the provincial party committee, the provincial  people's congress standing committee, and the Supreme People's  Court, the people's courts at various levels across the province  persisted in the guiding ideology of setting up the socialist  market economic system; made achievements in safeguarding the  national political and social stability, promoting a fast  economic development, and promoting the struggle against  corruption; comprehensively strengthened the judicial work; made  efforts to upgrade the law enforcement level; and better  accomplished the judicial work tasks assigned by the party and  the state. Over the past year, the courts at various levels  across the province accepted and handled 248,080 cases of  various categories, an increase of 3 percent over the previous  year; and concluded 227,265 cases of various categories  according to the constitution and the law, accounting for 4.5  percent. Of this total, the courts concluded in first trials  21,102 criminal cases, accounting for 9.3 percent; 119,612 civil  cases, accounting for 52.6 percent; 44,827 cases of economic  disputes, accounting for 19.7 percent; and 41,724 cases of  appealing to higher courts and presenting cases in courts as  well as administrative and executive criminal cases, accounting  for 18.4 percent. The courts comprehensively launched the  judicial activities according to laws, dealt blows to various  criminal activities, protected the legal rights and interests of  citizens and legal persons, readjusted the economic relations,  and played a positive role in safeguarding social stability and  promoting the deep development of reform and the setup of the  socialist market economic system.    He reported, in detail, on the work in the following five  aspects:  1. We Dealt Strict Blows to the Criminal Activities of  Jeopardizing Social Order and Safeguarded the Stability of the  State and Society [subhead]    In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory  on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and with  the general goal of setting up the socialist market economic  system as set forth by the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as its core, we unswervingly deepened reform,  expanded the scale of opening up, and maintained political  stability, economic development, national unity, and social  progress. Like the whole country, our province's situation was  good. However, many problems still existed. The criminal cases  judged by the courts last year were shown as follows: First,  the serious criminal cases accounted for a large proportion.  Last year, the courts across the province accepted and handled  21,786 cases in first trials, a drop of 5.6 percent from the  previous year and concluded 21,102 criminal cases in first  trials, a drop of 5.3 percent. However, the extraordinarily  serious criminal cases accounted for 42.2 percent of the total  criminal cases. Second, the number of criminal gangs that  brazenly looked down upon society increased. Last year, the  courts across the province concluded 2,810 cases of crimes  committed by gangs of criminals, accounting for 18.8 percent of  the criminal cases that were concluded through first trials. In  particular, some underworld criminal gangs appeared in  succession and they brought about extremely serious damages to  the social order. For instance, several cases committed by  criminal gangs in Yixian County and the Xiuyan Man Nationality  Autonomous County were tried. Third, the criminal cases of  money embezzlement were comparatively concentrated. The theft,  speculation, robbery, blackmailing, and economic criminal cases  accounted for a considerably large proportion. Fourth, many  all-round and serialized criminal cases took place. Some  criminal offenders committed various kinds of crimes, such as  looting, stealing, murdering, and kidnapping and blackmailing.    Social order directly affects the overall situation of  reform, opening up, and economic construction as well as the  setup of the socialist market economic system. So, social order  has constantly been a hot-debated issue that the masses of the  people have generally paid attention to. Therefore, in  conducting the judicial work, the courts at various levels  persistently implemented the principle of rapid and strict  punishment and prominently dealt blows to criminal activities.  A total of 21,313 criminals that produced legal effect were  judged during the year. Of this, 1,052 were sentenced to death,  to death with stay of execution, or to life imprisonment. Some  59.1 percent of the criminals were sentenced to the imprisonment  of five years or more. Four hundred and fifty large-scale  public trials were held. This maintained the prestige and trend  of the concentrative attacks.    Launching a special struggle to improve public security in  a specific area is a successful experience for solving regional  public security problems. Our province has a vast territory  with coastal development zones, large inland cities, oil fields,  mining areas, and some economically underdeveloped rural areas.  Different public security problems have occurred at different  times and in different localities. Cases of committing a crime  with a gun, kidnapping, blackmailing, robbing rental cars,  killing taxi drivers, and hiring someone to kill somebody have  mostly happened in big cities; criminal gangs with the nature of  underworld society which dominated a certain area have mostly  appeared in rural areas, county seats, and towns; and cases on  theft of industrial raw materials and damage of power facilities  have mostly appeared in oil fields and mining areas. Courts in  various localities defined the tasks for this special struggle  in line with local conditions and effectively resolved the  prominent public security problems in their localities in a  timely manner.    The central authorities have clearly defined that in solving  public security problems we must strengthen comprehensive public  security management. During trials, courts at all levels  persisted in implementing the comprehensive public security  management system. First of all, they gave full play to their  judicial functions and tried all kinds of cases in line with the  law. They succeeded in maintaining social stability through  trying criminal cases; properly handled the internal  contradictions among the people and guarded against and reduced  the number of crimes by trying civil, economic, and  administrative cases; and eliminated destabilizing factors by  doing a good job in handling lawsuits. Second, they  appropriately extended judicial work. Through conducting open  trials and trying and meting out punishment locally, courts at  all levels succeeded in increasing the number of areas  influenced by education on the legal system; strengthened the  social effect of judicial work by establishing special  collegiate benches for trying delinquents; strengthened the work  of supervising and transforming criminals by visiting and  investigating criminals who were placed under the control and  temporary suspension of the execution of a sentence, or exempted  from punishment; and resolved hosts of contradictions and  disputes at the grass roots and eliminated crimes in the bud by  intensifying the role of the people's courts. Third, they paid  attention to expanding the social effect of judicial work. Last  year courts at all levels printed over 100,000 copies of  propaganda materials on typical cases and the legal system in  the course of trials, gave 1,180 lectures on law and legal  consulting services, promptly proposed 1,224 judicial  suggestions for relevant departments, and publicized law through  radio and television broadcast, press, and other media means,  which were generally valued.  <H5>  2. We Strictly Punished Criminal Activities Seriously </H5> Disrupting the Economy and Unceasingly Deepened Anticorruption  Struggle    Deeply conducting an anticorruption struggle and promoting  administrative honesty is a major affair which the party and the  country should grasp at present and in the future. In line with  the central plan that noticeable results should be achieved in  an anticorruption struggle within a certain period of time,  courts at all levels further strengthened trial of serious  economic cases. Judging from the economic criminal cases  accepted by courts across the province last year, we noticed the  following characteristics: First, the number of cases accepted  declined during the year. Last year courts across the province  accepted 1,528 economic criminal cases (excluding 103 old  cases), showing a decline of 22 percent from the previous year's  figure of 1,950 cases. Second, the number of this category of  cases declined first and then increased again. During last  year's first nine months, courts across the province accepted  972 economic criminal cases as against 1,505 cases accepted  during the corresponding period of the previous year, showing a  decline of 35.4 percent. During the year's third quarter, the  central authorities proposed efforts be made to achieve  noticeable expected progress in the anticorruption struggle.  The number of cases accepted by courts began to rise again.  During last year's fourth quarter, courts accepted 556 cases  compared to 445 cases during the corresponding period of the  previous year, showing an increase of 24.9 percent. Third, most  of the cases concentrated on economic crimes. Of the total  number of economic criminal cases accepted by the courts last  year, 1,208 were cases of the four categories, namely,  corruption, cheating, misappropriation of public funds, and  bribe-taking, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of  cases accepted. Of these cases, 37.8 percent were cases of  corruption; 16.7 percent, cheating; 13.3 percent,  misappropriation of public funds; and 12.2 percent,  bribe-taking. Fourth, the proportion of criminal cases involving  party members and cadres was quite big. Of the court decisions  that had legal effect, 40.2 percent involved party members and  cadres. Over the past year, courts across the province tried  1,529 economic criminal cases. Owing to the complicated social  situation and the difficulties in obtaining evidence and  conducting investigations, 506 cases were rejected for  reinvestigation because the facts for fixing the crimes and  determining the sentence were unclear, and the evidence was not  adequate. Among the 1,084 criminals covered by legal  consequences, 435 involved the amount in excess of 10,000 yuan.  Of them, 309 criminals involved amounts between 50,000 and  10,000 yuan, 60 involved amounts between 100,000 and 50,000  yuan, and 66 involved the amount in excess of 100,000 yuan. Of  these criminals, 11 were given death sentences, suspended death  sentences, and life imprisonment, and 286 were given an  imprisonment of over five years. As a result, a total of 27.81  million yuan in economic losses was retrieved for the state. In  trying economic cases, courts at all levels always persisted in  the principle of "being both resolute and prudent to ensure  correctness" and offered corresponding policies and ideas for  handling the bribery cases taken place among contracted and  leased enterprises, the criminal cases committed by scientific  and technological personnel, and the cases of misappropriation  of public funds, and the cases of illegal money lending, thus  ensuring the quality of the trial of economic cases.  <H5>  3. We Vigorously Strengthened the Trial of Economic Cases </H5> and Deepened the Functional Role of Readjusting Economic  Relations    Along with the establishment and development of the  socialist  market economic structure, last year all courts in the province  received a total of 49,142 economic dispute cases of various  kinds, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year, and  the total volume involved by lawsuits exceeded 4.27 billion  yuan, a high record in history. These cases increasingly  manifested the characteristics of large amounts of money  involved by lawsuits, the increase in cases of new categories,  and the complexity of legal relations. Many cases spanned  several localities and trades and their legal relations  overlapped, thus making it more difficult to handle them.  First, in trying and handling these cases, people's courts, on  the one hand, resolutely exercised overall control in  consideration of the state overall interest, supported banks to  withdraw unreasonable loans, banned the funds under illegal  circulation, and prevented the "circulation of funds outside the  legal entities." On the other hand, people's courts gave  consideration to the objective factors of policy readjustment,  reasonably judged the right or wrong of the related parties, and  tried every possible means to reduce the economic losses of both  parties involved in a case. Second, people's courts protected  according to law the fair competition in the main body of  markets. As an economy based on the legal system, the market  economy has set an even higher demand on law enforcement. After  the convocation of the 14th CPC Congress, in the process of  changing from enforcing laws under the product economic  structure to enforcing laws under the socialist market economic  structure, courts at all levels paid attention to guiding the  vast numbers of judicial cadres to overcome the legal concepts  and traditional habits formed under the old economic mode and to  learn to correctly enforce laws under the new economic  structure. Third, people's courts continuously expanded the  sphere of service. In trying economic cases, courts at all  levels, on the one hand, correctly handled economic disputes in  a correct and timely manner, and, on the other hand, positively  helped enterprises develop production. By voluntarily going  deep into enterprises to help them examine contracts and  rationalize contract relations, people's courts achieved better  social results in orienting the trail of economic cases to  economic construction.  <H5>  4. We Comprehensively Tried Civil and Administrative Cases </H5> and Protected the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Citizens  and Legal Entities    Among the cases tried by courts, civil cases accounted for  the largest part. Last year, courts throughout the province  received a total of 125,824 civil cases of various kinds,  accounting for 50.6 percent of the total, or an increase of 9.3  percent over the previous year. Courts at all levels strictly  enforced the "General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and  the "PRC's Law on Civil Procedures," continuously strengthened  the trial of civil cases, and continuously improved the quality,  efficiency, and social effect of the trial. In handling cases,  courts strengthened the sense of law enforcement and changed  from handling cases based on experiences to handling cases  according to the law. In terms of the time to try cases, courts  strengthened the sense of time limit and changed from handling  cases at will to handling cases efficiently. In the form of  trial, courts strengthened the sense of evidence and changed  from completely depending on investigations to combining  evidence with investigation. First, courts conscientiously  handled the frequently occurred civil cases. Second, courts  prudently handled the cases of new categories and other  sensitive cases. Due to the influence of the upsurge in real  estate, stocks, negotiable securities, and business in the  previous stage, new types of civil cases increased with each  passing day. The lawsuits due to the disputes over development  of real estate, transfer of negotiable securities, labor  services, copyrights, and reputation rights were brought to the  courts in succession. Third, the construction of the people's  courts was strengthened, and the contradictions and disputes  were solved among the grass roots. Larger numbers of civil  disputes took place in the grass roots. The people's at various  levels paid attention to strengthening the grass-roots work.  Through readjustment, the province had 386 courts. Last year,  the people's courts guided the grass roots to mediate and handle  230,741 civil disputes. So, 215,188 contradictions were nipped  in the bud and among the grass roots.    In the past three years after the enforcement of the law  governing administrative procedures, the courts in the province  accepted 2,083 administrative cases in first trials and  concluded 2,033 of them. Thus, greater headway was made in the  administrative judicial work. In trying the administrative  cases, the courts at various levels not only protected the legal  rights and interests of citizens and legal persons but also  enabled the administrative organs to exercise their functions  and strictly handle affairs according to the laws. They  conscientiously examined, according to the laws, the specific  administrative activities and made judgments in line with the  principle of seeking truth from facts. In particular, they paid  attention to examining and handling the administrative cases  closely relating to reform, opening up, macroeconomic regulation  and control, and change of government functions, including the  cases of affecting the change of enterprise managerial  mechanisms, wantonly collecting funds, wantonly apportioning  expenses, and wantonly imposing fines, so as to protect the  enterprises' decision-making right to management and to promote  the setup and development of the socialist market economic  system. The administrative cases that cropped up due to the  restriction of the personal freedom were prudently treated and  appropriately handled. So, the courts realistically safeguarded  the citizens' legal rights and interests. Through  administrative judicial activities, the courts forcefully  supported the administrative organs to do administrative work  according to laws; helped standardize the administrative  management activities, upgrade the citizens' awareness of  abiding by laws and disciplines, and protect the legal rights  and interests of citizens and legal persons; and were welcomed  and praised by all social circles.  <H5>  5. We Strengthened the Construction of the Court Cadre </H5> Contingents and Ensured the Strict Enforcement of Laws    Viewing the general situation, we know that the province's  court cadre contingents are basically good and can be relied on  the party and the people. However, they still lag far behind  the requirements for deepening the development of reform and  opening up and setting up the socialist market economic system.  Over the past year, the courts at various levels across the  province grasped the trial work with one hand and grasped the  construction of the cadre contingents with the other. They  regarded the improvement of the cadres and policemen's political  integrity and professional quality as an important measure for  achieving the court work. First of all, they unified the  ideology of cadres and policemen with the guidelines of the 14th  party congress. The courts at various levels conscientiously  organized the broad masses of cadres and policemen to deeply  study, according to their actual conditions, the guidelines of  the 14th party congress and the third volume of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, to further emancipate the mind, to renew  their ideas, to deepen the understanding about the market  economic system, to firmly enhance the basic line of the party,  to enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency  for bringing into play the judicial functions to serve the  acceleration of the setup of the socialist market economic  system, and to enhance the ability to understand, analyze, and  solve problems with the theory on socialist market economy.  Under the conditions where the number of cadres continued to  increase, there were no sufficient judicial forces, and the  working conditions were comparatively poor, the broad masses of  cadres and policemen carried forward the fine traditions of the  judicial work, were inspired with enthusiasm, waged an arduous  struggle, and worked harder for a long period of time. Thus,  there emerged a group of advanced courts and outstanding  judicial cadres that strictly enforced laws, were honest in  performing their official duties, and served the people  wholeheartedly. Second, they made efforts to upgrade the  professional abilities of cadres and policemen. By the end of  1993, 54 percent of the cadres and policemen in the courts of  the province had an education level of college degree or higher.  Gigantic changes took place in the court cadres' educational  and specialized structures. Third, they strengthened the  improvement of administrative honesty and the supervision over  the judicial work. In order to resist the interference which  unhealthy social trends had brought to judicial work, courts at  all levels persisted in managing the courts and police strictly,  strictly enforced judicial discipline further and improved the  mechanism of restraint through employing people to supervise  administrative honesty work, establishing the law enforcement  responsibility system and the system of reinvestigating wrong  cases, conducting activities on vying to be an honest judge, and  signing joint pledges on administrative honesty with the persons  concerned. In line with the guidelines of the directives of the  central authorities and the provincial party committee on the  anticorruption struggle, courts at all levels conscientiously  investigated and resolved their own problems and adopted  resolute measures to straighten out and handle two prominent  problems on above-quota collection of fees and confusing the  set-up of judicial organs with their administrative power. Fees  which were collected above quota or should not be collected had  been refunded within a set time limit; and all authorized organs  whose administration and judicial powers were confused had all  been abolished without exception. Problems on law and discipline  violation emerged in judicial cadres had been strictly handled;  those whose offenses constituted a crime had been resolutely  punished in line with the law; the image of people's courts and  the purity of the ranks of judicial workers were maintained. To  guarantee strict enforcement of law, courts at all levels  realistically strengthened judicial supervision, promptly  resolved problems emerged in judicial work through the  procedures of second trial and retrial, and through law  enforcement inspections. Last year courts across the province  tried 11,146 cases subject to second trial, handled 5,393 cases  of appeal, received 278,129 visits from the masses, handled  5,393 letters from the masses, and changed the verdicts to  straighten out in line with law those cases whose facts to  support the original sentence were unclear and the evidences  were inadequate, and that laws were not properly applied to  them. Measures for improving the situation of failing to  strictly implement the procedural law and for improving rough  judicial work style were proposed in a timely manner.    During the past year, our province made definite  achievements  in court work, but it still lagged far behind the demands of the  party and the country and the unceasingly developed situation,  which were mainly indicated in the following: Our ideology,  concept, and professional quality were not totally compatible  with the overall objective of establishing the socialist market  economic structure; our ability to deal with the new situation  and resolve new problems needed further enhancement; the  problems that the masses of people found it difficult to bring a  lawsuit to court and that courts found it difficult to put the  verdicts into effect had not been thoroughly resolved; problems  on failing to strictly enforce the law caused by the influence  of protectionism of localities existed at varying degrees;  problems on the rough work style and sloppy work of some  judicial workers occurred frequently; some cases were not  handled in a timely manner and a small number of cases were not  properly handled; some cadres and policemen violated law and  discipline, and, although such cases were not great in number,  they had a very bad influence in the masses. We should adopt  effective measures to resolve these problems in an effort to  unceasingly improve the work of people's courts.    Zhang Huanwen said at the end of his report: This year we  should deeply study the guidelines of the third plenary session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, take the party's basic line  as the guidance and economic construction as the central task,  act in line with the demand of the conference of presidents of  the higher people's courts across the country, gain great  prestige in dealing strict blows to criminals, grasp major and  appalling cases until good results are achieved, make big  progress in regulating the relations in various economic  sectors, and comprehensive enhance the judicial level. It is  necessary to safeguard social stability, better serve the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure,  guarantee the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and  promote a sustained, rapid, and sound national economic  development.</p>

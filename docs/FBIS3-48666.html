			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paek In-chun, chairman of the North side  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification [Pomminnyon] issued a press statement on 24  January on the 3d anniversary of the formation of the North side  headquarters of Pomminnyon.    The press statement reads: The twenty-fifth of January marks  the 3d anniversary of the formation of the North side  headquarters of Pomminnyon. We who are involved in the work of  Pomminnyon are filled anew with deep emotion and great resolve  as we greet this day at this magnificent juncture when all the  fellow countrymen at home and abroad have designated this year a  year of great national unity for the country's reunification and  undertaken the first step for pannational reunification.    Three years have passed since the North side headquarters  were designated as a regional organization of Pomminnyon during  the formation of the Pomminnyon at the three-way working talks  held in Berlin in November 1990 following the resolution of the  first round of pannational rally on 15 August that year. Since  its formation, the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon has  waged a vigorous struggle to realize the country's reunification  to fulfill its lofty mission and responsibility to history and  the nation, strengthening its relations with the other  Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad.    All the struggles the Pomminnyon has waged for these three  years--such as the struggle to promote the implementation of the  historic North-South Agreement and the joint declaration on  denuclearization, the many rounds of pannational rallies which  were grandly held to crush the splittist forces' persistent  suppressive and obstructive maneuvers, the meetings of the  Pomminnyon chairmen's groups, and the struggle for the abolition  of the evil anti- reunification laws, for the release of  patriotic figures devoted to reunification, and for the  repatriation of old man Yi In-mo--have been just and patriotic  struggles which reflect the aspiration of all the fellow  countrymen who ardently desire national unity and the country's  reunification.    Through the numerous joint struggles since their formation,  our Pomminnyon organizations have been able to contribute to  strengthening the independent might of the country's  reunification and further heightening the fellow countrymen's  reunification desire at home and abroad. Through the three  years of the Pomminnyon movement, we have demonstrated at home  and abroad that our Pomminnyon's advance for the realization of  the three principles-- independence, peaceful reunification, and  great national unity, which are the common national ideals--is  unstoppable, no matter what desperate efforts the splittist  forces may take from their aversion to national unity and the  country's independent and peaceful reunification, and that the  victory of the cause of our reunification is inevitable.    The great advance of our nation for the country's  reunification is now entering a new stage, and the fellow  countrymen's desire for this has become more ardent with the new  year. The great leader President Kim Il-song--who provided a  sagacious analysis of the new situational demands in developing  the reunification movement and the fellow countrymen's  aspiration for reunification--elucidated a programmatic task in  his New Year's address this year for all the compatriots at home  and abroad to wage a pannational struggle in firm unity under  the banner of great national unity in order to bring forth a new  phase for the country's reunification this year. Prior to this,  last year, he brought forth a 10-point program for the great  unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification, which  is a great political charter for national unity.    A weighty but honorable task has now been set for the North  side headquarters of Pomminnyon to wage a more vigorous movement  for great unity of the whole nation by giving impetus to the  ardent aspiration and will of all fellow countrymen for national  unity and reunification, upholding the 10-point program for the  great unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification.  Some time ago we designated this year a year of great national  unity based on the proposal made by the overseas headquarters of  Pomminnyon, and announced at home and abroad that all the  activities of Pomminnyon will be concentrated on the realization  of the great unity of the whole nation.    I declare once again the resolve of the North side  headquarters of Pomminnyon to brilliantly realize, in  cooperation with all the other Pomminnyon organizations at home  and abroad, the 10-point program for the great unity of the  whole nation for the country's reunification and make this year  a year of great national unity and a year of opening a new phase  for the country's reunification so that we may realize the  country's reunification in the 1990's without fail.    In the future, we will explain, publicize, and implement  the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation  taking advantage of all of Pomminnyon's activities so as to  actively inspire all fellow countrymen to defy all differences  of political opinion, religion, party faction, and position to  rise nationwide and unite as one in the movement for the  country's reunification.    Many obstacles and difficulties remain on the road of our  struggle against national oppression and for reunification.  Trying to maintain colonial division system infinitely by  relying on outside forces, the present South Korean rulers began  aggravating tensions between the North and the South from the  beginning of the new year by scheming large-scale war exercises,  including the Team Spirit joint military exercise aiming at the  North, and by wielding the national security law which defines  fellow countrymen as the enemy, to intensify suppression of  South Korean pro-reunification patriotic forces, including  Pomminnyon-related figures.    Furthermore, the South Korean authorities did not hesitate  to  commit criminal acts against human ethics a few days ago.  Citing absurd reasons and pretexts, they blocked the Seoul  visit of the group of mourners from the North side who had  wanted to pay their respects to the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, whose  whole life was spent devoted to reunification and patriotism and  who fought at the fore for the formation of the South side  headquarters of Pomminnyon.    The maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group, which schemes  confrontation and division and goes against the fellow  countrymen's desire for reunification, are by far more crafty  and atrocious than those of previous military dictators.    Fellow countrymen in South Korea and abroad from all walks  of  life are raising their voice of rage and denunciation against  the South Korean Kim Yong-sam group which wears a so-called  civilian mask.    In the future, we will not tolerate any legal and  institutional devices as well as antireunification force's  maneuvers that put a brake on the great national unity. We will  especially designate forces that attempt to designate  Pomminnyon, the mother body of great national unity, as being  heretical, and that attempt to destroy or disintegrate it by  outlawing its activities, as the enemy of the nation obstructing  the country's reunification and national unity, and will wage a  staunch struggle to remove it.    We strongly demand that the present South Korean authorities  who have persistently blocked the formation of the South side  headquarters of Pomminnyon, to promptly stop their traitorous  acts and positively ensure Pomminnyon's pro-reunification and  patriotic activities.    As in the past, our North side headquarters will continue in  the future to actively support and root for the just struggle of  the South side Pomminnyon-related figures to carry out  legitimate Pomminnyon activities in South Korea and will  vigorously and continuously carry out pro-reunification and  patriotic activities by strengthening solidarity with all  Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad.    No one can block the Pomminnyon's grand march toward  reunification which bears the whole nation's aspiration for  reunification. Marking the fifth year of the nineties, we can  no longer abide by the tragedy of national division brought  about by outside forces.    I ardently call on the 70 million fellow countrymen in the  North, South, and overseas, to join Pomminnyon in stepping up  the grand march toward reunification under the banner of great  national unity.</p>

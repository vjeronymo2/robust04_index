			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS recruits new chief from Ericsson Mr Jan Stenberg yesterday agreed to become chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) from April 1. His appointment comes just two months after the collapse of SAS's ambitious attempt to merge with three other European airlines - the so-called Alcazar project - and as the carrier is facing new restructuring to stem heavy losses. Mr Stenberg will succeed Mr Jan Reinas, who became SAS's stop-gap chief executive last September following the resignation of Mr Jan Carlzon. Mr Carlzon stepped down after 12 years to devote all his energies to bringing Alcazar to fruition and said he would not return if the plan failed. Mr Stenberg, 54, has spent his entire career at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group. He is Ericsson executive vice-president and a member of the corporate executive committee. SAS will be hoping that Mr Stenberg's extensive involvement in Ericsson's internal restructuring during the 1980s will compensate for his lack of experience within the international airline business. The airline is aiming to cut costs by up to SKr2.5bn (Dollars 309m) as part of a plan to restore profitability and strengthen its financial position. It suffered a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss in the first nine months of 1993, but hopes its overall deficit for the year will be slightly lower than the SKr743m loss in 1992. Mr Stenberg said his first priority would be to drive through the rationalisation programme already outlined. This will include job losses, sale of aircraft, route closures and the disposal of non-core businesses. SAS will focus closely on its core flying operations, the new chief executive said. This will see it move away from the diversification strategy espoused by Mr Carlzon when the group's activities spread to include hotels, tours and catering. 'I have a vision of SAS as a profitable airline both within Scandinavia and beyond it,' he said. He also said the search for collaboration with other airlines would continue in response to industry pressures. In particular, he highlighted a possible deepening of co-operation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines, the group's two partners in the so-called European Quality Alliance. Alcazar envisaged a full merger with Swissair, Austrian and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Observer, Page 21</p>

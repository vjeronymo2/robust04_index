			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Reynolds to Stop Some Recycling: Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co. will  discontinue recycling glass and plastic beverage containers at three centers  because it says provisions of California law are forcing the aluminum industry  to subsidize glass and plastic recycling. Because redemption prices for glass  and plastic containers fail to cover their recycling costs, the company may end  up spending $1 million this year "subsidizing the recovery of glass and plastic  for recycling," according to Charles W. Rayfield, vice president and general  manager of Reynolds' Orange-based recycling subsidiary.  </P></p>

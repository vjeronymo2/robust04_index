			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has decided to move up the  time of reviewing the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan Guideline,"  the basic guideline for the defense buildup in Japan, to firm up  the outline of a new guideline by the end of 1994. The DA has  decided to do so in response to Prime Minister Hosokawa's strong  intention of attaching great importance to changes taken place  in the international situation since the end of the Cold War.  The review's results will be reflected in the 1995 budget. The  DA plans to make a speedy full-fledged review of the current  guideline by setting up a deliberation council consisting of  security and foreign affairs experts next spring. In the new  proposal for replacing the "Strengthening Defense Capability  Plan," which is based on the current guideline, cuts in the  fixed number of Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] personnel and  redefining Japan's participation in the UN Peacekeeping  Operations (PKO) are likely to be focal points.    The Cabinet decided on the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan  Guideline" in 1976 and the prime minister has shown enthusiasm  for an early review of it, saying, "The guideline was shaped  under the Cold War structure and it has become necessary to  review whether it is compatible with the needs of the present  day." On 24 December, the prime minister told Yamakuchi, House  of Representatives Budget Committee chairman, that "I have  already directed the DA to review the guideline and I intend to  have the review results reflected in the 1995 budget."    What the DA has thus far planned is that it will set the new  guideline's outline in March 1995 and make a final decision on  it by the end of 1995. However, the DA has decided to move up  the review time of the current guideline after concluding that  it will be unable to have the results of the review ready in  time for the compilation of the 1995 budget.    As the situation has continued wherein the number of GSDF  personnel falls below its fixed number of 180,000, which is set  in the current guideline's "attached list," the DA is likely to  shrink the fixed number of GSDF personnel to the current level  of 150,000 when it reviews the guideline. The DA also plans to  include the use of SDF reserves in the new guideline. In the  new guideline, the DA intends to stress the posture of  vigorously participating in the PKO. Regarding the theater  missile defense that the United States is promoting, meanwhile,  the DA is expected to refer to it in one way or another in the  new guideline. In the new guideline, the DA is likely to  forward a new defense policy by sweepingly changing the  conventional way of analyzing the international situation on the  premise of confrontation between two superpowers, the United  States and Soviet Union.    In late 1994, however, a preliminary budget request for  fiscal 1995 will be decided and it is hard to predict to what  extent the new guideline will be reflected in a budget bill for  fiscal 1995. The deliberation council is likely to begin a  full-fledged review after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is  enacted. Any delay in the budget bill's enactment is expected  to force the deliberation council to draw a conclusion on the  new guideline by the end of 1994 after six months of review.    DA officials are voicing doubts about the prime minister's  posture, saying, "The prime minister is in too much of a hurry,"  (says a senior DA official). Some DA officials think that the  prime minister probably aims to appease the ruling Social  Democratic Party of Japan, which has insisted on cutting defense  spending.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "Odr.": "Germany Must Invest More in </F> Asia--Rexrodt Assures Political Support"]    [Text] Bangkok, 25 Apr--The position of the German economy  in the Asia-Pacific region remains unsatisfactory in comparison  with American and Japanese involvement. The Germans see Asia as  predominantly an export market and thus are not present in  sufficient numbers there through direct investments, cooperative  agreements, and the exchange of technology and know-how. This  must change. At least that was the opinion of the German firms,  associations, chambers of industry and trade, and  representatives of the Bonn ministries taking part in the fifth  Asia-Pacific Conference of the German Economy, held in the Thai  capital of Bangkok. The conference participants are hoping to  jointly develop strategies for a successful German course of  action in this region, with its great prospects for growth, and  to spark interest in the region.    Due to its insufficient involvement up to now, the German  economy is continuing to lose ground in East Asia, even more so  than the United States and Japan. Deliveries and technology  transfers from Germany currently make up only around one-tenth  of the German foreign trade volume. No more than 3 to 4 percent  of German foreign investments flow into the Asia-Pacific region.  With an annual volume of German direct investments of 1.3  billion German marks [DM] going to Hong Kong and DM2 billion to  the ASEAN states, the Federal Republic is lagging far behind  Japan. This is because Japan operates much more offensively in  the region. In 1993, DM19 billion flowed from Japan to Hong Kong  alone, and another DM52 billion to the ASEAN states.    For this reason the Federal Government has now granted Asian  policy a position of importance. The government's Asia plan and  the founding of the Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy  are two important initiatives intended to heighten awareness in  the political and economic arenas. Federal Minister of Economics  Guenter Rexrodt, who opened the conference in Bangkok, promised  German businesses increased political support. Rexrodt also came  out in favor of a more intense dialogue between the Federal  Government and governments in the Asia-Pacific region. Although  the Federal Government is clearly opposed to direct export and  investment subsidies, Rexrodt sees the German Hermes-instrument  as providing an important contribution to the financial support  of German direct investments.    As is heard in Bangkok, however, much remains to be done.  "This somehow does not agree with German involvement in Asia.  The exotic business-romanticism idea is finally history.  Thousands of German firms have not yet become aware of this;  only now is it becoming clear to them that Asia is no longer the  backyard of the world," criticizes Fritz Kleinstaeuber, director  of the German-Indonesian Chamber of Industry and Trade in  Jakarta. Among the weak points he has identified in German-East  Asian trade are, in addition to marketing weaknesses which have  long been a problem, an unsatisfactory distribution system and,  not least, ineffective advertising. Kleinstaeuber also  challenges that the German presence in Asia should not be  limited to machinery and capital assets. German consumer goods  should also reappear in Asian markets.    "We see ourselves as partners in cooperation with the  Asia-Pacific countries in a broad sense. What is needed is not  so much exports from Europe to this region, but technology  transfer and the expansion of local net product in the foreign  markets," explains Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the  Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy. Von Pierer refers  primarily to the great opportunity for German firms to become  partners with Asian countries in gigantic infrastructure  improvement projects and in environmental protection  technologies. According to estimates, the volume of orders for  infrastructure projects in this region will amount to several  hundred billion dollars over the next few years. China, for  example, plans to install around 75 million additional telephone  connections by the year 2000.</p>

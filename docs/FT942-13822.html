			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Duty cut shocks Indian coal industry A cut in the import duty on non-coking coal from 85 to 35 per cent has come as a shock to the Indian coal industry. The industry has been criticised since its nationalisation in the early 1970s for not giving due attention to customer servicing and the quality of fuel produced. In the protected regime, the emphasis had been on stepping up production. Mr SK Chowdhary, chairman of Coal India Limited, the third largest coal company in the world, says the lowering of customs duty may lead to the import of 10m tonnes of non-coking coal in the next three years. But other industry experts suggest that the power plants and other big coal consuming industries located near the ports will be importing much more than that. At Dollars 12 a tonne Indian non-coking coal comes much cheaper than the imported coal, which costs about Dollars 30 a tonne. But as coal mined abroad has a high calorific value and lower ash content, import at 35 per cent duty will make sense for the strategically-located industrial units. Moreover, the duty-free import of coal is allowed for the production of exportable goods. Coal industry officials admit that the import of non-coking coal will force the Planning Commission to rework its production targets. The industry, which in recent years had recorded an annual growth rate of about 5 per cent, will at the most see a marginal rise in production in the current year. CIL which accounts for over 90 per cent of India's coal output has a production target of 223m tonnes for 1994-95 (April to March), against last year's production of 216.1m. The company has stocks of 40m tonnes of coal at the pitheads, however, so it may not chase the 1994-95 production target. Mr Chowdhary says CIL is in the process of working out a strategy to meet the competition from imports. The most important component of this will be to organise the supply of beneficiated power grade coal, in place of the present run of the mine non-coking coal. The company will not itself set up washeries for non-coking coal. Mr Ajit Panja, the minister of coal, has said that the private sector will be allowed to set up coal washeries on a 'build-own-operate' basis, and CIL has shortlisted 16 of the 42 private companies that have shown interest in building washeries. 'If the non-coking coal is beneficiated, then the power plants and other consumers will get fuel of uniform quality from indigenous sources, even though the ash content of coal will remain high. But the Indian boilers are designed to use high ash content coal,' says Mr PK Sengupta, director of CIL. The setting up of washeries will, however, take time. While CIL will try to limit imports, it thinks it should be possible to develop an export market for Indian coal, which has a low sulphur content. CIL will be talking to foreign coal producers and trading companies to explore the possibility of blending Indian coal with high-sulphur foreign coal for export to third countries. The company is reported to be keen to lease some mines in Australia and export most of their production to India. In the meantime, CIL has made a strong representation to the federal government that in the 'liberalised import environment', it should have the freedom to fix coal prices and production targets. There are strong indications that the government will remove the price control on coal in phases. The new environment also demands that CIL should bring down the cost of production of coal by improving the output per man-shift, which is very low in India compared with international standards, and closing down the uneconomic mines. In the first phase, 14 underground and four open cast pits will be closed down.</p>

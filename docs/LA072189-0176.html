			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DURAN FAVORED AS LEONARD'S NOV. 2 OPPONENT  </P> <P> Promoter Bob Arum has planned a Wednesday press conference at Roseland in New  York to announce Sugar Ray Leonard's Nov. 2 opponent at Caesars Palace in Las  Vegas, and the betting is that Roberto Duran, not Thomas Hearns, will emerge  from behind the curtain.  </P> <P> "We will definitely have a decision by this weekend," Arum said Thursday from  his Las Vegas office. "Mike Trainer (Leonard's attorney-manager) has listened  to offers from representatives of Duran and Hearns, and now he and Ray simply  have to make the best business decision."  </P> <P> For Leonard, who will be HBO's ringside commentator tonight at the Mike  Tyson-Carl Williams heavyweight championship bout, that would seem to be a  third match with Duran, who reestablished himself as a prime-time boxing  attraction last fall by upsetting Iran Barkley to claim the middleweight crown.  </P></p>

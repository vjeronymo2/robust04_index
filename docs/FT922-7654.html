			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Decision made to avoid disorderly assets liquidation THE WORLD'S financial system would have faced 'tremendous risks' if Olympia &amp; York had allowed its creditors to seize its assets, Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief bank negotiator, said yesterday. Mr Miller, a partner of the US investment bank James D Wolfensohn, said O&amp;Y filed for protection from its creditors in Canada and the US on Thursday night to avoid a disorderly liquidation of its assets. He was being interviewed on O&amp;Y's private motor launch as he travelled along the River Thames to catch a Concorde flight to New York. Mr Miller, who said he had not slept in a week because of shuttling between bank meetings all over the world, admitted that the insolvency filings would nonetheless damage the property markets in Toronto and New York. 'O&amp;Y is the best property developer in the world,' he said. 'If even we cannot withstand recession, confidence in the property markets is going to be shaken.' But he predicted that the impact on the markets would be 'temporary'. Mr Miller said that at the beginning of the week the company had started to become convinced that it would need to file for protection under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Chapter 11 legislation of the US. A series of creditors were threatening to seize assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But it was the threat that there would be a domino effect, leading to asset seizures by many other creditors, that finally persuaded O&amp;Y on Thursday afternoon to make the filings. He said that a big concern was that creditors in the US 'would . . . grab Canadian assets'. These US creditors had this ability because many of the US property loans were guaranteed by the O&amp;Y parent company in Canada. The filings have removed this threat. O&amp;Y also became concerned that it would be unable to make payments to creditors whose loans were secured on a series of Canadian buildings and that these creditors would therefore seize the buildings. In other words, there was the threat that creditors would try to liquidate billions of dollars of O&amp;Y's assets, which would have had a devastating effect on the property market and could have led to colossal losses for banks with property loans. However, Mr Miller said he understood why the Canadian government had not come to the company's aid by providing a bridging loan to facilitate the sale of the Exchange Tower in Toronto. Mr Miller said the Canadian government was prepared to provide the funds if these would have solved all O&amp;Y's problems. 'When the cash crisis began (two months ago), the government thought the loan would be a final solution,' he said. 'But it soon became apparent that O&amp;Y's difficulties were far too bad to be solved by that.'</p>

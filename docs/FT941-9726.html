			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Travel: Where you can find the rain in Spain - Adam Hopkins experiences delight and awe in the Picos mountains of northern Spain When the future Emperor Charles V inherited the Spanish throne at the age of 17, he immediately set off from Flanders to claim his Iberian birthright. He went by sea, as many do today. But instead of reaching the port of Santander, his navigators, who were suitably ashamed at their mistake, arrived instead off one of the wildest stretches of the Spanish coast, facing head on, at a distance of six leagues, those fierce and pinnacled mountains known as the Picos de Europa. The Lowlands-reared Charles and his courtiers had never seen anything much higher than a midden, and they were definitely impressed. One look at the mountains and they concluded that the distance was a single league, not six, says the Flemish chronicler, Laurent Vidal, describing the events of late September, 1517. Today the Picos, although barely 10,000ft high, still leap up behind the coast in a stunning exhibition of snowy-coloured limestone, offering the spectator a curious mixture of delight and awe. They also shelter in their midst a shrine and national park recording the occasion, in the 8th century, when the Spaniards first defeated the Moors, who until then had been all-conquering and had made the peninsula an advance-guard of Islam. The place is Covadonga, the Spanish victor's name was Pelayo, and the sacred cave of Pelayo and its numinous Virgin are meant to mark the start of the centuries-long reconquest from the Moors, giving the Picos range a special resonance for Spaniards. You can climb right up these mountains if you have the ropes, hooks and know-how; or walk in and out among them through amazing gorges; or take high paths that are reasonably safe and well defined. But if you are just that fraction more sedentary, you can equally well drive round them in a couple of days. Naturally, this could be extended to include a walk or two, or simply to allow more time for taking in the scenery - so long as the weather is kind. The possibility of mist and rain is a real one on Spain's Green Coast - why else would it be green? - but I myself, although properly pessimistic about the weather in these parts, have made the trip three times in the past three years, once in summer, twice in winter, and each time under cloudless skies. On the last occasion I started off from Llanes, a little fishing and holiday town on the Asturian coast. As well as possessing some excellent beaches and most of the Picos de Europa, the region of Asturias is famous for its cider. Rather rashly, considering how curvaceous the roads would be, I had repaired the previous evening to an excellent little cider house and fish restaurant in Llanes, called El Riveru. From there the proprietor, named Manuel Batalla (ready, as his name implied, for any contest) had swept me off to a festival at a nearby village: incredibly loud music, much jocund dancing and more cider at every turn. We wound up in a bar way above the coast where the clientele, at 3am or 4am, lifted up their heads as one and started on Asturian folk songs about lost love, drowned fishermen and coal miners buried underground. Tears, I may say, pricked the eyes; my skin became gooseflesh. And - yes - the road next morning was even wigglier than I remembered. From Llanes you trundle along the coast eastwards for a while, the Picos hidden by a great rib of intervening rock. But soon the route strikes inland along the banks of the river Deva - boaty, salmony, delectable - to enter a limestone gorge of shocking beauty and asperity. Griffon vultures wheel overhead, with specks of eagles stacked up even higher. Gaunt cliffs and spires of rock come tumbling down, trees grow here and there in silly places, and the road buckets in and out as you swivel along. There is a wonderful interruption at the lost little village of Lebena for a church in the style called Mozarabic - Christians building in the Moorish manner with horseshoe arches and abstract patterning. Soon after that the valley broadens, so well-protected by the surrounding heights that it grows grapes and a mass of Mediterranean plants. Here you will get the first full view of mountain wall and peaks - those of the eastern massif, entirely thrilling to the upturned eye. You could spend the night in the little town of Potes, capital of the eastern Picos which spill over into the region of Cantabria. There are hotels and restaurants, and hostales for the young and less affluent. But at the price of having to come back the same way, it is worthwhile carrying on through Potes right up into the mountain range, striking for a spot named Fuente De. Up here there is a parador, one of Spain's chain of state-owned, state-run and generally excellent hotels (this one is rather gaunt) and a cable car to the top of a high rock-cliff, whence even higher expeditions are possible on foot. The whole place is a mass of rock and thrilling verticals with meadows, Alpine-style, beneath. Half-way up from Potes to Fuente De you pass the Hotel del Oso (or Brown Bear), more comfortable than the parador and serving unquestionably the best food roundabout. Try their cocido Liebana if you fancy an assault course of chick peas, cabbage, pork, veal, mountain ham and paprika sausage. Hacking back now to Potes, and picking up the journey proper along the southern flanks of the Picos, the road, which grows narrower and considerably steeper, takes you up and down, over tremendous passes where you will undoubtedly need at least a layer of warmer clothing if you decide to take a stroll or picnic. Then down you go, tumultuously, towards the gorge of the river Cares which climbs up with its attendant walkers through a world of pitted, water-riven limestone. It is all tremendous stuff, with great rock skyscrapers and steeples, sometimes dramatically truncated, and villages in the valleys, stone-built and red-roofed, looking as if they have been extruded by the countryside, quite without benefit of human builders. Eventually, by means of yet another gorge, the road swings round the north-west corner, offering first Cangas de Onis, capital of the western Picos, and soon the shrine and national park of Covadonga. You will no doubt find a good many other visitors before you, but it is worth pushing on up the Covadonga valley even so, past vast car-parks and souvenir shops, the commercial apparat of sanctity, to encounter the minuscule Virgin in her rocky fastness, attended by praying nuns and any number of determined cyclists, all quite sweaty after the ascent. There are more hills above Covadonga, extremely steep ones, whether for car or cyclist, and they lead to a pair of mountain lakes, high at the heart of the national park. It is a toss-up whether this northern side of the Picos is more lovely than the south, but it is certainly better travelled, as you will find when you get back to the main road and run the length of the range again, this time from west to east. Lovely it is, however, and comparatively restful, and it offers access not only to the peaks above but also, matching the savage aspect of the mountains, to the strongest, tangiest cheese in all Spain. This takes its name from the mountain district of Cabrales. It takes its nature from the milk of sheep, goats and cows combined, and also from the limestone caverns where it is stored until maturity, acquiring, through naturally occurring moulds, a taste that rocks you on your heels and makes the palate throb and tingle. Cider to start with, limestone in the middle, cheese to finish with - not a bad sequence for a mountain exploration. From Britain, the quickest way is to fly from Stansted to Oviedo, capital of Asturias, on Aviaco, the Iberia subsidiary (London tel: 071-830-0011), three times weekly, with hire car available via the airline; or fly to Oviedo from Heathrow or Manchester via Barcelona or Madrid respectively - much less convenient. Travelscene (tel: 081-427-8800) has an Asturian programme, with a rather limited range of hotels in the Picos. There is a much fuller range of hotels on a Brittany Ferries package, sailing from Portsmouth to Santander, November to March, and from Plymouth at other times. Two nights on the ferry (there and back, 24-hour crossing), plus seven nights in Spain, with hotels and B &amp; B in Picos and approaches, costs from Pounds 226 per person.

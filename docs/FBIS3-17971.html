			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the Supreme Soviet resolution  regarding the issuance of personal privatization vouchers as of  1 April 1994, the Republican Council of the Movement for  Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice [DSPS] has addressed  workers, peasants, and the working intelligentsia with an appeal  to join the DSPS and resolutely demand that the state's economic  course be altered. According to the appeal, the actual aim of  personal vouchers is "to strip us of national property and of  such social guarantees as the right to work, rest, happy  childhood, adequate care in old age, free medical care, and  housing."    The authors of the document believe that the project of  issuing vouchers is "the final stage of transforming the  socialist socioeconomic system into a capitalist one, which  entails such inevitable consequences for working people as  poverty, absence of rights, unemployment and diseases,  humiliation, and the tragedy of colonial dependence."    The DSPS Republican Council calls upon the Belarusian  Supreme  Soviet to reject privatization and offers another way to  overcome the crisis. In particular, it suggests that DSPS  candidates be elected to the legislature and local soviets; and  that the constitution adopted against people's will, be  rescinded.</p>

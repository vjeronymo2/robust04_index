			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I am hard-pressed to express my dismay and anger over the brutality so  graphically depicted in the May 12th episode of "Beauty and the Beast." Our  family used to love the show for its depth of human compassion and peaceful  problem solving. What happened? Perhaps kindness and ingenuity don't win  ratings wars?  </P> <P> Eileen Bigelow, Whittier  </P></p>

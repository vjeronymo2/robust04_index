			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLEVELAND STAYS INSIDE TO ROUT KENNEDY, 82-56  </P> <P> As Kennedy High players will attest, there are but two things in the school gym  that offer less give than the diamond-hard basketball court. But those objects  are suspended 10 feet above the floor.  </P> <P> The Kennedy rims are a tad less forgiving than a drill sergeant with a  migraine.  </P> <P> Taking this into account, Cleveland brought its attack to point-blank range in  a North Valley League game Wednesday night and used its frontcourt to blow the  Golden Cougars away, 82-56.  </P> <P> "Everything had to be precise. Bank shots were falling in and out," said  forward Pat McCook, who came off the bench to lead the Cavaliers with 18  points.  </P> <P> Cleveland forwards Bobby McRae, Kayheed Murray and Brandon Martin contributed  12, 12, and 13 points, most of which came in the paint.  </P> <P> While the Cavaliers were crashing the boards, Kennedy was just plain crashing.  </P> <P> The Golden Cougars fell behind, 19-8, after the first quarter and 39-22 at  intermission.  </P> <P> "We just got out of our game plan," Golden Cougar forward Garret Anderson said.  "We don't have the team to run with them. Our plan was to slow them down."  </P> <P> Anderson was the one player Cleveland couldn't slow. He scored 33 points, 19 in  the first half. Things must have gotten lonely for Anderson -- he was the only  Kennedy player to score until Alan Johnson made a free throw four minutes into  the second quarter.  </P> <P> Anderson hit three consecutive three-point shots within a minute in the third  quarter to cut the lead to 47-36. The rally stalled, however, with 3 minutes 21  seconds to play in the period when he picked up his fourth foul and was pulled.  </P> <P> The performance was a vast improvement over Cleveland's last two -- a loss to  Granada Hills and a one-point victory over Taft. Still, Coach Marc Paez wasn't  beaming.  </P> <P> "I thought our rebounding was spotty," Paez said. "I'd say it was an  improvement, but we're not where we need to be."  </P> <P> The victory sets up a showdown between the Cavaliers and Granada Hills for the  league title Friday at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Brandon Battle, who started for Cleveland last season but was ruled  academically ineligible, returned and scored a point.  </P></p>

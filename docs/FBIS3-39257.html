Ever since U.S. President Bill Clinton and  his Japanese guest Morihiro Hosokawa stepped in front of the  White House microphones, jointly announcing that they do not  agree, one of those disputes is looming that are hardly too  dramatic to describe by the term "trade war." The fact is that  history has seen cold and hot wars being waged for much lesser  conflicts of interests. Apart from the Pacific Ocean, the two  world economic powers are separated by a gigantic imbalance. It  is adding up to an annual $50 billion in the United States'  balance of trade.    Both sides declare that the deficit has to be cut. In the  Japanese view, Clinton chose the wrong means at the wrong time.  Japan is in the middle of the worst recession in recent history  and it fears that terrible things might happen if it agrees to  opening up its markets to an extent exactly defined by yens and  dollars. It is, therefore, unlikely that Hosokawa, who does not  tend to be subservient anyhow, will give way. A showdown can be  expected.    The question is whether the Europeans will be able to watch  an escalating conflict across the Pacific as a joyful third  party. It might seem this way. They do not have any serious  trade imbalances with the United States. And if the Americans  manage to clear away the barriers with which Japan blocks off  unwelcome imports, they might also be clearing the way for the  Europeans.    Until then, and in the foreseeable future, there can only be  losers in the Pacific economic powers' conflict. For, among the  things that are at stake are the laboriously achieved results of  the latest world trade round. Goodbye, lovely profits from  prosperity!</p>

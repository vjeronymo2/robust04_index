			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Many representatives of Ukrainian and foreign mass  media have lately been inquiring at the Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine about the situation that is of interest to them,  concerning the supply of gas to Ukraine and the export of it to  European countries.    The press service of the cabinet of ministers reports that  due to reductions in gas deliveries to Ukraine from its main  suppliers, these matters at present are safely under the  supervision of the government. On 2 March, in particular, it  was decided to use gas more rationally, which would make it  possible to reduce considerably the consumption of gas by the  national economy. This will allow Ukraine to perform its  obligations in a stable manner in respect of the transit of gas  across its territory and will ensure the blue fuel is supplied  to European countries in full.    The government at the same time is taking steps to resolve  relations with gas exporters and resume its deliveries to  Ukraine at the level determined by interstate agreements.</p>

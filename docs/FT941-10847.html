			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / S Africa talks hit impasse Talks between the South African government, the African National Congress and right-wing groups demanding constitutional change broke down last night, increasing the threat of a violent boycott of April's all-race elections. The negotiations, which have dragged on for months without success, appeared to have reached a serious impasse, with no further talks scheduled to take place before Saturday's deadline for political parties to register for the elections. The talks broke down over the issue of the autonomy of regions under South Africa's interim constitution, with the right-wing Freedom Alliance demanding that autonomy be protected when the constituent assembly elected in April sits down to write a final constitution. ANC negotiator Joe Slovo said unless there was 'serious movement on fundamental questions on the part of the Freedom Alliance, I would say there is no hope.' Last night's talks took place against a background of sabotage attacks against railways, power lines and ANC offices. Police said there had been more than 40 such attacks in ultra-conservative areas of the Orange Free State and western Transvaal since December.</p>

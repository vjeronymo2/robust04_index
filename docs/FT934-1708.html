			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Littlechild pegs nuclear levy at 10% The fossil-fuel levy, the surcharge on electricity bills in England and Wales which subsidises the nuclear power industry and renewable energy, is to be held at 10 per cent for a further 12 months to avoid another row over rising fuel bills. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who sets the levy each year, said he considered this level to be the minimum necessary to raise the required Pounds 1.3bn a year. In the past Prof Littlechild said he thought the levy should come down each year. Last year he cut it from 11 per cent. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power utility which receives most of the levy proceeds, is also keen to see it come down to reinforce its claim that nuclear power can operate commercially. Last year's cut, however, meant that the levy did not raise enough to cover subsidies. It should have gone up next year to recover the shortfall and Prof Littlechild is believed to have proposed an increase to the government. But the Department of Trade and Industry, shaken by the row over the decision to impose value added tax on home-heating fuels, is said to have rejected his proposal and told him to freeze it for another year. Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, last night welcomed the freeze. 'Nuclear Electric gets less income from the levy in real terms each year, and we are firmly on course to be profitable before taking account of the levy within two years,' he said. The government is shortly to conduct a review of the future of nuclear power in the UK, in which the size of the levy is likely to be closely scrutinised. Ideally, the nuclear industry would have liked to see the levy come down again to drive home the message that its finances are improving, but in the circumstances a freeze is the best it can hope for. Prof Littlechild said the 10 per cent rate 'will apply until any further change in the rate is introduced. Barring unforeseen circumstances, I expect the 10 per cent rate to apply for at least 12 months from April 1 1994.' Prof Littlechild yesterday rejected an appeal by large energy users against reforms in the wholesale power pool, Michael Smith writes. Large users say the reforms miss an opportunity for significant change. Imperial Chemical Industries, one of the complainants, said the reforms proposed had been universally rejected by large users. It was 'yet another example of customer's interest not being taken seriously'. Under the proposed reform the pool is to introduce a system known as demand-side bidding through which large customers can agree to reduce consumption if the price goes above a certain level. This is expected by the pool to lead to average price cuts of about 1.5 per cent. ICI and other companies want demand-side bidding, but said the system did not go far enough in addressing their needs. They wanted a system which provided more incentive to cut consumption. Unlike the majority of electricity consumers, some intensive users of electricity have had to pay considerably more for electricity since privatisation. In rejecting the appeal, Prof Littlechild asked the pool to give careful thought to introducing the system and suggested a three-month trial. ICI said the system would bring no benefit to customers. The pool's reform had been due for implementation in October, but is now likely to be introduced early next year.</p>

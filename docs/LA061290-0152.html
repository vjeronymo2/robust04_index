			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KOLL CO. TO MANAGE HENLEY PROPERTIES' REAL ESTATE EMPIRE  </P> <P> The Koll Co. said Monday that it has been retained to manage the $500-million  real estate portfolio of Henley Properties Inc., including the controversial  housing development along the Bolsa Chica wetlands abutting Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> As part of the deal, Donald M. Koll was named president and a director of  Henley, and his Newport Beach-based firm was hired to oversee Henley's 15  Southern California properties and holdings in five other states.  </P> <P> Henley operates in California through its subsidiary, Signal Landmark Co. in  Irvine.  </P> <P> Neither Henley, a public company based in Hampton, N.H., nor the privately held  Koll would disclose the value of the contract. But the management agreement is  the largest ever for Koll, which has $4 billion worth of real estate under its  control, officials said.  </P> <P> "Don Koll and his highly respected organization will help us to accelerate the  development of our real estate projects and undertake various transactions to  realize the value of our holdings for the benefit of our shareholders," Michael  D. Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared  statement.  </P> <P> The contract allows Koll to participate in the profits that Henley makes from  its projects and also to use Henley's resources to purchase major blocks of  property.  </P> <P> "My major thrust is going to be not only to manage properties but to redo some  of the properties to try to get into large portfolios," Koll said. "We may buy  several large properties and either develop them or spin them off."  </P> <P> The management contract runs for five years with automatic one-year renewals.  Signal Landmark's 45 employees and many of the other 150 Henley Properties  employees will move into Koll headquarters in Newport Beach, he said.  </P> <P> "The whole thing is exciting to us," Koll said. "We'll have a public company,  which we will be in charge of for making profits."  </P> <P> While the Koll firm is privately held, Koll sits on the board of Wells Fargo  and Grubb &amp; Ellis.  </P> <P> Henley's biggest single holding is the 12,000-acre Bolsa Chica wetlands and  surrounding area which its Signal Landmark unit has been working on for years  to develop. In an intricate plan drafted last year with the city, Orange County  and the state, Signal Landmark reached a compromise that calls for preserving  most of the Bolsa Chica area as natural wetlands but allows up to 5,700 homes  on 412 acres on the bluff areas.  </P> <P> The city is attempting to annex the wetlands, and Henley is supporting the  effort. Henley and city officials said Monday that the corporate change would  not affect their agreement.  </P> <P> "Bolsa Chica is the key to the value of Henley Properties," said Walter D.  Sanborn III, managing director of investor relations for Henley Group Inc., the  former parent of Henley Properties. "It's the largest and most important  parcel, and it's best managed by someone in Southern California."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach city officials who were reached Monday approved of the  Koll-Henley deal.  </P> <P> "What we will have now is a shorter line of control," said City Councilman John  Erskine. "The Koll Co. is based in Newport Beach. It's a local firm, and the  control will be there, rather than out of state. I think that's good."  </P> <P> Michael Lennon of the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of  Southern California said the agreement "sounds like a good relationship" that  should avoid any conflict. Henley is primarily a residential land developer,  and Koll continues to build various office and commercial complexes.  </P> <P> Under the management contract, Koll has eliminated any conflict by agreeing to  give Henley first shot at most business opportunities, such as the purchase of  developable land, Sanborn said.  </P> <P> The deal with Henley is the latest in a series of major ventures Koll has  undertaken. Koll, for instance, recently acquired $300 million in property from  Wells Fargo Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust. It also tried unsuccessfully to  acquire 15,000 acres for $532 million from Union Pacific Corp.  </P> <P> Koll has built or is building office complexes in Newport Beach, Irvine,  Orange, San Diego and other California and Arizona cities. The firm is drawing  up plans for a $200-million Koll Anaheim Center and is building a $200-million,  28-story office tower in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The move to retain Koll is similar to other moves Henley Properties' parent has  made as it has spun off various businesses over the years.  </P> <P> The Henley Group itself was a 1986 spinoff from Allied-Signal Corp. The group  consisted of 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied, and it has been  reorganizing and spinning off companies ever since in an effort to increase  shareholder value.  </P> <P> The Henley Group moved from La Jolla two years ago and spun off Henley  Properties last December. Dingman is chairman of both companies. Koll replaces  Paul M. Montrone as president. Montrone remains president of Henley Group and  vice chairman of Henley Properties.  </P> <P> In its first quarter, Henley Properties lost $2.2 million on revenue of $12.6  million. The main reason for the loss, Sanborn said, was that the company  didn't sell any significant amount of real estate to offset continuing expenses  for the land it did own.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Billiter contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HENLEY PROPERTIES' HOLDINGS  </P> <P> In an agreement announced Monday, the Koll Co. will manage the holdings of  Henley Properties. Henley's Southern California holdings are owned through its  Irvine-based Signal Landmark unit. Henley's major properties include:  </P> <P> * Bolsa Chica, 12,000 acres including wetlands, slated for residential  development in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> * Fairbanks Highlands, 400 acres for residential development in north San Diego  County.  </P> <P> * Sycamore Valley, 325 acres for residential development in Poway.  </P> <P> * Coronado Cays, 1,200 waterfront marina units on Silver Strand in Coronado.  </P> <P> * Eagle Crest, 580 homes aroung an 18-hole golf course and country club in  Escondido.  </P> <P> * Industrial and business parks in Garden Grove, Ontario, Rancho Murrieta,  Corona and Signal Hill.  </P> <P> * 300,000 acres of forest land in Michigan and Wisconsin, mainly used for  recreation.  </P> <P> * 311-room Marriott Hotel at Long Beach Airport.  </P> <P> * Office buildings in Newport Beach, Long Beach, Signal Hill, La Jolla and Des  Plaines, Ill.  </P> <P> * Wentworth by the Sea, a resort hotel with golf course, marina and restaurants  in Rye, N.H. Owned as a joint venture.  </P> <P> * 10% limited partnership in 3,500 acres for residential development in Puako  and Ouli areas on the island of Hawaii.  </P> <P> Source: Henley Properties Inc.  </P> <P> </P></p>

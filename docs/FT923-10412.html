			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Lord Stevens goes as Invesco grows in US: Adverse publicity added to calls for a change in management The phased departure of Lord Stevens of Ludgate from the helm of UK-based fund manager Invesco MIM has been some time in the making, according to executives and directors of the company. His departure was undoubtedly hastened by adverse publicity which undermined the company's ability to attract new clients, both for its retail products and its wholesale fund management division. His close association with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, a well-publicised fine by regulators for sloppy administration of Personal Equity Plans and the disastrous investments of an Invesco MIM investment trust, Drayton Consolidated, also harmed the company's image. But individuals familiar with the firm say that ultimately, Invesco's shifting business mix meant that Lord Stevens' management style and focus were no longer appropriate. 'What underlies all this is a change in management style which is overdue,' said one senior Invesco executive. Lord Stevens' hands-on approach meant he was involved in the day-to-day decisions of the company while the focus of its operations was increasingly overseas. Executives and directors of Invesco MIM said they put pressure on Lord Stevens, who is 56, to retire. However, a financier close to Lord Stevens said he himself initiated discussions about reducing the burden of his responsibilities at the group almost six months ago. The proposal is said to have been recorded in minutes of an Invesco MIM board meeting. At the time, the group had been advised that its US operations were worth around Dollars 430m (Pounds 238m), more than the value put on the group as a whole by its stock market price. In January, and with the greatest secrecy, Invesco MIM began work on floating off the US business as a separate company. It employed the US investment bank Salomon Brothers as its adviser. Detailed work on the demerger was carried out, but a couple of months ago, the deal was dropped for two reasons: the market value of US fund management groups had fallen; a thorny tax problem had arisen, which meant that the US business was probably worth less as an independent company than had been hoped. If the demerger had gone ahead, Lord Stevens would have been at the helm of a much smaller group and the question of whether he was overburdened with responsibilities would have been less pressing. However, the issue of the group's management structure re-emerged once it became clear that the international business would remain intact. Shareholders had been concerned about Lord Stevens' role as a chairman of companies in which Invesco MIM had direct or indirect interests. In 1991 he earned Pounds 339,000 as chairman of United Newspapers, owner of the Daily Express, and was also chairman of Alexander Proudfoot, the management consultant, and the poor-performing Drayton Consolidated investment trust. 'We have been conscious of the fact that we have been criticised for holding interests in companies in which Lord Stevens has an interest,' said Mr Michael Perman, company secretary. However, he said Invesco MIM began to dispose of much of those interests some months ago. At a board meeting on Monday, it was decided that Lord Stevens' executive duties should be taken by Mr Charles Brady, who was appointed chief executive with immediate effect. Lord Stevens would retire as chairman at the next annual general meeting in the spring of 1993. Lord Stevens remained chairman of Alexander Proudfoot, and also of United Newspapers whose shares rose yesterday, probably on the assumption that he will have more time to devote to it. But Invesco MIM's share price also closed 9p higher at 75p. At Invesco, the US business has in effect taken control of the whole company with the appointment to the top executive post of Mr Brady, who built up the North America operations. At the same time, Mr Nicholas Johnson, in charge of the European and Pacific operations, has given up his title of joint deputy chairman. Invesco MIM's US operations are highly profitable - and have also had unusual success in penetrating the almost impenetrable Japanese pension fund management market. The latest accounts show the US operations now dwarf those in European and the Pacific. On the domestic front, the company has been hindered by a lacklustre investment performance for its pension funds under management and has had difficulty attracting new clients, according to pension fund consultants and industry analysts. 'There hasn't been much growth in its client base,' said Mr Philip Gibbs, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Lord Stevens' 30-year City career - most of it highly successful  - has been spent at companies now part of Invesco MIM. So his departure is something of a rite of passage for him - and for the company.</p>

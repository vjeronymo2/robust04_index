			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: COLOURFUL ANTHEMS TO BLACK-ROCK MOVEMENT *** 1/2 LIVING COLOUR  "TIME'S UP" EPIC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> "Elvis Is Dead" trumpets the gleeful, attention-getting track on this second  album from the hard-driving leaders of the black-rock movement. Well, so are  Malcolm X and Jimi Hendrix, but that doesn't stop them from being big  influences on this group.  </P> <P> And it doesn't stop Elvis either -- the frenzied abandon with which this  quartet often plays can be traced in part back to the Pelvis himself. The point  of the song, which does acknowledge Elvis as a great performer, is that he was  just the first white rock apostle -- it's certainly no coincidence that the  song locomotes along to a metalized James Brown riff. So it's no surprise that  in "Solace of You," when Corey Glover sings "Gotta go inside, back where it  started," he means Africa, a point confirmed by the song's South  African-inspired township jive shuffle and Mandela-inspired message.  </P> <P> Sound like a black-rock manifesto? It is, as was the band's 1988 debut album,  "Vivid." But thanks to matured songwriting and that frenzied abandon  (highlighting Vernon Reid's jazz-informed metal-master guitar heroics) it's  much more than that: a rousing collection that rocks hard and rolls poetically,  and that will be best appreciated by the colorblind -- but not the colourblind.

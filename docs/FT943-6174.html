			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Valuable service Sir, I have followed with interest your coverage of Lord Archer's dealings in the shares of Anglia TV. Your paper has frequently featured the problems facing small investors in their access to the Stock Exchange. I am sure that your readers would consider it a valuable service if you were to publish a list of other individuals who are prepared to deal on behalf of friends and acquaintances in the shares of public companies of which their spouse is a director. Paul J L Rex, Weavers, Gastons Lane, South Warnborough, Hants RG25 1RH</p>

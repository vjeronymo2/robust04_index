			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / BBC and Murdoch clash over news service BBC World Service Television has issued a writ against Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in an increasingly bitter row between the two organisations over the expansion of global television news. The BBC acted after Mr Murdoch's lawyers threatened to terminate its 10-year contract with the Murdoch-controlled Star TV system in Asia. Mr Murdoch's lawyers threatened to cancel the deal if the BBC went ahead with plans to launch an Arabic language television news service for the Middle East early next year. The legal clash reflects the intensifying battle in the growing market for global satellite television. Mr Murdoch plans to take Sky News, 50 per cent-owned by News Corp, around the world particularly to Asia. He wants to blunt BBC television's ambitious plans to launch television services in local languages around the world. Mr Bob Phillis, chairman of World Service Television and deputy director-general of the BBC, said last night: 'It is an essential part of our future strategy to develop World Service Television as a global news and information service.' BBC World Service Television has agreed with a leading Middle East industrial group to launch a 24-hours-a-day Arabic news service. The service, which is likely to be worth about Pounds 200m over 10 years to the BBC, would be carried on the Arabsat satellite and would be available throughout north Africa and the Middle East. It would operate separate London studios and newsrooms and draw on the strengths of BBC World Service Radio's established Arabic service. News Corporation's executives were unable to comment last night but the company is likely to argue that the areas covered by Arabsat overlap with the areas covered by Asiasat, the satellite that carries Star TV. The BBC has taken legal action in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London 'to clarify its relationship' with Star TV. The Corporation has issued a writ seeking a formal declaration from the court that the contract allows it to go ahead with the proposed Arabic channel. BBC executives believe there is no connection between an English language service for Asia and an Arabic language channel for north Africa and the Middle East. BBC World Service Television has also applied for an injunction preventing Star terminating its contract. A hearing is expected in the High Court on Thursday. Star TV broadcasts five channels of television, including the BBC service, to more than 30 countries in Asia. Independent research last January showed it reached more than 11m homes.

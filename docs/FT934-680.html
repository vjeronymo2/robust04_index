			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / The folly and the lively: Clay Harris rates this year's corporate greetings cards Slime does not spring to mind as the most tasteful object to feature on a corporate Christmas card, but UK biotechnology company Xenova has carried it off. Its photograph of a mould growing on a decaying log in a South American rain forest illustrates one source of its drugs in development. Xenova's card succeeds because it passes three tests of effective corporate communication in the festive season: it is imaginative, visually attractive, and it says something special about the sender. Each bad card, however, as Tolstoy might have said on opening his holiday post, is unhappy in its own way. Let us first award the annual blasphemy prize. The winner shows three wise men being greeted at Skipton Building Society with: 'You've heard about our Royal Sovereign then, have you?' There is obviously no holiday from promoting this savings product. Jollity at the expense of suffering also strikes a false note. Royston Investments, a futures fund manager, urges recipients to 'start 1994 with a billion' and encloses a 1bn dinar note from Yugoslavia. And Ofwat, the water industry regulator, cosily pictures itself as Santa Claus, addressing the halo-ed companies in its charge: 'Have you all been good boys and girls?' Anthropomorphic cartoon animals are another bete noire. Reindeer tend to suffer the most, nowhere more than on the card from Nomura International's corporate communications department in London, which has the poor creatures playing golf. The crowning insult is Nomura's logo visible through the cut-out cup. Other victims of logophilia include Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society and Everest double glazing. There is an emerging, and deplorable, tendency towards adorning cards with drawings by children, sometimes the progeny of an employee, sometimes the winner of a school contest. Most of these efforts belong nowhere more public than fridge doors of doting parents. Some genres are so hardy that they will survive any amount of scorn. Certain public relations consultants, venture capitalists and stockbrokers feel obliged to send their own group pictures or caricatures in 'humorous' situations. There is nothing to do but groan. Leeds Development Corporation has the naffest card. 'We'll give you something to toast this Christmas,' it says on an early 1960s-style photo of the hands of two businessmen holding brandy glasses in front of an open fire. And the British National Space Centre is rather heavy-handed with its view of the earth orbited by the words Observation, Communication and Science. But scientists, in general, had a good year. Three organisations plumped for colourful abstract images of their daily work. The Agricultural and Food Research Council shows gene sequence analysis for detecting pathogens in food, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory features an image of an ice crystal in the nuclear physics lab, and the European Space Agency gives an 'impression' of background radiation in the earth's environment. All these are no more than pretty pictures using bright artificial colours. They have little scientific relevance, but they identify the sender's business and they're eye-catching and that is enough. To some eyes the Financial Times's own card succeeded on the same terms. A reproduction of the FT's 1951 card, it features a variant of the 'Walking Newspaper' designed by Abram Games. Just old enough to have a retro look, it also served to commemorate the paper's centenary on pink paper. Some in the office debating society, however, felt it was too commercial. Even that criticism could not be made of a striking black-and-white panorama of the sledging masses on London's Primrose Hill, which was sent both by the Barnfather public relations agency and the London Clearing House, a provider of settlement services. The best religious/traditional card this year is an angel of peace from a 1480 altarpiece, sent by the PR firm Cardew, which flooded the City with cherubim in 1992. But for secularists, the winner is a stark photograph of frozen leaves from North West Water. In these politically correct days, senders cannot be too careful. BMW's card in the US shows a couple cruising along in a convertible with New Jersey plates, an image that smacks of smug nouveaux riches, the unintentional equivalent of an Essex joke. The humorously challenged are already crying: 'Hey, that's Joisey-ist]'</p>

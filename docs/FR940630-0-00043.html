			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those sections of COMAR 08.13.02 being repealed and incorporated into COMAR 08.20.02 and 08.20.13 are: .01 (Definitions), .02 (Application Requirements), .03 (Contents_Maps), .04 (Mining and Reclamation Plan), .05 (Projection Maps), .07 (Deep-Mining Bonds), .11 (Mine Opening Sealing), .12 (Barriers), .13 (Subsidence Control), .14 (Mine Operation), and .15 (Variances). The deletions of sections .06 (Application Review Procedures), .08 (Interim Permits), .09 (Flagging or Marking Affected Areas), and .10 (Standards) were previously approved by OSM on June 17, 1993 (58 FR 33331). In the same notice, OSM also approved deletions of subsections .01B, E, M; .02C(2); and .03E, J, M. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 being repealed are included in COMAR 08.20 except for 08.13.15 which has no comparable Federal requirement, the Director finds that the proposed repeal of COMAR 08.13.02 does not render the State program less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. COMAR 08.20.02.18_Deep Mine Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maryland is proposing to add COMAR 08.20.02.18 to specify certain requirements for deep mine permit applications. In addition to the general requirements for permit applications specified in COMAR 08.20.02, deep mine permit applications must include: (a) an application fee, (b) an application for other required permits, (c) certain mineral owner information, (d) a map of the proposed underground portion of the affected area which provides certain information, (e) cross-sections above the underground workings, (f) a geologic structure map which provides certain information, (g) results of laboratory analyses, if required, (h) information on existing adjacent deep mines, (i) certain hydrologic information, and (j) any other information requested by Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 783.24 and 783.25 specify the minimum requirements for maps, cross sections, and plans in underground mining permit applications. Since these application requirements are in addition to, and do not supersede, those required under COMAR 08.20.02, the Director finds them consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 783.24 and 783.25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. COMAR 08.20.13_Surface Effects of Deep Mines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) At COMAR 08.20.13.01, Maryland is proposing to change a reference from COMAR 08.13.02 to the Natural Resources Article, Title 7, Subtitle 5A. This is necessitated by the proposed repeal of COMAR 08.13.02. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that the proposed revision at COMAR 08.20.13.01 is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) At COMAR 08.20.13.03 (C) and (D), Maryland is proposing to require that all mine opening seals be designed using the best technology currently available and that the design and construction be certified by a registered professional engineer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.15 require that underground openings be properly managed in accordance with regulatory authority regulations. The Director finds that the proposed regulations at COMAR 08.20.13.03 are consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At COMAR 08.20.13.04(D), Maryland is proposing to require that surface openings and accesses to underground workings be located to prevent gravity discharge of water, unless certain demonstrations relating to effluent limitations are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation at COMAR 08.20.13.04(D) is substantively identical to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 817.41(i) except that the Federal rule prohibits any discharge from a drift mine. The Director notes that Maryland does not have drift mines. The Director finds it is no less effective than the Federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) At COMAR 08.20.13.10(D), Maryland is proposing to prohibit underground mining activities within the subjacent area where mining is predicted to result in the subsidence of any public bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(d) prohibit underground mining activities beneath or adjacent to public facilities if subsidence may cause material damage to those facilities. The Director finds that the proposed regulations at COMAR 08.20.13.10 is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) At COMAR 08.20.13.11, Maryland is proposing to require that barriers of solid coal be provided around the perimeter of the underground mine area, except for approved entries. The barriers must be able to support the overburden and withstand anticipated hydrostatic pressure. The barriers must meet certain design and performance standards which are enumerated in the Maryland regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

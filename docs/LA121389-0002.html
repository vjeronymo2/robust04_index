			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV WINS BATTLE ON PARTY ROLE  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a key political battle Tuesday when the  Soviet Congress, on the opening day of its winter session, refused to support a  call from reformists to consider whether the Communist Party should remain  enshrined in the constitution as the dominant force in Soviet society.  </P> <P> In a table-pounding speech, Gorbachev said those who want to amend the  constitution's Article 6, which makes the party the "leading and guiding force"  of the Soviet Union, are guilty of "political speculation" because they seek to  misuse the mood of change in the country and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We don't need to act on this matter as if it were an emergency," Gorbachev  said. "Why all this drama? We must approach the matter of constitutional  changes with great responsibility."  </P> <P> In East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, reform politicians have  shifted the role of the Communist Party so that it is no longer guaranteed the  position of supreme political power. On Monday, Bulgaria's leadership proposed  a multi-party system.  </P> <P> Progressives in the Soviet Union have sought similar changes, warning that the  Kremlin, which opened the way for new thinking throughout Eastern Europe, is  now lagging behind.  </P> <P> Poet Yevgeny A. Yevtushenko, who argued in favor of amending Article 6, told  the Congress of People's Deputies: "The authority of the party must not be  written in a paragraph. It must prove itself. It is important to the prestige  of perestroika (Gorbachev's reform program), to the prestige of the party, that  we change this article."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in putting down the challenge to the party's traditional role,  managed to deal handily with what had threatened to be one of the most  contentious issues the deputies would discuss.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, hundreds of lawmakers indicated their support of Yevtushenko's  call to put Article 6 on the agenda. The bid to include debate on the issue in  the current session was rejected by a vote of 1,138 to 839, with 56  abstentions.  </P> <P> "It was a noble defeat. We got many more votes than I expected," Yevtushenko  told reporters after the tally.  </P> <P> In the same vote, the deputies also turned down calls to debate other  constitutional articles dealing with land, property and the distribution of  powers between the country's 15 republics and the central government.  </P> <P> In what appeared to be in part a response to conservative critics who  questioned his low-key leadership tactics during a weekend Central Committee  plenum, Gorbachev demonstrated a leaner, firmer style in chairing the  congressional session.  </P> <P> He stressed the need for the 2,250-member Congress to avoid wasting time and to  concentrate its energy on critical economic issues, which are likely to be the  focus of most of the debate in the days to come.  </P> <P> "We need drastic reforms," he said. "So far, there are no improvements in this  area. . . . We have many problems and many important questions. But it is the  economy that people will be watching to see how we deal with it."  </P> <P> But a long debate over procedural matters put the Congress behind schedule even  on Day One, delaying the presentation of the government's economic plan by  Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzkhov.  </P> <P> However, Gorbachev indicated that he will not let glasnost, his policy of  openness, be misused as some critics argued it was during the previous  free-wheeling session last spring.  </P> <P> He said he will not permit deputies to "manipulate" the proceedings by taking  the podium to express views already aired by other lawmakers. In addition, he  held each speaker to a strict 60 seconds at the microphone, sounding a buzzer  to urge them to sit down, and continually warned that he wanted to hear only  from those with new proposals.  </P> <P> Gorbachev demonstrated that he intended to keep a tighter rein on the deputies  when he permitted human rights advocate Andrei D. Sakharov to take the podium  but cut him short when he began to discuss Article 6, about which Yevtushenko  had already spoken. Sakharov turned to Gorbachev and handed him a stack of  telegrams that he said supported amending Article 6.  </P> <P> "You come to me. I will give you three files of telegrams," Gorbachev responded  curtly, motioning Sakharov to take his seat.  </P> <P> The Congress, which is scheduled to meet for 10 days, is to consider ratifying  legislation passed last month by the smaller Supreme Soviet, including a law  that -- although stopping short of allowing private property -- would widen  ownership rights.  </P> <P> Another proposed law would permit farmers to privately lease land and pass it  on to their children.  </P> <P> The entire inaugural session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, held from  May 25 to June 9, was broadcast live on Soviet television. But this time, only  the opening of the Congress was broadcast live; the rest of the proceedings are  to be shown, probably in edited form, only in the evenings.  </P> <P> That is because the popularity of the first session cut work productivity by  20% as people across the nation tuned in to listen to the often-rambling  speeches about topics ranging from whether V. I. Lenin, the nation's founder,  should be entombed on Red Square to previously unpublicized atrocities carried  out under dictator Josef Stalin.  </P></p>

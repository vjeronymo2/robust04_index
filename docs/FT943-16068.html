			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Takeover rules Last week's purchase by Enterprise of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo may well have been within the rules of the takeover game. But that only goes to show that the rules need changing. A system that allowed Enterprise to offer a few large shareholders up to 169p for their Lasmo shares when the best most investors could receive in the market was 143p is blatantly discriminatory. Non-executive members of the Takeover Panel are pushing to have the rules reviewed. All power to their elbow.</p>

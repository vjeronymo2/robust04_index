			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COWBOYS MARCH PAST SAINTS, 17-13;  </P> <P> NFC: AIKMAN DIRECTS TWO 80-YARD SCORING DRIVES IN SECOND HALF TO OUTSHINE  FORMER DALLAS TEAMMATE WALSH.  </P> <P> Quarterback Troy Aikman continues to prove that the Dallas Cowboys made a wise  decision when they traded Steve Walsh to the New Orleans Saints in September.  </P> <P> Aikman outplayed Walsh Sunday in a duel of Dallas first-round draft picks as  the Cowboys kept alive their hopes for a wild-card playoff berth with a 17-13  victory.  </P> <P> Aikman completed 15 of 21 passes for 177 yards and directed two 80-yard  touchdown drives in the second half to help the Cowboys (6-7) beat the Saints  at Texas Stadium for the eighth consecutive time and score back-to-back home  victories for the first time since 1985.  </P> <P> Aikman had no passes intercepted for the first time in 14 games.  </P> <P> "Troy was just excellent," said Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson, who made the  decision to trade Walsh, the quarterback who won a national title for him at  the University of Miami. "Troy made some great plays against an outstanding  rush."  </P> <P> Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards for the Saints (5-7).  </P> <P> But Aikman, who beat out Walsh in training camp, completed all 11 of his passes  in the second half, including a five-yard scoring pass to Darryl Johnston for  the go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "It was tough putting the duel with Steve out of my mind, but I just took a 'I  don't care attitude,' " Aikman said. "Steve and I spoke before the game. I  think he played well, hitting some key passes."  </P> <P> Said New Orleans Coach Jim Mora: "I was very disappointed in our defense in the  second half. We didn't play to our potential."  </P> <P> Dallas cut a 10-0 halftime deficit to three points when Aikman connected with  Kelvin Martin on a 45-yard pass play to set up a one-yard touchdown run by  Emmitt Smith on the first possession of the second half.  </P> <P> Dallas also got a 47-yard field goal from rookie Ken Willis with 53 seconds to  play.  </P> <P> "That helped because New Orleans had to drive the length of the field without  any timeouts," Johnson said.  </P> <P> The field goal came after Mora had decided to punt on fourth and 10 from the  Dallas 38 with 3:29 left.  </P> <P> "I thought we could hold Dallas and get the ball back," Mora said.  </P> <P> Saint kicker Morten Andersen said he thought he could have made what would have  been a 55-yard attempt. He had kicked a 50-yard field goal earlier in the game.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to second-guess the coach's decision," Andersen said. "He wanted  to punt. It would have been a longshot, but I feel I could have hit it."  </P> <P> Walsh guided the Saints on a 13-play, 89-yard drive in the second quarter.  Passes of 22 yards to Gill Fenerty and 13 yards to Floyd Turner set up a  15-yard scoring run by Rueben Mayes, who rushed for 59 yards in 13 carries.  </P> <P> Smith gained 85 yards in 20 carries for the Cowboys.  </P> <P> The victory, which was sweet revenge for a 28-0 loss to New Orleans last year  in Jimmy Johnson's NFL coaching debut, marked the first back-to-back home  victories for Dallas since 1985.  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Chad has standby deal problems Chad is already having problems meeting the terms of a new standby agreement signed with the IMF in March and risks suspension at the mid-term review in September unless it can increase customs receipts, Reuter reports from N'djamena. 'In reality there is a risk,' said Mr Albert Pahimi, finance minister. A 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc last January hit the landlocked central African country hardest of all the franc zone members, economists say. 'We accepted devaluation at Dakar out of solidarity,' Mr Pahimi said yesterday. 'In Chad the CFA franc was overvalued by only about 20 per cent.' Since devaluation, inflation has soared to 54 per cent, according to World Bank figures. The country's main export is cotton, and it has to import basic foods and petroleum products. A key pillar of the standby agreement was an increase in customs receipts, which Mr Pahimi said were not keeping pace with targets set by the International Monetary Fund.</p>

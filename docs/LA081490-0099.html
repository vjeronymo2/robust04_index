			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> PROGRAM TRADING PUSHES DOW 30.20 HIGHER ON LIGHT VOLUME  </P> <P> An afternoon rally sent stock prices higher Monday after a steep opening slump,  but trading was reduced by a Wall Street power outage that curtailed operations  at the American Stock Exchange and several brokerages.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks rose 30.20 to 2,746.78. But  declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancing ones in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 766 down and 479 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume slowed dramatically, totaling 122.82 million shares on the Big Board,  down from 145.34 million Friday.  </P> <P> The market opened with a thud, with the Dow plunging as much as 32 points in  the first half hour. The drop followed steep losses overseas on continued  worries about the Mideast crisis. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei index  posted its fourth-largest percentage drop ever, losing 1,153.12 points, or  4.2%, to 26,176.43. It was the lowest close in two years.  </P> <P> But prices in New York began to pick up in the afternoon in a "light-volume  rally," said Dudley Eppel, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette  Securities. He said the market had reached an "oversold" state, and some  investors came in to bargain hunt.  </P> <P> Computerized program trading also was a big influence. "In the light-volume  days the computer controls the tape. It takes it right out of our hands," Eppel  said of the program trading.  </P> <P> Many analysts advised against reading too much into the rally, noting that the  market remains hostage to events in the Mideast and to economic concerns.  Foreign markets' dismal showings may weigh on Wall Street as the week  progresses.  </P> <P> Trading on the American Stock Exchange, as well as on the New York Mercantile  Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, was cut off shortly after 1 p.m. EDT after  a fire knocked out power in Manhattan's financial district. The exchanges were  forced to halt trading for the rest of the day.  </P> <P> The NYSE wasn't affected, but many brokerages said operations were curtailed.  </P> <P> Market highlights:  </P> <P> * Leading the Dow higher were IBM, up 1 3/4 to 103 3/4; Kodak, 2 1/2 to 43 1/2;  Merck, 2 1/8 to 86 7/8; and Procter &amp; Gamble, 1 7/8 to 81 3/4.  </P> <P> * Some growth stocks continued to rebound from their recent declines. Compaq  Computer rose 2 3/8 to 56 1/4, Disney added 2 1/4 to 109 and Home Depot gained  1 1/4 to 35 3/4  </P> <P> * Investors continued to snap up shares of drug and food firms, classic  "defensive" stocks in a recession. Ralston Purina jumped 2 1/2 to 94, Heinz  added 7/8 to 33 3/8 and Bristol Myers rose 1/2 to 61 3/4.  </P> <P> * Biotech stocks, red-hot before the recent market plunge, roared back. Amgen  jumped 3 1/8 to 47 on the first day following its 2-for-1 stock split. Chiron  rose 1 3/4 to 38 1/4, Genzyme gained 1 5/8 to 18 and Centocor leaped 1 3/4 to  40 1/2.  </P> <P> * Oil stocks were mostly higher. Arco rose 2 1/4 to 137 1/4, Unocal added 5/8  to 32 5/8 and Mobil jumped 1 1/4 to 67 1/8. Meanwhile, gold stocks soared as  the price of gold rocketed. ASA jumped 2 1/4 to 54 1/4 and Newmont Gold rose 2  1/2 to 53 5/8.  </P> <P> * Big gainers among Southland stocks included electronics distributor Marshall  Industries, up 1 to 24 1/8; computer firm AST Research, 1 1/4 to 21 1/8, and  Western Waste, 1 1/4 to 19 1/4.  </P> <P> * Midway Airlines rocketed 2 1/8 to 9 5/8 on a report that American Airlines  may be looking at bidding for Midway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bond Prices Hurt by Inflation Fears  </P> <P> Long-term government bond prices fell Monday on inflation worries and  oversupply concerns in a session abbreviated by a power outage in lower  Manhattan.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/16 point, or about $3.13 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield rose to 8.81% from 8.79% late Friday.  </P> <P> Trading, which was light, came to a virtual standstill after a power outage  shut down most of New York's financial district, including almost all primary  dealers of government securities.  </P> <P> Traders also were awaiting a series of economic reports due later this week  that could provide more evidence of economic weakness, and thus point to  further Federal Reserve moves to lower interest rates. The reports include  today's release of July retail sales and Thursday's report on consumer prices  in July.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.125% when power failed around 1 p.m. EDT. That was up  from 8% late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Dollar Pulled Down by Interest Rates  </P> <P> The U.S. dollar slumped against major foreign currencies, which are expected to  strengthen as interest rates rise overseas while rates fall here.  </P> <P> The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks because of weakness in the  U.S. economy, and many traders expect the Federal Reserve will eventually move  to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy to keep it from a  recession.  </P> <P> In New York, the dollar fell sharply against the German mark, buying 1.578  marks versus 1.589 on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was at 150.25 versus  150.40 Friday.  </P> <P> The dollar also lost ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound  rose to $1.8825 from $1.8735 late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Grain Prices Fall After Rain Arrives  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures fell sharply and livestock and meat futures were  mixed. Rain fell Monday in the Mississippi Delta region, where  drier-than-normal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean crop.  </P> <P> Weather forecasts predicted a continuation of beneficial crop weather in the  Midwest, where the bulk of corn and beans are grown.  </P> <P> In a six-to-10-day forecast released after the close of grain trading, the  National Weather Service predicted normal- to above-normal temperatures and  normal precipitation in the Midwest for the first half of the week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AFTERNOON RALLY  </P> <P> The Dow industrials slid more than 32 points in the first half-hour of trading  but struggled back before jumping 30 points near the close.  </P> <P> Friday close: 2,716.58  </P> <P> Monday close: 2,746.78 up 30.20  </P></p>

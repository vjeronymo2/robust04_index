While talking about the continued efforts made to boost  agriculture with science and technology, the passage "maintain  the ranks of scientific researchers in agriculture" has been  added.    2. On the question of continuously alleviating the peasants'  burden, the passage "the outstanding problems should be tackled  in a special way" has been added.    3. "Improving the quality of population" has been appended  to the question of family planning.    4. "Improving the distribution methods and developing and  perfecting the treasury bond market" has been appended to the  issue of treasury bonds.    5. While introducing the experiment of establishing a modern  enterprise system in light of the "Company Law," there is the  additional sentence "to spread the system, we should vigorously  sum up experience and gradually develop standard measures for  implementation."    6. On the part of running a clean administration and  fighting corruption, the passages: "They also constitute a  damage to reform, opening up, and the modernization program";  "are absolutely impermissible"; and "we oppose a proneness to  boast and exaggerate" have been added after: "The introduction  of the principle of commodity exchange to political activities  by state organs and the exchange of power for money seriously  distort the principle of a socialist market economy."    7. The passage: "Oppose and resist bad activities which  disrupt unity among the people, hinder social progress, and harm  the healthy growth of young people" has been added after:  "Strengthen management over the cultural market according to  law and use rich, varied, and healthy spiritual products to  allow the cultural market to flourish."    8. "Rural health work must be enhanced" has been added to  the question of health development.    9. "Advocating the spirit of thrift, economy, and hard work"  has been appended to the part on strengthening the building of  spiritual civilization.    10. "Earnestly implement the `Law on Regional Autonomy'" has  been emphasized in the section on nationality work.    11. Talking about the resumption of China's sovereignty over  Hong Kong and maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and  stability, the following passage has been added: "We hope that  the compatriots of Hong Kong will join the people of the whole  country, make concerted efforts, and contribute to this cause."    12. Discussing diplomatic work, the following has been  temporarily added in light of the new circumstances: "I would  like to tell our deputies a piece of news just received. In the  vote by the UN Human Rights Committee yesterday, the motion on  using human rights to oppose China submitted by some countries  encountered another setback. This fully shows that the  anti-China trend finds little support. On behalf of the Chinese  Government and the people, I would like to express my heartfelt  thanks to all countries which uphold justice." In the  amendment, this passage has been included in the report.    13. There is an additional passage: "Vigorously blaze new  trails, rely on our own strength, and build our country through  arduous efforts" at the end of the report.    In addition, some amendments have been made in wording.    After the finalized "Government Work Report" has been  adopted  tomorrow afternoon (22 March), the full text will be issued on  23 March.</p>

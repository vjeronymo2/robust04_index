			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE, 15, FACES A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRESSURE  </P> <P> Born in Canada, reared in Florida and living in France, 15-year-old Mary Pierce  holds three passports, a No. 136 ranking and a great deal of promise.  </P> <P> It isn't easy for someone so young to become part of the news, except for those  who make a big splash in tournaments, as did 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati and  16-year-old Monica Seles.  </P> <P> So far, Pierce is best known for what she has left: the U.S. Tennis Assn., Nick  Bollettieri's Tennis Academy, Harry Hopman's camp, Florida, America and the  lasting impression that her father, who is also her coach, might be the most  overbearing tennis parent of all.  </P> <P> Jim Pierce, 54, picked up and moved his family to his wife's native France  after a row with the USTA over financial and coaching support for his daughter.  In a recent Sports Illustrated article, the elder Pierce acknowledged, among  other things, to once yelling during a match, "Mary, kill the bitch."  </P> <P> Mary Pierce, who said she has not read the story, is loyal to her father.  </P> <P> "He doesn't do anything to hurt me or anything like that," Pierce said. "He's  on the court trying to get the best out of me. I don't see anything wrong with  that."  </P> <P> Asked what her father does, Pierce said: "Nothing, he watches me."  </P> <P> The elder Pierce travels with his daughter as she struggles to break in on the  pro tour. Coming into next week's Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at Manhattan  Country Club, Pierce has won $23,920 this year and $31,958 overall.  </P> <P> Unlike Capriati, who signed endorsements worth $5 million, Pierce has no  endorsement deals.  </P> <P> Pierce is still highly regarded as a potential star. At 5-feet-10 and 120  pounds, she plays an aggressive baseline game designed to put pressure on her  opponent.  </P> <P> Until recently, it was difficult to know for sure who Pierce's opponent might  be. Before the French Open, Pierce announced that she wanted to represent  France, rejecting the USTA. She played in the Federation Cup for France two  weeks ago in Atlanta.  </P> <P> Pierce's task will be to try to be equal to her buildup while riding out a  semi-controversial start. She said she can do it.  </P> <P> "To me, I don't feel any pressure," Pierce said. "When I go on the court, I'm  having fun. So I don't worry about it."  </P></p>

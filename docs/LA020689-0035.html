The probe began after two charities complained that they  received no money.  </P> <P> Hundreds of young professional singles over an 18-month period flocked to the  benefits for the Jimmy Fund, a Boston children's charity, the U.S. Olympic Swim  Team, the American Cancer Society and the Pine Street Inn, a shelter for the  homeless, the Boston Sunday Herald reported.  </P></p>

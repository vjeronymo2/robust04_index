			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXTBOOK PANEL DEFENDS TEACHING EVOLUTION AS FACT  </P> <P> Despite a barrage of criticism from religious fundamentalists, the authors of  proposed guidelines for science textbooks refused Friday to back away from  their recommendation that evolution be taught as accepted fact in California  schools.  </P> <P> In a move that prompted fundamentalists to demand the resignation of its  chairman, the Science Committee of the California Curriculum Commission agreed  to make no "substantive" changes in its controversial proposal. The committee  decided to delay its request for a formal commission endorsement until  September, however, to give it more time to prepare the document.  </P> <P> "If it's war they want, it's war they're going to get," said the Rev. Louis  Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition. "The issue still  continues to be the same -- that this framework is stating that evolution is a  fact. When it does that then it (evolution) becomes a religion de facto."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scheduled to Vote  </P> <P> The guidelines or framework tells publishers exactly what material is to be  included in textbooks purchased by California school districts. The commission,  which had been scheduled to vote on the proposed guidelines Friday, presents  recommendations to the 11-member state Board of Education, which then makes the  final decision.  </P> <P> Fundamentalist religious groups had demanded that all references to the  teaching of evolution as fact be erased from the proposed framework and that it  make provisions for science teachers to present other theories on the origin of  man, including creationism.  </P> <P> After an informal review of the Science Committee's proposed framework, the  state board urged the committee in a letter to modify the guidelines so they no  longer included "an advocacy statement for evolution."  </P> <P> "They (the Science Committee) have now thumbed their noses at the state board's  request, which probably will lead to an impending crisis this fall," Sheldon  said. "The Curriculum Commission and its Science Committee are on a collision  course with the board, and the board is going to have to dump somebody, and  we're calling for the committee chairman's resignation. She needs either to  resign, be fired or repent."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Discussion  </P> <P> "I'm leaning toward repentance," said Elizabeth Stage, the professor who now  heads the California Science Project at the University of California's  statewide office.  </P> <P> Stage, a prime author of the proposed framework, said in working on the  document, the committee will answer the board's request by providing additional  discussion in the guidelines on why scientists say evolution is a fact.  </P> <P> "In other words, it will discuss the facts, the evidence on which the theory is  based. The facts and the evidence about which there is not much doubt," she  said.  </P> <P> The committee will also address criticism of the various theories within  evolution, she said, but "substantively we won't change" the framework.  </P> <P> People for the American Way, a 270,000-member organization that has promoted  the teaching of evolution, said the committee's decision -- while a "defeat for  anti-evolution forces" -- will now mean both sides will be focusing their  attention on the state board.  </P> <P> "The battle is far from over as the anti-evolution forces will put a full-court  press on the members of the Board of Education," said Michael Hudson, Western  director for the organization.  </P></p>

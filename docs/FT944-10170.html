			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhone Poulenc to launch integrated farming trial Rhone Poulenc, one of Europe's largest agrochemicals groups, said yesterday that it would start an experiment in Integrated Crop Management to run alongside its trial organic farm in Ongar, Essex. The company said it would monitor its use of agrochemicals and artificial fertilisers more closely as well as looking at the use of rotation systems and different forms of cultivation in order to farm in a more environmentally-friendly way. 'We are really taking modern technology and combining it with the best traditional methods,' an official said. The new study will take place on 24 hectares on the company's Bundish Hall Farm, which is adjacent to Boarded Barns where organic methods have been employed on 24 hectares for the past five years. Rhone Poulenc has found that the gross margins on its organic sector have consistently been around half of those achieved on its conventional acres. Over a four-year period, the cumulative gross margin per hectare has been Pounds 2,557 for the organic part and Pounds 5,487 for the conventional fields. 'All our indications are that the gap will continue to widen between the organic and conventional profit levels,' said a company official, 'with ICM we're looking at a refinement of the conventional system.' The new ICM approach aims to be as profitable as conventional farming since any slight reduction in yields should be compensated for by the lower cost of agrochemicals and other inputs which will be reduced. A large cost for the organic land is the need to grow a fertility crop such as clover every couple of years in the land's rotation system to improve soil fertility.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL;  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL DORADO GATHERING MOMENTUM  </P> <P> Steve Gullotti, El Dorado High School baseball coach, pointed to a small mound  of dirt about 10 feet outside the Golden Hawks' dugout and proclaimed that the  freshly dug grave held all the trappings of his team's past.  </P> <P> "We buried the past right here," Gullotti said. "The players tossed in old  wristbands, batting gloves and even a helmet. The idea was to bury the past  rather than have it come back to haunt us."  </P> <P> El Dorado, a favorite to win the Empire League title, pushed aside the memory  of a mediocre 2-2 start in league play Friday by defeating rival Esperanza,  5-1, in Placentia.  </P> <P> Pitcher Jay Hassel (1-0) allowed only two hits after relieving starter Matt  Luke in the second inning to gain his first victory in three years.  </P> <P> For the past two years, Hassel has been sidelined with major knee and ankle  injuries that have kept him out of uniform for the entire season. Hassel, a  lanky right-hander, struck out five and received two sparkling plays by right  fielder Greg Fife in the seventh inning to keep Esperanza (6-5-3, 0-4-1)  winless in league play.  </P> <P> "Jay did a great job," Gullotti said. "The best thing he did was throw strikes.  He threw his curveball with confidence and went right after them."  </P> <P> El Dorado (11-5, 3-2) scored the only runs Hassel needed in the second inning,  taking advantage of a throwing error by losing pitcher Greg Hauser (2-3) that  allowed Travis Dowdell and Tim Walker to score.  </P> <P> El Dorado added three more runs on three hits in the third inning.  </P> <P> Esperanza scored its only run on a second-inning homer by catcher Keith  McDonald that carried well over the 345-foot sign in right-center field. The  Aztecs had only four hits and made two errors.  </P> <P> Esperanza has qualified for the playoffs in six consecutive seasons, advancing  to the large-schools championship game the past three years. But the Aztecs  appear to be going nowhere this year.  </P> <P> "We're not a bad team, but we're struggling," said Mike Curran, Esperanza  coach. "We're not hitting and we're not fielding, and you're not going to win  too many games that way. Hopefully, we'll get better, but it's getting awfully  late."  </P> <P> Loara 10, Katella 8 (8 innings) -- Matt Drager hit a two-run homer with two  outs in the bottom of the eighth to give the Saxons (6-9, 3-2) the victory.  Katella tied the score, 8-8, with three runs in the top of the sixth. Jessie  Evans had a two-run single in the inning. Loara scored five in the fifth, two  on a single by Rusty Tamblyn. Billy Fitzgerald had two hits and three RBIs for  Katella (8-5, 4-1).  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 11, Cypress 7 -- Brian Havens' grand slam in the fourth pulled Los  Alamitos into a 4-4 tie and the Griffins added another run and never trailed  again at Cypress. Los Alamitos (3-2 in league play) added two in the fifth and  four in the sixth to break the game open. Cypress (3-6-3, 1-3-1) was led by  Kevin Smith, who was three for four.  </P></p>

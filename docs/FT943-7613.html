			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: SSAB on course for record Big price rises and higher volumes led to a tripling of first-half profits at SSAB, putting the Swedish steel group on course for record full-year figures. Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.05bn (Dollars 133.2m), up SKr715m from a year ago, after a 20 per cent rise in sales to SKr7.6bn. Full-year profits are expected to be more than double 1993's SKr776m. This would exceed the SKr1.58bn profit achieved in the 1989 boom year. SSAB, already benefiting from rigorous cost-cutting and the weak Swedish currency, is seeing a strong pick-up in the market. First-half prices were 15 per cent higher than a year ago, and they accounted for 13 percentage points of the group's increase in sales. Volumes, accounting for the balance of the sales increase, have been driven up by rising demand in Sweden and the rest of Europe. Mr Leif Gustafsson, chief executive, said: 'The recessionary phase seems to have ended and steel demand is once again increasing on most western European markets.' Margins improved because raw material prices were only 6 per cent higher than a year ago, and the increase in processing costs was held to 3 per cent. The best performance came from the group's Tunnplat steel plate division, where profits after financial items climbed to SKr557m from SKr58m on a 29 per cent increase in sales to SKr4.05bn. In the second half, the group will benefit from mid-year price increases and a further weakening of the krona, although holiday production and maintenance stops will mitigate their impact.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Management: Multinationals face game of snakes and ladders - Companies must change the way they recruit and retain staff There can hardly be a company in Europe, America or even Japan where employees are not fearful for their jobs because of current economic pressures and the more deeply rooted trend towards 'delayering' and 'downsizing' of organisations. But this does not mean that the fast-growing number of companies with international operations can now forget their late-1980s worries about how to recruit and retain highly skilled managers and other employees. Far from it. This is not only because the much-debated 'demographic time-bomb' is still very much a reality in most European countries: a sharp fall is occurring in the number of 15 to 19-year-olds, which will be followed by stagnation well into the 21st century - except, curiously, in the UK, which has been experiencing a baby boom. At the same time, many companies that increased their workforces in the 1960s will face retirements en masse after the year 2000. The effect of this will be compounded by the declining popularity among some employees of a single-company career. Many people are becoming more choosy about what might be called the quality of life in the workplace. A number of other factors is also contributing to the recruitment and retention problems of multinationals in particular: international mobility is being hit as managers take more account of the wishes of their working spouses and children; and a growing number of adults is reluctant to move because they care for ageing parents. The continued existence of all these challenges emerges from an article in the latest Sloan Management review by Paul Vanderbroeck, human resources manager of Shell Research in Schwabenheim, Germany*. He suggests a series of actions that multinational companies should take in response to all these challenges. Some actions are obvious, others less so. Companies will need to hire - and promote - more women. They must broaden their recruitment by hiring more people abroad, not just for local jobs, but ones throughout the company. They should hire more older managers, with more experience. And they should consider introducing a flexible retirement age for key staff, in order to retain high-quality people longer. At the same time, however, they should use 'outflow management' as a real career development tool for people who have peaked and really would be better off elsewhere. They should get more out of existing managers through training and job rotation. To keep the workforce flexible and deployable, a substantial and unrelenting effort will be required. Multinationals will have to fight competition from small businesses and other employers. They may be able to 'market' themselves to graduates and others by demonstrating the challenges offered by their own new organisational structures - ones which favour small units, quick lines of communication, and entrepreneurship. Companies with newly shallow structures will also need to develop horizontal and diagonal career lines in order to reward staff and avoid career plateaus. It cannot be overstressed, says Vanderbroeck, that a condition for successful horizontal career development is the decoupling of hierarchy and remuneration. A manager's remuneration should be based on skill and contribution, not on the conventional basis of position in the hierarchy, size of budget and number of subordinates. As for international deployment, multinationals will have to provide services to the spouses of expatriate managers, helping them find jobs. 3M, the US group, offers a dislocation allowance, subsidies for studies abroad, and placement service allowances upon return. *Long-term Human Resource Development in Multinational Organisations.

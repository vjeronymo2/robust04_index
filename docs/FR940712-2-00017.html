CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000 (Paiute Expansion II Projects). The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 14 and June 15, 1994 Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) filed amendments to its two original applications that represent a change in the scope of the Northwest Expansion II Projects. Based on the changes in the amended filings, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an EIS is the more appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with Northwest's projects. The cooperating Federal agencies agree with this strategy. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis the important changes are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The deletion of 8 pipeline loops from the projects, which reduces the total miles of pipeline construction from 177.2 miles to 54.9 miles;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The deletion of 11 compressor station modifications, which reduces the required compression from 88,235 horsepower (hp) to 14,820 hp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The addition of 5.8 miles of 20-inch-diameter loop in Marion County, Oregon (the Salem Loop) and 1,070 hp at the existing Pegram Compressor Station in Bear Lake County, Idaho that were not part of the original proposals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The deletion of 26 of the 37 originally proposed meter station modifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The change in pipeline routing of both the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The termination of service agreements by all shippers that had proposed to have Northwest deliver gas to Paiute for ultimate delivery to customers in Nevada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of facilities proposed in the amended filings are in appendix 1 and maps showing the location of the Salem Loop, the Pegram Compressor Station, and the amended routing for the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral are attached as appendix 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .

The remaining facilities are part of Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The length and location of the Gresham Loop is the same in both applications; however, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 Northwest proposes using 20-inch-diameter pipeline, while Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;00 proposes using 30-inch-diameter pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The termination of all contracts that called for Northwest to deliver gas to Paiute effectively severs the connection between Northwest's and Paiute's proposals; therefore, only Northwest's proposed facilities will be included in the EA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Our EA will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concludes that the projects would result in significant environmental impacts, we will prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise we will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Local scoping meetings have already been held for the original projects. Additional scoping meetings are not planned. We are asking for comments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on those portions of the projects where the routing has been changed or the facilities were  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  part of the original proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Geology and paleontology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Visual resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wetland and riparian habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fish and wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Socioeconomics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the projects, or portions of the projects, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal. You do not need to re-submit comments if you have already done so. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reference Docket Nos.

Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 3. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Mailing List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If you don't want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information Request (see appendix 4).

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Enterprise in extremis: The outlook for European union is bleak, whatever the outcome of the French referendum The game is up. Whatever the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday, it is hard to see how the treaty's grand vision of European political and monetary union can survive in its present form. In Brussels yesterday, Britain's bloody retreat from the European exchange rate mechanism - coupled with Italy's temporary abstention - was hailed as a necessary measure to maintain confidence in the European Monetary System. But the Anglo-Italian moves - matched by the devaluation of the Spanish peseta - raise the prospect of a two-tier Europe, with the weaker economies dropping behind a 'hard-core' block led by Germany. Maastricht's goal of monetary union for all of the Twelve by the end of the century, never easy, now seems remote indeed. Moreover, the atmosphere of recrimination which accompanied Britain's retreat - particularly the charges in London of Bundesbank sabotage forcing the devaluation of sterling - seem certain to poison the immediate prospects for future European co-operation. 'What (these events) demonstrate is the fragile nature of the Community,' says a senior EC official. For three months since Danish voters narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty last June, European heads of government have insisted that the enterprise could be salvaged. They have stuck to this view, despite growing doubts about the treaty in Britain and, more importantly, in France and Germany, the driving forces behind greater European integration. Maastricht was conceived in what now seems a distant era of optimism. Although the treaty contained important provisions on a common social policy, foreign policy and tentatively defence, the most important bargain was struck on monetary union. Germany agreed, under French pressure, to trade its D-Mark for an ill-defined political union and the goal of a single currency, at the earliest by 1997, at the latest by 1999. In retrospect, as some senior officials in Brussels admit, Maastricht may have been a bridge too far. The Danish referendum has exposed the gulf between the Europe planned by the technocrats and heads of states and the Europe of the people - a point Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president and arch-federalist, now concedes. More important, the events of the past week have exposed what may be an even more fundamental flaw: the notion, implicit in Maastricht, that a united Germany could be tied down by treaty constraints to the point where Europe co-operation takes precedence over perceived vital national interests. Perhaps the turning point came earlier this month during an informal meeting of finance ministers in Bath when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, were ambushed by their 11 counterparts and urged to lower interest rates to help a general European economic recovery. 'It was a bloodbath,' says one participant. At one point, according to another source, Mr Waigel had to restrain Mr Schlesinger from walking out of the meeting, so enraged was the Bundesbank chief by the pressure he was put under. This private arm-twisting may explain, first, the Bundesbank's grudging cut of  1/4 percentage point in the Lombard rate this week, and Mr Schlesinger's subsequent comments in an interview - later denied - that he favoured a broader realignment of currencies in the ERM. Mr Schlesinger's comments helped to propel the emergency meeting of the EC monetary committee which ended at just before 6am yesterday morning and which killed British hopes of persuading the other member states to suspend the operations of the ERM until after Sunday. The currency game has still to play out. If President Mitterrand's gamble of putting the treaty to a referendum pays off, and there is a Yes vote, there is some prospect of relief for the weaker EC currencies. If the vote is No, further speculative attacks seem inevitable. In political terms, a Yes vote would put tremendous pressure on all EC states - including Denmark and Britain - to support Maastricht unequivocally and quickly. The problem is that the Danish government wants more time to prepare public opinion for a possible second referendum. The UK government's position is no less delicate. Faced with growing opposition to the treaty on his backbenches, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, must also do his duty as holder of the six-monthly rotating EC presidency. The risk, says one EC official, is that Britain will find itself once again isolated, as France and Germany debate what comes after Maastricht if there is a No on Sunday. For this reason, it seems likely that Britain will call a summit of the heads of state shortly after the French referendum. The aim would be to salvage what is left of the treaty, rather than to engage in a full-scale renegotiation; to push for broader European co-operation without necessarily drawing up new Community law; to initiate enlargement of the Community; and to press for completion of important business such as the single market. This 'business as usual' approach is characteristically British. There must be some doubts about whether Mr Major can carry it off.</p>

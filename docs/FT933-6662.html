			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / RTZ sells Pillar to MB-Caradon MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group yesterday agreed to buy most of the Pillar industrial businesses of RTZ, the mining company, for around Pounds 800m. MB-Caradon also announced a Pounds 334m rights issue to help fund the cash purchase. The deal will double MB-Caradon's building products turnover, and compares with the group's market value of Pounds 1.43bn yesterday morning. MB-Caradon's shareholders are to vote on the deal, and on a name change to Caradon, reflecting the increased scale of the building products activities. RTZ expects to realise about Pounds 900m from the sale of the whole of Pillar, and plans to sell the remaining loss-making activities 'as soon as practicable'. It faces an exceptional loss of Pounds 165m, but the sale will cut its gearing from 40 to 14 per cent. MB-Caradon said after the deal its gearing would be around 24 per cent but this would rise once 'fair-value adjustments' had been made to the assets. The share prices of both companies responded positively to the deal, which was trailed last week. MB-Caradon's shares rose 24p to 336p, compared with the one-for-four rights issue price of 260p, and RTZ's were 9 1/2 p higher at 712p. The businesses being bought cover most of Pillar's building products and electrical and engineering operations, including brands such as MK Electric, Friedland door bells, Peachtree and Better-Bilt doors and windows. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of MB-Caradon, said 84 per cent by turnover of the Pillar businesses being bought fitted with existing MB-Caradon activities in building products and automotive components. The businesses being acquired made an operating profit of Pounds 75.4m in 1992. The purchase price compares with net assets at the end of 1992 of Pounds 426m, rising to Pounds 462.8m at the end of June. MB-Caradon also reported interim results showing pre-tax profits slightly down at Pounds 59.5m before the exceptional profit on its CarnaudMetalbox stake sold in April. The businesses being bought made interim operating profits of Pounds 39.7m, up 20 per cent, on sales of Pounds 538m, up 12 per cent. Lex, Page 16 Background, Page 19</p>

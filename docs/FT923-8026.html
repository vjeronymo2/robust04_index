			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson faces lawsuit over drug pricing JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, the US healthcare group, is being sued for charging 100 times more for a drug in humans than animals. The medicine, Levamisole, is the first effective treatment for colo-rectal cancer. It is also used to de-worm sheep, horses and cattle. A suit has been filed in Cook County, Illinois, alleging the drug costs Dollars 1,495 a year in humans but only Dollars 14.95 in sheep. The plaintiff, Mr Frank Glickman, said this was unfair pricing practice and 'outrageous and unconscionable'. His lawyers want the suit to be considered as a class action. The suit follows considerable pressure on drugs groups in the US to restrain price increases and keep down the cost of new medicines. About 20,000 Americans could be treated with Levamisole, according to Dr Charles Moertel, of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Cancer of the colon and rectum is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in the US. Dr Moertel believes 7,000 deaths could be prevented if the treatment was widely used. Mr Robert Kniffin, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice-president for media relations, said: 'It is one of the wonders of modern US society that you can sue anybody for anything and get publicity for it.' He said Levamisole had been available for veterinary use for about 20 years. But Johnson &amp; Johnson had invested tens of millions of dollars on clinical trials to ensure it was safe and effective in humans. About 1,400 studies on 40,000 patients had been conducted. The company needed to recoup its investment. It had a programme to provide the medicine for those unable to pay. The drug was not dearer than other cancer therapies, and was cheaper than hospital care, said Mr Kniffin. 'We don't see any merit in this law-suit. If it comes to court we will prevail.' Levamisole, which is also known as Ergamisol, was licenced in the US two years ago for colo-rectal cancer. Combined with another drug, it reduces the risk of a cancer relapse by up to 41 per cent. Mr Kniffin said patients should not take the veterinary version. Active ingredients might be similar, but other chemicals in the drug would be different and could have harmful side-effects.</p>

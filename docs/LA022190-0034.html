			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> DESTRUCTION OF MONO COUNTY STREAM DOESN'T GO TOTALLY UNPUNISHED  </P> <P> When Mono County Judge Edward Forstenzer fined Nevada farmers $5,000 for  destroying a trophy trout stream last week, he went as far as the law allowed.  </P> <P> A $1,000 fine on each of the five misdemeanor citations -- four from the state  Fish and Game Code -- amounted to the maximum penalty.  </P> <P> The essence of the jury's verdict was that the Walker River Irrigation District  had rights to the water in Bridgeport Reservoir but didn't have the right to  draw it off in such a way as to destroy the East Walker River fishery, which is  what happened in September of 1988.  </P> <P> Forstenzer also ordered the district to run a 400-cubic-feet-per-second flow  for 14 days to flush out silt in the stream and to maintain a 30-c.f.s. minimum  flow year-round to prevent icing.  </P> <P> Since the defendant was an entity and not an individual or individuals, the law  did not allow for jail time.  </P> <P> Forstenzer, himself a fisherman with a reputation as a conservationist, agreed  with angling interests and Mono County District Attorney Stan Eller, who  prosecuted the case, that the maximum penalties he imposed weren't strong  enough to have a punitive effect.  </P> <P> Jim Edmondson, Region 5 Manager for CalTrout, says his group will push to  change that and also to increase fines for similar violations.  </P> <P> "You've got to make the fines commensurate with the action," Edmondson said.  "Society wants these abusers punished.  </P> <P> "(But) we're pleased that this is a victory. We've never won a case like this  before. It sends a very strong message."  </P> <P> The Committee to Ban Gill Nets -- in conjunction with Cortez Yacht Charters of  Lemon Grove and Aames Travel of Irvine -- is auctioning a fishing trip to Cabo  San Lucas in an attempt to raise money to stop the controversial practice of  gill-netting off the Southern California coast.  </P> <P> Bids must be submitted to the committee (P.O. Box 2323, Cypress, Calif., 90630)  by March 1, with the highest bidder winning a three-night stay at the Melia  Cabo Hotel, four days of fishing aboard the 32-foot Melisa, with an  English-speaking captain, and round-trip air fare.  </P> <P> The bidding will start at $1,300 and all will be kept secret until the winner  is announced. Estimated value of the prize is $2,500.  </P> <P> The committee is also accepting donations and urges the public to get involved  in its petition drive to put an initiative on the November ballot. Copies can  be obtained by calling (714) 828-9269.  </P> <P> The Wildlife Waystation in San Fernando, a haven for injured and displaced wild  animals and birds, is an official charity of the Los Angeles Marathon March 4.  The Waystation is seeking runners who will run for pledges. Details: (818)  899-5201.  </P> <P> San Diego long-range: The Polaris Supreme returned from a 16-day trip to the  Revillagigedo Islands Saturday with its 18 passengers having caught 152  yellowfin tuna, 187 wahoo and 149 grouper. Armin Loepfe of San Diego topped the  list with a 235-pound yellowfin.  </P> <P> Cabo San Lucas: Rough seas that cooled the striped marlin fishing have calmed  and fishing has been slowly improving, according to Darrell Primrose of Tortuga  Sportfishing.  </P> <P> Primrose said hotel boats are averaging one striper a boat per day and that  fishing for dorado, roosterfish and pargo has improved.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The oil booms were lifted Monday, and the Newport Bay sportfishing landings --  Davey's Locker and Newport Landing, shut down since Feb. 8 -- are back in full  operation. . . . Fred Hall's Western Fishing Tackle and Boat Show will be held  Feb. 28-March 4 at the the Long Beach Convention Center. . . . Those interested  in working in an outdoor environment are alerted to the 352-page third edition  of the National Parks Trade Journal, a guide to employers at parks, ski  resorts, lodges and organizations worldwide. The guide is available , at  $14.50, from the journal at P.O. Box 2221, Wawona Station, Yosemite National  Park, Calif., 95389. . . . . Irvine and Santa Ana Lakes will receive six  18-pound rainbows each Thursday morning as part of a campaign to break the lake  records. The trout are "triploids," sterile hybrids. The Irvine record is 14  pounds,10 ounces, Santa Ana's 16-11. Manager Steve Miller said anyone catching  a record fish can have it mounted free of charge. The lakes also got 3 1/2 tons  of rainbow plants last week and are due for another 3 1/2 tons Thursday.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Pete Thomas contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / ICI wins water tariff discount: Argument in favour of the big users could affect domestic charges NORTH West Water has agreed to cut its tariffs at Imperial Chemical Industries' complex at Runcorn by 25 per cent after appeals to Ofwat, the water regulator, that some big users are being overcharged. The rate cut for the site in north-west England takes effect next month. It could prompt other large users in England and Wales to seek discounts. Although this would be welcomed by industry as a benefit of privatisation, water companies would make up any shortfall by raising prices elsewhere, including charges to domestic users. Ofwat said ICI approached the regulator about a year ago to discuss tariffs at the site and was followed by several other big users. Gatwick airport had since negotiated a 25 per cent tariff reduction from East Surrey Water, which came into effect at the start of April. Tariff reductions are not automatic and big users need to show that the costs of supplying them are lower. ICI argued that it was supplied at Runcorn directly from North West Water's trunk mains rather than the more expensive household distribution network. ICI is the UK's largest industrial user of water with annual water bills of over Pounds 20m. The North West Water agreement will save a 'substantial six figure sum' each year, the company said. 'If these circumstances apply elsewhere, we will expect similar treatment,' said an official. ICI has been a leading critic of rising utility prices since privatisation. The company is still in discussions with the government about lower electricity prices for its Runcorn site, where its main product is chlorine. North West Water said ICI had made a 'particular' case for a reduction because it was supplied directly. The company had not yet laid down general rules to decide whether other customers deserved lower tariffs. The discounts were welcomed by Ofwat as 'correcting imbalances' between water users. In the past, industrial users and owners of large properties have subsidised small domestic users. These imbalances were being addressed by the water companies already and agreements with large users like ICI will accelerate the process. But the discounts will be attacked by water companies, which already face pressure to keep prices down yet improve water and sewage quality. Mr David Highet, director of communications at North West Water, warned that the lower charges for big users could mean higher bills for consumers. 'The money has to come from somewhere. We will recoup it from the customer base in future years.' Exchange halts deals, Page 10 Lex, Page 24</p>

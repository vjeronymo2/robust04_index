			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Department of Legal Information at </F> Ukraine's Ministry of Justice and UKRINFORM: "A Warning by  Ukraine's Ministry of Justice"; date not given]    [Text] On 5 January 1993, Ukraine's Ministry of Justice  registered the World Jewish Agency "Sokhnut" as a public  organization whose main goal is to assist Ukraine's Jewish  population in reviving its culture and traditions.    Despite the fact that the Agency's statutes clearly define  the trends of its activity as studying the history of the Jewish  people, providing assistance in holding Jewish national  holidays, developing ties with the state of Israel and Jewish  communities of other countries, the Agency and its head are  carrying out active work aimed at illegally boosting the  emigration to Israel, under the pretext of education purposes,  of the most intelligent, gifted, and physically fit boys and  girls aged between 15 and 17, so that they would subsequently  adopt Israeli citizenship and Judaism. We believe that this is  interference in our state's internal affairs by Sokhnut, since  the education of Ukraine citizens abroad is regulated by  interstate agreements or bilateral agreements between  educational institutions that are only concluded through  coordination with the appropriate power structures. So far,  there are no such agreements between Ukraine and Israel.    Such activity developed by Sokhnut extends far beyond its  statutes and is in violation of Ukraine's Constitution and  Ukraine's law "On Public Associations."    In addition, in accordance with information provided by the  chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in the Kiev City State  Administration, in violation of the requirements specified by  Article 24 of Ukraine's law "On Public Associations", Sokhnut is  not, to this day, registered by the State Tax Inspectorate and  is evading taxes in foreign currency. It conducts its financial  operations through small enterprises, in particular, through the  small enterprise "The Green Theater."    On the basis of the above and proceeding from Article 29 of  Ukraine's law "On Public Associations," Ukraine's Ministry of  Justice, as a legalizing body, is issuing a warning to the  Agency for the violations of the law committed by Sokhnut.  Should such illegal activity continue, the Ministry of Justice  will consider taking stricter measures, as stipulated by current  legislation, against the Agency to the extent that it may be  forced to disband (to be abolished).</p>

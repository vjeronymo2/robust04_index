The new policy will take effect Sept. 1. N.Y. York Atty. Gen. Robert  Abrams, who announced the change in Albany, N.Y., said a Ford dealer's decision  to provide warranty service on cars purchased elsewhere is the exception rather  than the rule, adding that Ford agreed to change its policy after talks with  his office.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: David Brown offer oversubscribed The offer of shares in David Brown Group at 178p as part of the Huddersfield gear maker's flotation was oversubscribed 6.2 times. All 16,300 valid applications will receive some shares. About 58 per cent of the 7.7m shares available to the public will be allotted to applicants who applied for 5,000 or fewer shares. About 50 per cent of applicants will thus receive at least half the shares they applied for. Up to 10 per cent of the shares in the offer were reserved for employees and pensioners of David Brown. Applications for these shares will be satisfied in full.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / CBI optimistic over recovery prospects for small companies THE most optimistic assessment of prospects for smaller companies for two years emerges from the latest survey of industrial trends published by the Confederation of British Industry today. The quarterly industrial trends survey for smaller manufacturing companies showed that though large companies are expected to continue to shed many jobs over the next four months, smaller businesses employing fewer than 200 people each will make only a small reduction in employee numbers. Small companies as well as large have cut jobs recently. But over the next four months the number of small companies cutting employment is likely to be almost balanced by those taking on more people, the CBI said. The survey of small businesses found that: Twenty-eight per cent said they were more optimistic about the general business situation, while 18 per cent were less optimistic. On balance, 10 per cent more businesses expected new orders to increase over the next four months. A positive balance of 10 per cent expected an increase in volume output over the next four months, compared with 13 per cent which had recorded a decline in the previous four months. Cost pressures were at their weakest since the smaller companies report was started in 1980. Export orders declined in the preceding four months at a slightly faster rate than experienced by larger manufacturers but they are expected to increase again over the coming four months.

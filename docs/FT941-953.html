			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Police branch out to prevent theft Police are cracking down on thefts in car parks in remote beauty spots by sitting in trees. The campaign was launched after a spate of thefts of possessions left in the backs of cars instead of being locked in the boot. About 300 drivers reported thefts from their cars at beauty spots near Keswick last year. Thieves in the Lake District have found officers appearing out of the blue - summoned by an officer sitting 30ft above the ground.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>   Limits of Tolerance -- "It is time to stop talking of `dirty  tricks'" as it implies "low-scale misbehavior, peccadillos" or  "at worst, paper burglaries of the Watergate kind. Murder is not  a `dirty trick'" to be "shrugged off or glossed aside," notes an  editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 25-26 June  on page 8. "Now that an inquest court has judicially implicated  the Civil Co-operation Bureau in the murder of SWAPO [South-West  African People's Organization] advocate Anton Lubowski after  five years of rumor, suspicion, slow disclosure and considerable  hush-up, justice needs to proceed with dispatch and  determination to an end result." While the "era behind us  involved a psychosis of war" and "wrongs were done on both  sides," however "a moral line must be drawn, and the moral line  can never encompass cold murder." It is necessary to learn who  committed what crimes "and where the chain of command stopped.  The Lubowski suspects should be extradited to Namibia.  Internally the truth commission should become a priority,  unopposed by anyone with a clear conscience."  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Disclosure -- "A note of desperation has crept into the  attempts of Mr F. W. de Klerk's government to prevent disclosure  of criminal actions committed in defense of apartheid." The  "common feature" of the Windhoek inquest into the Lubowski case,  the Goniwe inquest, the David Webster case and others "is that  neither judicial inquiries, nor inquests, nor prosecutions  succeeded in penetrating the web of deceit woven by the  Nationalists," states an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES  in English on 23 June on page 28. "All these inquiries seem to  peter out just below the level that would implicate either the  top officers of the security services, or the politicians who  guided them. The glue that holds the conspiracy together is  secret amnesty and secret indemnification, in terms of laws  crafted by the de Klerk government." "We know that our present  government includes killers and torturers, and people who sent  them to kill and torture." "To fix responsibility for crimes or  atrocities committed in the past, whether in defense of  apartheid or in the struggle against it, does more than identify  the guilty: it also exonerates the innocent."  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Robin Hood Budget -- "It is called the Robin Hood budget,  Minister of Finance Derek Keys taking from the rich to give to  the poor," states an editorial in the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN  in English on 23 June on pages 1 and 2. "However the 5 percent  transition levy on taxpayers and companies earning more than  R50,000 [rand] is hardly confined to the rich." The "levy aside,  Mr Keys produced a somewhat bland budget." He did not remove or  increase the VAT [value-added tax], "imposed modest increases in  excise duty on cigrettes, wines, spirits and beer," "cut the  corporate tax from 40 percent to 35 pewrcent, but raised the  secondary tax from 15 percent to 25 percent." "This was to our  minds a sleight-of-hand budget, socking the middle amd  upper-income taxpayers and giving little to the poor directly in  pension and other social benefits." "In essence, what his Budget  has given is fair warning that the redistribution of wealth has  begun."    Their Role -- While the "hand of the ANC" can be seen in  some  of the budget decisions, "the government as a whole has to take  the blame," for "there is joint Cabinet responsibility for all  decisions taken by the government and all actions by the  ministers, whatever their portfolios," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English also on 23 June on page 6.  With the "overwhelming" ANC "majority of votes and seats in the  Cabinet, it will increasingly have its way on issues that put it  into power like the Reconstruction and Development Programme and  the redistribution of wealth and land. How the National Party  [NP], as a junior partner in government, handles this situation  remains to be seen. It can either become a comfortable ally of  the ANC or a vigorous opposition party in Parliament and outside  it." IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Buthelezi "has an even  more difficult task" since "he continues to be under attack from  the ANC." "As there is no opposition of any consequence in  Parliament, it is left "to the NP and IFP to be standard bearers  of opposition politics. Will they, especially the NP, do so? The  political future of these parties and of the opposition will  depend on the answers."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Red Recipe -- "Red lights are starting to flicker," notes a  page-22 editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 26  June as it criticizes the appointment of Ronnie Kasrils as  deputy minister of defense. "The appointment of Ronnie Kasrils,  a communist activist of the highest degree as deputy defense  minister, does not only give an indication of the ANC's  `security course,' but is symptomatic of how the South African  Communist Party [SACP] is quietly getting its hand on important  levers of power." Another communist, Mr. Sydney Mufamadi, is  already minister of safety and security, the former police  portfolio. The Red recipe is clear for everyone to see: "Get  control of a country's security apparatus firstly, and work  further from there on." "The exact same strategy was adopted in  the former Czechoslovakia, in Poland, in Bulgaria and many  others." Defense Minister Joe Modise said about the appointment  of Mr. Kasrils that the ANC has been very generous, as it is  capable of running the country on its own, but prefers not to do  it. Mr. Mandela has also referred to Mr. Kasrils as his  favorite. "Indeed a meaningful remark, to say the least."  Shortly after his appointment, Mr. Kasrils rejected the nine  generals' disapproval of the proposed Truth commission as  "irrelevant," and added that there had always been an "openness"  in the ANC/SACP freedom struggle. The editorial goes on to call  Mr. Kasrils a "shadowy figure" who "played a dubious role in the  Bisho massacre," and concludes by asking: "What has he and his  party, and by implication the ANC, up their sleeves? And which  further Red strategy is quietly being devised at the SACP  headquarters?"</p>

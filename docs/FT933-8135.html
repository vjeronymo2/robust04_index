			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Kuwaiti labour plea A KUWAITI trade union yesterday accused manpower companies of ill-treating foreign workers and demanded greater legal protection including a minimum wage for the labour they provide, Reuter reports from Kuwait. 'These companies have greatly damaged Kuwait's image abroad through their continuous violations of labour laws and their inhuman practices including trading in humans,' the Union of Oil and Petrochemical Industry Workers said. Hundreds of manpower companies provide foreign labour to state-owned corporations such as oil companies. Two thousand foreigners employed by a local manpower company went on a rampage during a one-day strike earlier this month, overturning cars and smashing up rooms at the Kuwait National Petroleum's Mina Abdulla refinery. The workers, mainly Indians and Bangladeshis, complained of bad food and living conditions and irregular wage payments.</p>

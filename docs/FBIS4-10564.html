			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Monica Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Last Wednesday, President Patricio Aylwin finally  received the Treasury Inspector's Office's first report on the  huge losses amassed by Codelco [Copper Corporation]. And the  chief executive must have breathed a sigh of relief upon being  informed that--as found by the country's principal auditing  body--the responsibility for those losses stops at the level of  Codelco's former chief executive officer, Alejandro Noemi.    At this point in time, after an exhaustive examination of  the  proceedings of Codelco's Board of Directors, after taking the  depositions, not once but several times, of its former  executives and of others who are still with the Copper  Corporation, after a thorough analysis of a large number of  operations with brokers, and after having heard the testimony of  Juan Pablo Davila at least twice (the last was on 14 February),  the Treasury Inspector's Office has concluded that there was a  flagrant breakdown of the control systems in place for  supervision of the operations conducted by the Department of  Futures Markets.    In a separate paragraph of the report, Treasury Inspection  officials Raul Ailtken, Marcelino Pineda, and Martin Garrido  conclude that: "The spirit and regulation relative to metals  market operations were systematically violated by the Department  of Futures Markets, without any supervisory monitoring of the  situation having been exercised by the committee created for  this purpose, the management, or the deputy manager for sales."    The cited committee consisted of Gonzalo Trivelli, vice  president of marketing; Ignacio Guerrero, vice president of  finance and treasury inspection; Owen Guerrini, sales manager;  Carlos Derpsch, deputy sales manager; and Davila himself.    The report finds that the committee, created on 24 September  1990 to evaluate periodically and oversee the operations managed  by Juan Pablo Davila, ceased functioning on 13 August 1992, the  date of record of the minutes of its final meeting.    The Treasury Inspector's Office is delving, furthermore,  into  several of the contradictions incurred by Davila since the  irruption of the case. For example, Codelco's former operator  has insisted that the computerized monitoring systems that it  had been decided to use in futures operations were not used  because they were inoperative.    After a diligent on-site investigation at Codelco's head  office, however, the Treasury Inspector's Office found that, two  years ago, the company decided to purchase this monitoring  equipment. In December 1991, the necessary hardware--an A.S.400  computer--was purchased, and simultaneously, a contract was  signed for procurement of the software. The contract bore a  German signature.    The investigation revealed that since April of last year the  complete system has been in operating condition, and that it was  not put into operation not because of any technical fault or  lack of any element in the system, but simply because the data  that Davila was to provide was never inputted.  <H5>  November: Key Month </H5>   But there is more. The Treasury Inspection experts also  discovered a situation that goes back to a date in November of  last year and that has become a key piece in the investigation.    On that date, two of Juan Pablo Davila's management  superiors, Carlos Derpsch and Gonzalo Trivelli, were informed  that as of that moment Codelco had open positions into 1994  involving losses on the order of $10 million. That is, the  margin of exposure expressly set by Noemi when he authorized  operations of that type had been exceeded by a factor of 10.    The information concerning these losses did not emanate from  Juan Pablo Davila on that occasion, but from one of his  subordinates, operator Gonzalo Sanchez, who for that reason had  to testify more than once before Minister Benquis.    That seems to have been the starting point of all the  confusion as to whether Davila actually realized gains of more  than $30 million in 1992. Be that as it may, it turns out that,  instead of immediately ordering the placement of stop-loss  orders, as they should have, Trivelli and Derpsch allegedly  instructed the "star" operator to transfer the loss to 1993.    Moreover, the Treasury Inspector's Office report cites  another fact that can hardly pour oil on the government's  troubled waters. According to the above-named experts, losses  could exceed the $206 million figure by an amount close to $40  million. The definitive figure will have to be determined month  by month, step by step, given the high degree of fluctuation of  copper prices on the international market, and the impact they  will have on the still open operations effected by Juan Pablo  Davila.</p>

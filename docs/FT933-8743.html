			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ontario court ruling deals blow to PWA PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, has suffered a setback in its attempt to gain a vital CDollars 246m (USDollars 189m) equity injection from American Airlines. The Ontario Court of Appeal has rejected PWA's attempt to have the Gemini reservations system declared insolvent. This would have allowed Canadian to switch to American's Sabre system - a condition of American's equity investment. PWA is also asking the Federal Competition Tribunal to free it from Gemini, and has offered its partners in the system - Air Canada and a group of US airlines - a CDollars 20m settlement. Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, appealed to the federal cabinet to intervene and force a negotiated settlement between Canadian and its Gemini partners. However, Air Canada replied that it would not negotiate the winding-up of the reservation system. PWA would not say whether it will take the Gemini issue to the Federal Court of Appeal. Confederation Life, one of Canada's top four life companies, is looking for a capital infusion, after raising CDollars 240m earlier this year with a European debenture issue. Mr Paul Cantor, president, said the company was looking at several options, including a preferred stock issue, converting the mutual into a public shareholder-owned company and finding a partner. Canada's 'big six' chartered banks are considered potential strategic partners.</p>

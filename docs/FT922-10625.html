			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Italcementi buys control of rival ITALCEMENTI, Italy's largest cement company, has expanded its international operations by buying control of one of its chief competitors, Ciments Francais, from Poliet, the French building materials group, for FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn). The deal is the latest twist in the saga of Ciments Francais, which was taken over by Poliet, part of Paribas, the powerful French financial group, only last year. It also reflects the consolidation of ownership within the European construction industry, which is under intense pressure because of the economic slowdown. As part of the deal, Ciments Francais will stage a FFr5bn capital increase to be underwritten by Paribas and Mediobanca, the Italian bank advising Italcementi. This will leave Italcementi with a direct holding of 30 per cent in Ciments Francais. It will also have a two-thirds interest in an additional 15 per cent held with Poliet, which will directly hold 15 per cent. Mediobanca will own 5 per cent of the shares with the remaining 35 per cent in public issue. Italcementi is launching a L648bn (Dollars 520.48m) rights issue to help finance the purchase. Shareholders will be offered one new ordinary or savings share, priced at L5,000, for every two of the respective category currently held, raising L335bn. A further L313bn will come from options on new non-convertible savings shares to be issued as warrants linked to a Mediobanca bond for the company. The balance of the total purchase price of around L1,660bn will come from Italcementi's existing liquidity, which was L854bn at the end of 1991. Ciments Francais, like other building material businesses, has had a tough year. It recently announced a 59 per cent fall in 1991 net profits to FFr401m, on sales up 6.5 per cent to FFr16.5bn. Italcementi, which announced 1991 results yesterday, raised group sales by almost 6 per cent to L1,649bn. However, net parent company profits fell 10 per cent to L145.8bn. The combination of Ciments Francais with Italcementi, which dominates its domestic market, will create one of the world's largest cement groups, with a combined workforce of 24,000 and joint output of 38m tonnes of cement. The two are largely complementary. Ciments Francais has expanded outside France to establish a presence around the Mediterranean, notably in Spain and North Africa. Italcementi has expanded through investments in Cyprus, Czechoslovakia and the US.</p>

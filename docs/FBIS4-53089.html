			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- A survey on retail prices in  Japan by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  indicates that consumers actually pay less for daily necessities  than shown in the government's official monthly survey, MITI  said Monday [16 May].    MITI's own survey found that prices for 23 of 25 items  posted  lower price indexes than under the management and coordination  agency's official monthly consumer prices survey.    The price index of video tapes, for example, was 171.3 in  the  February survey by the agency against 100 in the MITI survey  conducted during the same month, MITI said.    A MITI official said at a news conference that MITI's survey  is more reflective of the actual retail price trend in Japan  under the growing emergence of discounters.    The official said MITI used price-evaluating methods  including covering products sold in a bundle, such as videotapes  and notebooks.    The MITI survey, the first of its kind in Japan, was  intended  to assess how the Japanese Government's deregulation policy has  impacted prices on store shelves, the official said, apparently  dismissing arguments that the government has been reluctant to  narrow a large price gap between products at home and abroad.    The survey results can be taken to indicate that the  purchasing power of Japanese consumers is stronger than  generally believed, the official said.    Other products that showed a large price gap with the  official price survey included long-sleeved white shirts with an  index of 147, tissue paper at 127.9 and television sets at  113.7, all against the base of 100 in the MITI survey.    The MITI survey, conducted in Tokyo, also found that price  gaps are wide among the various store categories.    The average retail price index for the 25 items surveyed was  87.2 among discount stores, 113.1 among convenience stores, 96.7  among supermarket chains and 120.5 among department stores.    Such prices gaps from one store category to another indicate  not only the intensity of the ongoing price war in the retail  sector but also a sharp expansion in product choices available  to the consumer, the MITI official said.    Among the polled items, men's underwear showed the sharpest  price gap from one store to another, followed by tissue paper,  videotapes and winter business suits, MITI said.    On the other hand, items such as shampoo, paper diapers and  health beverages showed the smallest price gaps among stores,  MITI said, apparently because they are sold at their makers'  recommended prices.</p>

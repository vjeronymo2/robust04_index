			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia are  surprisingly young and thus constitute a danger to Estonian  national security. The Estonian Foreign Ministry has emphasized  this in a statement. The document notes that of 10,500 retired  Russian military men here, 6,000 are under 60 years of age; over  1,000 are under 50; and 360 men are as young as 35 to 45.    Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of the Russian talks delegation,  said at a news conference yesterday that the majority of the  retired servicemen are elderly people who must be allowed to end  their days in peace. As is known, Russia is refusing to  conclude a troop withdrawal agreement if no agreement is signed  simultaneously on social guarantees for the retired military  men. The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Svirin's claim  about the retired servicemen's age is not accurate. A typical  retired serviceman living in Estonia is a former  counterintelligence officer or a paratrooper, aged 36-46, the  Foreign Ministry declares in its statement.    The Foreign Ministry stresses that Russian military presence  in any form at all is very dangerous for Estonian security.  Russian retired servicemen not only generate anxiety for the  local population but have also close links with criminal  elements, the statement says. The Foreign Ministry adds that  despite these circumstances Estonia has introduced a procedure  whereby retired servicemen can apply for residence permits. As  the issue is very important from the point of view of state  security, Estonian officials must process each case on an  individual basis. This is what the statement says, according to  BNS.</p>

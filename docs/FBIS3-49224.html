			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak in New York, Ewa Szymanska in </F> Washington, T.T.S. and Wojciech Pomianowski in Berlin, and  Krystyna Grzybowska in Bonn: "Fever Before  Summit--USA-NATO-Central Europe"]    [Text]  <H5>  Will Clinton Manage To Convince Walesa? </H5>   Whether President Bill Clinton will score a success during  his European trip will depend on whether he manages to convince  the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary about his  "Partnership for Peace" proposal--that, according to the Tuesday  [4 January] edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES. If he does manage to  convince them, everyone will be satisfied; if not, then,  according to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. President will find  himself in a troublesome situation.    THE WASHINGTON POST also pointed to Walesa's and Havel's  skepticism with regard to "Partnership for Peace." "There is  nothing good about it," the Polish president said, and he also  announced that he will demand security guarantees from NATO  within the next six months. THE NEW YORK TIMES pointed to a  precondition set by Foreign Minister Olechowski that has to be  met before Poland joins "Partnership for Peace": a clear  expression of the goal--that is, acceptance by NATO of new  members and also of the criteria the candidate countries must  meet. According to U.S. Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter,  Olechowski's preconditions will be met. At the same time, U.S.  diplomats have been making assurances that "Partnership for  Peace" does not mean a "new Yalta."    In the same issue of THE WASHINGTON POST, commentator Jim  Hoagland notes that, even though during the Brussels summit the  United States should redefine its leadership role with regard to  its NATO partners, which was so clear during the Cold War, one  should not require that the United States solve European  problems, such as the conflict in Bosnia, for example. But,  after all, what could one expect from Washington if Marshal Tito  himself said that Yugoslavia would fall apart after his death?  Richard Cohen writes in an article right next to the previous  one. The message from both articles is unanimous: U.S.  leadership will never be a cure-all for all of the problems of  Europe and the world.    Is the United States turning its back on the Old Continent  and heading toward Asia? The administration denies that, while  stressing that President Clinton will visit Europe as many as  four times this year: during the NATO summit, on the 50th  anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, during the July  G-7 summit in Naples, and, in the fall, on the occasion of the  summit of the CSCE, which will take place in Hungary. Europe is  waiting to see what kind of a vision of its future and of U.S.  involvement on the Old Continent Bill Clinton will suggest, Jim  Hoagland says at the end.  <H5>  Meeting in Milwaukee </H5>   This coming Thursday, President Bill Clinton will meet  Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak Americans in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin. Members of the White House Security Council scheduled  a dinner with so-called leaders of ethnic communities for  Wednesday.    The highlight of the Milwaukee events will be the  president's  speech on the occasion of his European trip. According to White  House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers, Clinton will be trying to  convince the American nation about the need for continued active  involvement in European security issues.    The "Partnership for Peace" proposal aroused great anxiety  among Americans from Central Europe. A flood of phone calls to  the White House and letters to the president were initiated as  part of a Coalition of Central European Countries, in which  appeals are being made to the President to take into account the  security requirements of Central European countries. The appeals  point to potential dangers stemming from leaving Central Europe  in a gray area.    A special phone line was launched in mid-December, through  which one can send a telegram to the White House with a  ready-made text, in which a postulate is made of accepting  Poland as a NATO member. The Polish community availed itself of  this modern type of lobbying. It seems that the meeting in  Milwaukee is a result of the campaign and also a victory by the  Polish ethnic group, which, up to now, was regarded as  politically passive.  <H5>  Walesa: West's Desertion </H5>   In an interview with BBC Radio, President Lech Walesa  accused  Western countries of having left Central Europe to its own fate.  He said the West acted in a hesitant manner and rescinded its  earlier promises of accepting Central European countries into  NATO because Russia had spoken out against it.    "Boris Yeltsin sensed the West's indecision and selfishness,  and that is why he set preconditions," the president said. "But  he set these preconditions not on Poland at all but on NATO.  Meanwhile, the West is acting as if it could not see that at  all. What are Western countries afraid of when Russia approves  of the principles of pluralism and democracy and wants to  establish them?" Lech Walesa asks. "Are they afraid of a vacuum  being created? That is not just a simple fear; that is  desertion."   <H5>    Markus Meckel: Need for Binding Commitment </H5>   "We need a binding commitment and a time frame for Polish  membership in NATO," Markus Meckel told RZECZPOSPOLITA. He is  the leader of the Polish group in the Social Democratic Party  faction in the German Bundestag and the last foreign minister of  the German Democratic Republic.    According to Meckel, the democratic and stable development  of  the countries of Central and East Europe and their integration  into Western organizations--into the European Union and NATO,  among others--is in the interest of the West and all of Europe.  Meckel said the desire by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic to be members of NATO is understandable and logical,  especially against the backdrop of the dangers that have  recently emerged in Russia. The way the West should respond to  the Russian events is to link the countries of Central and East  Europe to the West as soon as possible, including in the area of  security policy. Meckel also said that fears expressed by Poland  and other countries of the region of the vacuum of a buffer zone  or even of a "new Yalta" are realistic, while the way the West  has been handling Russia is questionable. He thinks that NATO  should present Russia with an offer of cooperation, but, at the  same time, it should provide security guarantees to countries in  Central Europe. Meckel perceives a danger of returning to the  division of the world and thinks that the danger can only be  eliminated through the West's decisive action, including  accepting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into Western  security organizations.    When could that happen? Not as soon as the countries  concerned would like to see it, Meckel repeated what Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel said during a visit to Bonn by Polish  Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What does that mean? "If  Germans say: `Not so fast,'" Meckel said, "that means we will  need quite some time in which to convince our West European and  U.S. friends that integration by Poland and other countries is  in our mutual interest and that it will contribute to the  stabilization of Europe." According to Meckel, a specific  promise or a time frame for Poland and its partners (or an offer  of cooperation for Russia) will not be decided at the next NATO  summit mainly because of the position adopted by the Americans,  but also due to the British position. What is more  realistic--and the Germans should insist on accomplishing  that--is that an unambiguous declaration will be made that  "Partnership for Peace" not only does not exclude Polish,  Hungarian, and Czech membership in NATO, but it also constitutes  a first and binding step toward integrating these countries.  <H5>  Nobody Isolates Russia </H5>   On Tuesday, which was a day after Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski's visit to Bonn and a few days before the NATO summit  meeting in Brussels, an article appeared in DIE WELT entitled  "NATO and a New East" and written by three well-known political  scientists--Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford University; Michael  Mertes, who is an associate of the Chancellor's Office; and  Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the Paris-based  International Relations Institute and deputy editor in chief of  the POLITIQUE ETRANGERE ("Foreign Policy") journal.    The authors express their conviction that, despite the  success by the Russian extreme right wing, there are still  chances for democratic transformations. This is even more reason  for the West to support the democratic camp against the fascist  forces. The results of the Russian elections spurred a debate on  the efforts of the countries of Central Europe toward  integration. There are views that accepting Poland, the Czech  and Slovak Republics, and Hungary as NATO members could cause a  negative response by Russia and, as a result, could lead to a  weakening of the pro-Western and democratic front present in  Russia.    Ash, Mertes, and Moisi regard these arguments as not very  convincing. Russia's uncertain future makes its neighbors'  nervousness completely understandable. But could acceptance of  the democratic countries of Central Europe be falsely  interpreted as designed to isolate Russia? The article says no,  on the condition that these countries' membership in NATO will  take place at the same time as some efforts aimed at  establishing a special "security partnership" with Russia.    The article's authors think that the countries of Central  Europe should be offered an "engagement" to NATO, which would  open up the prospect of a subsequent marriage. They suggested  three stages: During the first stage, countries of Central  Europe would participate in political consultations and in  NATO's parliamentary meetings; in the second stage, the  countries' Armed Forces would participate in NATO peace missions  under the protectorate of the United Nations or the CSCE; and,  in the third and final stage, they would receive complete  security guarantees in accordance with Article 5 of the  Washington treaty. On Tuesday, the German press issued extensive  reports on the talks in Bonn between Ministers Olechowski and  Kinkel. Particular emphasis was placed on Poland's justified  concern over the developments in Russia. The papers cited a  statement made by Friedbert Pfluger, a defense expert from  Germany's Christian Democratic Union, who demands an associate  membership in NATO for countries of Central Europe.</p>

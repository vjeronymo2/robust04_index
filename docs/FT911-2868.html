			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: James Tildesley resigns from Norton Grp board MR JAMES TILDESLEY has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Norton Group and quit the board. He has been at the centre of one of the controversies besetting the engineering concern which includes the famous motorcycle marque. Norton is being investigated by the DTI and its shares were suspended at 18p on April 1 because of a delay in publishing results for the six months to October 31. Yesterday evening's announcement included no reason for the departure and no one was available to comment at Norton. Mr Tildesley, non-executive chairman since 1988, only stepped into the chief executive position in January, when Mr Philippe Le Roux resigned. The controversy involving Mr Tildesley concerned the Pounds 8.2m purchase of a German fasteners maker from a Channel Islands trust company set up to benefit his offspring. His former company, PSM, had founded the German business. A poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue to help complete the purchase had a bumpy conclusion in January. Norton's new non-executive chairman is Mr Norman Minty, who joined the board when Norton reversed into his eponymous furniture company in June 1989, thereby gaining a main market listing. Norton also announced two other board appointments, again with no amplification. A Mr D MacDonald becomes chief executive and a Mr N Wilson joins as a non-executive director.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Lilley welcomes proposal on pension privatisation: Labour MP says state should abandon basic provision THE POLITICAL debate over Britain's welfare state broadened yesterday when Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, welcomed a Labour MP's proposals for privatising state pensions. Mr Lilley said that the paper by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, would be considered by the government as part of its long-term review of public spending. His comments seemed calculated to embarrass the Labour leadership, which has been trying to capitalise on the controversy over the government's long-term review of public spending and its impact on less well-off pensioners. Mr Lilley said he was keen to encourage greater private provision of pensions - but stopped short of endorsing Mr Field's suggestion that the basic state pension should be privatised. The basic pension would remain 'the building block on which people can build their own additional provision,' Mr Lilley said. Ministers are committed to manifesto pledges to protect the basic state pension, but Mr Lilley wants to encourage debate on proposals which could be included in the Conservatives' next election manifesto. In a separate part of the social security department's spending review, Mr Lilley is studying UK rules on paying unemployment benefit to citizens of other European Community countries to see if they can be tightened without breaking EC regulations on the free movement of labour. Mr Lilley's success in promoting debate on pensions, however, could backfire as the Tory party struggles to win the Christchurch by-election, where a third of the population are pensioners. The Conservatives are defending a majority of 23,000. Adding to the government's difficulties this week are the prospect of another intervention in the debate on Maastricht by Baroness Thatcher when the House of Lords debates a referendum on the treaty on Wednesday. There is also the threat of a government defeat on the treaty's social chapter when it is debated in the Commons and Lords on July 26. In his pamphlet published today, Mr Field, chairman of the cross-party Commons social security committee, proposes the imposition of a statutory duty on employers to contribute six per cent of gross earnings to private schemes on their employees' behalf. He says the basic state pension scheme could eventually be abandoned. Among Labour leaders, Mr David Blunkett, health spokesman, described Mr Field as a 'maverick' and said he wanted a welfare state 'which we will all contribute to and which we all draw on'. He rejected '1930s' ideas of a system with only a safety net for the worse off. Mr Donald Dewar, social security spokesman, said: 'No one in the Labour Party wants a two-tier system with those who can afford it opting out and the basic pension relegated to a fall-back safety net provision.'

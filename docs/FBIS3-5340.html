At a time when the agreed conclusions of the DPRK-USA  contact  in New York have begun to be implemented, the United States  intends to set the exchange of special envoys between the North  and South of Korea and the inspection by the IAEA [International  Atomic Energy Agency] as preconditions of the suspension of the  "Team Spirit 94" joint manoeuvres and the opening of the third  round of the DPRK-USA talks, the analyst says, and continues:  This makes us doubt whether it has the willingness to fully  implement the conclusions or not.    The stand of the United States that it will take an action  only when the other side acts first, shows that it seeks a  solution to the issue from the position of strength. This will  only bring difficulties to the solution of the issue.    Whether the issue is solved or not depends on how sincerely  the United States, a dialogue partner, work to implement its  commitments.    Of importance here is for the United States to strictly  observe the principle of the joint statement between the DPRK  and the United States and renounce the attitude and stand to set  preconditions, persisting only in its assertions. Such attitude  and stand are only harmful to the solution of the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula.    The United States must show in deeds its sincerity and  willingness to solve the issue as a partner of the dialogue.</p>

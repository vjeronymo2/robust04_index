			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares for small jute crop IN SPITE of the favourable weather, India, the largest grower of jute, will produce a small crop of about 6.5m bales (180 kg each) during the season beginning next month. That would be down some 300,000 bales from the estimated 1992-93 crop, but in the preceding two years as much as 9m bales were harvested. The quality of the next crop will be good, however, as the overflowing canals and ponds will allow proper retting (softening) of jute. Farmers in Assam, north Bengal and Bihar, have been unable to realise adequate prices for raw jute this season, with the government price support agency remaining virtually inactive. So they have reduced plantings of the crop. The heavy carry over stocks from 1991-92 of nearly 3m bales kept prices below the government's recommended minimum. According to industry and trade officials, a recent recovery in jute prices should continue into the 1993-94 season because it will open with stocks of only about 1.6m bales. The total supply of 8.1m bales will just be enough to meet the mill industry's requirement of 7.5m bales and village level consumption of 600,000 bales. There will, however, be no surplus at the end of the next season. India's jute season must open with stocks equivalent to at least two months' fibre supply to the mills, as the new crop starts arriving in the market in volume from September. India will have to find a solution to the problem by importing fibre from Bangladesh, which exports about 1.6m bales a year. But Bangladesh may not have much surplus either in 1993-94 when its crop is expected to be only 4.5m bales, down from 5.2m bales in 1992-93. It certainly is not going to bail out India at the cost of its regular jute buyers.</p>

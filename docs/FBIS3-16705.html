This is one of the first trips abroad by the Pentagon chief.  At the end of last year, when Perry was offered the post of  secretary of defense to replace Les Aspin, who had resigned,  evil tongues maintained that the candidate was good in every  respect -- an experienced leader, an expert in high  technologies, and a successful entrepreneur -- but not a  politician. In Kiev, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and,  particularly, Moscow, Perry will have to demonstrate his  qualities as a political leader.    The Pentagon chief is coming to Moscow literally a couple of  days after the Vladivostok meeting between U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev -- which gives grounds for assuming that they are  connected not only in time but in aims. In addition to tackling  questions of bilateral cooperation between the United States and  Russia in the military sphere, Perry must demonstrate that  Washington's policy in support of democratic transformations in  Russia has not changed, despite the friction which has arisen  recently, and that the partnership will be continued.    On the eve of his trip the secretary spoke at the George  Washington University. He emphasized that "all the major  powers, including those friendly to the United States, have  their own interests, which sometimes run counter to  Washington's. We cannot expect Russia or any other great power  to act against its own national interests." At the same time in  relations between states there must not be even a hint of  jealousy of others' successes. The defense secretary once again  made a high assessment of Russia's contribution to settling the  crisis in the Balkans and, in particular, to removing the Serb  artillery from positions around Sarajevo.    Speaking of the main aims of U.S. policy toward Russia,  Perry  outlined to some extent the range of problems which he intends  to touch on in Moscow -- guarantees of security and of the  prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the  maintenance of regional stability in the region, including the  states of the former Warsaw Pact.    Special attention will evidently be devoted to Russia's  attitude to the NATO "Partnership [sotrudnichestvo] for Peace"  program, which Moscow is in no hurry to subscribe to, although  it has declared its readiness. As has been learned from  informed sources, the problem of recycling radioactive elements  will be discussed in the talks -- a problem which, in the  Russian leadership's opinion, can be resolved only with all  possible international assistance.    Moscow's offer of broader cooperation might meet with  understanding on the part of the U.S. secretary, who believes  that closer relations with Moscow not only help to advance  democracy in Russia but also contribute to better understanding  of what is happening there, on those immense expanses.    IZVESTIYA was told at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that the  program has not yet been finalized, and it is too soon to say  anything specific about the visit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nevenka Jovicic report from Athens] </F>   [Text] [Studio announcer] Goran Percevic, vice president  of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and deputy in the Federal  Assembly, who is heading the SPS delegation currently visiting  Athens at the invitation of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement], has held talks with Apostolos Kaklamanis, speaker of  the Greek Parliament. The SPS delegation also held talks with  Yerasimos Arsenis, defense minister and member of PASOK's  leadership, and leaders of other Greek parliamentary parties.    [Jovicic] The speaker of the Greek Parliament, Apostolos  Kaklamanis, who today held talks with Goran Percevic, vice  president of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and deputy in  the Federal Assembly, has sent a message to the Serbian people  to persevere in the struggle for the final realization of their  just, legitimate aims. Kaklamanis stressed that the Serbian  people should remain resolute in their just struggle, which is  also the struggle for the independence and freedom of all Balkan  states.    The SPS delegation is visiting Athens at the invitation of  the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, PASOK. The delegation has  attended the PASOK congress over the past few days.    In a cordial meeting with the SPS delegation, the speaker of  the Greek Parliament said that the Greek people understand and  realize that a big conspiracy has been initiated against the  Serbian people, and that the aim of this conspiracy was to break  up the old Yugoslavia. Goran Percevic, vice president of the  SPS, said that at these very difficult and crucial times for the  Balkans, traditional, historical, and indissoluble friendship  between the Greek and Serbian peoples has been confirmed once  again. Apostolos Kaklamanis accepted the invitation to visit  Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that this visit would take place  very soon.    The SPS delegation today also held talks with Yerasimos  Arsenis, defense minister and member of the PASOK leadership.  During the open discussions that lasted an hour, they discussed  security in the Balkans and the situation in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Minister Arsenis stressed that the  denouement of the situation in the Balkans could move in two  directions. One possibility is to give in to pressure and allow  the creation of a large number of puppet states that would be in  constant conflict with one another and would be bossed around by  big powers. The other possibility is the strengthening of the  Balkan states, so that they are capable of solving problems  themselves. The international community should understand that  the second option is in its own interests, Minister Arsenis  stressed.    During their talks, the SPS delegation, various PASOK  officials, and leaders of other parties represented in the  parliament, such as the Political Spring and the Communist Party  of Greece, expressed strong support for the just struggle of the  Serbian people and sharply condemned the sanctions of the  international community on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev is convinced that neither the decision to amnesty  Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and their associates, nor these people  themselves "can in any measure destabilize the situation in the  country, which is guaranteed by the provisions of the  constitution and the policy of the Russian president."    Speaking today at a regular meeting with Russian and foreign  journalists at the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation,  Andrey Kozyrev, who is a deputy, also said that for him and many  other Russian parliamentarians the Duma's decision on a  political amnesty "seems shameful." "These people," he stated,  "should be in prison. They broke the law and should be sent  back to prison and tried. And then, perhaps, an amnesty will be  extended to them."    This is a "mistake by those who released them," the minister  stressed, "and I think the Russian president will take the  appropriate decision in his own time."</p>

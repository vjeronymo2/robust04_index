			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PROCRASTINATORS' CLUB 'HONORS' BUSH, CONGRESS FOR BUDGET MESS  </P> <P> When the Procrastinators' Club gathers to select its Procrastinator of the  Year, it's usually difficult to make a choice. But this year, the club  president said, there was no contest.  </P> <P> The 1990 Procrastinators of the Year are President Bush and Congress for their  inaction on the federal budget, said Les Waas, president of the Philadelphia  group.  </P> <P> He said Bush and lawmakers were honored for "outstanding procrastination in  making the current budget decisions."  </P> <P> The club usually puts off making the award until well after each year ends, but  Waas said this year there was really no question of who the honoree would be.  </P> <P> Waas said the committee also got around to dispensing a piece of budget advice  for Bush and Congress:  </P> <P> "Spend the money first and then determine a budget later -- procrastinate until  the money has been spent, because then the budget will always balance," Waas  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Row erupts over 'cruel' tests for jobseekers Unemployed people are being offered vacancies which are deemed 'hard to fill' as a way of testing whether they are genuine applicants for social security benefit, according to a leaked government memorandum. The memo, which was drawn up by the Employment Service, reveals that applicants for benefit are being offered jobs such as hairdressers, chefs and cooks as a means of testing whether they are truly seeking work. The document was leaked to Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington. He condemned the proposals as 'cruel and sneaky'. 'This scheme has been designed by ministers in a desperate attempt to meet Treasury spending targets,' he said. 'They ought to be ashamed of themselves.' He added: 'How on earth do they expect a redundant miner to react when offered a job as a hairdresser or a chef?' According to the document, which was sent to all regional directors of the Employment Service, tests using hard-to-fill jobs were introduced last month in a trial period to last until mid-August. The document states that 'claimants who refuse to, or fail to, apply for jobs . . . may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for a maximum of 26 weeks'. Currently, anyone drawing unemployment benefit must look for a new job. After 13 weeks on the dole, individuals are challenged as to the appropriateness of the job they are seeking, and may be asked to re-consider. Failure to do so can result in benefits being taken away. The document suggests that more rigorous methods are being used to test the search for work. According to the memorandum, the idea of testing applicants in this way was raised by Viscount Astor, the parliamentary under secretary at the Department of Social Security. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, responded to the suggestion 'expressing scepticism', but asked officials to 'investigate the possibilities'. The memo defines hard-to-fill vacancies and ranks occupations in order of unpopularity. Hairdressers and barbers top the list, followed by debt collectors, credit agents, nannies, chefs and cooks and service managers. The Department of Employment said: 'A small minority of clients make little or no effort to find work, and are unwilling to take up training. In such cases, it is entirely appropriate to test whether a client satisfies the condition that they are able and willing to accept employment. The best way of doing this is to offer them a chance of a job.'</p>

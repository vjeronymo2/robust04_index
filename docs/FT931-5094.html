			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Long wait for entry: Western misgivings as China negotiates to join the Gatt China this year will join the world's top 10 traders, but it is finding this exclusive club not as welcoming as it might have expected. The Chinese are being obliged to pay much more attention to trade sensitivities than ever before. Beijing's protracted negotiations on accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have provided a focus for the misgivings felt by China's main trading partners over the spectacular improvement in its export performance in the past few years. For the US, the European Community and Japan, the prospect of China as a world trade power that plays by its own rules is no longer distant. And it should be no surprise that they are all trying, perhaps belatedly, to ensure they are not disadvantaged as competition intensifies. The challenge they face is writ large in their ballooning trade deficits with China: the US deficit in 1992 exceeded Dollars 18bn, the EC's reached Dollars 9.3bn, and Japan's was about Dollars 5bn. In response to growing restiveness among its main trading partners, China has promised to send buying missions to the US and to Europe. Its officials have also been talking China up as a market for raw materials and equipment. They recently reiterated their forecast of projected imports worth Dollars 350bn to Dollars 400bn in the current 1991-1995 five-year plan. Chinese officials have also been making much of the fact that the country's overall trade surplus was down sharply last year to Dollars 4.4bn, compared with Dollars 9bn in 1991. They expect it to shrink further this year. Western governments tend to view these Chinese statements and manoeuvres as little more than a smokescreen, and are maintaining pressure on Beijing to liberalise its trade regime and so enhance opportunities for foreign entry to the Chinese market. In Beijing last week, Mr Douglas Newkirk, the assistant US trade representative, spelt out what he said were minimum conditions for China's accession to Gatt. These included: a single national trade policy common to all provinces and regions; full transparency of trade regulations (until recently trade was governed by a plethora of secret rules); the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers; a commitment to move to a full market economy; and acceptance of safeguards to protect Gatt signatories from a possible surge in Chinese exports. It is the latter concern, given China's enormous strides recently as an export power, that is weighing most heavily with the west. An EC official said in Beijing that the Community's principal requirement was a strong safeguards clause, and it was most unlikely to accept anything less. According to the EC representative, in spite of China's claims to have embarked on a concerted process of trade liberalisation, barriers to entry to the China market abound. Many are derived from bureaucratic interference, such as the difficulties EC dairy products faced overcoming the sometimes arbitrarily applied health regulations. A decade or so ago China ranked 20th among trading nations with exports of about Dollars 21bn (see chart), which represented less than 1 per cent of world trade. Projected exports this year of Dollars 100bn would account for more than 2.5 per cent of world trade. The range and quality of its products are also showing marked improvement, with a continuing shift towards more sophisticated manufactured items, including machinery and transport equipment - sectors where there has been high foreign investment. Exports of these items rose by about 86 per cent in the first nine months of 1992 compared with the same period a year earlier. They accounted for 16 per cent of total exports last year, up sharply from only 6 per cent in 1988. China's trading partners have not overlooked the fact that investment is pouring into export-generating industries. In the first 10 months of 1992, some Dollars 37bn was committed to new projects, the bulk located in special economic zones in coastal regions. This compares with Dollars 48bn of contracted direct foreign investment for the previous 13 years of the 'open door' policy. Chinese officials, who a few months ago were predicting that China's accession to Gatt would be a formality, appear to have been taken aback by what they regard as an unhelpful posture adopted by the west. In last week's Gatt negotiations, Beijing resisted US pressure to agree to a safeguards clause, which would enable individual signatories to impose quota restrictions on items such as textiles and electronic products. It also refused to embrace full market price reform as an eventual goal. Mr Newkirk charged that China had backed away from earlier commitments. The Chinese, for their part, accuse the west, and the US in particular, of moving the goalposts in the Gatt negotiations. Beijing is certain to have been disappointed by Mr Newkirk's comment that it was still a 'long way' from fulfilling the requirements of Gatt accession. It would also not have been impressed by his observation that China's situation was unique because 'Gatt was not written with a socialist market economy in mind'. This, Mr Newkirk said, was why it was necessary to negotiate a 'boutique protocol aimed exactly and uniquely at the Chinese system'. The Chinese, who are anxious to resolve the Gatt issue quickly to reduce bilateral trade pressures, say it is unfair to impose a special safeguards system on them when other recent signatories, such as several of the former eastern bloc states, have not been obliged to accept the same conditions. On the eve of the resumption of the talks, Mr Li Zhongzhou, deputy director-general of China's powerful Department of International Trade and Economic Relations, told foreign diplomats that recent reforms had 'brought China's trade regime into conformity with the requirements of Gatt'. He cited a long list of reforms, including reductions in import duties, a 7.3 per cent drop in the general level of tariffs by the removal of two-thirds of products from the list of 53 still subject to import licensing; and steps towards abolishing about 75 per cent of China's non-tariff barriers. 'These commitments,' Mr Li said, 'represent a great challenge requiring domestic industries to make difficult policy adjustments in the face of stronger international competition. 'If these adjustments are reciprocated by greater market access for Chinese goods, our enterprises will manage to overcome the difficulties of adjustment,' he added. China's trading partners, however, burdened by yawning trade deficits, are not showing much sympathy for the teething problems that Chinese industry might encounter in the early stages of trade liberalisation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        CHINA: TOTAL EXPORTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------                 Dollars bn                           Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1982             21.871                       1987       39.542 1983             22.179                       1988       47.542 1984             24.831                       1989       51.628 1985             27.327                       1990       60.920 1986             31.147                       1991       70.292                            1992 (10 months to Oct)       62.139  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Monetary Fund  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

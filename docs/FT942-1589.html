			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foster's joins Wheelock in China brewing Foster's, the Australian brewery group, is joining forces with Wheelock, the Hong Kong-based trading house, to make a push into the brewing business in China. The companies yesterday said evaluation of potential projects in the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu had already started. They will spend a total of USDollars 1bn over five years, if initial plans are fully implemented. Foster's already has two joint ventures in Guangdong Province and Shanghai, and said its own aims fit neatly with Wheelock's strategy, which centres on the development of five 'regional hubs' - Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu/Chongqing and Beijing/Tianjin. In a recent internal reorganisation, Foster's elevated the importance of Asian markets by creating a new Foster's Asia division. This incorporates the existing Foster's China interests. The decision by the Australian brewer to increase its focus on Asian expansion opportunities comes as Foster's existing UK and North American interests are suffering from sluggish demand and extremely competitive conditions. Yesterday, by contrast, Foster's pointed out that the beer market in China grew by about 23m hectolitres in 1993, to around 123m hectolitres  - making it the world's second-largest beer market after the US and easily surpassing the Australian beer market of 17m hectolitres. It also pointed out that the Chinese brewing industry remains fragmented, with more than 800 breweries, only 10 of which produce more than 1m hectolitres and none more than 2.5m hectolitres. The move marks Wheelock's first foray into brewing. Mr John Hung, executive director, said the group had been looking into the brewery business because of its potential in China, and that Foster's geographical targets - in the regional hubs of Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu - coincide with Wheelock's own strategic plans for the mainland. Less than 10 per cent of Wheelock's assets are in China, but there are plans to increase this to a maximum of 20 per cent. The venture will marry Foster's brewery skills with Wheelock's China know-how and expertise in property development expertise. Mr Hung said: 'Wheelock has always been the party, in any joint venture, that brings to the table a number of things: local knowledge, financial strength, corporate muscle in Hong Kong and China connections, and will help seek sites.' The market leader is Tsingtao, the local brewer whose shares are traded in Hong Kong. However, foreign brands are jockeying for market share.</p>

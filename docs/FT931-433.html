			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais The prospect of privatisation certainly gave Credit Lyonnais an incentive to clear the decks by maximising its provisions for 1992. Even so, there is no guarantee recovery will be rapid from now on. The FFr14.7bn (Pounds 1.85bn) net new provisions declared yesterday were large, but probably also represented the most the bank could afford given its weak capital position. The bank's tradition of secrecy about its provisions leaves room for doubt about how far it had fallen behind on covering big international risks such as Olympia &amp; York, MGM and Sasea. Even if these provisions are now adequate, conditions are deteriorating in the domestic market, particularly in property lending. Interest rates will almost certainly not fall in time to prevent more losses from that quarter in 1993. A higher incidence of non-performing loans will be a drag on operating income. All in all, the 60 per cent jump in the share price since last November looks premature.</p>

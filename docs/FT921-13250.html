			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Rocky road to Rio The term 'sustainable development' has become an international buzzword in the run up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development - the Earth Summit - to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June. The term is defined as 'economic development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. But a new survey by SustainAbility, a UK environmental consultancy, demonstrates that the road to Rio is still very rocky and uphill. 'Not surprisingly the debate about sustainable development has so far taken place mainly at the rarefied international level,' it says. 'Most local activists and ordinary business people are still not actively involved.' The study found that some environmental organisations were rethinking their position on whether they can or should work with business and industry. But there was still a considerable amount of reluctance. In discussions with the World Wide Fund for Nature in Geneva the researchers found that the organisation was split on the extent to which its various national branches should work with business. 'There is absolutely no hope in terms of ecological leadership or vision in the political or business communities,' said David Suzuki of the University of British Columbia. Tony Cleaver, chief executive of IBM UK, was more positive. He thought the most hopeful sign was 'the increased awareness of environmental issues, both in business and in politics, coupled with the increasing belief that it is possible to marry economic growth and environmental responsibility'. Environmentalists rated chemicals and power generation as the main problem industries, followed by the petroleum industry and public and private transport.

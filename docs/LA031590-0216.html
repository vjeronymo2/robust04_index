			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: CINEMATOGRAPHERS EDGE INTO THE LIMELIGHT;  </P> <P> OSCARS: THE DISTINCTIVE STYLES OF THE FIVE NOMINEES AMPLY DEMONSTRATE WHY THE  CRAFT'S STOCK IS RISING.  </P> <P> There are frequent complaints that the Academy Award telecast is too long. In  fact, the agreement between the motion-picture academy and the ABC network  stipulates that the show cannot be less than three hours long. How else to get  in all those commercials.  </P> <P> Still, there are suggestions that some of the "lesser" awards be sent by mail  -- a thought greeted by rightful indignation in the industry. What is Batman  going to do without special effects, take the stairs? And what would "The Hunt  for the Red October" and any number of other films do without their apt and  ingenious sound effects?  </P> <P> In fact, audiences are smarter all the time about the work of the  below-the-line technicians who don't get salads named after them but without  whom movies would have only a fraction of their impact. Viewers have even come  to realize that the actors don't make up the words, and certainly not the  deeds, as they go along. There are writers, dyspeptic but ever-hopeful,  involved.  </P> <P> Probably the latest craft to win a widening recognition outside the industry  ghetto are the cinematographers. It is clear that, subject matter and location  aside, all films do not look alike. In black-and-white days, you couldn't  mistake the contrasty and menacing shadows of a Warners film with the sunny,  creamy lights of a typical MGM film.  </P> <P> In Britain, the cinematographers are more often known as lighting cameramen  and, in a way, it's a more fitting title; it's not the taking of the images  that counts, it's the shaping of the light.  </P> <P> The differences are subtler in these days of color and the technological  challenges more dramatic, involving as they frequently do the melding of live  action with special effects.  </P> <P> This year's five Academy Award nominees for cinematography suggest the range of  the challenges and the contribution of the person behind the camera to the  total picture.  </P> <P> Mikael Salomon's images for "The Abyss," for example, involved mind-boggling  difficulties of underwater action and of sequences done in claustrophobic  spaces of the undersea vehicles. It's a film in which what you see counts for  more than what you think or feel emotionally, and Salomon's work earned its  nomination, along with the picture's other nominations for art direction, sound  and visual effects.  </P> <P> The commercially disappointing Paul Newman film, "Blaze," in which he played  Louisiana politician Earl Long, received only one nomination, but it was for  Haskell Wexler's cinematography. The nomination is his fifth and he has two  Oscars, for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "Bound for Glory." He's also  photographed films as various as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The  Thomas Crown Affair."  </P> <P> Wexler's approach is what could be called a poetic naturalism, events taking  place in the seeming absence of artificial light or in the presence of whatever  the available light was. It is cinematography that, seeking to conceal itself,  has become a valued signature, as it is in "Blaze."  </P> <P> "Medium Cool," Wexler's own feature, which was made during the tumultuous  Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968 and placed fictional characters amid  the actual chaos, prefigured the kind of dramatic re-creations of history  Robert Richardson would be asked to photograph for Oliver Stone in "Born on the  Fourth of July," and for which he received one of the film's eight nominations.  The visual tasks, from a high school prom to grueling combat sequences, a  rat-infested hospital and several riots, were, to say the least of it, varied  and demanding.  </P> <P> The German-born veteran cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who has shot 80 films  in 27 years, including 15 with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, was nominated for "The  Fabulous Baker Boys." Ballhaus moved to the United States in 1982 to do "Baby  It's You" with John Sayles. For Martin Scorsese, he photographed "The Color of  Money," "After Hours," "The Last Temptation of Christ" and, most recently,  "Nice Fellas." His work on "Broadcast News" gave him his first Oscar  nomination.  </P> <P> Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy singing of "Makin' Whoopee" atop a grand piano,  arguably the high point of "Baker Boys," was, Ballhaus pointed out the other  day, a 360-degree camera orbit. "One of my favorite moves if it's right for the  scene," Ballhaus said. The camera, like a dance partner, not only makes its  circle but glides in and out and rises and falls -- echoing, in a sense, the  eloquent writhings of the actress.  </P> <P> The British veteran Freddie Francis, who won an Oscar for his work on "Sons and  Lovers" in 1960, has been nominated for "Glory," the story of a black regiment  in the Civil War. Francis also filmed "The Elephant Man" and such earlier  black-and-white classics as "Room at the Top" and "Saturday Night and Sunday  Morning." "The French Lieutenant's Woman," in color, was a remarkable blending  of a modern reality and an historic romanticism. "Glory" is its own blending --  of intimacy and scale -- and the battle scenes Francis photographed are quite  extraordinary.  </P> <P> As in many other categories of the Academy Awards this year, it is well nigh  impossible to predict where the Oscar for cinematography might go. And, too, as  in other categories, there are allowable tips of the hat to cinematographers  who didn't make the cut but might have: Miroslav Ondricek of "Valmont," John  Seale of "Dead Poets Society," John A. Alonzo of "Steel Magnolias," Robert  Yeoman of "Drugstore Cowboy," Ernest Dickerson of "Do the Right Thing," to name  a second five.  </P></p>

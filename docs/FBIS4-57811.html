			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon </F> Carpio upon arriving in Honduras to attend a meeting of Central  American presidents, with unidentified reporters; at the Hernan  Acosta Mejia Air Force Base in Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Text] [De Leon] We, the Central American presidents, are  very excited to be here, where we will try to unify our  positions and prepare the agenda for the hemispheric summit --  the so-called Summit of the Americas -- which will be held in  the United States at the end of the year. The idea is precisely  to unify the proposals, our proposals, proposals to be presented  by each nation. The idea is to present in a unified manner  diverse issues, including environmental issues, on which a  proposal has already been drawn up by all of the Central  American presidents. I had the honor of presenting to President  Clinton the proposal for a sustained alliance, an Alliance for  Sustained Development. This is a pilot program for Central  America to strengthen our democracies based on absolute liberty,  based on a true democracy, and based on respect for human  rights, such as the right to a clean environment.    There is also the drug trafficking issue, and drug-related  activities, which generally includes several other issues.  There is also the free trade issue, which has taken the form of  NAFTA. We will attempt to unify standards in an attempt to  present a single point of view at the upcoming meeting on this.    [Reporter] What [words indistinct] NAFTA in Guatemala?    [De Leon] We have been studying this. We have presented a  proposal to the United States. Every president has already  appointed and designated two representatives each, and these  representatives are already working on this. We hope this  process will develop little by little until a hemispheric free  trade agreement is achieved. This was the proposal the  presidents made to President Clinton in November. Of course, to  achieve this we must overcome several problems. Our [words  indistinct] our goal is to achieve integration, although we  understand that integration into this free trade agreement will  be a slow process.    [Reporter] This is a historic moment for the democracies of  Central America. The Guatemalan Government has entered into  negotiations with the Guatemalan guerrillas. What are the  chances these negotiations will ultimately put an end to this  conflict, which is the last armed conflict to prevail in the  region?    [De Leon] Tomorrow will be exactly one year since former  President Serrano Elias attempted to interrupt the institutional  and constitutional order. This is one of the main reasons why I  assumed the presidency of the Republic. Now, one year later, we  can highlight two fundamental changes that have taken place.    In institutional matters one year later, we can say with  satisfaction that Guatemala has guarded and strengthened its  institutionality. Today, more than ever, any possibility of  interrupting institutional order has been removed. Now, more  than ever, there is no talk of a coup d'etat in Guatemala, and  the principles of institutionality have been strengthened and  preserved and, in turn, so has the democratic process.    Meanwhile, when I assumed the Presidency nearly one year  ago,  we encountered a dialogue that had broken down; the entire  process was totally bogged down. Now we are nearing peace  [words indistinct] to sign peace. Today -- and this is the  reason I was delayed -- we were engaged in direct communication  with the Peace Commission that is discussing the displaced  communities issue. We are on the verge of resolving this point,  while we are [words indistinct] the aspect we have already  agreed upon on a timetable that will conclude with a cease-fire  in September. In certain regions, there could be cease-fires  before this time. This would conclude with the signing of a  peace pact that puts an end to an armed conflict -- the last  one, as you just noted -- which has been going on for more than  33 years.    [Reporter] What was the U.S. reaction to the proposal you  presented in the name of the Central American presidents?    [De Leon] At that time, it was very well-received. I believe  this is the time to test the world power that is our neighbor  and which, to some extent, is committed to these issues not only  because of a commitment to the nations of Central America, but  also because of its commitments to its own population. For  example, environmental issues as well as drug-related  activities, adversely affect not only the Central American  population, but they also affect the U.S. population and the  world population. Therefore, this proposal was very  well-received, and we hope that today we can wrap up this point  and take it to the upcoming summit with...    [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President will this meeting  serve to somehow establish a bilateral relationship with  Honduras?    [De Leon] We have embarked on an excellent relationship with  President Reina, and I believe that this is a good opportunity  to discuss bilateral issues, even through this may be in a very  quick manner. We will be meeting on 31 May in San Salvador, but  there are issues we can discuss, such as the supply of  electricity. We could offer Honduras a certain amount of  megawatts, which would enable us, when the network is created,  to supply a certain amount of electricity. Right now, this is a  difficult issue for Honduras. We undoubtedly could discuss this  and other issues, particularly in light of the excellent  relationship all of the Central American nations currently have,  and all presidents have, including the new presidents.    [Reporter] What about the travel advisory issued to U.S.  citizens in the wake of the high level of violence and attacks  against U.S. citizens? Has this situation improved? Why is  this situation occurring?    [De Leon] As Guatemalan President and as a representative of  the Guatemalan people and its government, I believe this was a  very drastic decision; it was much too extreme on the part of  the world power, the United States. In the United States  itself, incidents such as those that have occurred in my country  are also taking place against citizens from other nations.  There are murders, violence, and others incidents.  Nevertheless, although I respect it, I do not agree with this  drastic decision. It is unjustified because, although in  Guatemala we are currently experiencing a climate of violence  like many other parts of the world, conditions do not exist to  justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English].  Nevertheless, we are making an all-out effort to convince the  United States that conditions do not prevail to continue with  this warning in the hope of returning tourism to the nation.    [Reporter] But what is the reason for this situation?    [De Leon] It has been brought about by violent situations  that have taken place in all countries of the world. There have  been two or three cases. There were charges of trafficking in  children, and these were untrue. Nevertheless, two or three  U.S. citizens have been accused, as well as two or three other  foreigners. Nevertheless, conditions do not prevail to justify  the travel warning [preceding two words in English].</p>

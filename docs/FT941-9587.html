			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / BAe shareholders weigh up old guard's power: Tony Jackson assesses whether replacing Cahill by Bauman will produce the managerial chemistry the company has been groping for British Aerospace's shareholders might be forgiven for feeling slightly restive this morning. The weekend press told them of the ousting of their chairman, Mr John Cahill, and the appointment of a part-time non-executive chairman, Mr Bob Bauman. Mr Cahill's original task was to impose controls on a group which was by general consent a financial and organisational shambles. Now that the BAe culture has rejected him, the old guard are by implication back in control. Given the hash they made of BAe in the old days, is that something shareholders should be happy about? The question is one which BAe might perhaps argue under two headings. First, it might claim, the old guard is no more. The group's nadir came in September 1991, with its Pounds 432m rescue rights issue. The executive members of the board who sanctioned that issue - and who were responsible for the plight which led to it - have mostly left or been removed. Professor Sir Roland Smith, chairman, has gone; so have the finance, legal, personnel and property directors. True enough. But the chief executive Mr Dick Evans is still there, as is deputy chairman Mr Sydney Gillibrand - a lifelong aircraft man, steeped in BAe's defence and aerospace businesses. So are the operating chiefs of the all-important defence business, who allegedly did not take kindly to Mr Cahill's attempts to wean them from their old cost-plus ways. But, BAe might argue, the new chairman Mr Bob Bauman is a formidable figure. When, as newly arrived chairman of Beecham, he found himself at odds with his chief executive Mr John Robb - now chief executive of Wellcome - it was Mr Robb who left. Mr Bauman then piloted Beecham's merger with SmithKline, making a fortune in salary and bonuses. He is now approaching retirement with his reputation intact. Unlike Mr Cahill, he genuinely appears to know about the defence and aerospace business, having chaired the US group Avco from 1981 until its takeover by Textron four years later. Although working only one or two days a week, he will form a strong focus for any shareholder dissent. He also has some strong non-executive directors, such as Sir Graham Day, Sir James Blyth of Boots and Mr Ronnie Hampel of ICI. But they were all there at the time of the rights issue debacle. On the face of it, this is genuinely puzzling. Perhaps the twilight world of classified defence work is hard for outsiders to get a grip on. But Sir James, for instance, was at one time a senior official in the Ministry of Defence. Perhaps the combination of Mr Bauman and Mr Evans will finally produce the managerial chemistry which BAe has been groping for. Given its huge importance as a UK manufacturer and employer, one certainly hopes so. If not, roll on the much-touted merger with GEC. If Lord Weinstock, now 69, could knock BAe into shape, he would not only round off his career but do the nation a genuine service. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

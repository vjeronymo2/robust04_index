			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Lion stops new business Scottish Lion, the lossmaking London market insurer, is to cease writing all new and renewal business with immediate effect. The move follows a 'strategic decision' to withdraw from active underwriting in the London market, the parent company, China Merchants Group, the Chinese state-owned shipping and investment concern, said on Friday. Scottish Lion suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.6m last year and the directors said they expected a further deterioration in underwriting results this year. Mr Richard Williams, finance director, said, however, that the company expected no difficulties meeting claims on existing policies.</p>

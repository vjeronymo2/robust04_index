			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Six commenters suggested that the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a remedy which would allow a ban on all admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a facility, regardless of the resident's source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment. Three commenters further indicated that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy should be mandatory in cases involving immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept these suggestions. The Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not provide the authority to ban admissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents whose source of payment is other than Medicare or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid. The Act does provide for the remedies of denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all payment for SNFs and NFs by the Secretary and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment for all new admissions for SNFs by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, and for NFs, by the Secretary or the States. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule included denial of payment for all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions in certain diagnostic categories or requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized care, but we have not included that remedy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule for the reasons discussed under ``Denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payment'' later in this preamble. We believe that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies, along with the other available remedies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance, should be sufficient to promote a shift from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance to substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters stated that the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing the facility should be available for SNFs and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just for those facilities that participate as NFs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNF/NFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For SNFs, HCFA has termination as an option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for remedying noncompliance. While HCFA can terminate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNF's Medicare participation, it cannot revoke a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license to operate within a State. Therefore, actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closures of facilities and transfers of residents are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies which are options only for those facilities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the State is the enforcing agency because the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also has licensing authority; closures of facilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license related actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter proposed that off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring be added to the list of available remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are not accepting this suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement remedies are designed to motivate providers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve and maintain compliance with participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The motivation is provided by the nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the various available enforcement remedies that either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require some action to be taken by the provider or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve financial consequences directly or indirectly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider. Since off-site monitoring would be performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State rather than imposed on the facility, and since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there would be no responsibility and, therefore, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive for a facility response, we conclude that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of monitor is not an enforcement remedy to be imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against facilities with deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter proposed the addition of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Secretarial authority to order the hospitalization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents in cases involving immediate jeopardy, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is unable or unwilling to respond to the residents'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not believe an additional remedy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed in order to respond to this commenter's concern. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management will be imposed in those cases where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy is identified in a facility that will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be terminated immediately, control of the situation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including determinations as to the care of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents, will be shifted away from the facility's own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management until the jeopardy is removed. Should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility fail to relinquish control to the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager, termination will result and residents will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred to facilities that are able to provide care in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner consistent with certification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter proposed that public notice be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included as an available remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Public notices are already required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation for any SNF termination. Public notices are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed, but not required (unless the State has its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public notice requirement), for NFs that will be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that the regulation should expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of public notices as a remedy for noncompliance by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including them in this section's listing. Public notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are frequently costly, and they do not always serve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent of notifying the widest possible audience of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's noncompliance. Further, facilities are already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to post the availability of the results of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys on their premises. Accordingly, we are not adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this suggestion in the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

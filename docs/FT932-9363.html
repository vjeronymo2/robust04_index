			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Brazil's finance minister stays MR Eliseu Resende, Brazil's finance minister, remained in office yesterday after being questioned in the Senate on Wednesday about alleged favours from the ministry to his former employer. The consensus among legislators was that Mr Resende emerged strengthened from the session. Senators queried him over proposed loans for Peru and Ecuador which have been earmarked to finance construction work by Norberto Odebrecht, the construction company where Mr Resende worked from 1983 to 1990. Mr Resende maintains that the loan approval was routine. Before the session ended, President Itamar Franco released a message of confidence in Mr Resende through his press secretary. However, a presidential press release that was expected after the senate session was not distributed, leading to speculation that Mr Resende's future may still be in doubt. If he is replaced, his successor would be the country's fourth finance minister in less than eight months. These shuffles are believed to be stalling progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund. A wider shake-up of Mr Franco's government may be forthcoming. Ms Yeda Crusius resigned as planning minister last week after expressing irritation over the limited role she was allowed in preparing the government's economic recovery programme.</p>

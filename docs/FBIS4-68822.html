			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Smirnov and Vadim Bardin under the </F> heading "Export Regulation": "Quotas On the Way Out, But State  Controls To Remain"]    [Text] Yesterday two consecutive events occurred which  should pique the interest of Russian exporters. In the morning  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations board discussed a  concept for a federal program of industrial export supports, and  in the afternoon the government's commission on operational  issues met and decided to change the mechanism by which export  quotas are assigned.    This is not the first time that the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations has tried to use state incentives to improve  the export structure. The board meeting focused on the  objectives of a federal program to support machinery and  equipment exports.    On 31 March 1993 the government approved the "State Program  for Support of Machinery and Equipment Exports," which was  developed by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The  first version of the federal program, which differs from the  state program in its specific request for allocation of budget  funding, was presented to the government in October. However,  the government took no action at that time. In December the  draft federal program was sent back to the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations for additional editing.    The core ideas of the revised federal program are these:  establishment of a precedent for budget funding of finished  goods exports through creation of a lending, insurance and  transportation infrastructure for industrial exports (including  through the use of favorable tariffs). Specifically, these  things are supposed to be embodied in the Russian Export-Import  Bank, a controlling block of shares in which will belong to the  state. On two occasions already, in July 1993 and January 1994,  the government has passed a resolution establishing such a bank,  yet at this time it exists only on paper. Suffice it to say that  bank president Viktor Shilin, who was confirmed by the founders'  meeting, is still working as deputy minister for foreign  economic relations, i.e. despite the extensive history of this  issue exporters of finished goods are still forced to solve  their problems on their own.    The sad story of support for industrial exports brings to  mind the thought that in the future Russia will be represented  in the world market solely as a raw materials exporter. In view  of that, the changes in the raw materials export mechanism  announced at yesterday's commission session by Oleg Soskovets,  are of primary importance. The commission granted non-ferrous  metals and diesel fuel export quotas to the State Investment  Corporation, which is headed by Yuriy Petrov. Hard currency  revenues will go to a society for disabled Afghanistan war  veterans.    In this way the case-by-case assignment of export quotas  will  be replaced by specific funding of their previous recipients'  programs. Special-purpose export quotas will now go only to  special exporters, who may in turn, in accordance with a  decision by Soskovets' commission, transfer the hard currency  received through sale of their export quotas (minus a  commission) to non-commercial structures designated by the  government. Thereby the government eliminates another means of  exporting strategic raw materials that has easily evaded state  supervision: use of public organizations that possess special  foreign economic privileges and tax breaks.    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations lobbied for this  innovation, but the ministry has not yet succeeded in reserving  the sale of special-purpose quotas for organizations under its  jurisdiction. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  proposes that the new mechanism be extended to the assignment of  special-purpose quotas and regional quotas, particularly since  at the present time local governments are refusing them in favor  of their own enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations has also drawn up proposals regarding a change in the  mechanism for export shipments in connection with the state's  needs, as supported by the government commission on operational  matters. Specifically, it has been proposed that as of 1 January  1995 state exports be restricted solely to fulfillment of  intergovernmental agreements and protocols. At the same time  export controls should be tightened, with these to be carried  out in part by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The  number of government special export agents would be limited to a  single organization for each product category.  <H8>  Changes in Export Regulation </H8> <H5>  Immediate Changes </H5>   Special-purpose export quotas will be assigned only to  special exporters for the purpose of funding the programs of  public non-commercial organizations designated by the government.  <H5>  Long-Range Changes </H5>   As of 1 January 1995 state exports will be restricted to  fulfillment of obligations under intergovernmental agreements  and protocols.</p>

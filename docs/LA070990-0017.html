			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Madonna Concert Canceled: A pop concert by Madonna in Rome this week has been  abruptly called off.  </P> <P> The cancellation came amid criticisms by Catholic officials against Madonna of  bad taste in her shows, but organizers said that the July 11 concert was  canceled because it coincided with a threatened general strike -- which has  since been called off. Prominent Roman Catholic bodies had attempted to get the  tour canceled. The Catholic news agency SIR said earlier this week that  Madonna's use of crucifixes and sacred symbols in concerts and videos was an  offense to good taste. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (7): Eyes on investments abroad  -Overseas expansion Privatisation and liberalisation are advancing across the world. They are moving fastest in cellular mobile services, which are ready provided on a competitive basis in most of Europe and much of Asia but they are extending rapidly to fixed-wire services. The RBOCs are exploiting opportunities in both fields. Again, there is no uniform picture. 'Our overseas strategy is a privatisation strategy,' says Mr Andres Bande, president of Ameritech's international division. By contrast, Mr Dick Callahan, president of US West International, who is actually based in London, stresses: 'We emphatically do not have a privatisation strategy. Ours is based above all on wireless and cable local networks.' Nynex's Mr Rubin splits the difference: 'We are looking at all opportunities, and certainly don't want to get typecast as providers of only one or two types of service.' The Baby Bells' existing operations underline the diversity. While Southwestern Bell, Nynex and US West have invested heavily in UK cable TV and telephone networks, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic have kept clear and been on the privatisation trail. (They are joint partners in New Zealand and are active elsewhere). Pacific Telesis has been concentrating on wireless. As Bell Atlantic's Mr Smith puts it: 'Our strategy abroad is simple - to export what we do well here.' BellSouth, the largest of the RBOC's by revenue, is one of the broadest ranging in its international portfolio. Its activities include a stake in Optus (the main challenger to the state fixed-wire operator in Australia), an Dollars 80m mobile data transmission network in France (being built with France Telecom, the state operator), and a stake in a cellular network in Germany. Overseas cellular licences are a field of marked contention between the RBOCs. At least three RBOCs were looking for partners with whom to bid for the new GSM digital licence in Italy. In terms of variety, US West is not far behind BellSouth. It has cellular operations in Russia and eastern Europe, and is pitching for a basic line-construction contract in India. In the UK it is operating combined cable TV/telephone networks and has a 50 per cent stake in Mercury One-2-One, the UK's new PCN cellular network. It intends to take home the experience gained on both fronts. Lessons learned with PCN will be particularly valuable for its ambitions with PCS - the US equivalent of PCN. 'There's room for us all,' says Bell Atlantic's Mr Smith. And not just abroad. As one RBOC executive noted with a smile, in the US long-distance business AT&amp;T has been cut down to about 70 per cent market share since 1984, yet its revenues have grown every year.</p>

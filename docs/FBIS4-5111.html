			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- It will take at least two  years for the South Korean Government to settle the repatriation  of some 4,000 Koreans in Sakhalin, Radio Moscow reported Sunday.    The repatriation concerns the interests of South and North  Korea as well as Russia, making the issue a difficult one to  resolve, said the radio, monitored here by NAEWOE press.    Some 60,000 Koreans were taken to Sakhalin during World War  II when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule, and about 4,000  first-generation members remain, according to Radio Moscow.    More than expected said they wanted to return to Korea in a  recent poll, apparently attracted by their mother country's  economic growth and living standards, it reported.    Seoul insists that Tokyo is responsible for bringing them  back to Korea since the majority were taken forcibly by the  Japanese military to work at labor camps.    But many descendants of Koreans in Sakhalin have settled  down  with stable careers and Seoul officials predict the Russian  Government would be unwilling to let them go.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Cuban economy 'set to recover next year': A senior economic policymaker tells Stephen Fidler of plans to tackle island's money glut Cuba's economy will not return to growth until at least next year, and any recovery will be modest, a leading Cuban economic policymaker says. 'It seems to me that this year the economy is still facing a very, very difficult situation,' says Mr Osvaldo Martnez, president of the Economic Commission of Cuba's National Assembly, 'but I expect that next year it will be in a position to resume growth, though not in a spectacular manner.' Mr Martnez, in London last week with a delegation from Cuba's National Assembly, estimates that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy has shrunk by 30-35 per cent - lower than many external estimates. The collapse - Cuba conducted 85 per cent of its commerce with the USSR and its former east European satellites - was followed by a big drop in Cuban trade. Exports from Cuba dropped from Dollars 8.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1993, he says. Mr Martnez says the main problem facing the government is the big overhang of currency in the Cuban economy. A meeting of the National Assembly at the start of this month, following consultations with 3.5m workers, has provided the outline for tackling this issue, he says. The government does not intend to apply shock therapy - 'the type of neo-liberal policies as you see in Latin America. The task is to correct the internal financial imbalance and not to kill the social cohesion'. However, the government recognises that excess liquidity has had negative effects on the economy. 'It hurts the discipline of work and the interest in work. It hurts productivity and efficiency and contributes to the development of the black market,' says Mr Martnez. Excess liquidity was estimated at the start of last month at about 11bn pesos - representing about 15 months of the population's earnings. (The peso is not convertible, but it is officially set at about parity to the dollar. The black market rate is around 100 to the dollar.) Some 60 per cent of this monetary overhang was in the form of deposits in savings banks, and the rest in cash. This is being made worse by a continuing budget deficit. It was 5.2bn pesos last year, and this year the government is aiming to reduce it by 24 per cent, mainly by reducing inefficiency in and cutting subsidies to state enterprises, he says. The monetary overhang will be addressed in three ways. Policies would be aimed at encouraging savings; raising prices and eliminating subsidies and certain government gratuities, such as free water; and through the introduction of wider taxation. At the moment, only a few thousand Cubans pay income tax. Price rises were announced last week, significant ones on products Mr Martnez describes as non-essential goods, such as cigarettes, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and on petrol. Electricity prices will also go up, but by how much will depend on what is consumed. 'We think that we need not less than 18 months to see the problem under control,' though the first effects of the policy will be seen before that. The aim, he says, is to 'restore the purchasing power of our national currency'. After the problem of excess liquidity is resolved, the possibility of making the peso convertible will be considered. Asked about the crackdown on the rampant black market that also emerged from the National Assembly meeting, Mr Martnez says: 'We are not thinking in terms of an economic solution. The repression of the black market is not a matter of an economic solution, it's a matter of elementary social justice. 'If we are asking Cuban workers to accept some sacrifices in order to balance the excess of liquidity . . . it is necessary to act against the black marketeers who make profits from the exploitation of the people.' The economic solution to the black market 'is to increase the production and efficiency of the economy,' he says. Asked whether a further freeing of the agricultural sector - producers must by law sell their produce to the government - is in prospect to increase farm production, he says: 'We are not in a dogmatic position in this field or any other field.' However, the 1980s experiment of peasant markets is 'not a real solution' but a source of 'speculation, high prices and intermediaries'. His prediction that the economy will improve is based on some improving indicators. 'Foreign investment is going well in the conditions of the US blockade' - a reference to the US embargo, which he estimates has cost the Cuban economy Dollars 40bn since it was introduced in 1960. He says there are no official figures for the size of foreign investment but cites 'academic estimates' of Dollars 500m. 'It's not a big figure but in the conditions of the Cuban economy an important one.' He says tourism is going well. Last year gross revenues were about Dollars 700m - with visitor numbers of around 700,000 - providing a net contribution of Dollars 220m to the economy. Oil exploration is on a rising trend, and national oil output rose last year to 1.1m tonnes, from about 800,000 in 1992. He does not expect electricity shortages, already leading to significant power cuts, to get worse.</p>

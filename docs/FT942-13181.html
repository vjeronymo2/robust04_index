			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Accor argues the logic of the lower bid - Forte's higher bid for Meridien is not the whole story Over the 27 years since they opened their first Novotel in Lille, Mr Gerard Pelisson and Mr Paul Dubrule, joint chairmen of the Accor hotels-to-luncheon vouchers group, have developed the disconcerting habit of finishing one another's sentences. Mr Pelisson takes the lead enthusing about the growing market for company canteen meals in Latin America. Mr Dubrule explains why Accor agreed earlier this year to merge its business travel interests with those of Carlson of the US, rather than with American Express. Both talk with equal animation, however, about why they rather than rivals Forte of the UK should be allowed to buy the Meridien hotel chain, 57 per cent owned by Air France. When the Air France board meets on Thursday, financial logic dictates that Forte should be the preferred candidate. Its offer reportedly values Meridien at FFr1.8bn (Dollars 310m) compared to Accor's offer, thought to value the chain at FFr1.6bn. Mr Jean-Didier Blanchet, Meridien's chairman, has publicly backed Forte's bid. Air France is expected to announce a loss of FFr9bn for 1993 and is seeking European Union approval for a French government cash injection of FFr20bn over the next three years. Some might find it difficult to see how the company could argue its case for more money in Brussels if it accepted the lower Accor offer; Mr Dubrule and Mr Pelisson disagree. They do not quite argue that they should be allowed to buy Meridien simply because they are French. A naked appeal to French patriotism would be difficult to sustain because all - or nearly all - the money Accor is offering is being put up by Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia. Accor would own 51 per cent of a joint company, with the prince owning the rest. Together, they are believed to be bidding for 40 per cent of Meridien. Accor would inject about half of its 101 upmarket Sofitel hotels into the joint company, along with its management skills. Mr Dubrule and Mr Pelisson's central argument is that, although it is offering less money, Accor could do more to ensure Air France's future than Forte. They argue that Accor, with its hotel and business travel interests, could provide Air France with more air travel and package bookings than Forte. Mr Pelisson points out that Accor's Paris offices are 200 metres away from Air France's. He says: 'Most of their people have the same origins as ours.' Mr Dubrule continues: 'It's easier to work with your neighbours than with someone else. Forte's partner should be BA; our normal partner is Air France.' He says the European Commission should not be concerned about Air France accepting less money. Mr Pelisson continues: 'What is most important for Air France is that we can do much more to help it recover in the future.' The co-chairmen have another objection to the Forte bid: it is offering too much money. Last year, a French bank valued Meridien at only FFr1.2bn. Isn't that something for Forte to worry about rather than Accor? Mr Pelisson says it is something for Air France to worry about, since Meridien will require investment of up to FFr2bn over the next five years. How would Forte pay for that expansion? But then how would Accor, whose net income fell to FFr615m last year from FFr802m in 1992? Prince Al Waleed and his associates will fund the expansion, Mr Pelisson says. Accor itself has other expansion plans. The tie-up with Carlson will create the world's biggest business travel company. Latin America's growing economies present opportunities for selling business services. The group has a 24 per cent interest in Accor Asia Pacific, a Sydney-based company which runs Accor hotels throughout Asia. The demand for reasonably-priced hotels in China and India will be huge. If Accor's Meridien bid fails, the group has plenty of other interests to pursue, the chairmen say.</p>

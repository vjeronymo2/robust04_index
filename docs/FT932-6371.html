			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cazenove replaced as fund manager by LPFA THE LONDON Pensions Fund Authority, which administers the pensions of the London borough employees, has sacked Cazenove as one of its external fund managers because of poor performance and replaced them with Gartmore, writes Norma Cohen. The move is part of a growing trend among pension funds to concentrate on four major independent fund managers, of which Gartmore is one. The others are Mercury Asset Management, Philips and Drew Fund Management and Schroder Asset Management and the group is estimated to manage roughly a quarter of the entire UK pension fund market. The LPFA, which has about Pounds 1.8bn in assets, has three external managers overseeing pools of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 480m each. Since 1988, Cazenove, PDFM and Prudential Portfolio Managers have each managed one of the pools. However, Cazenove has been unable to meet the performance target recently. Mr Peter Scales, chief executive of LPFA, said the managers were expected to produce returns, assessed on a three-year rolling basis, of one percentage point above the median UK pension fund pool as measured by the WM Company, an independent performance measurement service. Mr Scales said its short-list of contenders, besides Gartmore, were Schroder, Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford and Baring Asset Management. Also, LPFA has removed Bacon and Woodrow as its actuarial advisers and retained the much smaller consultancy firm of Hymans Robertson. Mr Scales said that while Bacon and Woodrow had provided excellent service, the LPFA preferred a consultancy firm specialising in the local authority market.</p>

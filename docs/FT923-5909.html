			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Poland hopes foreign banks will buy treasury bonds POLAND, struggling to finance a weighty budget deficit, hopes foreign banks will start buying its three-year treasury bonds next month, once it has ironed out a technical hitch over the repatriation of interest, Reuter reports from Warsaw. None of the foreign banks invited at the end of last month to bid for a 7,000bn zloty issue - the first of its kind - took part. Ms Alicja Malecka, a finance ministry adviser seconded from the US Treasury, said the banks were put off because a foreign exchange permit was not ready. 'The banks were not sure they would be able to repatriate the interest,' she said. The permit is now expected to come into force by mid-September, and this had raised 'a lot of interest' from banks, mutual funds and individuals in the US, Britain, Austria and Switzerland, she said. The annualised interest on the bonds, payable every three months, was set at 47.22 per cent for the first quarter. Although this compares with an expected annual inflation rate of 40 per cent, the response has been modest. By August 8, two thirds of the first tranche of one year bonds had been sold. Unsold bonds from the first tranche will be rolled into the next auction and public offer, at the beginning of November. The second tranche begins next week. The bonds carry interest equal to yearly inflation plus five per cent interest.</p>

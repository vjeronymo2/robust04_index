			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Tecs and government split over training for jobless SHARP DIFFERENCES in priorities for training the jobless have emerged between the government and the private-sector-led bodies it pays Pounds 1.8bn a year to carry out the programmes, according to a survey by the Financial Times. The survey is the second to canvass the opinions of the 1,220 board members of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales which are now responsible for delivering the government's main training programmes. Most of the Tec directors who responded rated the training of the jobless as their lowest priority, although most public funding they receive is for that purpose. Top priority, according to a majority of the directors, mostly senior business men and women, was local economic regeneration, including the creation of jobs so that proper opportunities could exist for the unemployed. One director said: 'Jobs should be real and not cosmetic.' The survey highlights the frustration of many Tec directors who want more discretion in assessing local economic and labour market needs as the recession ends. Fifty-nine per cent of directors in the survey were not satisfied with the way Tecs collectively communicate with the government. The findings are topical. While the government sees Tecs as here to stay, there are growing tensions in Whitehall itself over how the partnerships should evolve. Tecs themselves want more co-ordination between government departments so that a more focused approach could be taken to areas such as education and training. Half the 506 directors who responded to the survey - more than 40 per cent of all the Tec directors in England and Wales - advocated the establishment of a new department of education and training. Directors gave broad general approval to many of the innovative ideas on tackling unemployment being piloted by the Department of Employment, such as subsidising employers taking on long-term unemployed individuals. Concern was expressed, however, over the potential for job substitution. One of the most controversial ideas being considered by the government is 'workfare'. Selected groups would have to take up either community jobs or training in return for benefits. Forty-six per cent of respondents in the survey supported such a move. Directors were also in favour of a credit, or entitlement, for people aged 16 to 19 to undertake either academic or vocational education. The survey showed widespread concern about government economic policy. Call for wider action, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

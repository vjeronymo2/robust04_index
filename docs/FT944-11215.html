			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (19): Hong Kong's role is crucial - For now, Hong Kong remains the main international financial centre for the mainland Ultimately, bankers and brokers expect Shanghai to take on the role of China's New York: but for now, the mainland's financial centre is firmly based in the 1,070 sq kms of territory now under British rule. Hong Kong has long capitalised on its geographical position in terms of China trade, but its role as a money-raising centre has emerged more recently and is reflected in the growing number - and size - of foreign financial institutions setting up shop in the colony. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs have doubled their Hong Kong head-count in the space of a year (in Goldman's case, to 400 from 200). While beefing up Hong Kong staffing levels is indicative of the lure of Asia in general, the emphasis on the colony over Tokyo or Singapore more particularly underlines the starring role of China. China's massive spending programmes - such as a planned USDollars 120bn over the next decade on power and Yn54bn (Dollars 6.35bn) this year on building telephone lines - will ensure it is a regular user of the world capital markets. However, its relative inexperience means that - for now - it is highly dependent on overseas markets for experts who can dovetail its needs with those of international investors. This can be a frustrating role for the colony's bankers - as those working in power project financing could testify. Nearly a year's worth of economically viable power deals have been mothballed because investors are demanding higher rates of return than Beijing is willing to concede. However, perseverance is expected to pay off and many are looking for a relaxation from Beijing during the course of next year. One of the biggest roles in China's cash-raising drive has been played by the Hong Kong stock exchange, Asia's second biggest stock market and the first overseas bourse to establish the regulatory framework for mainland companies to secure an overseas listing directly - that is, without first registering offshore or buying into a shell company to engineer a 'backdoor listing.' So far, 11 mainland companies have raised a total HKDollars 13.4bn (USDollars 1.7bn) on the Hong Kong stock exchange through the creation of H shares; some 15 selected companies are scheduled to follow. The role of conduit between Chinese issuer and international investor was conceived in early 1992, soon after Mr Charles Lee - who retired last month  -took up the chairmanship. H shares, former mainland state-owned enterprises listing in the colony, were effectively borne out of the conclusion that growth potential must lie beyond Hong Kong - a conclusion many of the exchange's members were also discovering. The fruits of lengthy negotiations between regulatory authorities in Hong Kong and China - with the former seeking to ensure issuers complied with international standards - was a joint Memorandum of Understanding and the hugely successful listing of Tsingtao Brewery, the company responsible for China's best known beer, in July of last year: the HKDollars 889m issue was 110 times oversubscribed. Tsingtao was one of an initial list of nine state-owned companies selected for an overseas listing, all of which are now trading in Hong Kong. A second list of 22 companies followed in January, of which around 17 will have their primary listing in Hong Kong, and the expectation is for still bigger lists in subsequent years. Some 15 months on, sentiment has waned heavily: a reflection of concerns over China's overheating economy and the impending demise of paramount leader and architect of China's capitalist drive, Deng Xiaoping, allied with more widespread fears, such as rising interest rates, which are hurting markets worldwide. Price earnings multiples have fallen sharply: from almost 18 in the case of Tsingtao to just nine in the case of Qingling Motors, the light duty truck maker which raised a total HKDollars 1.04bn in August. The stock exchange, however, is not allowing the vacillations of sentiment to undermine its position as the premier exchange for the issuance and trading of China securities. In August, Hang Seng Index Services, which is responsible for the colony's blue chip index of the same name, launched an H share index as a specific barometer for the mainland companies, raising their profile and providing an investment benchmark. In its latest blueprint for the future, The Way Forward, the stock exchange shows its hand will remain stacked in favour of China: 'Most participants with whom the exchange met stressed that the single most important issue facing the exchange was how it could best serve China's capital formation needs. It was felt that serving these needs represented the exchange's best opportunity of long term future growth.' The exchange is now considering the introduction of a more active debt market, in part to carve a further niche in enabling China incorporated institutions to raise capital through bond issues in Hong Kong. While China bonds have been arranged by Hong Kong bankers - especially where distribution is aimed at the South East Asian market (the so-called dragon bond market) the bigger global issues tend to have been handled further afield. However, both the government and private sectors remain alert to the fact Hong Kong cannot take for granted its role as China's premier capital raising market. Some believe that Hong Kong's spiralling costs and deteriorating skills, especially in English and Putonghua, the main spoken language of China, could erode this role. Mr David Li, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and chief executive of Bank of East Asia, the third biggest listed bank in the colony, recently warned of another, altogether closer, rival: 'Within China itself, Shanghai is aiming to become the leading financial centre. There is talk that Shanghai may replace Hong Kong. It can sometimes be easier to recruit talented employees in China than it is in Hong Kong. 'The possibility that Shanghai could replace Hong Kong is at the heart of the challenges we face. Because many of our strengths can be reproduced, or even transferred, the possibility of tomorrow's Shanghai is sobering. It suggests that we could lose the race for greater competitiveness.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies and market capitalisation in HKDollars m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                         Listing    Issue   Closing     Market name                               date    price   price at   capit'n                                            in HK    Oct 25,    Oct 25                                          dollars   1994 in    1994 in                                                  HKDollars  HKDollars m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tsingtao Brewery            July 15 1993    2.80     5.60    1,942.36 Shanghai Petrochemical      July 26 1993    1.58     2.50    4,200.00 Beiren Printing Machinery  August 6 1993    2.08    3.525      352.50 Guangzhou Shipyard         August 6 1993    2.08    3.875      609.92 Maanshan Iron &amp; Steel         Nov 3 1993    2.27     2.40    4,159.03 Kunming Machine Tool          Dec 7 1993    1.98     3.20      208.00 Yizheng Chemical Fibre     March 29 1994    2.38    2.925    2,925.00 Tianjin Bohai Chemical       May 17 1994    1.20     1.26      428.40 Dongfang Electrical          June 6 1994    2.83     4.25      722.50 Luoyang Glass                July 8 1994    3.65    4.125    1,031.25 Qingling Motors           August 17 1994    2.07    3.125    3,062.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT statistics, Hong Kong  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

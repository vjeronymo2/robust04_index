			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The management of Russia's unified power grid has  proclaimed a state of emergency in the industry. For the first  time ever, fuel reserves have dropped to a critical level that  poses a real threat of whole regions being cut off from the  power supply. In order to bring the situation back to normal,  the power engineers have asked consumers to repay their debts  and the government to grant the industry credits on preferential  terms.</p>

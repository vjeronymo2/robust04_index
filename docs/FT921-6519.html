			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: New Zealand's exporters gain as economy recovers - Second-liners have risen sharply but heavyweights have remained in the doldrums Prices for many second- line stocks have risen sharply as New Zealand investors show increasing confidence in the country's economic fortunes. This follows a spate of good economic news, strong profit recoveries and rising business confidence. Interest rates have been falling and there has been a sharp drop in the New Zealand dollar, which is helping exporters. Commodity prices have also risen and inflation is now running at just 1 per cent, the lowest rate of any OECD country. Some companies, especially those in the exporting sector, have seen their share prices double or quadruple in recent months. However, leading stocks have been immune to this trend and, judging from their performance, the New Zealand market is in the doldrums. The NZSE-40 index, which started on September 30 last year, struggled back through the 1,500 mark this week, to close at 1,535.86 yesterday. The index has recovered from its mid-December low of 1,409.86 but is still well off its all-time high of 1,561.74 reached last November. The index is dominated by heavyweights which have been out of favour. These include Fletcher Challenge, the country's largest industrial company, which is 79 cents below its 12-month high of NZDollars 4.21. The stock has been depressed by last week's news of a sharp fall in profits from its inter-national pulp and paper operations and lacklustre performances from all of its other activities except petro-chemicals. Brierley Investments is receiving little support as investors reassess its future following the sale last December of Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, its UK-based motor division. Suggestions that it might become a major player in Australian aviation following yesterday's decision to increase its shareholding in Air New Zealand to 42.5 per cent is also weighing on the stock. Telecom has been weak on reports that it is losing market share to its main rival Clear Communications, which now gives a cheaper telephone service across 80 per cent of New Zealand. But Telecom picked up a little this week after stating that it was planning to expand in Australia and Asia. Lion Nathan, the brewer, has yet to recover the ground it lost since its proposed merger with Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) was cancelled in January. News that it was going to acquire the 50 per cent stake it does not own in National Brewing Holdings, Australia's second biggest brewer, from ACIL was seen as the less favoured option. However, second-liners tell a different story, especially exporters, which have been in big demand. The commodity exporter Mair, which was selling at 50 cents last year, has jumped from 85 cents to NZDollars 2.45 this year, with most of the rise following last week's announcement of a strong increase in profits, the reinstatement of the dividend and a one-for-three scrip issue. Shares in niche primary producing companies such as the apple producers Applefields and Eastern Equities, Grocorp and Agland have shown similar rises. Manufacturing exporters, which are prospering in Australia under the Closer Economic Relations trade pact, have been sought. Ceramco, the engineering, food and clothing conglomerate, has concentrated on high-quality lingerie and now controls 25 per cent of the Australian market: its shares have risen from 76 cents to NZDollars 2.55 this year. Even the speculators are back. Remarkable movements have been seen in the shares of the investment bank Fay, Richwhite - whose flamboyant founder, Mr Michael Fay, is heading New Zealand's challenge in the America's Cup yacht race. Fay, Richwhite shares have moved in tandem with the success or otherwise of the yacht's performance in the qualifying races. In one burst they shot from 70 cents to NZDollars 1.19, but stood at 90 cents yesterday. All of these fluctuations have been in spite of warnings from the company that there is nothing in its current trading to support such sharp movements. History is repeating itself. In the previous challenge, the company, then known as Capital Markets, saw its shares advance from a few cents to over NZDollars 8 when it seemed the challenge might be successful.</p>

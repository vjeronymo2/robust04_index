			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME SECURITY;  </P> <P> PROTECTING A HOUSE FROM BURGLARY DURING VACATION  </P> <P> One of the joys of traveling is coming home.  </P> <P> Reduce the risk of finding that your house has been burglarized by following  these tips before leaving:  </P> <P> * Ask a trusted neighbor to collect the mail, newspapers and deliveries and to  check the house from time to time.  </P> <P> * Arrange to have the lawn mowed.  </P> <P> * Put valuables and documents in a bank safe-deposit box.  </P> <P> * Lock all doors and windows, including those in the garage.  </P> <P> * Light all entries. Burglars avoid bright areas.  </P> <P> * Instead of leaving interior lights and appliances on all the time, set timers  to simulate normal use.  </P> <P> * Turn down the bell on the telephone. A nonstop ringing phone tells a burglar  that no one is home.  </P> <P> * Don't store empty trash cans outside. Hide them in a locked garage or out of  sight.  </P> <P> * Leave a car in the driveway or ask a neighbor to park there.  </P> <P> * Remove anything that shows names or addresses from a car that must be left at  the airport.  </P> <P> * Don't announce vacation plans in the local paper.  </P> <P> * Remember that the goal is to create the illusion that the house is occupied  as usual. Take some time before departure to analyze the home's vulnerable  areas and eliminate anything that could make it an easy target for burglary.  </P> <P> Distributed by AP Newsfeatures.  </P></p>

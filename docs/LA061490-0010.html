			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER WIN FOR WORD POWER;  </P> <P> * U.S. MUST FOCUS ON AIDING NICARAGUA NOW, AND DO IT ZEALOUSLY  </P> <P> This week's demobilization of the Nicaraguan rebel army included a powerful act  of symbolism for all Central America. When the Contras' weapons, last fired  only weeks ago, were sliced in half by blowtorches, it proved the power of  words over the roar of cannons. It was words -- dialogue, peace negotiations --  that convinced both sides in the Nicaraguan conflict to hold elections, to  accept the outcome and, finally, to beat their swords into plowshares.  </P> <P> Not once in the eight years of the civil war did military pressure bring the  Sandinista government and the Contra leadership face to face. Superpower  posturing didn't lead to solutions, either. The conflict simply exhausted  Nicaraguans, who were more concerned with putting food on the table and keeping  sons out of the fighting.  </P> <P> Not until the Iran-Contra scandal left Washington with a Central American  policy vacuum did Nicaragua's political agenda revert to the region's leaders:  Most notably former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won a Nobel Peace  Prize for authoring the peace plan that led to Nicaragua's elections. And only  after U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off did they finally sit down to  seriously negotiate.  </P> <P> United States policy-makers, in particular, must understand the value that  simple dialogue played in bringing this long war to an end. Negotiations must  also be pushed in nearby El Salvador, where a shorter but bloodier civil war  still rages with U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for the government side.  </P> <P> Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, must scramble to forge  national unity among those who have spent a decade doing battle with one  another. And she must salvage her country's economy, shattered after years of  war. That's where U.S. policy-makers must focus their efforts to help Nicaragua  now. And they must do so with all the zeal they showed while supporting the  Contras for far too long.  </P></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Reforms hit European drugs industry EUROPE'S pharmaceuticals industry continued to suffer the effects of healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy during the first third of the year. Drugs sales in Europe's seven largest markets fell from Dollars 16.65bn in the four months to April 1992 to Dollars 15.66bn (Pounds 10.4bn) during the same period this year. The figures, compiled by the pharmaceuticals market research company IMS International, were affected by the devaluations of a number of European currencies. In local currencies, sales in the seven countries increased 1.4 per cent, compared with 8 per cent in the whole of 1992. The seven markets represent about 85 per cent of the west European market. France overtook Germany as the world's third largest market, as drugs sales increased from Dollars 3.93bn during the first four months in 1992 to Dollars 4.23bn during the same period this year, an increase of 7.2 per cent excluding currencies. The German market, hit by a 5 per cent price cut in January and the introduction of curbs on doctors' prescribing, fell from Dollars 4.67bn to Dollars 4.17bn, a drop of 11 per cent excluding currencies. The figures include sales in eastern Germany. Italian sales fell 0.6 per cent in the local currency after health reforms this year. They dropped from Dollars 3.76bn to Dollars 2.97bn. The UK posted a drop from Dollars 1.71bn to Dollars 1.62bn, but excluding currencies it reported a gain of 11.6 per cent. Spanish sales fell from Dollars 1.62bn to Dollars 1.61bn, but generated a 13.2 per cent rise in local currencies. The Dutch market was the fastest-growing among the seven, rising from Dollars 461m to Dollars 530m, an increase of 14.4 per cent excluding exchange rates. Sales in Belgium increased from Dollars 499m to Dollars 529m, a rise of 5.9 per cent in local currencies. In dollar terms, all therapeutic categories reported a drop in sales except for anti-infectives, which include anti-viral and anti-fungal treatments. These increased from Dollars 1.61bn to Dollars 1.62bn. Excluding exchange rates, sales of anti-infectives rose 9.5 per cent, alimentary and metabolism treatments increased 0.4 per cent, central nervous system drugs rose 4.1 per cent, and respiratory medicines, mainly asthma medicines, rose 5.9 per cent. All figures include purchases by pharmacies, representing about 80 per cent of total drugs sales. They exclude end-users such as hospitals.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   WEST EUROPEAN PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-APRIL 1993 (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             France      Germany    Italy     Spain  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular                998         988       616       275 Alimentary/metabolism         725         724       436       305 Anti-infectives               470         439       278       228 Central nervous system        554         260       349       123 Respiratory                   359         493       220       228 Musculo-skeletal              189         229       173       119 Blood/organs                  244         160       196        26 Others                        689         874       700       312 Total                       4,228       4,167     2,968     1,616  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               UK        Belgium   Holland    Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular                272         100        95     3,344 Alimentary/metabolism         237          84       119     2,630 Anti-infectives               155          79        66     1,715 Central nervous system        220          73        37     1,616 Respiratory                   171          56        75     1,602 Musculo-skeletal               77          31        24       842 Blood/organs                   36          20        20       702 Others                        448          87        95     3,205 Total                       1,616         530       531    15,656  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: lMS International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): How today's telephones limit tomorrow's technology / A look at developments in office communications CORDLESS phones have begun to make an impact in the home. But traditional PABXs still dominate the office. Ian Garcia, marketing communications manager at GPT, says: 'Cordless PABXs will never be the norm in business; but they are essential for managers who spend 50 to 60 per cent of their time away from their desks.' Factory managers at Wavin Industrial Products, a maker of plastic pipe and fitting systems, are testing GPT software which adds cordless communications to their standard PABX. Now the managers use cordless handsets to make and receive calls from the factory floor, where they spend much of their time. Cordless phones also have a place in the 'virtual office,' like one run by Digital Equipment in Sweden. Here no-one has a permanent office, but desks and computers can be booked as and when they are needed. Cordless PABXs are ideal in this environment because the switchboard operator doesn't need to know where people are to put a call through, (see article on facing page). Despite the benefits, take up of cordless PABXs has been slow. Keith Mallinson, director of research at the Yankee Group Europe, says: 'This is starting to change with the launch of new products from Northern Telecom and Ericsson.' There are two main types of cordless technology - CT2 (cordless telephony 2) and DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephony standard). Northern Telecom and GPT both sell products which are developments from the CT2 standard, used in the UK Rabbit wireless phone network. Ericsson prefers DECT, which is backed by Etsi, the European Telecoms Standards Institute. Mr Mallinson believes there is room for both technologies and that the market will grow - 'between 10 and 20 per cent of office workers could be using cordless phones by the end of the century,' he says. However, in the longer term, he believes that improvements to the interface between humans and phone networks will have a more significant effect on the way phones are used in offices. HORRENDOUS HANDSETS Telephone handsets seem easy to use so long as you only want to dial a number. But many people even have difficulty forwarding a call to a nearby desk. In fact, if you try to set up a conference call on a PABX or want to use BT's Star Services (such as Charge Advice), you will need a good memory for weird combinations of buttons, numbers and symbols. The poor interface between phone user and network will become even more apparent when the next generation of phone services, such as Selective Call Barring, Selective Call Forwarding, and display of Caller ID, become available. Some believe that phones should be controlled by the user's personal computer. But many will find this a turn off. In the meantime, 'screen phones' are being developed to fill the breach. These consist of a handset linked to a small liquid crystal display. The challenge for the telecoms industry is to make them as easy to use as through-the-wall cash machines or ATMs. There are several screen phones available, (mainly in the US) including models from AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom and Philips. Some have keyboards; others are operated by buttons near the screen. Widespread use of screen phones is some way off; use of enhanced network services is much closer. This month BT begins trials in Perth, Scotland, of Caller ID equipment (which displays the caller's phone number) and Caller Return services. Caller Return means that if the phone stops ringing before you get to it, you can find out the caller's phone number by pressing a few buttons. If the six-month trials are successful, BT will offer the services to phone users nationwide next year. Another kind of enhanced service is available to business users over the public phone network. Called Centrex, this is essentially a substitute for having an in-house PABX. It uses the intelligence in digital exchanges to offer PABX-like features. In the past, these services have made very little headway but they now have some high profile customers such as Daiwa Bank which uses Mercury's Centrex service. VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS Instead of (or as well as) replacing the PABX, it is possible to replace a private telecoms network with a Virtual Private Network, (VPN). A VPN is essentially a substitute for a network of leased lines. Telecoms carriers which sell VPNs argue that they offer the same service levels as private networks at a lower cost because they can carry several company's data at the same time. In the US, the market for VPNs is worth several billion dollars and has helped to take traffic off private networks and give it back to the telecoms carriers. European telecoms carriers hope that VPN will do the same for them. One advantage from the carrier's point of view is that VPNs enable them to offer a greater variety of different tariffs than is possible under traditional tariffing regulations. It is early days for European virtual private networks but they are already attracting customers like Barclays Bank. RACE TO OFFER TELECOMS 'OUTSOURCING' VPNs usually form part of the portfolio of services offered by telecoms suppliers which want to win telecoms outsourcing (or managed network services) business. Telecoms outsourcing involves taking over the management and day-to-day running of a company's telecommunications network. Sometimes the network is already in existence. Sometimes the telecoms company expands it or builds a new one, often making use of its own voice and data networks. Jonathan Crane, president of MCI National Accounts, says the global network outsourcing market is geared primarily towards the estimated 2,500 multinational corporations in the world that have extensive communications networks spanning the globe. These have to deal with a multiplicity of telecommunications carriers and bills in a variety of currencies. They therefore have much to gain from handing over their networks to a third party. A bigger incentive, however, is the potential for cost reduction. For example, US bank J P Morgan expects to save Dollars 12.5m in operating expenses through its Dollars 20m five-year contract with BT and could save more from its Dollars 80m contract with MCI/Infonet. MCI, now in a joint telecoms outsourcing venture with BT, estimates that the global network outsourcing market is worth Dollars 5bn a year with annual growth of 15 to 20 per cent. Fears about quality of service prevent the market from growing any faster, reflecting the conservative nature of office communications.

In particular, the dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific area will experience rapid growth in telecom service revenues in this decade, as this table indicates. Similarly, Latin America shows strong demand for telecom modernisation. Meanwhile, the success of mobile communications supports the 'leapfrog' theory that areas such as eastern Europe may skip generations of telecom development and leap to the latest technology.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT Telecoms Market Newsletter.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

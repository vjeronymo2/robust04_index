			<p>BFN     [Text] Mechyslaw Hryb and members of a governmental  delegation -- Deputy Prime Minister Syarhey Linh and Ivan  Tsyareshka, chairman of the Supreme Soviet permanent commission  for international matters -- have held a news conference at the  Supreme Soviet. The news conference was devoted to the results  of the delegation's participation in the session of the European  Parliament in Strasbourg.    The Belarusian delegation, Mechyslaw Hryb said, proposed to  discuss issues concerning mutual relations with European  countries and prospects for cooperation in various spheres of  life. The talks followed this direction.    I have understood, Mechyslaw Hryb said, that we are moving  toward the European Union, toward the European Parliament, very  slowly. We should have been there long ago, because people in  Europe have scarcely heard of us -- they believe that we are  still living under totalitarianism without any changes.  However, during our talks at the European Parliament, they were  convinced that this is not the case any longer.    After leaving Strasbourg, our delegation arrived in  Bucharest, where it participated in the Transmontana forum  devoted to various political and economic issues facing European  countries.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / TGWU starts ban on overtime at Vauxhall MEMBERS OF the TGWU general workers' union at Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, began an overtime ban yesterday in an effort to persuade the company to improve a pay offer. Other unions - including the AEU engineering workers' organisation - are expected to order members to refuse overtime work within the next few days. The Vauxhall offer to 9,000 manual workers would provide 5 per cent rises from October last year and an increase in line with inflation from this October, plus a single unconsolidated payment of 0.5 per cent of salary. Employees at the Luton car assembly and parts plants would receive an extra 5 per cent on meeting demands for changes in work practices and bargaining procedures. The unions are angry that Vauxhall has refused to concede a reduction in the 39-hour week. They say the proposed deal is worth less than that won recently by Ford workers.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SITTER HELD IN ATTEMPTED MURDER OF CHILD  </P> <P> Los Angeles police Friday arrested a baby-sitter on suspicion of attempted  murder after paramedics found an 18-month-old Van Nuys girl bruised and  unconscious.  </P> <P> Nova Marcia Thompson, 34, of Van Nuys was jailed without bail a day after  paramedics were called to her home in the 14300 block of Vanowen Street when  the child she was caring for stopped breathing, police said. Police did not  release the child's name.  </P> <P> Lt. Warren Knowles said the girl's father had left her in Thompson's care  Wednesday and was going to return for her Thursday afternoon. But Thompson  called the father Thursday morning and said the girl had stopped breathing. The  father notified paramedics, who took the girl to Valley Presbyterian Hospital  in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Police were called because paramedics and doctors noticed bruises on the girl's  head and body and a burn mark on her leg, Knowles said.  </P> <P> Knowles said investigators have not determined exactly how the girl was  injured. He said Thompson was arrested Thursday on suspicion of child abuse but  was rearrested Friday on suspicion of attempted murder when detectives received  a doctor's report that the girl remained in a coma on life-support equipment  and was not expected to live.  </P></p>

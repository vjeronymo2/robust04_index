			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan "obviously" has the  capability to produce nuclear weapons, a Japanese Government  source said Monday [20 June], endorsing a similar remark made  recently by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata amid a crisis over North  Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.    "Judging from Japan's scientific techniques and economic  power, it is obvious," the source said, speaking on condition of  anonymity.    The source, however, said, "intention and capability are  different. Absence of intention (to produce nuclear arms)  should be definite."    "There is no need for the government to deny nor emphasize  (such capability)," the source added.    Hata told reporters on Friday that "it's certainly the case  that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has  not made them."    The premier said Japan has abstained from holding such arms  in line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai has called Hata's  remarks an insufficient explanation of the government's true  position.    He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of nuclear  energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military utilization  and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons technology or  know-how."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng arrived here this afternoon for a two-day official visit,  the first by a Chinese head of government to Mongolia in over  three decades.    Prime Minister P. Jasray presided over a grand ceremony at  the airport to welcome Li Peng, who ended a 10-day tour of  Central Asia earlier today.    A written statement was issued upon Li's arrival at the  airport.    "We are happy to see the gratifying expansion of  Sino-Mongolian friendly cooperation in all fields in the past  few years," Li said.    The maintaining of a friendly and good-neighborly  relationship between China and Mongolia conforms with the common  wishes and fundamental interests of the two peoples, and will  benefit peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific  region as well, he said.    During this visit, Li said, he expects to hold talks with  Prime Minister P. Jasray and meet with president P. Ochirbat  to exchange views on ways of furthering bilateral relations and  on other issues of common concern.    Also, the two sides will sign a treaty on Sino-Mongolian  friendship and cooperation, he said.    The document will further advance the friendly relations as  well as exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in  all fields, he said.    China will work together with Mongolia towards that goal, he  said.</p>

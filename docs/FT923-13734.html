			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Friend of the humblest angler: Fishing - The writings of Hugh Tempest Sheringham occupy a special place in Tom Fort's library A LITTLE over a quarter of a century ago my eyes were first opened to the possibility that there might be more to fishing than catching or, commonly in my own distressing case, failing to catch fish. One of my elder brothers and I, browsing in a secondhand bookshop in Reading, came upon a case of books on angling. We were passionate fishermen, but of a severely non spiritual kind. Among the books we bought was one bound in faded red cloth. Its spine was decorated with two crossed fishing rods, between which were a net and a fat basket with lid raised to display something resembling a chub or carp. It cost two-and-sixpence, and was called An Open Creel. The author's name was HT Sheringham. I read it straight through, with a swiftly swelling sense of wonder and delight. Even now, I can recall the condition of hilarity to which I was reduced by the chapter entitled A Day of Tribulation, in which Sheringham describes a succession of calamities which overtook him during a day's wet fly fishing, presumably on the Exe. I was, at that time, making my own first, cack-handed attempts to educate myself in the use of a fly rod. It was a great solace to find the despair which overwhelmed me as I sought to deliver my flies in the teeth of gales mirrored in this light-footed but deeply felt prose. Just as I had railed against Providence, so Sheringham - having left his cast in a bush over deep water - sat down to contrast his misfortunes with those of Job. A little while later came the loss of the big fish on which his heart was set, leaving me to my thoughts of Job and his exaggerated griefs. Having devoured An Open Creel, my brothers and I (for a third also became a devotee) rushed back to the shop in Reading, and snapped up Elements of Angling (first published in 1908) and Coarse Fishing (1912). These led to Trout Fishing: Memories and Morals and to An Angler's Hours. These books were the foundation of a collection which now amounts to almost 600. I cherish them all, even the ones I have never got round to reading. And there are writers to whom I return again and again: JW Hills, Zane Grey, Roderick Haig-Brown, BB, GD Luard, Frank Barker, FA Mitchell-Hedges, Richard Walker, Chris Yates, Negley Arthur Ransome, Harry Plunket Greene. All I regard as friends, and all I admire for the way they brought the sport to life. Yet I have never changed the opinion I must have formed in those early days: that Hugh Tempest Sheringham was the finest of them all. He was brought up in Tewkesbury, where his father was vicar. The flavour of his childhood, and the dawning of the passion for rivers, are exquisitely captured in the opening chapter of An Open Creel, Waters Of Youth. The affection for the chub - whether caught on worm or cheese or, best of all, fly - was born on the Severn and Avon and their tributaries, and was never to leave him. While his grandfather, the stern archdeacon, endeavoured to bend him to the discipline of Latin verse, the boy's imagination ran on water meadows, the play of sunlight on moving water, the tantalising mysteries of the depths beneath the hanging branches of willows. In 1903 Sheringham - who had been a classical scholar at Cambridge - became angling editor of the Field; a job he held until his early death 27 years later. Had he gone into the Church, or to the British Museum - which was his ambition - he might well have joined the great throng of us whose immortal masterpieces remain locked in our heads. He produced a mass of writing which made him among the most cherished and respected authorities on fishing of his day. When he died he was mourned by the good and the great, and the not so great. As his friend, John Moore, wrote: It was chiefly the humbler angler that he loved, and by whom he was loved in return. For Sheringham was a curiosity, a socialist fisherman. Although he relished his days on the Itchen, Test and Kennet, he always fished them as a guest. The sort of club he cared to belong to was the one he celebrated in A Suburban Fishery, in An Angler's Hours, where a man might stalk a trout or two, then cast a fly for chub, and finish his day watching his float circle a shaded eddy in the hope that the perch or roach might bite. It was in his passion for coarse fishing that Sheringham's democratic instincts are most apparent. Yet his enthusiasm was almost heretical. The gods of the age - such as Halford - did not demean themselves by considering the ways of chub. Only the salmon in his Scottish torrent, and the noble trout of the chalkstream, were considered worthy of a gentleman's time and study. Sheringham's partiality for floats and spinners, worms and cheese, an 18 foot rod and a Nottingham-style centrepin reel, made him an object of curiosity and ridicule among his friends. Sheringham loved rivers like the lower Kennet, the Colne and the Evenlode, where democracy reigned and the fish which rose to his fly was as likely to be a chub or a dace as a trout. As for salmon, he caught his share, mainly from the Welsh Dee and the Coquet in Northumberland. But he maintained an air of lofty indifference to the celebrated, exclusive rivers of Scotland, and appeared to believe that those who fished them, and nowhere else, were not truly to be counted of the brotherhood. As a writer, Sheringham's voice came as a fresh breeze, dispersing tired old conventions. His manner is wise and humorous, his style delicious in its elegance and wit. But the best of him is that he speaks of fishing as other fishermen find it, of rare triumphs and frequent reverses. He subscribes wholeheartedly to the axiom that it is better to catch fish than not to do so - but knows well eno ugh that, for ordinary folk, success in fishing as in other matters can never easily be won. An Angler For All Seasons, a Sheringham anthology, introduced by Tom Fort, is published on July 23 by Merlin Unwin, Pounds 16.95.</p>

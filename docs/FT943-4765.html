			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Peek profits show 57% rise to Pounds 3.26m A strong performance from the field data systems division helped Peek, whose principal business is traffic systems, to lift interim profits sharply. They rose to Pounds 3.26m for the six months to June, from Pounds 2.07m in the corresponding period last year, when there was a loss of Pounds 554,000 on the disposal of discontinued businesses. Total group sales grew by 28 per cent, from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 56.6m. Mr Allen Standley, chief executive, said that the field data division had benefited from improving markets and wider acceptance of the company's newer products, including the Husky hand-held computer. Net cash totalled Pounds 158,000 in the period, compared with net borrowings of Pounds 1.9m in the year-earlier period. Interest payable was Pounds 11,000, compared with Pounds 194,000 received previously. Earnings per share improved from 1.11p to 1.75p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.05p.</p>

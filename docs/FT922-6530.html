			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Schools and business in partnership Sir, Miss F H McLean is stringently critical (Letters, May 16) of an initiative by a well-known supermarket to support local schools by the issue of vouchers exchangeable for free computer equipment. Miss McLean's notion that this offer 'well illustrates' the partnership between business and education - which the government is encouraging - is both capricious and misleading. Our Mid Glamorgan Education Business Partnership has now been in existence for over three years and has developed very robust and extensive relationships between the local education authority, the Welsh Office, industry and commerce, our Training and Enterprise Council, teachers and students, and local communities. My colleagues, mainly secondees from education and business, are involved in delivering specific programmes to 42 comprehensive schools, nine special schools, and many of our 350 primary schools in the county. These programmes include enterprise development, curriculum enhancement, teacher placement and compact. Our second annual report, for 1990-91, lists 150 local private and public sector organisations which have provided much appreciated support during the year. Tesco, the supermarket in question, is one of these organisations. At a recent three-day European conference on school/industry links at Porthcawl, Mr David Hunt, the secretary of state for Wales, delivered a supportive speech underlining his, and the government's, commitment to the partnership concept as achieved in Mid Glamorgan.

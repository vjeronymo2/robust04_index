			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / High price for Tokyo's high-rise rice Mr Shoko Sato would not look out of place in rural Japan. But this property developer was yesterday planting rice deep in the heart of Tokyo, in Ginza, one of the world's most urbanised and expensive real estate markets. Mr Sato's 850 sq metre plot, a former car park surrounded by towering office blocks, is worth about Y10bn (Pounds 65.78m). The price of Japanese rice might have soared after the failure of two harvests, and land values in the city may have collapsed following the end of the 'bubble economy', but downtown Tokyo is an unlikely location for rice culture. For one thing, Mr Sato's site will not produce rice profits. When harvested in September, the paddy will yield just 20kg. Each grain will cost about Y600 to produce; one 80g bowl will cost more than Y2m (Pounds 13,100). Mr Sato, who is also a director of an industrial incinerator business, explains: 'I originally planned to build a karaoke bar complex with a small strip for growing vegetables to supply an adjoining pub. But when I went to the financial institutions I was turned down. The economy was going badly and the bottom had fallen out of the karaoke market.' He was unable to lease the land and was unwilling to sell given the state of the market. He was then approached by a charity intrigued by his idea of growing vegetables in central Tokyo. The Japan Welfare Education Scholarship Foundation, which promotes healthcare for the aged, had become concerned about the impact of agrochemicals on health. Mr Hitoi Sato, the charity's managing director who is no relation to the owner, explains: 'We're concerned about the decline of Japanese agriculture and also want to promote the consumption of organic rice and vegetables that haven't been over-processed. 'By planting the rice here it allows us to remind people of the importance of rice in Japanese society.' Next to the paddy, the foundation has set up stalls to sell organic vegetables and free-range eggs. The charity has also arranged for children to visit the site. The foundation's charitable status allows the venture and the owner to avoid incurring taxes on the site. The owner, Mr Sato, says he will decide after the September rice harvest what to do with the site. 'It depends on the economy. I doubt it'll be a permanent agricultural field. But I know I won't build a karaoke bar, that's for sure.' Hata seeks restart of US trade talks, Page 6</p>

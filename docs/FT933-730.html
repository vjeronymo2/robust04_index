			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Howard to discuss firefighter pay COUNCIL LEADERS will tell Mr Michael Howard, home secretary today, that the government must take the blame if there is a firefighters' strike. They are due to meet this morning for talks on the future of the 15-year-old firefighters pay formula. 'If the government does not agree to honour the formula - which in the past it has supported - then we will potentially be faced with a serious dispute entirely of the government's making,' warned Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, and Ms Josie Farrington, chairwoman of the Association of County Councils, in a joint statement yesterday. They added that a dispute would result in costs for the provision of emergency cover. 'We will ask the home secretary who he intends should pay for this in the event of industrial action,' they said. 'Instead of the Home Office advising fire authorities - possibly at their own expense - to draw up plans for strike action, the government should be working with the employers to find a way of averting a dispute. We hope today's talks will achieve this.' The employers say the provision of a back-up service for one day, with Green Goddesses and troops to deal with emergencies, would cost more than meeting the firefighters' pay formula in full. 'The cost of a strike would outweigh any benefits achieved,' said Mr Tony Ritchie, chairman of the Metropolitan Authorities fire committee. If today's meeting at the Home Office fails to provide employers with room for financial manoeuvre, there is the strong possibility of a series of one-day strikes, starting in the second week of November. The Fire Brigades Union is due to ballot 50,000 firefighters next Monday, asking for their support for one-day strikes. The result will be known on November 1. The union's leaders are due to meet the employers on Friday, when they hope agreement on this year's pay formula can be reached, as well as a commitment for next year. The size of the increase the firefighters could expect in November under the formula will be known on Thursday when the government's earnings survey for 1993 is published. This provides the basis for the firefighters' award as their pay is linked to the upper quartile of full-time male manual earnings. The employers have already intimated they will meet this year's formula in full.</p>

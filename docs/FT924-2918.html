			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Eastward, look, the land is bright Despite the fascination of the gloomy media and financial commentators with the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the undoubted presence of many warning signs, there is still no evidence to date that the industrial world faces a slump on anything like that scale. As the new London Business School Economic Outlook usefully reminds us, combined output in the seven leading industrial economies rose by  1/2 per cent in 1991 and a probable 1 per cent in 1992. This is certainly a slowdown compared with an established trend growth rate of 2 or 3 per cent per annum and creates obvious problems of rising joblessness. But nothing that has so far happened is anything like the Great Depression, when US output fell by a third and world trade diminished by more than two-thirds in value terms. Despite all the new elements of financial unease, the growth slowdown so far is of the same order as that of the early 1980s. Even in the UK the estimated output drop of 3 to 4 per cent on both occasions is less than half of what was seen in 1929-33. The slowdown in the west, together with the genuinely depressed state of the 'former centrally planned economies' - a euphemism for the ex-Soviet Union and its satellites - has been enough to put competitive markets under a cloud, to provoke some sneaking sympathy in the west for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's opponents in the military industrial complex, to bring back into fashion itchy government interventionism, and to make the foreign offices of the west afraid to say 'boo' to any unpleasant autocracy which has done them the favour of placing arms orders. Someone who is suspicious of this mood music and wants to cheer up in the face of the Edinburgh summit should look, not backwards to the Great Depression, but across to the other side of the world to the prospering developing countries of eastern Asia, which have contracted out of the world slowdown. These do not, incidentally, now include Japan, which has acquired most of the characteristics of the other Group of Seven industrial countries. Japanese growth in 1992 is estimated to be around 1 1/2 to 2 per cent and some leading Japanese economists expect a virtual standstill in 1993-94. By contrast, the four Asian 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - are all estimated to be growing by between 6 and 7 1/2 per cent this year. Even the non-tiger countries are achieving a comparable performance - China 5 1/2 per cent, Indonesia 6 1/2 per cent, Malaysia 7 1/2 per cent and Thailand 8 per cent. Only the Philippines has slowed to G7 growth rates. The ability of Asian developing countries to contract out of the western slowdown is not confined to the accidents of particular countries or years. Nor does it just reflect the ability to make use of a rising population. GDP per capita in all the Asian developing countries taken together has been rising at least twice as rapidly as in the G7, both in the boom of the 1980s and in the subsequent slowdown. The mixed group of Middle Eastern and European (mostly southern European) developing countries now also shows signs of outperforming the industrial leaders. But, despite the improvement in some of the formerly heavily indebted Latin American states, the region as a whole is still crawling; southern Africa is, alas, still in absolute decline. Asia's leading countries cover a great many different political and economic systems. What they do seem to have in common is a willingness to use market incentives (even in China), a well-established system of property rights (unlike the former Soviet Union), a respect for technical training, a very obvious work ethic and an increasing openness to trade. The achievement of the Asian developing countries attracts public attention when vulnerable American or European industries cry out for quotas or anti-dumping duties. But they still do not figure sufficiently in the general assessment of the world economy. This reflects the fact that the countries labelled 'industrial' by the IMF still account for well over 70 per cent of world GDP. Asia's developing countries together account for only just over 7 per cent. But compound interest has its own logic. To make a stylised projection: let us put together the Asian developing countries with those of the Middle East and southern Europe. Let us say that they account for 10 per cent of world GDP - a slight underestimate. Let us assume that all these countries together can achieve a growth rate averaging 6 per cent per annum (in total, not per capita). If the established industrial countries achieve only 2 per cent, they will be overtaken by 'Asia' just after the year 2040, within the lifetime of the majority of people now living. Even if western growth rates buck up to 3 per cent or Asian growth rates are slightly lower, the catch-up will come around 2060, still within within some people's lifetimes. These divergences are discussed from an industrial point of view by Lord Rees-Mogg in a thoughtful article in The Independent, published on Monday. He presents the rise of the Asian economies as a threat to European prosperity unless we all wake up and adopt more of the cultural characteristics I listed in a previous paragraph. We should indeed accept some of them selectively, but not out of fear. The growth of other areas of prosperity is an opportunity more than a threat. It is extremely unlikely that Asian citizens will forever want to pile up their export proceeds in the form of yen, dollar or even Ecu notes on their walls - although if they did it would be a pure gift to the G7. Rees-Mogg talks of industrial costs 2 per cent of those in Europe. They can only be low in some specific sectors because the general level of productivity in their whole economies is still well beneath that of the west. As general prosperity and productivity increase, so will real wages. Lord Macaulay made a famous attack on those who advocated child labour to counter the supposed competitive threats of that era. Other countries' growth is beneficial, and trade should be and can be a form of rivalry between companies rather than warfare between countries. But my main point is that we need both to stop patting the Asian countries on their heads as examples of successful development and to stop running scared of their achievements, but instead to begin to take them into that management, albeit minimal, of the world economy which even an international market system requires.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH IN REAL GDP PER HEAD  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Per cent (annual average)                1974-83    1983-89    1989-93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- G7                                           1.4        3.0        1.2 US                                           0.8        2.7        0.1 Japan                                        2.5        4.0        3.4 EC                                           1.6        2.7        1.4 Asian developing countries                   3.2        5.6        4.5 Middle East &amp; Europe developing countries   -0.6       -2.1        2.9 Latin America                                0.5        0.4        0.3 Africa                                      -0.3       -0.4       -1.0 UK                                           1.1        3.2       -0.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMF World Economic Outlook  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

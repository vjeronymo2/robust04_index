			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 7 May, BNS -- Laar said Estonia would like  to follow the "Lithuanian model" in pulling out Russian troops  and does not intend to make concessions like those Latvia agreed  upon, Estonian Prime Minister said Saturday [7 May] in an  interview.    Lithuania and Russia signed in 1992 a protocol and a  timetable for troop withdrawal, but did not conclude any  framework agreement to regulate the issue.    "The Estonian Government doesn't intend to make any  concessions to Russia," Laar emphasized in the interview with  BNS.    In the premier's view, Russia's failure to propose a date  for  the next round of talks in essence means suspension of the  negotiations.    "We are ready for talks and prepared to discuss all  questions  in a constructive spirit," Laar told BNS.    The prime minister said the withdrawal of Russian troops has  come to a virtual standstill in recent months and that about  2,500 troops still remain in Estonia.    The prime minister claimed Russia lacks the slightest wish  to  reach agreement and sign the prepared troop withdrawal accord.    Vasily Svirin, Russia's top negotiator, declared after the  end of the latest round of talks that Russia will sign the  agreement on the troop pullout only in a package with the accord  on social guarantees for military retirees. He referred to the  respective Latvian-Russian agreements initialed on 30 April.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Iraqis step up attacks on Shias IRAQI troops have surrounded Shia strongholds in the south of the country and are intensifying attacks on the rebel positions, it emerged yesterday. Diplomats at the United Nations said they expected the Security Council to act on the escalation of fighting in the south within days. 'It's a matter of extreme concern,' said one diplomat yesterday. Britain and the US have begun discussing how to respond to the offensive against the Shias, which has been waged intermittently by the Iraqi army since the end of the Gulf war and with particular severity since March. Baghdad has intensified the conflict in the last few days by deploying ground attack aircraft against the Shias for the first time since the Gulf war. Four or five divisions - about 50,000 men  - are believed to be stationed around the perimeter of the marshlands used by Shia militia as sanctuary from tank attack. Until last week, attacks on the Shia had been confined to artillery bombardments and incursions by patrols. The use of Russian-built SU-25 'Frogfoot' ground attack fighters represents a significant escalation in President Saddam Hussein's suppression of the Shias and violates the terms of UN resolution 688, which calls on Iraq to end its repression of the Kurds and Shias. Their use also threatens to revive the brinkmanship between Iraq and the UN, which led last week to renewed threats of military action in response to Baghdad's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors into a ministry building. Iraq has probably had some success in rebuilding its early warning radar networks, a development which could complicate any small scale air attack by UN-backed forces because radar installations would have to be disabled first. In addition Iraq still has 300 combat aircraft, of which about 150 are flying, compared with 750-800 before the invasion of Kuwait two years ago. Other Iraqi forces seem to have been reconstituted to about 40 per cent of their levels two years ago. It has almost 2,000 tanks and a similar number of artillery pieces with 350,000 men under arms. More than half of the army's 28-30 divisions are dug in along the Kurdistan border and are in continual skirmishes with Kurdish forces. About one third are in southern Iraq attempting to exert control over the Iranian-backed Shia forces. The remaining 4-5 divisions, mostly the so-called elite Republican Guards, are stationed around Baghdad accompanied by the newly reconstituted Presidential Guard. The US, meanwhile, is sending a battery of Patriot air defence missiles to Bahrain this week as part of an effort to protect Gulf states from any Iraqi missile attack. Earlier this week it send a Patriot battery and missiles to Kuwait. A team of UN weapons inspectors said yesterday they had found no weapons-related materials after several hours of searching Iraq's Agriculture Ministry - from which a previous UN team had been barred. But Mr Achim Biermann, who led the UN team, said: 'There is room for deep concern that some major material may have been taken out.' A previous UN team suspected that documents related to Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programme were being hidden in the building. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission investigating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, left Baghdad for New York yesterday and said: 'We have not cleared out what remains in Iraq.' He said the commission planned a full range of further inspections over the next month.</p>

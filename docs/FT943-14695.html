			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UBS settles with Smith Union Bank of Switzerland has reached an out of court settlement with Mr Terry Smith, a leading investment analyst, bringing to an end a high-profile legal dispute which had become the focus of a City of London debate about analysts' freedom to write impartial company reports. The settlement, disclosed in high court documents, comes as a surprise, as UBS has for months been refusing to give in to Mr Smith's demand for Pounds 600,000 in legal costs and earnings due under his contract with the investment bank. Both sides yesterday refused to discuss the terms of the settlement. The two had been suing and countersuing each other over the publication in 1992 of Accounting for Growth, a book written by Mr Smith which attacked the accounting techniques used by many big UK companies. Mr Smith was sacked by UBS in October 1992. It said he had breached internal procedures for vetting the contents of the book. However, Mr Smith has insisted that he was dismissed in part because of complaints about the book from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, and Sir Colin Marshall, also a GrandMet director and chairman of British Airways. Both companies are UBS clients. Mr Smith, who yesterday refused to comment, sued UBS for breach of contract and unfair dismissal. UBS said: 'We are both satisfied that the interests of each party have been met.' Although UBS tried to persuade Mr Smith not to publish the book, it later sued him for breach of copyright, alleging that the book contained research carried out by other UBS analysts. Accounting for Growth is an expanded version of award-winning research published by UBS in January 1991, which highlighted accounting techniques used by UK companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets. Just before publication, newspaper articles highlighted Grand Met as the company which used more of these techniques than any other. Had the case come to trial, Mr Smith was seeking to cross-examine Sir Allen and Sir Colin. He now works for a small independent firm of stockbrokers, Collins Stewart.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ORANGE;  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES THAT GATES HAS KEY ROLE IN JAIL  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday ruled in favor of the city of Orange in its  lawsuit with the county over expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail, saying  that Sheriff Brad Gates is actually the lead administrator on the project  rather than the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Projections and studies done by the county about the impact of the jail  expansion on the surrounding area have been based on decision-making power  belonging to the supervisors. Under the judge's ruling, those studies would  also have to analyze how the sheriff's decisions about jail operations might  effect the area.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the county have already appealed the judge's decision, based on a  similar preliminary ruling he had made earlier.  </P> <P> County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said Friday, however, that if the judge's decision  is upheld, the county could be forced to redo its environmental impact report,  causing significant delays for the project.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, county officials and the city of Orange are still negotiating a  possible compromise for the jail expansion that could involve dismissal of the  suit.  </P> <P> The county is planning to expand the capacity of the branch jail, on The City  Drive in Orange, from 622 inmates to 1,326. The $45-million construction job  was scheduled to begin last spring and the first new structures were to open by  the end of the year.  </P> <P> The expansion is a major component of the county's effort to relieve severe  overcrowding in its jail system.  </P></p>

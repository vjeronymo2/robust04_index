			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Russia risks UN clash over Yugoslavia THE UN Security Council's post cold war unity appeared at risk last night over the issue of former Yugoslavia's continued membership in the general assembly. Under the rules, the 15-member council may recommend to the larger body the exclusion of a member state and the western powers have signalled their wish to follow that course in the Yugoslav case. But Russia is adamantly opposed to any move that would adversely affect the Belgrade government's UN rights - raising the possibility that a western resolution to this effect might be vetoed. This would be a rare event in the changed political climate in the security council. A new session of the general assembly, the 47th, opened yesterday and the credentials of what now is called 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)' could be challenged by a committee set up routinely to examine the credentials of all of the member states. It was a similar committee's recommendation that brought about the exclusion of South Africa from the general assembly in 1974. South Africa remains a UN member but cannot participate in most UN work. While the EC foreign ministers, meeting in London last weekend, agreed to try to block the Belgrade government's claim to be the automatic UN successor to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a founding member, several Moslem states also backed the effort. Russian objections are somewhat ironic given the fact that Moscow managed to retain its permanent security council seat last December following the Soviet break-up. Mr Yuli Vorontsov, then the Soviet ambassador and now the UN representative of the Russian Federation, was the council president at the time and was widely credited with diplomatic sleight of hand. Although a draft paper being circulated by Britain, France and Belgium, with US and Austrian support, would recommend that the general assembly deny Belgrade's claim to continue automatically former Yugoslavia's membership, and exclude its participation in the work of UN bodies, some western diplomats questioned last night whether the issue would be pressed to a vote.

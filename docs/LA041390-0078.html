			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUGH CURBS ON WATER USE URGED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> The San Diego County Water Authority voted unanimously Thursday to ask its 24  member agencies to enact mandatory water-reduction measures.  </P> <P> In an unprecedented effort to tighten the taps while facing a drought that has  parched the state, the authority's board of directors recommended prohibiting  residents from washing cars, watering lawns or filling swimming pools during  the daytime, restaurants from serving water to customers except when requested,  and homeowners from washing down sidewalks, driveways or tennis courts at any  time.  </P> <P> The authority's action is a recommendation to the 24 individual governments and  water boards in the county, which now must independently decide whether to  follow through with the restrictions that officials hope will achieve a 10%  savings in water use.  </P> <P> Authority officials said they believe most of the member agencies will adopt  the water-saving measures, which would be mandatory after the failure of a  voluntary program in 1987.  </P> <P> "I doubt any will go against (the recommendations)," said Byron M. Buck,  director of the authority's Water Resources Planning Division. "This shouldn't  have any lifestyle impact -- we're just asking people to cut wasteful use."  </P> <P> Before the San Diego panel voted, officials of the Metropolitan Water District  of Southern California, which supplies water to Los Angeles and Southern  California, urged the authority to adopt the tough measures.  </P> <P> "We don't have a secure water supply," said Carl Boronkay, MWD general manager.  "What is needed is a comprehensive statewide policy."  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District supplies water from Oxnard to the Mexican  border. Among the 130 cities in its region, only about 10 have adopted  ordinances similar to the San Diego proposal, MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski  said.  </P> <P> "We are hoping all cities will respond in a fashion similar to San Diego," he  said. "Virtually every city south of Sacramento should be adopting such  ordinances, if they haven't already."  </P> <P> The restrictions supported by San Diego's water authority resemble an ordinance  passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council. That ordinance also  prohibited hosing down hard surfaces such as driveways; serving water in  restaurants unless requested, and allowing irrigation water to run off into  gutters, Malinowski said.  </P> <P> But the San Diego proposal goes further than the Los Angeles ordinance in that  it restricts the watering of residential lawns, he said.  </P> <P> About 50 of California's 58 counties have instituted some kind of water  restrictions, said Dean Thompson, a spokesman with the Department of Water  Resources' Drought Center in Sacramento.  </P> <P> FINDING WATER: DWP fails to adequately plan L.A. water future, audit says.

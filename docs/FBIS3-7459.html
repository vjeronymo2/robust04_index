The iron-like will and tested leadership  ability of our party have been more vigorously demonstrated in  stern struggles recently.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Recently,  we have vigorously proven once again in the stern trials and  struggles that our party is the great party with an iron-like  will and tested leadership ability, that our people are the  heroic people with a firm revolutionary faith and indomitable  struggling spirit, and that socialism of our own style which  embodied the chuche idea is the invincible socialism deeply  rooted in the popular masses. The iron-like will and tested  leadership ability are a basic criterion for the working class  party leading the revolution. The working class party can  overcome any trials, and victoriously lead the people, and  consummate its historic cause to the end only if it cherishes  the iron-like will and tested leadership ability. Therefore, it  is very fortunate for the people to live under the leadership of  the great party with an invincible might.    Today, our party has widely demonstrated its might as a  great  party with iron-like will and tested leadership ability by  upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head.  Above all, the iron-like will and tested leadership ability of  our party are being clearly demonstrated in firmly leading our  people on the socialist road, thus constantly upholding the  revolutionary banner of the chuche idea.    The historic mission of the working class party lies in  building the socialist and communist society. The will and  leadership ability of the party can be vigorously demonstrated  in adhering to the socialist cause and in leading it to victory.  Furthermore, firmly adhering to the socialist cause and  victoriously carrying it out today are emerging as important  matters related to the destiny of mankind.    In recent years, socialism collapsed in some countries. With  this, imperialists and reactionaries are babbling about  socialism coming to an end. Also, they are more viciously  conducting antisocialist plots. However, our party is firmly  leading the socialist cause down the single road of chuche with  its iron-like will and tested leadership ability that will not  falter at any antisocialist plot. It is the invincible will of  our party to endlessly consummate the socialist cause by  upholding the banner of the chuche idea without the slightest  hesitation and backwardness in any difficult situation or trial.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works, such as  The Historic Lesson of Socialist Construction and the  General Line of Our Party, On the Fundamental  Question of Revolutionary Party Building, and Abuses  of Socialism Are Intolerable, have vigorously demonstrated  our party's determination on how it is firm in consummating the  socialist cause. Our party has learned lessons from the  collapse of socialism in some countries and is vigorously moving  forward by invoking wisdom and by showing courage of turning a  misfortune into a blessing, thus resolutely refuting the  reactionaries' plots against socialism.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has always made it a  rule to solve all problems in conformity with the aspiration of  the people and actual conditions of our country. The dear  comrade leader has developed and consummated the chuche  socialist idea and has enabled the popular masses to strongly  arm themselves with it to strengthen the main force of the  revolution. With its might, he has lead our country to be ever  victorious.    Even when the socialist betrayers threw away the socialist  principle and moved toward wholly accepting the capitalistic  political method and economic system, we firmly adhered to the  chuche-oriented position, thoroughly embodied the Taean work  system, and implemented the rural theses. This clearly proves  our party's revolutionary leadership.    Truly, our party's leadership is a fundamental source that  made it possible to further consolidate and develop socialism of  our own style. Our party's iron-like will and refined  leadership are also manifest in leading the revolution and  construction toward endless upsurges with far-reaching  aspirations and ideals and without the slightest stagnation or  stalemate.    The socialist cause is a long-term cause that accompanies a  serious social change and large scale construction work. This  cause can advance victoriously only when endless struggle is  launched through far-reaching aspirations and ideals. We are  leading the socialist construction toward the one road of rapid  progress without the slightest stagnation and stalemate by  always highly upholding the banner of continued revolution.  Here lies the resoluteness of the working-class party's will  and invincible leadership.    Our party is an experienced and ambitious revolutionary  party  endlessly advancing and struggling with the far-reaching  aspiration and ideal for the bright future of socialism and  communism. Our party's firm position is to continue revolution  to the end until imperialism is wiped out on this land and the  banner of socialism's victory flies high. Therefore, our party  is firmly adhering to and vigorously pushing ahead with the  three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--and  is resolutely adhering to the revolutionary principle and  socialist principle under whatever circumstance.    Because of our party's wise leadership which leads socialist  construction by unfolding an extraordinary high goal and far-  reaching blueprint and mobilizes the popular masses'  revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity to look ahead into the  distant future, unprecedented miracles and innovations are being  created in our country, and many great monumental creations that  elucidate the era of the Workers Party are being built.    Our party has the strong will and militant base that does  not  yield to difficult situations, does not boast of victory, and  which vigorously advances toward a new goal. Last year, on the  occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory of war, the  party Central Committee announced its slogans to call the whole  party, the whole country, and all the people, thus achieving a  great revolutionary upsurge and brilliantly decorating the 40th  anniversary of the victory of war as a great festival of  victors. Also, at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party  Central Committee, a revolutionary economic strategy organizing  and mobilizing the whole party, the whole country, and all the  people toward a new general march was presented. This is clear  manifestation of our party's iron-like will and refined  leadership.    Although our people were faced with great difficulties and  barriers due to the unexpected international events and the  acute situation created in the country, they consistently rose  to create mass heroism and collective innovation without the  slightest wavering and with revolutionary optimism and faith in  victory, because of our party's leadership.    Today, our people are overflowing with confidence that when  they move according to our party's leadership, there is nothing  in this world that cannot be achieved and no trial or difficulty  that cannot be resolutely overcome to occupy a high peak in  socialism.    Possessed with an iron-like will and refined leadership, our  party takes pride as a great party leading the socialist cause  toward the one road of being ever victorious. This wholly lies  in the fact that our party is highly upholding the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il. The dear comrade leader's iron faith and  peerless courage comprise our party's iron-like will and his  extraordinary ability and leadership capability comprise our  party's refined leadership.    The faith and will possessed by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il is an iron-like will which does not waver with any kind  of thunder and lightning and which does not shake even with the  attack of a myriad of powerful enemies. It is also a peerless  courage that achieves victory in revolution by turning  misfortune to good fortune and an adverse situation into a  favorable one.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shown  in  the great decisive step of taking the initiative to overcome  difficulties in revolution through dauntless operations; in the  extraordinary organizational capability of achieving the final  victory ahead of schedule by always thrusting oneself toward the  attack line; and in the revolutionary leadership art that  provides a new upsurge of revolutionary offensive by calling  forth at once the whole party, all the people, and the whole  country.    Because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise  leadership encompasses wisdom of keen insight, peerless courage,  and refined leadership, our party is highly manifesting to the  whole world, the dignity of a militant party which possesses  invincible, ever-victorious leadership, and our party is highly  manifesting to the whole world the dignity of a heroic people  possessed with revolutionary faith.    Our people will adhere to the socialist banner according to  the leadership of the great party and leader [suryong] to the  end, and will brilliantly build socialism of our own style  centered on the popular masses.</p>

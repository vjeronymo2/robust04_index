Delegations from the three countries, which in  March proposed sending observers under a so-called Temporary  International Presence in Hebron [TIPH], are continuing  preparations to send 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians in  the Israeli-occupied city where tensions have been escalating  ever since a Jewish settler opened fire on dozens of  Palestinians as they prayed in the Hebron mosque on February 25.    The diplomats told ANSA that the two high-ranking  Carabinieri  police officers and Rome Foreign Ministry officials who visited  Hebron on April 11 have been shuttling between the Palestinian  city, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with their counterparts from Norway  and Denmark in an effort to resolve a series of practical  problems, such as deciding where the observers will reside.    The TIPH members will be carrying only light weapons for  self-defense and hope to ease tensions between Israeli settlers  and the armed forces and local residents.    A memorandum officially getting the mission under way should  be signed in Copenhagen some time at the end of next week and  unless new obstacles are raised, deployment may begin as early  as the end of the month, the diplomats said.

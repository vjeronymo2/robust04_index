			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Banks become concerned over falling margins REMEMBER how lending to large companies was meant to be getting profitable again? After the paper-thin margins of the late 1980s, the capital shortage afflicting many parts of the banking industry was meant to have led to a rapid widening in loan margins. That is the theory. In reality, however, margins on large corporate loans are still far too low to bring banks a profit. And now, it seems, they could be heading down again. Concern about falling margins is troubling many banks active in London's loans market. The cause of their concern is simple: demand for bank credit remains sluggish, while the potential supply has begun to expand again as banks succeed in rebuilding their battered capital bases. Lending margins reached a plateau last autumn, having risen almost constantly over the previous 12 months. As a rough norm, banks are now lending money in the public syndicated loans market at a spread of  1/2 percentage point (50 basis points) over the London Interbank Offered Rate - though that margin widens substantially for companies whose credit standing has weakened during the recession, or where the lending is project-related or otherwise non-standard. At  1/2 -point, no banks are making money - though after tortuous internal arguments about cross-subsidisation, many can make an argument for staying in the loans business. The provision of a standby facility is a necessary part of the overall range of services provided to a customer, runs this argument: provided the overall relationship is profitable, there is no harm lending money at a loss. Most banks reckon they need a margin of between 1.2 and 1.4 per cent to break even on lending to large corporates. According to Mr Alan Moore, head of corporate banking at Lloyds Bank, a spread of 0.75 to 0.80 point is needed just to cover cost of the bank's capital needed to support its lending. Even that is after a fall in the bank's cost of capital recently, from around 18 per cent to perhaps 15 per cent, he said. Add in a margin to cover a bank's costs, the need to build a reserve against future bad loans and a retention to allow for future growth, and the overall cost of lending rises to well over 1 percentage point. The recovery in bank capital is one of the main reasons why margins could fall again. Over the last 10 days, the UK's four biggest banks have all reported an improvement in their capital ratios. For all four, the key tier-one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets improved during 1990, with all of them now at or above the psychologically important 5.5 per cent level. Also, some foreign banks in London are still reported to be willing to take loans at cut-price rates. 'The problem is, there are still too many banks around, and some of them are still looking for marginal income,' said Mr Moore. The demand for credit, meanwhile, is being held back in part by the slow pace of any economic recovery in the UK and US. Many banks in London were last autumn projecting a rise in loan demand this spring: the more prudent are now predicting demand will be slight until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, many of the four and five-year multiple option facilities (Mofs) negotiated at fine rates by UK companies in the 1980s mature over the next two years. As these are renegotiated at higher rates, banks can look for an improvement in the overall margins on their loan portfolios. However, the renegotiations are likely to have a perverse side-effect, if anything helping to push banks' margins down. With commitment fees (paid by companies on the undrawn part of facilities from banks) almost non-existent at the end of the 1980s, at one stage touching just five basis points, many companies took larger standby facilities than they needed, reasoning there was no harm in having a guaranteed supply of credit on hand. Now, though, commitment fees, like loan margins, have risen, and companies are shrinking their standby lines. The result: a substantial release of bank capital that had been tied up in standby facilities (banks have to set aside half the usual level of capital for undrawn facilities.) That may drive margins down. There is, in short, no sign of the recovery in bank margins continuing, unless economic conditions - and loan demand  - recover strongly, and soon.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Extradition move soon in charity case BRITISH police are planning to press for the extradition from Belgium of Mr Gamil Naguib, one of two men named in a High Court writ last month filed by the Salvation Army alleging fraud of more than Pounds 6m. The move came after details of Mr Naguib's whereabouts were passed to the Metropolitan and City of London police fraud squad by The Independent newspaper. Mr Naguib was found in Antwerp. He had been missing since the writ was issued on February 15. Formal extradition proceedings need to be processed through the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office. Details of Mr Naguib have been passed to Belgian and other European police forces through Interpol. Police are confident that a second man named in the writ, Mr Stuard Ford, will soon return to Britain voluntarily. It emerged yesterday that the Crown Prosecution Service has been given documents relating to discussions between individuals representing the Salvation Army and an organisation claiming to belong to the United Nations. It is understood discussions involved some of the individuals named in last month's writ. The discussions were made on behalf of the ACP Investment and Trade Bank, which has been disowned by the UN and was under investigation in the US. According to a bulletin from the US Controller of the Currency dated August 14 1992, ACP may have been operating a banking business in the US without authorisation. Dr Antoine Yameogo, ACP's executive co-ordinator, told the Financial Times that his bank had received a UN mandate to operate for humanitarian and development purposes in 1979 and in the early 1980s. UN officials said they had never heard of the bank. Colonel Grenville Burn, who was in charge of Salvation Army fundraising and involved in contacts between the charity and Mr Naguib and Mr Ford, yesterday refused to comment.</p>

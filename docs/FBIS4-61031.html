			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valentina Nikiforova report: "Nonsignatories"] </F>   [Text] Here is the official report -- of the 248  participants in the assembly, 245 signed the "Social Accord  Treaty." Those are impressive figures. It was not signed by G.  Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Federation Communist Party  Central Executive Committee, or by N. Vinogradov and A. Tuleyev,  chairmen of the oblast legislative assemblies of Vladimir and  Kemerovo Oblasts respectively.    That would seem to be minor opposition. But that depends.  If the leader of one of the largest political parties, which  won one-third of the seats in the Federal Assembly elections,  does not sign, then the organizers of the second edition of the  failed "political new year" should ponder on it. It is not as a  result of trivial disagreements that the Communist leader is  refusing to sign -- the party disagrees with the policy of the  president and the government and is calling for it to be  changed. For the sake of peace, harmony, and a dignified life.    The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin deputies' faction was among  the  refuseniks. Its leader rightly believes that agreement can only  be achieved on a specific issue.    The Agrarian Party of Russia had reasonable objections. The  court chroniclers have called them self-seeking. Perhaps  because the agrarians are sounding the alarm? Spring is in full  swing, and there are major difficulties with the sowing -- what  will be left in the silos this fall?...    So those who are not signing the red papers are people whose  view of Russia is not conditioned by the Kremlin.</p>

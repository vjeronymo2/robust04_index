He was speaking on  the final day of his Western Transvaal election trail, during  which he addressed a meeting at a Rustenburg Golf Club and a  rally at the Vryburg showgrounds.    Mr de Klerk called for support for the National Party [NP]  so  it could protect the vested interests of all South Africans,  including those of blacks. He did not believe opinion polls  which showed relatively poor support for the NP because the  surveys had been conducted in areas where intimidation ran rife.    The majority of coloureds, Indians, and whites, and a  significant proportion of blacks, supported the NP, he said.  "We can win. Winning means getting the biggest percentage of  the vote, not 50 per cent or more."    Mr de Klerk added, "I have no doubt that the whole world  wants the NP to do well because the investors of the world trust  our financial policies, they distrust the financial policies of  the African National Congress."    The future government's financial policy should be balanced  to accommodate the interests of both those who had much to lose  and those who needed to gain because they suffered. "Those who  have much to lose does not mean white South Africans," Mr de  Klerk said. All people with own businesses, houses, jobs and  pension funds had much to lose unless there was a system which  protected these vested interests, he said.</p>

Saburov told Interfax a few hours before his  departure that besides the Crimean capital he was planning to  visit other cities of the Republic of Crimea (which is part of  Ukraine).    To quote Saburov, his trip will last for 10 days. He is  planning to evaluate the current state of the Crimean economy  and legislation, and collect material necessary for drafting a  strategy for Crimea's economic development.    Saburov will be accompanied by a group of experts most of  whom come from Crimea.    Since his appointment to the post of Crimean prime minister,  they have been busy studying the Crimean economy.    The new premier refused to name members of the future  Crimean  Cabinet. "I don't think any decisions should be taken in haste.  We shall decide everything on the spot," he said.    No talks with the Ukrainian leaders figure in the program of  the trip. "Such talks are premature," said Saburov. He noted,  however, that if any of the Ukrainian leaders decided to hold  the talks they would take place immediately.</p>

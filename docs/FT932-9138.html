			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Hardline deputies quit in Belgrade MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, suffered a setback yesterday when ultra-nationalists walked out of a pan-Serbian parliamentary session convened to persuade Bosnian Serbs to back an international peace plan. The remaining parliamentary deputies voted to back the Vance-Owen peace plan following the walk-out by more than 100 deputies of the Serbian Radical party, until recently unofficial allies of Mr Milosevic. Rebel Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia sent only observers to the extraordinary session of the pan-Serb parliament. Mr Vojislav Seselj, the extremist leader of the Radicals, brushed aside the declaration adopted by the deputies from the Yugoslav, Serbian and Montenegrin parliaments. He described the declaration as invalid. The declaration criticised the Bosnian Serbs for ignoring the interests of the people of Serbia and Montenegro. It also criticised the referendum, to be held among Bosnian Serbs this weekend, on the grounds that people would not be able to vote freely in the war conditions. In the hastily organised referendum, Bosnian Serbs are likely to confirm rejection of the peace plan by the defiant leaders of their self-styled Serb state. Diplomats in Belgrade believe most people will vote against the Vance-Owen plan, which calls for the division of Bosnia into ten provinces along ethnic lines. In a second qustion, Bosnian Serbs are also expected to vote in favour of independence for their self-proclaimed Serb state, with the right to link up with 'other nations and states'. The referendum will take place in impoverished towns and villages, destroyed, heavily damaged or abandoned, in the self-proclaimed Srpska Republic, which covers about two-thirds of Bosnia. It includes the bulk of eastern Bosnia, which under the Vance-Owen plan has been designated a 'Moslem province', adhering to the mostly Moslem structure of the pre-war population. But Moslems will not be voting in the referendum: most were expelled or killed by Serb forces last spring when they seized control of eastern Bosnia. Besieged for 13 months, Gorazde is the only remaining Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia. Some 500,000 Bosnian Serbs who have sought refuge in Serbia in theory are supposed to vote, but it is unclear what arrangements have been made. The Belgrade government is unlikely to allow voting. The number of voters has not been determined. There were about 1.4m Serbs in Bosnia before the war. Voting lists are impossible to regulate. On Thursday night, Mr Petar Cancar, chief of the referendum commission, admitted he did not know the number of voters and that additional consultations were needed. The likely No vote on the peace plan will further deepen the split between Belgrade and Serb kinsmen in Bosnia. Under threat of military intervention and tough new sanctions by the international community, President Milosevic has told Serbs they have won the war and should accept the peace plan. But confronted by another failure to subdue his disobedient creations, Mr Milosevic is bound to tighten further the noose on 'Srpska Republika'. But reflecting the hardening of attitudes, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said: 'It is now quite obvious that we are not puppets of Milosevic.'</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection back in the black with Dollars 4.17m THE SUCCESSFUL completion of a three-month debt restructuring programme at Holmes Protection yesterday enabled the US security group to announce a sharp turnround in its year-end results. Pre-tax profits for 1992 totalled Dollars 4.17m (Pounds 3m) compared with losses of Dollars 35.5m. Turnover declined from Dollars 59m in 1991 to Dollars 56.2m. The company, quoted in the UK, blamed the downturn in turnover on orders cancelled before a new management team headed by Sir Ian MacGregor, former chairman of British Coal, had implemented a restructuring plan designed to wipe out debt held by seven North American institutions. The institutions, which were unsecured lenders, agreed to forgive a portion of the debt and accept a part cash and part debt-equity swap for the remainder. Yesterday's results included an exceptional gain of Dollars 1.88m (Dollars 30.7m) following the reversal of an acquisition reserve made in 1991. Earnings per share after adjusting for the share consolidation were 23 cents, against losses of Dollars 12.98. However the directors felt a figure of 10 cents, on the basis that the shares issued during the restructuring had been in issue throughout the year, was more meaningful. Although the company decided not to pay a dividend for the third year running, Sir Ian said it intended 'to resume the payment of a nominal amount of dividends during 1993'. He also predicted increased turnover in the year ahead following a slowdown in the cancellation rate in its main business of installing and servicing alarm systems.</p>

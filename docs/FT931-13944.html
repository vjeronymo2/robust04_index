			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Unita rebels seize Angolan oil town UNITA rebels have scored a notable victory in their war against Angolan government troops with the capture of the oil town of Soyo, which accounts for a third of Angola's production, Reuter reports from Luanda. An Angolan armed forces communique issued yesterday admitted that the government had lost the country's most important oil centre. 'After two days of heavy fighting between government forces and Unita, backed by Zairean forces and mercenaries, the government was forced to withdraw from the town of Soyo,' the communique said. Unita was reported to have set ablaze several oil wells as well as seizing 17 foreign oil workers after two days of fierce battles. Attempts were being made to open talks to win the release of the foreigners. The fall of Soyo is a serious blow to the government, which desperately needs cash from oil exports to fund its war against Unita. Oil earns some 90 per cent of Angola's foreign revenues and the north-western town of Soyo accounted for a third of the country's daily production of more than 500,000 barrels. Scores of foreigners, many of them Portuguese, were evacuated from the area by boat and helicopter. But Fina Petroleos de Angola said 17 expatriates, some from service companies, had been unable to get away in time. Unita's Voice of the Black Cockerel radio confirmed foreigners were in rebel hands and said heavy fighting was also taking place on the Huambo, Menongwe, Moxico, Saurimo and Malanje fronts. State media said Cabinda was tense and authorities feared Unita might be preparing an attack on the enclave sandwiched between Zaire and the Congo. Since disputing the results of September elections which it lost to the ruling MPLA, Unita has expelled local authorities from some 70 per cent of Angolan territory - including northern diamond areas - in violation of May 1991 peace accords.</p>

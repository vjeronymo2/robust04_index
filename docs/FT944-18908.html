			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Pachinko gamesters defy tax bait Japan's national police force has lost a campaign to tempt more operators of the country's pachinko game industry to accept the virtues of paying tax. The National Police Agency reports it is making little headway with its tactic of introducing tax-assessable pre-paid game cards, an attempt to persuade pachinko parlour owners to divulge earnings. The government's recent tax reform, partly intended to bolster the tax base, is therefore likely to leave untouched a rich source of revenue. Pachinko, an addiction for a quarter of Japan's population, is a recession-proof mixture of pinball and gambling. It has an estimated annual turnover of Y17,500bn (Pounds 113.6bn). Players buy handfuls of ball-bearings, fed into pinball machines and spat out again in greater or lesser amounts, regulated by computer. Metal balls are exchanged for prizes or sold for cash, contrary to a Japanese law against gambling for money. The balls are sold at neighbouring shops, whose ownership is tied to the pachinko parlours. The parlours are often owned by North Korean immigrants, who send a popularly estimated Y60bn-Y80bn a year back to relatives in Pyongyang. Failure to crack the problem has not only cost the government tax revenue, it has also caused diplomatic embarrassment over this unintended subsidy to an unfriendly regime. Japan's police force chose a tactful line. Taking a heavy hand to pachinko would have invited the anger of the gangsters who protect this and other fringe industries. As has been shown in recent weeks some of these gangsters have alarmingly light trigger fingers. At the turn of the decade the police agency informally promoted the development of two producers of pre-paid pachinko cards and vending machines, Nihon Leisure Card and and Nihon Game Card, both chaired by former police officers. The aim was to enable tax authorities to guess individual pachinko operators' sales and income by the number of pre-paid cards they purchased, according to a report in the latest issue of the weekly magazine, Aera. Since starting business in 1990, the two groups have installed systems in just over 3,000 out of Japan's 18,000 pachinko parlours, making a tidy profit. Police gave new pachinko owners operating licenses in half the usual time, in return for a promise to install a card system, according to Aera. Existing operators, showing deference to the police, bought systems in the interests of 'modernisation'. The hitch was that parlours continued to sell balls for cash, alongside pre-paid cards. In despair, the police agency asked the finance ministry to offer tax reductions to pachinko parlours that were prepared to come clean and use pre-paid cards exclusively. The ministry, which has never shared the national fondness for a flutter in the pachinko arcade, refused. It goes to show that removing some of the constraints on the Japanese economy can be longer and trickier than it might at first appear.</p>

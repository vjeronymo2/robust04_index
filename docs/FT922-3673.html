			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Danzas declines 19% but expects early recovery DANZAS, the transport services group, said its group pre-tax profit tumbled 19 per cent last year to SFr46m (Dollars 31.7m), because of squeezed margins in France and organisational problems in Basle and in Austria. Mr Bernd Mensinger, chairman, forecast a recovery this year, but warned that next year's profits would be hurt by the elimination of customs procedures between European Community countries. As usual, Danzas revealed a curious mixture of group and parent company figures. Consolidated group revenues in 1991 rose 13.9 per cent to SFr10.2bn. Other group figures merely represented compilations, not a true consolidation, Mr Peter Wagner, finance director, said. Full consolidated figures would be published for 1993 results, he said. The parent company, which covers operations in Switzerland, parts of France and almost all of Italy, had net income of SFr14.3m in 1991, up 6 per cent. Sales rose 11.8 per cent to SFr3.8bn. Mr Mensinger said Danzas would decide early next year on whether to simplify the terms covering shareholdings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Endre Aczel editorial: "Passing on Responsibility"] </F>   [Text] If we strip certain issues to the bare facts, we  will find that the United States of America has actually  threatened Hungary lest it become closer to the rump Yugoslavia.    The threat was contained in U.S. Foreign Affairs Spokesman  McCurry's statement according to which the United States "views  all actions that might ease Serbia's isolation with deepest  concern."    Before saying this, McCurry listed "plans" to broaden  communication between Budapest and Belgrade. Plans that are  known to Washington and condemned by it.    We know that it is not usually inconsequential when a very  large country says to a very small country that it is "deeply  concerned" about what the latter is doing or is preparing to do.  The lightest of such consequences is a reprimand. Foreign  Minister Jeszenszky (or the Hungarian Government) has received  this. In nearly four years, it has not had such a conflict with  any western power, so this in itself indicates the gravity of  the event.    However, after all this introduction, what I have to say is  that the Government of the United States is acting unjustly when  it calls the renewed Hungarian-Serbian dialogue a source of  danger that might "undermine" the UN embargo policy afflicting  Yugoslavia. Washington's strictness with us is nothing other  than camouflage of its own (many times proved) lack of a  concept, a kind of searching for responsibility elsewhere.    So, who is actually "undermining" the embargo policy here?    Hungary, which is heroically adhering to the embargo policy  that is far too costly for it, was only an observer, rather than  a participant, in the German-French efforts that actually held  out the possibility of ending the sanctions, providing that the  Serbs fulfill certain conditions. However, without expressing  its opinion, the United States itself was also an observer. (At  that time, Clinton was very much occupied with NAFTA [North  American Free Trade Agreement], APEC [Asia Pacific Economic  Community], and GATT....) Therefore, the end of the sanctions  policy did not even originate in Hungary. This makes it even  more interesting that, at the time, Washington did not reprimand  Paris and Bonn, and why it did not later reprimand the Bosnian  Muslims who swept the entire promising German-French plan  (including the already implemented Serbian and Croatian  allowances) off the table, and this is how the sanctions policy  remained in force.    Well, ever since, we have not seen any viable ideas from  Clinton and his team as to what should really be done. (We now  know what we should not do. As if the outcome of the south Slav  crisis depended on Hungarian-Serbian customs and border  cooperation....) What is even worse, America proved to be  completely unable to form or coordinate the West's and NATO's  Bosnia policy. This whole issue is a tale of the appearance and  widening of gaps between the U.S., French, British, and German  viewpoints. Seemingly, the Americans have always been more  radical than the Europeans but, in reality, they would not for  anything have moved away from the periphery of events. Whatever  happens now, the American role would not become better in  retrospect.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Hope in Angola Angola's ceasefire calls to mind the axiom that second marriages are a triumph of hope over experience. But this shotgun marriage could succeed. Much has changed since 1991, when President Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, agreed a ceasefire, only for it to collapse the following year. For the first time in three decades, southern Africa is within reach of a comprehensive peace, built on democratic governance, market economics and the aim of co-operative regional development. Blame for the collapse of the last peace pact, which followed Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept defeat in the 1992 elections, rests primarily on his shoulders. But the collapse might have been averted had the settlement provided explicitly for a government of national unity, and had the United Nations received more support for its role in monitoring the disengagement and subsequent creation of an integrated army. Instead, it was inadequately resourced. Both issues have been addressed at the Lusaka ceasefire talks. Unita has an assured role in government, and the UN force will number 6,000-7,000 - 10 times the size of the 1991-92 contingent. Among the most heartening elements has been the part played by African leaders, particularly of the 'front-line' states. Once preoccupied with the battle against white minority rule, the group is seeking to act as a facilitator of democracy and promoter of regional economic co-operation. Mediation in Lesotho and Mozambique, where it helped persuade Mr Afonso Dhlakama to end his election boycott, has already brought results. If the frontline states can maintain pressure on Unita and urge restraint on the MPLA, the settlement may yet succeed. At the same time, the world's leading powers must help fund and man the UN initiative. They should also be prepared to help Angola's economic recovery. The country has lost more than lives since this futile conflict resumed. Since then, South Africa has not only captured the world's attention but probably drained much of the world's aid purse. Had Angola been able to appeal for international assistance in 1992, it would probably have received a better response than is likely today. Fortunately, the country has substantial resources. At least half the oil export earnings went towards the government's war effort, while the diamond fields helped sustain Mr Savimbi. Oil production, currently more than 500,000 barrels per day, could exceed 700,000 barrels before the end of the decade. Given peace and good management, the country can also develop its hydro-electric potential and exploit its agricultural and marine resources Nevertheless, Angola needs help. Generous international assistance is more than a worthy humanitarian cause. It would also relaunch a region whose success is central to recovery in Africa as a whole.</p>

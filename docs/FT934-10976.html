			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Flat-owner plan fails to attract funds THE GOVERNMENT is having difficulty attracting private-sector finance to set up an advisory service for flat-owners who want to buy a share of the freehold of their building. Sir George Young, the housing minister, said in July that the government would be prepared to fund up to 50 per cent of the cost of the service through the special grants programme but the remainder would have to come from the private sector. By the time the changes to leasehold law came into force on Monday there was still a significant shortfall in the contributions. In response to a parliamentary question Sir George admitted that although a formal bid to run the agency had been received in early October, the initial contributions from private-sector bodies had been very disappointing. He said he had written to a number of the institutions again - many of which would expect to be closely involved in the enfranchisement procedures - seeking further financial support for the advisory service. The Department of Environment said yesterday that it had not yet had any response from the banks and building societies to Sir George's letter, but the government still hoped to have the advisory service running by the end of the year. The reforms, which give owners of long leaseholds of flats the right to club together and buy the freehold of their building and the individual right to extend their leases by 90 years at market price, are said to be complex and confusing. Without freely available advice and assistance, lawyers and property specialists predict that the take-up of the rights of collective leasehold enfranchisement will be low.</p>

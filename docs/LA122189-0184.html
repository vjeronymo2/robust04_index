			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MEETING SLATED ON HANDICAP HOUSING  </P> <P> The chief lawyer for the state Department of Developmental Services said  Wednesday that the agency plans to meet in early January with an Orange County  group that has complained about the lack of housing for the handicapped in the  county.  </P> <P> "We don't believe their allegation that we're failing to meet our legal  obligations," said Joseph O. Egan, chief counsel for the department, in a  telephone interview from Sacramento. "But we want to meet with them to discuss  some of the issues they are raising."  </P> <P> Egan was referring to a Dec. 13 letter by the Tustin-based citizens group that  oversees governmental aid to the handicapped. That watchdog group, whose formal  title is Area XI Developmental Disabilities Board, accused the state of acting  illegally by not providing enough money for housing handicapped adults and  children in Orange County.  </P> <P> The letter also formally charged the department with being "out of compliance"  with state law -- a charge that automatically requires the department to make  an internal review. The Orange County group, under state law, has the power to  review the government's performance in providing aid to the handicapped.  </P> <P> Egan said Wednesday that the department now has received and reviewed the  letter from the watchdog group. He said that while the department rejects the  group's charges of not obeying state law, "we think we can work with them and  clear up some of their problems." BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

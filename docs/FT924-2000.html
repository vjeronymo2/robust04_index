			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkey to shift part of short term borrowing THE TURKISH Treasury plans to shift part of its borrowing from the short term to one-year borrowing in 1994 in order to balance its cash-flow movements more effectively, Reuter reports from Istanbul. '1993 will be a transition year. We will issue a set amount of one-year bonds in January and we will auction these in diminishing maturities throughout the year,' said a senior Treasury official. The Treasury now issues one-year bonds occasionally during the year. It auctions one-year, nine-month, six-month and three-month issues in turn every week but it does not set in advance the amount it borrows in each auction.</p>

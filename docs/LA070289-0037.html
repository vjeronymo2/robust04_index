			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEMP'S VISIT TO JORDAN DOWNS  </P> <P> A recent editorial ("Really Show the Man Around," May 31) in your newspaper  indicated that I should take note of the problems and opportunities in the  Jordan Downs housing development and their implications for broader housing  policy reforms. I have spoken with Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and other  outspoken advocates of public housing tenants in Los Angeles, and I share their  concerns and intend to promote broadened tenant involvement, resident  management and homeownership opportunities for the residents of Jordan Downs  and other housing developments throughout the country.  </P> <P> Resident management and homesteading opportunities begin with tenant  empowerment, and a commitment to a long-term process of training and community  organization. I have directed every field office in the country, including Los  Angeles, as well as HUD headquarters staff in Washington, D.C., to designate  resident initiatives coordinators to work with public housing resident entities  and housing authorities to lend the requisite technical support in this process  of neighborhood empowerment. I have also announced a $2.5 million training  grant process to provide direct funding to newly forming resident management  entities.  </P> <P> The residents of Jordan Downs and their political supporters in Los Angeles  succeeded in halting a proposed disposition of the project last year. New  policies being promulgated at the Department of Housing and Urban Development  will provide a greater role for tenant organizations in determining their own  destiny. Resident management and homeownership opportunities provide a clear  alternative to unwarranted demolition and disposition activities and a  guaranteed equity stake for the residents of public housing.  </P> <P> JACK KEMP  </P> <P> HUD Secretary  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vadim Gorshenin: "PRAVDA Prepared To Join </F> Strike"]    [Text] After the destruction of the Supreme Soviet and the  abolition of the Security Ministry it is the press' turn to face  heavy shelling. If the Chernomyrdin government decree is  fulfilled prices for newspapers will increase substantially.  Yesterday your PRAVDA correspondent got in touch with Ivan  Laptev, president of the association of chief editors and  publishers.    "I should like to draw the attention of PRAVDA employees and  readers," Ivan Dmitriyevich stated. "It is not a case of  dependent or independent publications -- it was a case of the  economic stifling of the entire press. And unless the president  and government repeal decree no. 1233, then soon we shall have  only memories of the press. Incidentally, I should like to note  that the decision which has been taken discredits the new  Constitution, especially article 29."    For our readers' information. PRAVDA, like many other  Russian newspapers, states its readiness also to suspend the  production of its publication from 10 through 17 January in  protest against one more government pogrom.</p>

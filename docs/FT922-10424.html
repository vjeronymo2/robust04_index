			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Hong Kong airport body to seek loan THE Hong Kong authority responsible for building and operating the colony's new airport has been given provisional authority to borrow HKDollars 23.3bn (Pounds 1.67bn) to finance the construction of the airport, though it will take months before it is ready to approach the world's capital markets, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Mrs Anson Chan, a senior Hong Kong official, said the Provisional Airport Authority's (PAA) capital funding requirement - including interest payments and fees associated with the borrowings - was HKDollars 38.2bn, in March 1991 prices. The PAA's finance director said the authority would be seeking the longest-term financing that was available from the market.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading "Panorama": "Armed </F> Forces of Armenia Fired on CSCE Mission"]    [Text] On 28 April a delegation of the CSCE [Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe] Minsk Group was fired on by  the Armenian armed forces in Azerbaijan's Terterskiy Rayon. The  KHABAR-SERVICE agency learned about this from the UN government  [as published] in Azerbaijan. By a stroke of luck there were no  casualties among the members of the delegation. As Minister of  Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov told a correspondent  of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency, this happened despite the fact  that while visiting Yerevan the leader of the delegation, Mr.  Mathias Mosberg, a deputy of the Minsk Conference [as  published], informed the leadership of Armenia about a  forthcoming visit of the mission he heads to Azerbaijan's  Terterskiy Rayon, which is located in the immediate proximity of  the front line. It should be stressed that the delegation was in  the region on a peace-making mission, and the belligerent  parties had been informed about the future route to be traveled  by foreign diplomats several days in advance of their arrival.  After firing on the motorcade of Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador  at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, this  winter, the armed forces of Armenia have in this manner now  expressed their attitude toward the peacemaking efforts of  intermediaries for the second time.</p>

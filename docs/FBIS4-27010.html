			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "CPPCC Urges Better Rural Production"] </F>   [Text] China's top advisory body yesterday called on its  members to play an active role in the campaign to lift  agricultural development.    All sectors must boost farming because it has a direct  impact  on the people's lives and social stability, said Li Ruihuan,  Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC).    He told the opening session of the seventh meeting of the  CPPCC Standing Committee that the Party and the State Council  want solid agricultural growth this year.    "As the country's top advisory body, the CPPCC should pay  close attention to the development of agriculture and offer good  suggestions to solving problems in this sector," said Li.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is now in charge of  China's agriculture, yesterday reported that the rural economy  is generally good -- there have been several successful  harvests, the economy has made consistent and comprehensive  achievements, and the living standards of farmers have also been  improved.    However, he warned that some problems still haunt the  agriculture sector, which cannot be ignored if the nation is to  continue economic development and to readjust the economic  system.    The problems include the imbalance in supply and demand of  grain, uneven agricultural production among areas, gaps between  cotton supply and demand, slow increases of farmers' income,  rural unemployment, and disappearing cultivated land.    Farming has also been hindered by shortages of scientists  and  technicians, the decline of agriculture production in the  coastal areas, and price hikes of farm production materials.    Chen said the government will push for more high yield,  quality, and efficient agriculture.    Meanwhile, the government will give a specialized loan of 10  billion yuan ($1.15 billion) to support the development of rural  enterprises, boosting the agricultural modernization drive.    "Cooperation between rural enterprises in eastern and  western  areas must be expanded," he added.    The CPPCC has organized three inspection teams for three  grain-producing provinces, including Anhui, Henan, and Shanxi,  to investigate the agriculture situation there.    More than 200 CPPCC Standing Committee members will spend  the  five-day meeting in Beijing voicing their suggestions and  opinions on the country's agriculture development.</p>

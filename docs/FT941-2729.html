			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Modest economic recovery forecast A sharp rise in investment will offset a slowdown in consumer spending caused by April's tax rises, leading the UK economy to a modest but sustainable recovery, says a forecast from the Society of Business Economists. The society, representing private-sector financial analysts, says in its latest assessment that investment will grow 2.3 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent next. Manufacturing investment will rise 8.0 per cent next year. Mr David Kern, chairman of the society's forecasting group, said it 'expects the tax increases coming into effect in April to dampen disposable income quite sharply, but the slowdown in consumer spending will be only modest, mainly because of a decline in the savings ratio'. Gross domestic product is predicted to grow 2.5 per cent this year, rising slightly to 2.6 per cent next year, supported by an improvement in stockbuilding and net exports. Mr Kern said: 'Inflationary pressures will remain subdued over the next few months, but there will be a gradual pick-up towards the end of 1994 and through 1995, reflecting a gradual tightening in labour market conditions, as further falls in unemployment cause a slow upturn in labour costs.' Underlying inflation is forecast to be 2.6 per cent this year and 3.7 per cent next. A survey from Birmingham Midshires Building Society shows that consumers are postponing purchases until they are certain how the tax rises will will affect them. Its consumer confidence index reached a high in October last year but has fallen sharply.</p>

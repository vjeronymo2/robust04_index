			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Academy of  Sciences (CAS), the largest national research institution in  China, today offered 144 new technological advances on the  market.    The new achievements, involving machinery and electronics,  chemical industry, energy, agriculture, new materials, bio-  engineering and other industries, represent China's latest  progress in these fields.    CAS vice-president Wang Fusong said today that the  technologies are chosen from among those developed by its 123  research institutes nationwide.    The offer is part of CAS's efforts to make better use of  technological achievements and provide new technologies for  enterprises.    In order to meet the country's increasing demand for  technology, CAS changed its research strategy in 1992 by  concentrating a considerable number of its scientists on applied  technological research and application or commercialization of  their technological achievements.    The vice-president said that during the past two years,  about  500 enterprises have been set up by CAS, utilizing their  research achievements and establishing technological cooperation  with about 3,000 other enterprises over the country, which has  produced huge economic benefits.    "All 144 achievements have been compiled in one CAS  reference  guide, and in the future CAS will regularly publish such a book  containing its technological achievements, which will serve as a  bridge for technological transfer between the research  institutes and enterprises," said Wang.</p>

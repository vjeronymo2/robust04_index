			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to drop Ecu bond futures THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is to abandon its Ecu bond futures contract. Trade in the contract has dried up because of uncertainty over the prospects for European economic and monetary union, and competition from the Paris-based Matif exchange. The Matif's Ecu bond future has an average daily volume of 2,644 contracts. However, in June - the month when the European bond markets were in turmoil following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union - the average daily volume rose to 10,114 contracts, according to the Matif. By contrast, Liffe said its Ecu bond contract, launched in March 1991, has not traded at all since June 2.</p>

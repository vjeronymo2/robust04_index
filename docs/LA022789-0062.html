			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOINT VENTURES SCRAPPED IN BID TO GAIN MORE CONTROL;  </P> <P> FOREIGN FIRMS DECIDE TO GO IT ALONE IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Foreign companies are casting off the security of joint ventures in Japan and  stepping out on their own to take advantage of booming consumer demand,  marketing consultants say.  </P> <P> U.S. fast-food chain operator Wendy's International and West German car maker  Volkswagen AG are among companies that are trying to boost sales by taking  greater control of their own marketing efforts here.  </P> <P> "The issue is gaining control," said William Best, manager here of consultants  A. T. Kearney International. "They see the booming consumer market while their  own sales languish."  </P> <P> Some frustrated foreign companies are boosting their stakes in their ventures  with Japanese partners to a majority interest while others are gearing up to go  it alone.  </P> <P> "Frankly, a joint venture is a lousy arrangement from a strategic point of  view, because it only serves to minimize risk," said James Abegglen, president  of consultants Asia Advisory Service.  </P> <P> "Always try first to do it on your own, and fall back to joint arrangements  only when you have to."  </P> <P> Best found in a study of 2,000 companies with foreign capital here that 3% to  5% of the foreign investors had recently upped their stakes. By the end of next  year that could reach 15%.  </P> <P> In the past, foreign firms readily set up joint ventures to penetrate Japan's  multilayered market, often signing away exclusive distribution rights to  trading companies or to distributors in the same or a complementary business.  </P> <P> But they have had trouble getting the Japanese partner to sell their brands  aggressively, marketing consultants said.  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak subsidiary Eastman Kodak (Japan) Ltd., for example, formed  ventures with two former distributors and one customer for hands-on control in  the Japanese market, an Eastman Kodak Japan spokesman said. By last August it  had secured a majority interest in all three ventures.  </P> <P> "We think about what's going to happen 50 years from now," said spokesman  Toshio Nakano. "Trading companies have slightly different objectives than  manufacturers."  </P> <P> Abegglen said a hookup may be necessary to help companies with staffing and  distribution -- the biggest headaches foreigners face -- until the company  outgrows the need.  </P> <P> U.S. chemical company Du Pont, which has nine joint ventures here, could  develop by relying on its partners, an official said. But the policy now is to  concentrate new investment on its wholly owned subsidiary.  </P> <P> "We've built up enough of an infrastructure that now we have the luxury of  choosing whether to put technology into our own operations or into a venture,"  said Thomas Jordan, head of planning for the subsidiary Du Pont Japan Ltd.  </P> <P> "Why automatically share the profit and rewards if you have the option of  keeping them in your own subsidiary?" he asked, stressing that Du Pont would  consider additional joint ventures to obtain a specific skill or technology.  </P> <P> Some foreign companies say a controlling interest is not enough.  </P> <P> They aim to run the show by setting up a subsidiary independent of any  exclusive licensing agreement. This would result in the subsidiary temporarily  competing against its parent's joint venture.  </P> <P> It may be awkward, but some have decided it is worth it.  </P> <P> Swiss confectioner Jacobs Suchard opened a Tokyo subsidiary last month to  create its own sales network. Toblerone and other Suchard brands have been  imported and sold by Japanese confectioner Meiji Seika since 1971 but only in  selected department stores and supermarkets.  </P> <P> "We aim to widen our market and put our candy bars in the neighborhood shops,"  a Suchard subsidiary spokesman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Direct Network  </P> <P> Suchard may also renew the contract with Meiji.  </P> <P> Wendy's also expects to increase sales by creating a direct network. It has 27  stores now under an exclusive franchising contract with supermarket giant Daiei  via a joint venture.  </P> <P> A Wendy's official said the company expects to open 15 stores within five years  and will target the suburbs to avoid competing directly with the venture, which  has aimed for urban areas. "We don't want to interrupt their operations," he  said.  </P> <P> Volkswagen is also preparing for twin billing. The German car firm is  negotiating with trading company Yanase, its sole importer and dealer in Japan,  to allow Volkswagen to set up its own distribution network.  </P> <P> The firm expects an agreement this month with Yanase, which will continue to  import and sell Volkswagens, said Robert Janson, Volkswagen Asia Ltd executive  vice president.  </P> <P> Businessmen warn that the market here is still a labyrinth of personal contacts  that can obstruct the newcomer. Kodak got around that by hiring staff from its  former distributor.  </P> <P> "Japanese business is still Japanese business and relationships are still very  valuable," Best said.  </P></p>

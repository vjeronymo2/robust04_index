Missing the mid-1997 opening date by a year would wipe out  the savings and add $8.2 billion to the overall bill.    A recently completed internal study by the Finance Branch  concluded that a one-year delay would cost Hong Kong $3 billion  in possible benefits, such as revenues from tourism.    But a two-year delay would cost the territory $9 billion,  and  $18 billion would be lost after three years.    Lower prices for civil engineering works worldwide are  understood to be a key factor in pushing down the cost of the 10  core projects, especially the seven government-funded schemes,  which are well under way.    It is now certain that the airport railway to be built by  the  Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) cannot be completed by  mid- 1997 as scheduled.    There is still a chance, however, that Chek Lap Kok airport  could open on time.    Officials are said to be anxious to reach an agreement with  China on the airport financing scheme so as to take advantage of  the lower construction prices.    The study found that the costs of building the airport and  its rail link would rise by $2 billion and $2.1 billion  respectively if the completion date was deferred by six months,  and double that if delayed for a year.    As funds are running out for the Provisional Airport  Authority (PAA), Treasury officials will today inform the  Legislative Council about the Government's updated study of the  airport core plan and seek their advice on the way forward.    Sources said two options would be presented.    The "pause option" envisages only enough extra funds to  cover  the expenses required by the PAA to finish the works under way  at present.    The other option will be a more forward-looking alternative,  seeking councillors' approval for awarding enough funds to cover  not only the PAA's running costs, but also to foot the bill for  three urgent construction-related contracts.    The three contracts include the design contract for the new  airport's baggage handling and automatic people mover systems,  which costs $120 million.    Tenders for the design contract would have to be awarded by  the end of this month to keep in line with the original 1997  opening date.    Another urgent contract is the $719 million foundation works  for the airport passenger terminal, and the third contract,  costing $455 million, is the construction of support facilities  at Chek Lap Kok, such as submarine water pipelines, sewage  plants, a power substation and a temporary ferry pier for  shipping construction materials and workers.    Sources said that to ensure the airport was completed on  time, the contracts for foundation work and the supporting  facilities had to be awarded by the end of March.    Together with the $400 million running costs for the PAA for  the 1994-95 financial year and the extension of Bechtel's  consultancy for one year, the second option envisages the  Government seeking close to $2 billion from the Legislative  Council.    The amount would still keep the overall capital injection  into the airport project within the $16.6 billion ceiling set in  the original financing package presented to the Chinese side two  years ago.    So far, the Government has pumped a total of $14.6 billion  into the airport body.    Of the two options presented to legislators today, the  Government sees the "pause option" as disruptive and  undesirable, as it would send the wrong signal to PAA staff that  the Government was paving the way for the office to close down.    Officials are concerned that the "pause option" would lead  to  an exodus of staff, making it extremely difficult to  re-establish the PAA office.    The Government would prefer to keep the momentum going,  especially in view of lower tender prices, down by about 10  percent to 25 percent, on the civil engineering side.    In the Government's updated study on the overall costs of  the  10 airport core projects, which still assumes the new airport's  opening date in 1997, the total bill for constructing the seven  government- funded projects has gone down by $7.6 billion, from  the original $60.1 billion, to $52.5 billion.    Costs for building the airport are estimated to go up  slightly by $1.6 billion, from the original $63.6 billion to  $65.2 billion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The auto industry of  north China's Tianjin Municipality, centering on the production  of Xiali sedan cars introduced from Japan, has burgeoned rapidly.    Tianjin first imported production technology and equipment  from the Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., of Japan in 1986 to produce a  type of midget car named Xiali.    During the past eight years, growing market demand and  unceasing expansion of its production scale has made the auto  industry Tianjin's number one profit-earner.    Some 50,000 Xiali sedans rolled off the production line in  1993 alone, with output value and profits both holding first  place among all of the city's industrial sectors.    The flourishing of the auto industry has also stimulated  development of many related local economic sectors.    At present, Tianjin lays claim to the title of the country's  second largest sedan producer after Shanghai, which produces  Volkswagen Santanas in cooperation with Germany.    Since 1990, Xiali sedan cars have been in great demand on  the  domestic market due mainly to the rapid development of China's  taxi service, according to the manager of the Tianjin auto  marketing company.    With the advantage of low prices and low operating costs,  Xiali sedans account for the majority of cars in taxi service.    Half of the 100,000 Xiali cars already sold have been put  into taxi service all over the country, and many have been  bought directly by individual taxi drivers, the manager said.    Tianjin Municipality has stressed further input to develop  its Xiali auto industry. Innovation and extension projects are  under way.    By the year 1995, annual output will be increased to 150,000  and the usage rate of domestically-made spare parts will reach  85 percent.</p>

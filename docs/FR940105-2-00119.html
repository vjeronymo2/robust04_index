			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission. The specific maps under consideration are the 1991 existing Noise Exposure Map and the 1996 future Noise Exposure Map. The FAA has determined that these maps for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport are in compliance with the applicable requirements. This determination is effective on December 10, 1993. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detail overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator who submitted those maps, or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport, also effective on December 10, 1993. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, &sect;150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., room 617, Washington, DC 20591 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration, Minneapolis Airports District Office, room 102, 6020&hyph;28th Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55450 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission, Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport, 6040&hyph;28th Street South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55450 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 10, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Franklin D.

The  instrument's construction and characteristics are described, and  test results including typical spectra are given. The system is  based on a Brueker 113V FTIR spectrometer, with an operating  spectral range of 10-10,000 cm[.sup]-1[/] and a maximum  resolution of 0.03 cm[.sup]-1[/]. The liquid-helium  Dewar/superconducting magnet system is an Oxford S11/12L-40-13,  with a magnetic-cavity effective diameter of 40mm and a maximum  field strength of 12 T. The five-reflector imaging system is  independently developed. Overall system transmission efficiency  is 0.37 (37 percent).    Figure 1, reproduced below, is a schematic diagram of the  entire system, while Figures 2 and 3, not reproduced, show  measured spectra for a test of the optical transmission system  and photothermal ionization spectra (resolution = 0.15  cm[.sup]-1[/]) of ultra-pure silicon under various magnetic  fields. There are no tables.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-27B>           Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of the FTIR Magneto-Optical Spectrometer </FIG>   References    1. McCombe, B. D., and Wagner, R.

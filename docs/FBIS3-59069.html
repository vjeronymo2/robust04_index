			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Guido Passalacqua in Milan on 24 January: "`I May Not Sign the  Pact'"]    [Text] Milan -- Seated behind the walnut desk in his new  office, which has been painted dazzlingly white, with the League  flag behind him, Umberto Bossi fidgeted with the fax reporting  the agreement with Segni. It was 1900 hours and it was clear,  as he admitted himself, that he still lacked all the information  ("I am waiting to hear from [League's lower house floor leader]  Maroni," he said.) But already he was banging his fist on the  desk: "I will not sign this document, and if I do not sign it  the League will not sign it, unless it adds that the next  legislature will be a constituent one." Then late in the  evening Maroni telephoned to clarify matters and to inform him  that the demand had been accepted and that a sentence had been  included in the document to state that the next will be a  "constituent legislature."    But apart from this clarification, it was apparent that  Bossi  is thinking about the repercussions within the movement, the  many people who disagree with the negotiations and are unwilling  to accept too much mediation, the hard-line League members who  refuse to yield constituencies to unknown fellow travelers.  First and foremost among these is Senator Miglio, who  immediately dismissed the document: "The framework is national  unity, which nobody is challenging; it seemed to me merely an  electoral accord. It will be difficult to keep together  everything and its opposite." Bossi was less skeptical....    [Passalacqua] What is your assessment of the document?    [Bossi] Mine is a positive assessment, but....    [Passalacqua] But what?    [Bossi] It confirms that there could be a shift toward  something pseudo-federalist, that all the League's years of  struggle in this field are having some impact. The document  represents an understanding, a declaration that [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni accepts a minor, superficial form of federalism.    [Passalacqua] Is that not enough for you?    [Bossi] It is not to be assumed that this document will  guarantee the transition to the Second Republic. Only an  overwhelming victory by the League in the North will guarantee  the Second Republic. Only then will the situation inevitably  change in a federalist direction. The League is not  relinquishing political federalism.    [Passalacqua] But what about its policy of alliances?    [Bossi] We have the problem of whether to make a gesture of  goodwill. For one thing, by joining a coalition the League is  becoming a national political force. If we were to go it alone  we would win everything in four or five regions North of the Po.  But then we might be marginalized. If we become a national  force, then the reform of the state will become a task for the  entire country, including southern Italy. But this is a risky  option, because according to my information, the major centers  of power do not want a Second Republic.    [Passalacqua] What do you like about the document?    [Bossi] A number of things have been more or less copied  from  our programs. They have appropriated that which was ours, but  they must remember that it was the League that made history.  Looking at this document, you get the impression of an attempt  to keep alive the principle of the citizens' economic equality  -- a principle that constitutes a trap, because it leads to a  rigid interventionist state. By focusing on federalism,  however, the League is thinking about freedom. So the document  represents a half-way stance. It can be interpreted in two  ways. It depends on how it is interpreted at the right time.  [Bossi ends]    Bossi became more animated and cited his real precondition,  the assertion that the next legislature will be a constituent  one: "Otherwise I will not sign this document, and if do not  sign it, neither will the League."    [Passalacqua] But do you agree with putting forward Segni  for  the premiership?    [Bossi] For the moment I do not agree with anything; first  it  must be signed, then.... The important thing is not the prime  minister, but which political forces support him.    [Passalacqua] Some people are saying that this document  grants the initiative to Segni and [Italian People's Party (PPI)  Secretary] Martinazzoli.    [Bossi] The League has a large membership, who want a  battle,  who want a struggle, and who are ready for a fight. We must see  whether this is a maneuver on Martinazzoli's part. There is a  great difference between a warrior such as myself and a chicken  thief such as Martinazzoli. We are prepared to continue the  fight indefinitely.    [Passalacqua] And what is Maroni doing negotiating in Rome,  while you are here in Milan talking about battles?    [Bossi] Mediators are there to mediate. But an adult  decision must be made about what is to be done. There are  several tendencies within the League, and I, being its founder,  have worked to keep them together. In the North, the League is  extremely strong. Never mind your opinion polls: We have an  average of 45 percent on our own. Nobody can defeat us here.  Even if [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto  and [Fininvest President] Berlusconi get together, we can beat  them with one hand tied. The accord must be reached with a  realization that there can be no victory without us. And that  change can only come about if the League scores an overwhelming  victory in the North.    [Passalacqua] Is this an appeal to the League supporters?    [Bossi] It is not appeal; it is an analysis. I have never  suffered any doubts or fears.</p>

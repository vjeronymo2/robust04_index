			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A TEAM TO THROW A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO ALL-STAR EFFORT  </P> <P> It's hard to say what will generate the most excitement at tonight's 2-A/3-A  All-Star boys' basketball game at Serra High. Will it be the players'  performances or 3-A Coach John Farrell's attempts to work 16 bodies into the  32-minute game?  </P> <P> By comparison, 2-A Coach Dennis Kane of San Diego High selected just 11 players  for his team.  </P> <P> "We're going into this game to showcase the kids," said Farrell, coach at  Torrey Pines. "We're not cutting anybody. Who am I to cut a kid? They've all  earned the right to be here.  </P> <P> "Our main thing is to get them all in. If we win the game, that's fine."  </P> <P> Four of Farrell's players no longer need showcasing. Monte Vista's Joe McNaull  (San Diego State), Shane Knight (Brigham Young) and Kyle Armstrong (Navy) have  signed with Division I schools, and J.J. Stokes has signed with UCLA to play  football.  </P> <P> The other 12 are looking for someone to take a flyer on them.  </P> <P> Only two 2-A players, Dee Boyer (Lamar) and Tony Clark (Arizona), have their  college plans finalized.  </P> <P> The boys' game begins at 7 p.m. The girls' game is scheduled for 5 p.m. DAVE  McKIBBEN  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (17): Difficult choices - Standards dilemma / Network managers have been hoping for a standard method of controlling their distributed systems, but no single standard has yet emerged Many network managers will be forced to choose a product in the near future without waiting to see if a clear standard becomes apparent. Wide area and local area networks of computers combining a variety different makes of hardware and software have been spreading at an extremely rapid rate, many of them outside the authority of network managers. Network management rose to the top of the list of concerns of European computer systems and network users for the first time last year, according to a study by Yankee Group Europe. There are plenty of software tools for tackling various aspects of the task, but there is still no standard approach to it as a whole. Network managers want more than just the ability to monitor their system devices - such as hubs, bridges and routers. They want to be able to control the performance of distributed applications, deliver a high level of service to users and ensure that information is kept secure. All this has to be done while keeping costs down, which in many cases will be achieved by charging users for the network service. Many system management functions which were carried out efficiently in the old IBM mainframe environment have yet to be worked out in the new world of distributed or client/server systems. Any standard method of network management for these new systems must be able to support two key communications protocols, the Internet's Simple Network Management Protocol (SIP) and the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP), the Open Systems Interconnection standard promoted by the International Standards Organisation. SIP is generally preferred for applications based on the UNIX operating system, which is used by most mid-range computers of the current generation. CMIP is favoured by users in the telecommunications industry. There have been several candidates for a network management standard, but none has gained sufficient support to attain that status. As yet, all the offerings provide only parts of the required solution. The two clear front-runners are Hewlett-Packard's OpenView and IBM's NetView/6000, which is also being marketed by Digital. The OSF's communications manager for Europe, Mr Mark Laureys says that they still need an industry definition of a piece of code called an object request broker before the DME can be completed. In the local area network sector, Microsoft is certain to be counted among the most important players. Its Systems Management Server (formerly code-named 'Hermes'), was previewed in May and is due to be available in late summer. Based on Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, it will offer some essential functions of a network management system, including software distribution, network auditing and remote support for applications users. These were all high on the list of requirements of network managers in a preliminary study conducted by Microsoft, according to its UK business systems group marketing manager, Ms Julie Cox. She foresees that SMS will compete to some extent with NetView and Openview. But industry analysts expect that although Microsoft's product will be commonly adopted on local area networks it will not be generally seen as an enterprise-wide solution. Thus IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft look likely to be the strongest forces in network management for at least the next couple of years. In that time, network management may replace the operating system as the primary battleground for leadership of the industry.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Guinness buoyed by 13% increase GUINNESS, the UK-based international drinks group, matched market expectations yesterday with a 13 per cent increase in 1991 pre-tax profits from Pounds 847m to Pounds 956m. Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman, said further 'acceptable growth in profits' should be achieved this year, and industry analysts are forecasting a 12 per cent rise to about Pounds 1.07bn. However, the company's shares closed 14p down at 556p on Mr Tennant's warning that trading conditions were likely to be no easier than last year. 'There seems to be little prospect of a speedy end to the recession in several major markets, notably the UK and North America,' he said. Group trading profit improved 19 per cent last year from Pounds 837m to Pounds 995m on turnover up 16 per cent at Pounds 4.07bn. Guinness's 24 per cent stake in LVMH, the French drinks and luxury goods group, contributed additional profits of Pounds 123m. Diluted earnings per share increased 15 per cent to 33.6p. The dividend is raised 15 per cent with a 7.75p final payment making a total 10.8p. Guinness spent Pounds 881m on acquisitions during the year - notably Cruzcampo and Union Cervecera, the Spanish brewers; Asbach, the German brandy; and Pampero, the Venezuelan spirits company. In spirits, acquisitions contributed Pounds 299m to turnover, up 13 per cent to Pounds 2.44bn; and Pounds 37m to profits, 12 per cent higher at Pounds 749m. The Cruzcampo group's contribution to the brewing division more than covered the financing cost of its acquisition. It accounted for Pounds 61m of total brewing profits of Pounds 244m (Pounds 160m) and Pounds 283m of the Pounds 1.59bn turnover (Pounds 1.3bn). Since 1987, in addition to its Pounds 1.1bn stake in LVMH, Guinness has invested Pounds 1.5bn in acquisitions. 'We believe there will be further opportunities in both beer and spirits,' Mr Tennant said. The group's free cash flow last year amounted to Pounds 182m. Continental Europe now contributes the largest slice of profits, up from 24 per cent to 30 per cent after acquisitions. The accounts include an extraordinary charge of Pounds 41m reflecting the Pounds 70m net cost of settling the Argyll Group's claim for compensation arising from the 1986 Distillers takeover, partially offset by the recovery of Pounds 29m of Pounds 68m invested in the Ivan Boesky partnership.

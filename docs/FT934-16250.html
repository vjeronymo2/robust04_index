			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public service pay figures Sir, The table that accompanied your report of the New Earnings Survey figures ('Pay rises faster in public sector', October 1) provided a misleading picture of pay increases for civil service executive officers and, if repeated in the other examples, may explain the apparently contradictory evidence of public sector pay movements. Executive officers are shown to have received a pay increase of 5.2 per cent 'in spite of the fact that many key public-sector groups had been affected by the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit when the pay data were compiled'. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the pay data are compiled in April each year, and in both years in question, the settlements were delayed. Therefore the comparison reflects the pay settlement in 1992. It is also distorted by compensation payments, required by law, made when the system of service-related annual increments was abolished. Information gathered by the Office of Manpower Economics as part of our pay agreement showed that far from pay rising faster in the public sector, civil servants suffered compared with the private sector in 1991 and 1992. The office's data would have shown it in 1993, only the government prevented publication in order to save itself further embarrassment. On top of that, the chancellor now wants to make public servants the scapegoats for the failings of the government's economic policy, with extensive privatisation and a further year's wage freeze. It is an explosive cocktail. John Sheldon, general secretary, NUCPS, 124-130 Southwark Street, London SE1 OTU</p>

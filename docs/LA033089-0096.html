			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE TRASH HAULING FRANCHISE REJECTED  </P> <P> After some heavy lobbying by garbage collection companies, the Downey City  Council unanimously voted this week to reject a proposal that would have  awarded the city's franchise to only one hauler. Instead, the 16 firms that  currently hold either commercial, industrial or residential trash collection  licenses will be allowed to continue operation.  </P> <P> When the issue of franchising to a single firm went before the council in  February, members delayed action until the haulers were given an opportunity to  address the council. At Tuesday's meeting, attorney Z. Harry Astor spoke  against franchising on behalf of 12 of the 16 haulers. And city officials  acknowledged that they had received 70 letters, mostly from local businesses  opposed to making any change.  </P> <P> As garbage hauler Michael Agopian put it, the current system is "the American  way" because it allows for more competition.  </P> <P> Astor said his clients will comply with the council's desire that they start  work no earlier than 7 a.m. to avoid disturbing residents with noise from the  compactors. They also promised to make sure their equipment operates safely and  to repaint dumpster bins that are parked in alleys at businesses and identify  them with the haulers' names.  </P> <P> Astor said the haulers also are willing to let the city raise their permit fees  from $187.50 per truck to $500 per truck.  </P></p>

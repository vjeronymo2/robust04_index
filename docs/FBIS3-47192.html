			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jan 94 </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] The working group meeting on government procurement  in the telecommunications sector held in Washington on 4 and 5  January closed without making any significant progress. While  there has been some progress on the issue of improving the  transparency of the bidding procedures, Japan rejected the U.S.  proposal to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation  (NTT) in the agreement on government procurement, and the two  sides have not been able to close the gap on the issue of  objective criteria.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be meeting President  Bill Clinton for the third time at the summit talks on 11  February. The Clinton administration seems to have refrained  from making tough demands on Japan so far "for fear of hurting  the Hosokawa administration." However, the present government  has been in existence for six months, and the prime minister's  close aides believe that "this time, they will be asking for  results." The government is, thus, hoping that some progress  can be made in the framework talks, which is the focal issue at  present.    According to one government source, however, "the point of  compromise remains unclear," and more rough sailing is expected  in the talks.    As far as Hosokawa is concerned, he has no choice but to  push  for "political reform first," even though he also faces the need  to adopt pump-priming measures and pass the budget, not to  mention his visit to the U.S. In contrast to Clinton, who will  be well- prepared, Hosokawa cannot claim to have fully prepared  a well-thought-out strategy for the U.S. summit meeting.    At the framework talks, government procurement, insurance,  and automobiles and auto parts have been named as priority  areas, and both sides expect to reach agreement before the  summit meeting in February. After the negotiations on  telecommunications, the working group on government procurement  of medical equipment is holding meetings on 6 and 7 January, the  working group on insurance on 10 and 11 January, and deputy  ministerial level discussions on automobiles and auto parts are  due to start on 11 January, leading up to the critical  negotiating phase in February.    According to the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, objective criteria still represent a controversial  issue because "they might lead to managed trade." The United  States would like to introduce such things as future sales  volume as numerical targets, while Japan is strongly opposed to  the idea. Recently, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, the United States has taken the more flexible  position of "not seeking the setting of numerical targets."  Japan, however, remains unconvinced. It believes "the United  States is still asking for an increase in our purchase of  U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts; this will still lead to  numerical targets."    Furthermore, in government procurement and insurance, the  United States is seeking to measure the degree of openness of  the Japanese market by comparing the share of foreign products  and companies on it to those in the other G-7 nations.  According to the Foreign Ministry, Japan maintains it will "not  agree to any targets," on this issue either.    However, since Japan has been unable to come up with any  effective measures to reduce its current accounts surplus, some  government officials believe "Japan will have to make some sort  of concession." In the end, Hosokawa may have to make a  political decision overriding the wishes of the bureaucrats.</p>

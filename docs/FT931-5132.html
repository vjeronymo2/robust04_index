			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Tories still dogged by tensions MR JOHN MAJOR believes his government has reached a watershed. He may be right. In retrospect, this spring may be judged to have marked the start of economic recovery and the beginning of the end of the Tory civil war over Maastricht. But if it does prove so, political historians are more likely to give the credit not to the government but to a more favourable turn of events. The Conservative party central council meeting in Harrogate at the weekend was meant to be the occasion at which the government recaptured its confidence. Instead it revealed again the tensions and frustrations which still beset the Tory party. A procession of cabinet ministers trooped to the platform to decry Conservative opponents of the Maastricht treaty and to talk up the recent signs of economic confidence. Mr Major wound up with an upbeat and not unconvincing assessment of the government's prospects once the recession and the row over Europe are put behind it. The constituency activists who make up the party's central council gave him a warm and sympathetic reception. But if hope and exhortation were visible in abundance - and were duly applauded by an audience searching for anything to cheer - there was less evidence of a fresh political strategy to accompany them. The frustration was never far below the surface. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, summed up the mood in the cabinet when he decried the 'trench warfare' over Maastricht that was sapping the government's authority. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, was typically blunt. Enough is enough he declared, before likening the arguments of Tory rebels to those of the obscure religious sect under siege by police in Waco, Texas. The sentiments were echoed by speaker after speaker. It appeared that the tactic was to drive a wedge between the Tory Euro-sceptics and their local party associations. Mr Hurd is furious at the way the legislation is being held up by the rebels' filibustering and has been urging a tougher line by the party whips. He made it clear that the treaty had to be ratified before parliament broke for the summer. But by the time Mr Major came to speak threats had been replaced by exhortation. The prime minister was not prepared to risk a permanent breach with the rebels by wielding the big stick. Instead he appealed for unity. The odds are that the whips will increase the pressure on the rebels and seek to force the pace of the legislation. But the confused message from Harrogate will not have helped. Last night most of the Euro-sceptics were unmoved. The government today faces the possibility of its first defeat on the legislation in the Commons. The weekend message on the economy was similarly blurred. Mr Major thinks the recession is over. He has made the point several times in private conversations with colleagues. He is unapologetic about his efforts to talk up confidence. But past false dawns have persuaded him to temper his optimism in any public statements. Mr Major talks of a 'turning point'. He will not state flatly that he believes recovery is under way. But his caution undermines his own case - it reinforces the impression that the government has not restored its grip. So too does cabinet-level gossip about the prospects for a summer reshuffle which might see Mr Norman Lamont switched from the Treasury. Close associates of the prime minister insist he has not made up his mind one way or the other. His senior cabinet colleagues are less reticent in their speculation. The case for a new chancellor is being made not only by aspirants for the job but also by senior Tory party advisers. For his part Mr Lamont is determined that the Budget will make his case for staying on until the wider shake-up pencilled in for next year. The uncertainty - likely to be prolonged until the Maastricht bill passes its final Commons hurdle - is damaging the government. Mr Major and his colleagues made a credible case in Harrogate that the worst is be over, that recovery will gradually restore their authority and that Maastricht will in the end be ratified. They did much less to demonstrate that the government has regained charge of its own destiny.</p>

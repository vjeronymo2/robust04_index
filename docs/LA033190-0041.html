			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS GOES DEEP, HELPS HART SINK SAN GABRIEL, 5-1  </P> <P> A fly ball, groundout or even a check-swing roller probably would have  sufficed.  </P> <P> But Rob Davis belted a game-ending grand slam in the bottom of the seventh  inning Friday as Hart High took over sole possession of first in the Foothill  League with a 5-1 come-from-behind baseball victory over visiting San Gabriel.  Davis' homer made a winner of Andrew Lorraine, who threw a one-hitter and  struck out nine to improve his record to 4-0.  </P> <P> "I was just thinking I had to get the fly ball," said Davis, who was two for  three, including his first home run. "I hit it solid."  </P> <P> With the score tied and none out, 1-1, Hart (8-1-2, 5-0 in league play) loaded  the bases on an error, a single and an intentional walk. That set the stage for  Davis, a senior shortstop and the Indians' leading batter (.483).  </P> <P> "I haven't coached a kid who is any tougher than he is with the game on the  line," Hart Coach Bud Murray said. "Ever since I've known him, that's how he's  been. He's got a knack."  </P> <P> Davis knocked the first pitch from right-hander Danny Ricabal over the  left-field fence to trigger a jubilant dugout eruption and end what had been an  entertaining duel of off-speed offerings between Ricabal and Lorraine.  </P> <P> Lorraine, a senior left-hander with a puzzling assortment of pitches, allowed  only five baserunners and retired the final 11 batters he faced while logging  his second complete game.  </P> <P> Yet Lorraine's only mistake -- a hanging curve in the second inning that junior  Dan Terrazas hit over the left-field fence for a solo home run -- gave San  Gabriel (5-5-1, 4-1) a 1-0 lead that almost stood up.  </P> <P> "That would have been a tough one to lose," Lorraine said. "I'll tell you, Rob  Davis is probably the best clutch hitter in the world. I gotta buy him  something."  </P> <P> Hart tied the score in the sixth on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by  pinch-hitter R. J. Simone that scored Davis. Ricabal (4-1), who struck out  three while yielding eight hits, struck out Tom Wolff swinging to end the  inning.  </P> <P> "As good a game as Danny threw, Andy threw a better game," San Gabriel Coach  Dick Guzman said. "We didn't produce any offense. Against a team like Hart, how  long is (a one-run lead) going to last?"  </P> <P> Hart, however, has struggled offensively. The Indians entered the game with a  .260 batting average and only 13 extra-base hits in 258 at-bats. But the team  slump, Davis said, won't last long.  </P> <P> "We're going to be OK," he said. "We hit well today. We knew it would be a  tough game."  </P></p>

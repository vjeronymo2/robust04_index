			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Russia set to decide on most risky reform stage The Russian government is poised to decide on the next and most dangerous step in its three-year-old reform process. Going ahead would mean launching a full attack on inflation, closing many obsolete factories and starting to create a working social security system - with the aid of up to Dollars 18bn (Pounds 11.6bn) provided through the International Monetary Fund. The scale of the transformation now being debated in the government and with IMF experts would be larger than anything yet attempted and would risk creating social unrest and political instability. However, it could also reduce Russian inflation - which was running at 4 per cent in August - to west European levels and provide the basis for sustained growth for the first time in more than a decade. The government's ambitions are partly revealed in an article in today's Sevodnya newspaper by Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the Russian director on the Fund's board. Mr Kagalovsky, whose article was approved by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, lays out requests the government is already making to the IMF and other western institutions or plans to make at the annual IMF meeting in Madrid early next month. Though Mr Kagalovsky does not total them, they would amount to Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn. If agreed, it would be a massive commitment to one country and to a government's agreement to reform. It would also increase criticism that the Fund is already relaxing its criteria too much in order to accommodate Russia. Earlier this week, Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, warned that the IMF risked 'financial and moral ruin' if it continued to waive its normally strict conditions. The Russian government wants to increase its 'stand-by' borrowing facility from Dollars 4bn to more than Dollars 5bn by raising the percentage of the Dollars 6bn quota it can borrow from 68 per cent to to 90 per cent. It also wants to increase by up to Dollars 2bn what it can borrow under the so called 'systemic transformation facility'. This is a lending medium with fewer conditions than normal, under which Russia has already borrowed Dollars 3bn in the past 12 months - also by raising the quota limits. The Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn from the stand-by and the systemic transformation facility loans would be used, says Mr Kagalovsky, to: fund the budget deficit and provide for the 'pressing needs' of industry, the farming sector, health and social provision; put up a fund to stabilise the rouble by paying an estimated Dollars 6bn and Dollars 8bn to the Russian Central Bank, and giving it enough reserves to protect the Russian currency once it is made fully convertible. Mr Kagalovsky says that the money must be paid over to Russia rather than held in reserve by the Fund; give Russia membership of the Paris Club of creditor nations - because of the huge debts owing to Russia, which Mr Kagalovsky estimates at Dollars 147bn.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Alitalia plans to be scrutinised Plans to restructure Alitalia, loss-making state-owned national carrier, will be scrutinised for the first time by the new Berlusconi government at a meeting between the airline's chief executives and Mr Publio Fiori, the transport minister. Within the Berlusconi government there are strong pressures for cuts and changes even more radical than those proposed by the three month-old board of Alitalia. Several ministers want to use Alitalia as a demonstration of the government's resolve to pursue free market policies and extend the scope of the previous Ciampi administration's privatisation plans. Alitalia has accumulated losses of L1,229bn (Pounds 513.3m) over the past six years, and almost a quarter of that during 1993. The restructuring plan, which has been presented to representatives of air and ground staff over the past two weeks, has yet to be made public. But the unions fear the restructuring proposed would involve cuts of over a fifth of the workforce.</p>

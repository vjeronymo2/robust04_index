			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ericsson issue raises SKr2.2bn ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, said yesterday it had raised SKr2.17bn (Dollars 301.3m) through a convertible bond issue to stiffen its financial muscle in fast-growing markets where competition was intense from rivals such as Siemens of Germany and AT&amp;T of the US. Ericsson said orders were set to grow by more than 30 per cent this year to more than Dollars 9bn and it needed the cash for 'acquisitions, financing requirements by customers and because of general problems in the financial market' - although it declined to be more specific. 'This is a way to try to ensure we have the financial wherewithal in a relatively tight financial market,' the company said. Ericsson has been riding a rise in new orders for more than a year, particularly in its radio communications division. It has established a 40 per cent share of the world market for mobile telephone infrastructure systems and has signalled a significant improvement this year on last year's SKr1.30bn pre-tax profit. It has been growing fast in China, which accounts for 7 per cent of group sales, and is anxious to ensure it can continue to compete for business where customer financing is required. 'In China and even in some other markets there may be a need for us to help the customer with the financing of deals,' the company said. The issue of 4.25 per cent convertible subordinated debentures was fully subscribed, with 50 per cent taken up by foreign investors. The bonds will mature on June 30, 2000, with conversion to B shares available from August 2 at SKr300.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Tories go slow in Scotland For a party which many say is on the verge of extinction, the Scottish Conservatives appear remarkably relaxed. Since the election was called, Labour has had Neil Kinnock in Edinburgh at its annual Scottish conference, the SNP has launched its campaign with a cheery press conference and the Liberals have presented a Scottish version of their manifesto. The Tories, meanwhile, have held one rather limp press conference (and that, apparently, at the urging of the broadcasters anxious to balance Kinnock). Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has released two statements by fax, one on Tory plans to ban the carrying of knives, and the other on expanding foreign language teaching in schools. The party is even launching its manifesto in Scotland a day later than in England, with the idea of getting two bites of the cherry. Still, there was a sign of life yesterday: Lord Sanderson, party chairman, made a foray into Fife, and Lang challenged Donald Dewar, his Labour opposite number, on taxation - by issuing a fax, of course. 'We're starting slowly and building up gradually,' says party headquarters.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SIDES WITH CITY AGAINST FEISTY HOLLYWOOD COMMITTEE  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge sided Wednesday with the city of Los Angeles in a  dispute with a scrappy citizens advisory committee on Hollywood redevelopment  that has refused to disband, despite a City Council decision to abolish it.  </P> <P> Judge Kurt J. Lewin rejected claims by the group, known as the Project Area  Committee, that the council's action violated state law as well as the  Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, a broad blueprint for renewal in central  Hollywood.  </P> <P> The ruling was a victory for Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo, a strong  supporter of the redevelopment project. Woo had asked the council to dissolve  the committee last May because it had become a forum for "wacky behavior" bent  on undermining the renewal effort.  </P> <P> Woo described the ruling as "exhilarating." He said he wanted to "send out a  peace message" to committee members and invite them to cooperate with the  advisory panel he appointed in August.  </P> <P> The committee was set up in December, 1983, to help the Community Redevelopment  Agency prepare a redevelopment plan for 1,100 acres of central Hollywood.  </P> <P> When the council adopted the $922-million plan in May, 1986, the committee  became an advisory group directed by state law to report to the CRA on "policy  matters" affecting local residents.  </P> <P> State law required the CRA to consult with the committee for three years. Last  May, when the three years elapsed, the council followed Woo's lead and voted to  replace the largely elected committee with a separate advisory group.  </P> <P> But the committee refused to die. Committee members pointed to a section of the  plan stating that "to the maximum extent permitted by law, the activities of  the agency pertaining to implementation of the plan . . . shall be developed in  consultation with the . . . committee." The members interpret that to mean the  life of the 30-year plan.  </P> <P> Lewin disagreed. Ultimately, the judge said, the question is a political one  that "area residents can still pursue . . . at the ballot box."  </P></p>

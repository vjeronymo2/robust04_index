			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / DPP urges Lord Mackay to widen advocacy rights MRS Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, and Sir James Nursaw QC, head of the Government Legal Service, yesterday called on the Lord Chancellor to give barristers in the employed sector the right to appear as advocates in the higher courts. In a joint submission to Lord Mackay, they argue that if he approves a Bar Council rule that bans all employed barristers from appearing in the higher courts he will shut the door on wider advocacy rights for Crown Prosecution Service and government barristers forever. This would be inconsistent with recent advice from his advisory committee that CPS lawyers should be granted advocacy rights at some stage. Mrs Mills and Sir James suggest Lord Mackay should ask the Bar to amend its rule to reflect this. Granting rights of audience to employed lawyers would both improve the administration of justice and be in the public interest, they claim. At the moment, more than 60 per cent of instructions to counsel are returned just before the hearing so that a new and possibly unknown barrister is brought in at the last minute. If rights of audience were available to employed lawyers, in some cases it would be possible to use an experienced GLS or CPS advocate with knowledge of the case. The Bar is vehemently opposed to CPS lawyers having advocacy rights in the Crown Court. It fears the CPS would take on the bulk of prosecution work itself and deprive young barristers in private practice of much of their bread and butter income, putting the future of an independent Bar at risk. The CPS says it is the Bar's largest client and has a vested interest in ensuring that it survives. Mrs Mills says it would undertake no more than 15-20 per cent of Crown Court prosecution work with all major trials continuing to be handled by private practitioners. Their joint submission follows a recommendation made to the Lord Chancellor last month by Sir Gordon Borrie, the outgoing director general of fair trading that the Bar's rule was anti-competitive and should be removed. Although it is now more than four years since Lord Mackay first signalled the end of the Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts his office said yesterday that he was still several months away from a final decision on the issue.</p>

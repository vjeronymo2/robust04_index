			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of address by President Joaquim Chissano on 24 June to </F> mark the country's 19th independence anniversary; place not  given]    [Text] Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots:    At midnight on 25 June 1994, we shall celebrate another  anniversary of our country's existence as an independent and  sovereign country.    We shall celebrate the 19th national independence  anniversary, thus remembering a period of great euphoria and  hope experienced by all Mozambicans on 25 June 1975, when they  began to open a new chapter in the country's multicentennial  history.    25 June 1975 was a particularly solemn and important period  during which we assumed the responsibility of leading our  fatherland's destiny.    The proclamation of independence was the result of the  national liberation struggle, waged by the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo], which is also celebrating 32 years of existence  today.    In order to obtain success in the struggle for national  liberation, it was necessary to unite the entire Mozambican  people around a common objective -- to gain national  independence.    It was our unity that made us Mozambicans, with our own  identity as a people and as a state in the context of the  international community.    By strengthening unity we consolidate our Mozambican  identity, our national independence, and we consolidate peace,  which is an indispensable condition for our country's progress  and our fatherland's prosperity.    I would therefore like to call on all Mozambican people,  regardless of color, sex, race, tribe, party, or religion, to  preserve and defend our unity against all attempts aimed at  dividing our people.    Mozambican women, Mozambican men:    This is the second time that we celebrate our national  independence anniversary in peace, following the signing of the  General Peace Accord in 4 October 1992. Since then all  Mozambicans have been living in peace and stability, devoting  all their capabilities and energy toward consolidating  democracy, national reconstruction, and the well-being of all  Mozambicans.    Since the establishment of peace, my government has been  successfully implementing a number of programs within the  framework of national reconstruction and the normalization of  our people's life.    The undertakings carried out by my government include the  reconstruction of schools, hospitals, the opening and repair of  bore holes, wells, renovation, maintenance, and opening of  roads, bridges, and runways throughout the country.    With the establishment of peace, with the return of refugees  and war-displaced people, and following their engagement in  productive activity during 1993, we achieved an economic growth  rate of 19 percent, against a target of about six percent.    On behalf of my government and on my own behalf, I would  like  to salute the Mozambican people, who responded and continue to  respond positively to efforts carried out by my government and  civilian society to pacify the country and obtain greater  democratic openness and the political participation for all  citizens.    I would like to convey a message of appreciation to the  national business community which, believing in the present  political, economic, and social moment brought about by peace,  contributed greatly to the growth of the national economy.    I would also like to salute the international community for  the political and financial assistance it rendered. It is my  hope that this assistance will continue to be rendered for our  country's economic growth and well-being, which the Mozambican  people deserve and so much desire.    We are now facing new challenges. We have the responsibility  of continuing to develop efforts aimed at increasing production  in conformity with this year's economic and social plan.    Another natural disaster, cyclone "Nadia", hit our country,  particularly the northern provinces, leaving thousands of people  homeless, destitute, and without food, in addition to the  economic damage it caused.    My government conveyed a message of sympathy to the affected  people and took the necessary measures to assist them. Actions  are under way to minimize the effects of the cyclone as well as  to guarantee the implementation of the production targets  established for this year.    I would like to urge the people, economic agents, and the  international community to continue to give their contribution  in order to realize these objectives.    Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots:    The voter registration process is an important moment to  prepare for and organize the general multiparty election  scheduled for 27 and 28 October this year.    The voter registration process is aimed at registering and  identifying all voting-age Mozambicans to vote for the president  of the Republic and for deputies in the National Assembly.  Those who do not register cannot vote.    The voter registration process is a major task which  requires  the participation of all Mozambicans. By participating in the  election, the citizens are exercising a constitutional right, a  right that is also a compulsory civic duty for all Mozambicans  of voting age.    It is the duty of all citizens to take part in the election  and cooperate with the relevant authorities in all actions aimed  at facilitating the process.    I would, therefore, like to call on registered political  parties, which have great responsibility in the whole process,  to do all they can for the success of the process and to ensure  that the first general multiparty elections are free and fair.  It is only in this way that the elected and the unelected can  contribute to the success of national reconstruction,  consolidation of peace, and the normalization of life for all  our people.    Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots:    It was with joy that the Mozambican people celebrated the  electoral victory of the African National Congress and its  President Nelson Mandela. Immediately after the announcement of  the electoral results, on behalf of the Mozambican people, the  government, and on my own behalf, I congratulated the people of  this great country for ending "apartheid" and the coming to  power of a majority government democratically elected, led by  the ANC.    It was with great joy that the Republic of Mozambique, the  Frontline States, the southern African and OAU countries  welcomed the new South Africa as a member of the Frontline  States, the OAU, and the United Nations.    The Republic of Mozambique has already begun a useful  cooperation in different fields, particularly in the fields of  manpower and ports and railroads, with the Republic of South,  and it is our hope that this cooperation will continue to  increase on the basis of greater trust and mutual benefits.    Thus, we are anxiously waiting for South Africa to become a  member of the Southern African Development Community.    The electoral victory of the ANC and President Nelson  Mandela  is the result of the struggle carried out by the countries of  the region and the international community to completely  eradicate "apartheid". For us, the end of destabilizatio is the  beginning of an era of peace and security in the region, the  establishment of cooperative health relations for regional  development.    It is our sincere hope that the fraternal people of South  Africa will have a prosperous future, and we would like to  convey our warm greetings to President Nelson Mandela for his  election to the leadership of the new and free Republic of South  Africa.    We would like to salute President Bakili Muluzi and the  United Democratic Front of the Republic of Malawi for their  victory in the recent free and democratic elections held in that  fraternal country.    We would also like to salute the Malawian people for their  political maturity and desire to change toward real democracy in  their country. We hope to begin a new era of bilateral  cooperation, given the historic ties and the major economic and  social interests linking the Republic of Mozambique and the  Republic of Malawi.    Compatriots:    While on one hand, we salute positive developments in the  Republics of South Africa and Malawi. On the other hand there  is a cause for consternation in other republics. We refer to  the day-to- day life in the fraternal countries of Angola,  Rwanda, Somalia, Burundi, and Liberia.    Despite the great expectation surrounding peace negotiations  in Lusaka between the Angolan Government and UNITA, we continue  to be alarmed by the killing of innocent civilians in Angola.    My country appreciates the flexibility and the spirit of  compromise demonstrated by the Angolan Government at the  negotiating table. We would like to urge UNITA and its leader,  Dr. Jonas Savimbi, to adopt a positive posture with a view to  ending the suffering of the Angolan people.    We would like to call for a speedy conclusion of the  negotiations with the subsequent signing of the Lusaka accord  and the end of war in Angola. Our region desires a complete,  true, and lasting peace.    What is happening in Rwanda is a true carnage that the world  should neither ignore nor tolerate. We would like to appeal to  the parties in the conflict to follow the path of dialogue. We  would also like to appeal to the international community to give  its material and financial assistance and find appropriate  mechanisms to end this disaster at the end of the century.    Tensions prevail in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East where  armed conflicts are rife. We are concerned with the situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the UN efforts to maintain peace  and render humanitarian assistance to thousands of victims are  rendered fruitless.    The problem generated around the Korean Peninsula endangers  peace and security in that region, while in Yemen there is a  generalized armed conflict which has been killing innocent  people and causing the destruction of economic and social  infrastructures in that country.    We favor dialogue and our desire is to see the leaders and  the people of Yemen find the best way of resolving their  differences.    Compatriots:    On this occasion when we celebrate the 19th national  independence anniversary, I would like to salute the Mozambique  Armed Forces for their commitment to and engagement in the  defense of our country's sovereignty during all these 19 years.  We want to reiterate that even with the establishment of the  new national army -- the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM]  -- the government will continue to make efforts to find  solutions which will guarantee them a honorable form of life and  participation in the country's reconstruction. We want them to  view their active participation in national reconstruction and  the country's economic and social development as a right and the  duty of each and everyone of them.    With unity and discipline, without hastiness, we shall be  able to transform our desire into reality.    I would like to address a message of solidarity and respect  to war-displaced people and refugees who have finally returned  or continue to return home. It is my hope that their lives will  normalize rapidly, as we guarantee them assistance in this  direction.    To all workers, peasants, intellectuals, public servants,  and  others in different areas of production, I would like to convey  my wishes for greater success in their tasks to contribute to  the country's development and the well-being of the Mozambican  people.    To all national and international nongovernmental  organizations, foreign aid workers, religious denominations, and  the entire civilian society, I would like to convey my  appreciation for the effort they are exerting in the search for  solutions to the various problems affecting the country and all  our people. I would like to urge you to continue with your  positive work in support of the economy and the needy.    I would like you all to celebrate 25 June in the happiest  manner possible, hoping that the future will bring you  prosperity and success in your activities.    It is also my desire that peace, unity, reconciliation, and  national reconstruction will be the principal concern of all  Mozambicans at this time when we celebrate the 19th national  independence anniversary and when the holding of legislative and  presidential elections, on 27 and 28 October 1994, is  approaching.    Long live 25 June!    Long live national independence!    Long live the Mozambican people!    For peace, unity, justice, and progress;    For democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction;    For a better future;    The struggle continues!</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Northern Investors net assets at 289.4p Northern Investors, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based venture capital group, reported a fully diluted net asset value of 284.4p per share as at September 30. The figure showed a marginal decline on the 289.4p of six months earlier but an increase on the 276.8p at end-September 1991. Mr Robert Dickinson, chairman, said the group's investments had shown 'encouraging resilience' in the economic downturn. Three new investments were completed during the interim period, involving a total commitment of Pounds 593,000. The pre-tax surplus fell to Pounds 206,000 (Pounds 282,000) reflecting reduced investment income of Pounds 419,000 (Pounds 491,000) following the decision to move some resources from cash into longer term investments at the end of 1991. Earnings per share emerged at 4p (5.4p) and the interim dividend is cut from 3.5p to 2p.</p>

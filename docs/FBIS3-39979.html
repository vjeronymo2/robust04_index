Addressing his party's consultation meeting here, Dicle said  that Turkey was passing through its most comprehensive economic  and political crisis in its 70-year-long history.    He recalled that the European Parliament had decided to send  observers to southeastern Turkey during the March local polls  and "this decision is a political victory of our party won  against the policy of a state."    Dicle claimed that his party's deputies were the ones who  were facing the removal of their immunity and "we are not afraid  from such a thing because we are a party of a cause."    "We defend the brotherhood of peoples under any condition.  We are not the ones who brought the country to this situation.  Attempts to play with fire in the Kurdish question is very  dangerous. We invite everyone to common sense [as received],"  he said.    The party's deputy from Adiyaman, Mahmut Kilinc, answering  questions of reporters during the meeting said that their party  was "against the violence of the PKK and the state."</p>

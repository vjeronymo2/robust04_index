			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Insurance premium for terrorism not measurable Sir, As an insurer I am concerned that Mr Keith Salway (Letters, November 24) considers it 'a disgraceful act' to withdraw commercial insurance cover for damage from terrorist action on the mainland. Insurance risks must be capable of financial measurement and it is impossible to see how a premium for terror-ist actions can be calculated here. To provide cover would cause unacceptably increased premiums. The cost of reinstating the pecuniary interest of the insured in his property for acts of political terrorism should be met by the government out of state funds to which we have contributed. Only the government can overcome terrorist threats. It is up to us all to help it in this by reporting to the police any suspected terrorists in order to prevent damage by their actions. We may then defeat the malefactors who threaten us. John Burrows, Copyhold, Church Lane, Bury, Pulborough, West Sussex RH20 1PB</p>

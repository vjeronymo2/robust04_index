The  union leaders are demanding wage increases. The Quetzaltenango  state employees warned they will only leave the offices when  they are given the 40-percent wage increase they demanded from  the government five weeks ago.    The National Police reported that approximately 800  demonstrators held a protest and later seized the governor's  headquarters and the Quetzaltenango municipality with more than  100 employees. Public security authorities said police  surveillance will be increased in the coming hours, and they  will find a legal way to evacuate the municipality and the state  governor's office.    Union leader Oswaldo Squich declared that public employees  await the arrival of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's  representative to negotiate. The demonstrators coordinated  their actions with the leaders of the National Federation of  State Workers Unions, who are scheduled to meet with government  representatives.    The government employees union leaders temporarily seized  the  National Palace, headquarters of the Guatemalan Government, a  few days ago, over the same conflict. Monday, more than 30,000  professors joined the protest movement.</p>

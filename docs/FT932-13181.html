			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: View on health service moves misguided Sir, Your editorial on private finance and the National Health Service (April 22) shows uncharacteristic naivete. I was particularly surprised by your description of Labour's response to government plans as 'depressing' and 'reflex', since my statement on behalf of the Labour party did seek to draw a distinction between the positive role to be played in the NHS by expanded leasing-type arrangements and the problems associated with handing over key healthcare services to the private sector. Schemes must be judged on their merits and their effect on healthcare, both short and long term. To suggest as you do that the government's latest moves will begin to unleash new investment while protecting the NHS is simply misguided. It is true that Treasury pressure to cut public spending on health, while apparently increasing 'real resources', is driving ministers to seek more private finance. But in seeking to square this financial circle they are deliberately creating conditions for key NHS functions to be gradually handed over to companies operating outside the NHS. The FT may approve, but I believe such a path will inevitably lead to a two-tier service and the erosion of free and comprehensive healthcare. Something far more ideological is happening to Tory health policy than you suggest. For evidence, I suggest that your readers examine the full text of junior health secretary Tom Sackville's speech or the pamphlet on this topic by David Willetts MP - the real agenda is not far from the surface. With all this in mind I await with interest the speech by the health secretary, Mrs Bottomley, to the Confederation of British Industry next month (since she seems completely unwilling to say anything to parliament on this topic). I suspect that my worst fears will be confirmed. David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

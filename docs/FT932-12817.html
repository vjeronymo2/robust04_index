			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Auditors are told to provide more details of work AUDITORS will be required to provide more detailed documentation of their work under draft guidelines issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Five new auditing standards call for formal documentation throughout the audit process, and add new guidelines on making estimates. Mr David Young, a member of the board, said: 'This represents a hardening of emphasis on particular points. I think it will make a difference through lots of minor individual changes.' The guidelines reflect concerns by audit regulators that auditors do not have adequate information on paper which can be inspected to determine the quality of their work. A standard on planning stresses more emphasis on documentation and a distinction between formulating general strategy and detailed planning of procedures. One on documentation says there should be evidence that the audit was carried out in accordance with auditing standards, and which gives detailed information of the content of working papers during the audit. A standard on estimates stresses the importance of the auditors verifying with sufficient evidence the larger number of accounting estimates during an audit. Comments on the guidelines are invited by July 31. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy yesterday unveiled a new corporate image and announced fundamental changes to professional qualifications. New students will use open learning rather than being required to attend college, making the qualification more flexible. Continuous assessment of students' performance will assume a greater role. Greater emphasis is to be placed on commercial accounting and reporting, taxation and business planning. Cipfa is also emphasising post-qualification development, and will shortly launch an advanced diploma in business and financial management and a public service Master of Business Administration degree. The restructuring comes as Cipfa - which has about 11,500 members - faces new challenges with the fundamental changes affecting the public sector. Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the institute, said: 'Our objective is to ensure that our qualifications and training remain relevant to the new environment.' The organisation has been given a new logo - the abbreviation Cipfa, with an italic sweep to the letter p. It now calls itself 'the leading accountancy body for the public services'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 5 Apr -- The optic fiber communications  line between Moscow and St. Petersburg which became operational  today can be described as a breakthrough in Russian  telecommunications. Mayors Yuriy Luzhkov and Anatoliy Sobchak  could meet on the screens of monitors defying the distance of  675 km between them. This unusual video link-up took place  simultaneously in the capital and the town on the Neva. It  crowned the efforts of three firms -- "Metrokom," "Raskom," and  "Makomnet" -- established in Russia by "Andrew Corporation," a  U.S. company which is a world leader in telecommunications. On  the Russian side, the partners were the subways of both towns,  the October [Oktyabrskaya] railway, and the "High-Speed Tracks"  joint-stock company.    The video equipment used for this special news conference  was  connected to the sections of the optic fiber network laid down  in subway tunnels in each town and along the entire October  railway. The technology transmits simultaneously huge volumes of  audio, video, and computerized data both within the country and  to international communications satellites. [passage omitted]</p>

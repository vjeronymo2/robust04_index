			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE SING ELIAS' PRAISES  </P> <P> My wife and I attended Diane Elias' recital at St. Andrew's Presbyterian  Church, and we were disappointed with Bruce Burroughs' review ("Mezzo Diane  Elias in Hometown Newport Recital," Calendar, Aug. 8).  </P> <P> We thoroughly enjoyed the choice of songs and the singing as well as the  opportunity to hear Miss Elias sing.  </P> <P> We do not agree with Mr. Burroughs' review.  </P> <P> Mr. and Mrs. ROBERT D. HUNTER, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

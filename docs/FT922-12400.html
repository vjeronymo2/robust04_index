			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Books: An un-literary biography - Waugh without his art NO ABIDING CITY: EVELYN WAUGH 1939-1966 by Martin Stannard JM Dent Pounds 25, 523 pages GRAHAM Greene, in a much-quoted phrase, said that his friend Evelyn Waugh was 'the greatest novelist of my generation'. Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford in another well-known quotation: 'You have no idea how much nastier I would be if I was not a Catholic . . . ' There is the challenge to the biographer: to show how the literary genius co-existed with the cruel, tormented, snobbish, offensive, reactionary old buffer. The second volume of Martin Stannard's biography opens in 1939 with the fashionable author of black comedies joining the Royal Marines as an over-age trainee officer - or rather, as he saw it, as a Catholic crusader in the defence of Christendom. The love affair with the army was short, and painful on both sides. Waugh came to feel that he was unwanted (which was true) and that the cause had been dishonoured; his five days in Crete gave him a conclusive sense of national disgrace. He began to turn his life into a fiction - 'sensitive, Catholic, bundled out of a Protestant war because he would not compromise his honour . . . ' writes Stannard. 'Everyone else had to be wrong . . . ' Here was the impetus for the post-war writings, and also for his short, unhappy life; he retreated into a dream, a fixation with a romantic and unreal past. An important part of that fiction was his infatuation with the aristocracy. He never truly belonged to it, he was reacting against his Golders Green birth and his middle-class father. As his son Auberon has written: 'Although the Waughs were an eminently respectable family . . . the gulf between them and the carefree traditions of the aristocracy was as great as if he had been a fishmonger's assistant'. That may be a bit strong but the idea can stand: there must have been hypocrisy as well as eccentricity in Waugh's life, which would have heightened self-parody and unreality and, in his literary art, 'the confusion of social grace with moral worth' (in one of Stannard's sharper phrases). Stannard lingers over the detail of Waugh's increasingly isolated and misanthropic years as country gent. His days were taken up with family, church, library, increasingly distant friends, and drunken jaunts to London. He was an old man long before his time. His (second) marriage, one suspects, will remain mysterious: he must have been an impossible man. His deficiencies as a father have been aired again in his son's recent autobiography. The father said of his children: 'I can only see them as defective adults, feckless, destructive, frivolous, sensual, humourless . . . ' Was that a joke? Presumably not - the sentence comes from his diaries. Was it self-parody? The fundamental concern of his life was his Catholicism, and Stannard rightly emphasises his obsession with the preservation and propagation of the Faith, He awaited death for years. He was afraid of madness, and in The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold in 1957 he left a remarkable report on his own breakdown. Stannard gives the episode a central place in his tale. Were Waugh's 'voices' the result of an overuse of narcotics, as he afterwards claimed, or, as Stannard suggests, did the drugs release 'a barrage of self-hatred . . . his private catalogue of self-reproach'? If he was mad, perhaps he should have bitten a few more of our novelists . . . Stannard's biography is careful, readable, and appears exhaustive until one realises its great weakness, which is that it too rarely illuminates the most important area of Waugh's life - there is almost no sense of Waugh at work as writer. There is a welter of detail about the minutiae of the years, his wartime postings, his feuds with Cyril Connolly, and so on and so forth. But what happened when this dyspeptic and lonely man closed his library door, settled at his desk, and picked up his fountain pen? We are not told. It turns out to be a curiously un-literary biography.</p>

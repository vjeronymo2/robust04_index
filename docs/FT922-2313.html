			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: US side boosts Erskine House STRONG growth in the US helped Erskine House, the office equipment services company, to announce a 5 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.7m for last year. Mr Brian McGillivray, the chairman who transformed Erskine through a heady programme of acquisitions in the 1980s, said the company had benefited from cost-cutting in the US and Pounds 1.4m decrease group interest charges to Pounds 3.7m. The savings offset a 6 per cent decline in group sales to Pounds 178.9m for the year to March 31. Mr McGillivray said Erskine was seeing a slight improvement in the US after the severely depressed conditions of 1991. 'We are a little more happy,' he said. The US contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 4.9m). The UK remained difficult, and Mr McGillivray held out little hope for a significant improvement in the current year. Machine sales in the UK had been 'disappointingly low' and margins depressed by price-cutting. Furthermore, adverse publicity surrounding the leasing industry had cost Erskine between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m in operating profits last year. Servicing income rose slightly during the year, but UK pre-tax profits still fell almost 19 per cent to Pounds 5.1m. Erskine sold its laser printer business for Pounds 4.7m, which accounted for Pounds 800,000 in operating profits in 1991. Germany suffered a 58 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 371,000. Debt fell from Pounds 41.3m to Pounds 36.3m, representing 50 per cent of shareholders' funds. The dividend was maintained at 4.35p, for a total of 6.65p. Earnings per share were depressed from 14.5p to 11.7p by a higher tax charge. COMMENT Erskine House may be finding its way back into City affections. The results appear to show that the same management, accused of going too far too fast on the acquisition trail in the 1980s, can steer the company through a tough recession. Points in favour include the long-term nature of debt, and the steady servicing income in most markets. Erskine is also unlikely to tread on toes with any big acquisitions in the next year or two. This said, the debt obligations and late cycle nature of copier leasing means Erskine will not show immediate dazzling growth. Forecasts for 1993 range from same again to about Pounds 14.5m. On yesterday's close of 86p, the prospective p/e looks almost too low at about 6 or 7 times. Shares are further supported by a healthy yield of more than 10 per cent.</p>

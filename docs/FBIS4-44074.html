			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at Corfu </F> news conference at the end of the European Union [EU] summit at  the Municipal Theater in Corfu--live]    [Text] I warmly thank European Commission President Jacques  Delors for his kind words about the Greek Presidency. This  European Union summit was actually very significant. Delors has  already given us a taste of what we managed to accomplish, what  we have managed to agree upon, and what we have managed to do.  I believe these are great steps forward.    Before going into detail, I would like to say that although  some disagree about the general policy that is being formulated,  this policy is contained in Delors' white paper. Battles have  been waged to achieve this, but now it is established. The  white paper will constitute a guide for our actions and  initiatives in the future.    Now, regarding decisions specifically for Greece. Four big  development projects for our country are included in the  decisions of the EU summit. These are the Egnatia highway  project, the Patrai-Bulgarian border highway project, the  natural gas network, and the cable link between Greece and  Italy. A second point that I would like to stress is that for  the first time it has been decided to include both Cyprus and  Malta in the next EU expansion phase.    Within the framework of this conference, we had other very  important developments. We had the signing of the agreement  between United Europe and Russia, which constitutes a great step  forward for peace, progress, and democracy. We also had the  signing of the accession agreements by four countries. All of  these countries are particularly sensitive to social policy and  environmental issues and will contribute significantly to the  United Europe's working level.    There was also an official meeting within the framework of  dialogue between Cyprus and the European Union. As you may  know, we met Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis on this matter.    I will say that I am mostly happy with the results, with  only  one exception, on which I cannot remain silent. We were unable  to elect a new European Commission president to replace Jacques  Delors. The Greek Presidency did everything possible to reach  this goal, but unfortunately we did not achieve it. I am  obliged to say that it was not achieved because Great Britain  refused to accept the proposal of all the others. The issue  remains open. A new EU summit supposedly will take place in  mid-July to elect a new European Commission president. I do not  want to go into more detail, but it is necessary to take a  position.    Now, I ask Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos to  detail the conclusions of this EU summit.</p>

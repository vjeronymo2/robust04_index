			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Akihiko Magoori and Hiroki Fukuda of AERA's </F> editorial department: "Truth and Falsehood of `Rumored Political  Change at the End of January'"]    [Text] On 16 December, three House of Representatives  members quit the LDP in defiance of their party's policy  regarding extending the current extraordinary Diet; on that same  day, former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka died.    The death of the former prime minister, who almost  personified the LDP's best days, seems to symbolize the LDP's  decline and the current transitional stage.    Shigeru Ishiba, who was present at the plenary session on 15  December to vote for extending the Diet session in defiance of  the LDP decision, said: "I decided to leave the party because I  thought I would have to be responsible for bringing about  political reform." Masamitsu Oishi revealed his inner thoughts  at a news conference this way: "I had never imagined until  yesterday that what happened today could actually take place."  Takashi Sasagawa said: "I have a very pleasant feeling."    It is said that phone calls of encouragement from supporters  poured in to the office of former LDP General Council Chairman  Takeo Nishioka, who took action similar to that of the  aforementioned trio and quit the party on 17 December.    The foursome are considering forming a new group with  independent members of the House of Representatives who  previously leapt out of the LDP.    Even Noriaki Watase, who was absent from the plenary session  as directed by the party, resolutely said: "Political  realignment is at the threshold, and there will be plenty of  chances to put my life on the line."    A certain businessman was reported to have personally  censured LDP President Yohei Kono face to face regarding its  harassing tactics against the Hosokawa cabinet on the rice  problem, asking: "What has become of the LDP?"    Is the predicament not the same as that of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which repeatedly resorted to  such tactics as boycotting deliberations and ox-walks during its  days as an opposition party? Where has the determination of the  LDP, which had professed that it would become a responsible  opposition party, gone? That sort of sense of despair is  spreading in economic circles.  <H5>  Liabilities From the Days of LDP-Controlled Government </H5>   "Mr. Hosokawa is an amateur, and it is about time for him to  give up." "The time has come for professionals to work out  emergency economic measures. The LDP has to go out to take  charge." These are the recent words of former Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone.    Political reform, rice problems, and sluggish business  conditions are liabilities left over from the days of the  LDP-led governments. The majority of people are undoubtedly  aware of this fact, and say that such posturing is too indulgent  on the part of the LDP.    For the time being, the LDP is determined to refuse to  respond to deliberations on political reform bills at the House  of Councillors, in opposition to the extension of the Diet  session. Should such a situation continue, however, there is a  strong possibility that the public desertion from the LDP will  accelerate.    Not only will the LDP face a predicament, but cracks in the  SDPJ position will further widen.    SDPJ Diet members opposing electoral reform, a crucial  element of political reform, were conspicuous in demanding their  party's secession from the coalition regime by adamantly  opposing opening markets when problems concerning the rice issue  arose.    They seemed to have intended to kill the political reform  bills by using the rice problem as leverage.    Against this background, reform-minded young Diet members  were reported to have seriously debated leaving the SDPJ if it  ever broke away from the coalition.    One such young Diet member said: "Because of the  complications involving rice, it became clear to me that I can  no longer stay with the SDPJ. If a chance ever arises, I will  leave the party."    About the party convention the SDPJ is to hold on 11 and 12  January, a rumor similar to the following has been circulating:  "At the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama will retire, and  for that position, Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi is  expected to be recommended."    It seems most unlikely that Mr. Yokoyama will want to go  along with the proposal, since he is said to be attempting to  organize a new political party. Such a rumor reflects the fact  that Murayama and his executives have lost their unifying force.  <H5>  Recovery of Reliance Sought by Materializing Reform </H5>   By deciding to extend its session for 45 days until 29  January, calm temporarily returned to the Diet, where the matter  of opening markets to rice imports and whether or not to extend  the session were simultaneously discussed.    With the extension of the Diet session, the LDP and the SDPJ  both survived fears that they would disintegrate during the past  year. But this amounts to nothing more than putting off finding  solutions to problems to a later day. Cracks spreading in the  positions of both parties are likely to bring about splitting  the parties in connection with whether or not to adopt political  reform bills to be voted on at the end of January.    Komeito's Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa said: "After  many twists and turns, the bills will be passed after all."    Against the LDP's heightened insistence on emphasizing  measures to deal with business conditions, Shinseito's chief  secretary Ichiro Ozawa noted that he thinks early realization of  political reform is indispensable to overcoming recession,  saying: "It is like putting the cart before the horse to say the  recession problem must be settled prior to political reform."    At an "emergency general meeting with both coalition and  opposition Diet members" held on 14 December by a private ad hoc  commission on administrative reform, a young Diet member said:  "As a precondition for implementing policies that will be  accompanied by sufferings of the people, it is necessary to gain  popular support. For that purpose, the materialization of  political reform is a duty of Diet members."    On 16 December, the day after the decision to extend the  Diet  session was reached, the average stock price of the First  Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose from the previous day  by 300 yen. This seems to indicate market expectation of  political stability.    There is no guarantee, however, of a smooth deliberation at  the House of Councillors, which is said "to maintain intact the  1955 order." Different from the House of Representatives, the  upper house is controlled by both the LDP and the SDPJ, and  quite a few SDPJ members oppose the bills currently being  proposed.  <H5>  Frontal Breakthrough Eyed in Accordance With Article 59 </H5>   Close associates of Mr. Ozawa said: "All means imaginable  are  being prepared to cope with all kinds of situations in the upper  house." One is a frontal breakthrough, in accordance with  Article 59 of the Constitution, which says that a failure of the  House of Councillors to take final action within sixty days  after receipt of a bill passed by the House of Representatives  "may be determined by the House of Representatives to constitute  a rejection of the said bill by the House of Councillors."    In that case, the bill can become law by passing it a second  time in the lower house by a two-thirds majority or more of the  members present or by calling for a joint committee meeting  comprising both Houses.    Although it is difficult to obtain a two-thirds majority in  the lower house, the possibility of a bill being passed will be  high if the bill is referred to a joint committee of both  Houses, because it can then become law by obtaining a simple  majority of both Houses.    Since the political reform bills passed through the lower  house on 18 November, the 60th day falls on 16 January. On and  after the next day, 17 January, such "surprise moves" can be  used.    The magic of this move is to refer the bill to the lower  house for a second deliberation. It is based on the calculation  that once the bill is returned to the lower house, the House can  be easily dissolved when the bill is threatened to be shelved,  although it is difficult to dissolve the lower house on grounds  that the upper house is delaying the deliberation.    But actions relying on Article 59 may invite criticism that  "the House of Councillors are robbed of the right to deliberate  on bills, thus neglecting the upper house." In the postwar  history of the Diet, only one precedent can be found, in 1952,  when the wage bill for Maritime Safety Agency employees was  passed by a joint committee of both Houses.    The coalition ruling parties are considering these plans  because they want to expedite upper house deliberations by  threatening that they may take such firm actions.    Simultaneous secret maneuvers to undermine the solidarity of  the upper house LDP members are underway. Those close to Mr.  Ozawa are confident that "the LDP members of the House of  Councillors will incline toward the ruling parties if the  Hosokawa regime maintains high support ratings and increases its  stability, because many of the LDP members are former  bureaucrats."    Former Minister of Labor Masakuni Murakami, a LDP member of  the House of Councillors, pointed out that the upper house  deliberation may be difficult for the time being because the  Diet session was extended high-handedly. He added: "It must not  maintain inertial continuation of the 1955 order." "Since the  upper house is intended to control as well as compliment the  lower one, ways may be found to amend the bills."    As for amendments, it is suggested that the distribution of  seats in both single-member election districts and proportional  representation districts be reviewed and that proportional  districts from the national district be changed to several  blocks.  <H5>  Problems Converge Again at the End of January </H5>   The Hosokawa regime plans to launch measures to boost  economic conditions by large-scale tax cuts and the third  supplementary budget bill, simultaneously expediting  deliberation of the bills.    On the other hand, it embraces the problem of raising  consumption tax rates as possible sources of revenue to fill the  gap created by tax cuts.    The SDPJ strongly opposes the consumption tax raise.  Therefore, it intends to put off the formation of next year's  budget bill until next year in order not to be entangled with  deliberations on political reform.    "The Hosokawa regime is on the brink of falling, without  chance of recovery, because it is obsessed with three  falsehoods." The LDP's former Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications Junichiro Koizumi points out that the present  regime will reach an impasse after all because of the three  difficulties: the partial opening of the market to rice imports;  failure to legislate political reform bills before the year end;  and the 100 million-yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin to the prime  minister himself.    The LDP currently clings to a hope of regaining power, which  remains nothing more than a wish.    However, Prime Minister Hosokawa cannot evade taking  responsibility if the bills fail to pass, because the Diet  session was extended on grounds of materializing political  reform.    It is unmistakably clear that the political situation will  become tense in late January, when a number of problems converge  at a time when deliberation of the bills reaches a climax.</p>

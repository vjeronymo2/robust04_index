			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER POSTS LOSS; MORE GM PLANTS MAY SHUT;  </P> <P> AUTOS: THE NO. 3 CAR MAKER ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $214 MILLION IN RED INK.  ANALYSTS SAY GM COULD WRITE OFF $1 BILLION TO CLOSE 11 FACILITIES, INCLUDING  VAN NUYS, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.  </P> <P> Stepping up a drumbeat of sobering economic news from the automobile industry,  Chrysler Corp. reported a $214-million quarterly loss Monday while General  Motors Corp. laid plans for broad-based plant closings affecting tens of  thousands of workers.  </P> <P> Chrysler's heavy loss was actually smaller than expected, but the red ink  underscored the auto maker's vulnerability to the current economic climate and  to sales pressure from both Japanese and U.S.-based competitors.  </P> <P> The Chrysler loss, though, could seem small by comparison to GM's third-quarter  bottom line if the biggest U.S. auto maker takes the huge writeoff against  earnings Wednesday that some analysts are expecting.  </P> <P> The auto giant summoned analysts to a New York meeting to hear what a spokesman  called "significant" news shortly before it is to report its three-month  financial results.  </P> <P> GM wouldn't elaborate, but some analysts believe that it will set aside up to  $1 billion to cover the costs of permanently closing four assembly plants. The  plants -- in Michigan, Missouri, Massachusetts and Georgia -- have been  "temporarily" closed for many months. They previously employed about 10,000  workers.  </P> <P> "I believe they will finally acknowledge reality," said Anne Knight, analyst at  Paine Webber.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, trade publications reported that GM has boosted to 11 the number of  car and truck assembly plants it will close in November and December for up to  a month because of poor sales. Some 35,000 workers will be temporarily laid  off.  </P> <P> As part of the temporary closings, GM's plant in Van Nuys is to shut down for  two weeks starting Nov. 5.  </P> <P> The cutbacks mean GM will build about 154,000 fewer vehicles than planned in  the quarter, a drop of 15%.  </P> <P> The downbeat reports from Detroit are only partly due to the recent negative  economic developments in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis. Overall car sales  have been slumping for nearly two years, and the domestic auto makers have been  getting a shrinking share of those sales.  </P> <P> But the downturn in consumer confidence and leap in the price of gasoline have  delayed an expected sales recovery and cut directly into sales of trucks. This  has worsened a major overcapacity problem at GM, whose decade-long loss in  market share has left it with too many plants.  </P> <P> And the truck falloff has been especially damaging to Chrysler's all-important  Jeep and minivan sales.  </P> <P> Though overall U.S. car sales have held up better than expected since the Aug.  2 invasion of Kuwait, Chrysler sold 21% fewer vehicles in the July-September  period than a year earlier. Revenue tumbled 15% to $6.5 billion.  </P> <P> Chrysler blamed its woes partly on the high cost of rebates -- upward of $1,200  per vehicle -- and on the production loss of some 56,000 minivans during  factory changes to build 1991 models. Such production hiccups during new-model  changeover normally make the third quarter the worst for auto firms.  </P> <P> "We didn't anticipate the Gulf crisis, the federal budget fiasco or the  continued escalation in the incentive wars," said Chairman Lee A. Iacocca.  </P> <P> However, Chrysler's earnings were some 25% higher than forecast by analysts at  Shearson Lehman Bros., Barclays de Zoete Wedd and other investment houses. The  company's finance subsidiary reported record earnings, though that performance  was overwhelmed by Chrysler's sagging car and truck sales. Chrysler has lost  nearly 2 percentage points of market share in the past year.  </P> <P> Chrysler issued the bleak earnings report in the midst of its contract  negotiations with the United Auto Workers. The union said Monday that it would  continue bargaining at least until Thursday's scheduled meeting of a worker  council. The auto company says it can't afford to match the contract terms the  UAW recently obtained from GM and Ford Motor Co.  </P> <P> David Healy, an analyst at Barclays, expects GM's third-quarter earnings to  drop to $377 million from the year-earlier $517 million, not counting any  writeoffs due to plant closings. Analyst Knight thinks the writeoff will be in  the $1-billion range, putting GM deeply into the red.  </P> <P> The four plants expected to be formally shut down have, until now, been  categorized as "temporarily" closed because of language in GM's old union  contract that ostensibly prohibited plant closings. Most GM observers believe  that the company wants to close additional plants as well, and it is unclear  whether the UAW-GM contract signed in September has any meaningful obstacles to  more shutdowns.  </P> <P> High on the list of vulnerable plants is the Van Nuys assembly plant, which is  to lose the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird to a Canadian plant in 1992  and hasn't been assigned anything else to build.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GM Plant Closures  </P> <P> General Motors will temporarily shut down 11 car and truck plants for one to  four weeks beginning Nov. 5. The Flint, Mich., truck plant closed Monday for  four weeks and will eliminate a shift indefinitely on Jan. 2 About 37,000  workers will be affected at the 12 factories. GM is expected to announce  Wednesday that four other plants, mothballed for several months, are being  permanently closed. Those plants employed 10,000 workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary closures  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P> Fairfax  </P> <P> Oklahoma City  </P> <P> Flint  </P> <P> Pontiac  </P> <P> Scarborough  </P> <P> Fort Wayne  </P> <P> Bowling Green  </P> <P> Lordstown  </P> <P> Wilmington  </P> <P> Tarrytown  </P> <P> </P> <P> Permanent closures  </P> <P> Leeds  </P> <P> Pontiac  </P> <P> Framingham  </P> <P> Lakewood  </P> <P> Sources: Automobile News, Ward's Automotive Report  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chrysler: In The Red Again  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. annual profit/loss. . .  </P> <P> billions of dollars  </P> <P> </P> <P> and third-quater earnings  </P> <P> millions of dollars  </P> <P> '89: $331 million  </P> <P> '90: ($214 million)  </P></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Failure to deliver what Russians most require (1) Sir, Once again a big new effort is to be made to give aid to Russia. The problem surely is that it is not promises of aid which have been wanting. It is the delivery which is at fault. According to the European Community's court of auditors, the Community, for example, voted aid of Ecu835m (Pounds 689m) for 1991; a further Ecu1.75bn (Pounds 1.44bn) was voted in loans and guarantees. Yet by December 31 1992, none of this money had been paid out. According to a senior official in the EC unit dealing with Russian aid, the unit prefers to work with non-profit-making bodies such as academic institutions and charities. This is fine for developing capitalist theories of government, but it is scarcely going to produce the working free-market economy which the west wants and the Russian government needs. I am a non-executive director of a company which has had a technical assistance agreement with a former Russian ministry for 18 months. We have been told that our Russian partners are not entitled to aid from the EC with which to purchase this technical assistance because their sphere of activity 'does not fit' the categories chosen by the EC for aid, despite the fact that one of the categories is human resources training. The Russians are attempting to find work outside Russia with which to earn much-needed foreign currency. The ministry has (or had) a highly-skilled workforce of 800,000. Is this really the best the Community can do? Elizabeth Jones 9 The Terraces, Garner St, London E29AQ</p>

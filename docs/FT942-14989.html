			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No call for state funding Sir, Your leading article, 'Paying for parties (April 14), on the report of the home affairs select committee on the funding of political parties, claims that the Labour minority called for state funding. It then goes on to criticise us for doing so. In fact our minority report makes no reference to state funding except to say that we do not intend to discuss it. Chris Mullin, House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A-levels fail the test of time Britain's A-level examinations, increasingly regarded as a curiosity by the rest of the world, have remained untouched during the past six years, while every other aspect of the school system in England and Wales has been subjected to radical reform. The furious reaction from employers' organisations which greeted last week's A-level results will, with luck, finally convince the government that they need reform. Such reform will be at least six years too late. The precipitate fall in the numbers taking maths and science has aroused the greatest ire among employers. The decline in both maths and physics was more than five per cent for the second year running, while the numbers with the combination of subjects needed for most university science and engineering courses has dropped by 40 per cent in a decade. The employers who claim to be so angered by this might consider whether one explanation for the unpopularity of science degrees lies in the pay signals they themselves provide. But they are right to say that A-levels have exacerbated the problem. By forcing 16-year-olds to choose only three subjects, A-levels entrench specialisation. They make it impossible to gain a sound grounding in the sciences without abandoning arts and the humanities altogether - a step many students are understandably reluctant to take. Gold standard The government's defence, that A-levels are an 'educational gold standard', is weak. No system which allows 16-year-olds to drop sciences or languages altogether can be called 'golden' by any standards. However, A-levels have some features worth preserving. They are widely respected, despite the sharp improvement in pass rates of the past few years; they are rigorous; and they are independently assessed. Useful reform can be achieved without compromising any of these virtues. Slimming A-level syllabuses so that five subjects becomes a feasible norm for each candidate offers the simplest and most effective way to do this. The level of academic rigour would remain the same in each case. Academics believe that a five A-level system could be implemented by cutting the content of each syllabus by 20 per cent, and by reforming the sixth-form timetable so that students spend more time in lessons. Mixed economy With five subjects, sixth-formers could maintain an interest in arts and literature while taking the mathematics and two sciences needed to keep a science degree as a viable option. It would also be easier to operate a 'mixed economy' of traditional academic A-levels and vocational qualifications. The government currently hopes that students will consider taking A-levels alongside the new General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ). Dubbed the 'Vocational A-level' by former education secretary Mr John Patten, a GNVQ is intended to be equal in value to two A-levels. The problem is that it is difficult to take the current unwieldy A-levels alongside a GNVQ. With slimmed syllabuses and five subjects as the norm, however, students could take three A-levels on top of their vocational training. A further worthwhile reform would bring vocational qualifications within the A-level framework, provided they were subjected to a similar level of rigorous external assessment as academic A-levels. But the chief virtue of this plan is that it needs only incremental changes to the system already in place. This is far preferable to the seismic change which was involved in introducing the national curriculum. Why has the government held back? Sheer embarrassment may be part of the problem. A five A-level system was first proposed by the Higginson report, commissioned by Mr Kenneth Baker when education secretary in 1987. It is still endorsed by universities. But the then prime minister, Mrs Thatcher, promptly rejected its findings when it was published, and it has been gathering dust for six years. It is now plain that failure to implement the report's proposals at the time was a grievous mistake. But if the government continues to avoid taking action, it will only compound its error.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Tequila sunset Emerging markets enthusiasts have been faced with the prospect of a nightmare before Christmas. The Mexican devaluation set off a whiff of panic that spread from central America all the way to Argentina. With hindsight, the Mexican devaluation seems inevitable. The country funded its huge current account deficit through capital from abroad, especially the US. Foreign investors were content to provide funds as long as they ran no currency risk - the peso was pegged to the US dollar - and Mexican interest rates were double those in the US. But a combination of higher US rates and Mexican political crises reversed the flow of funds. With the government's limited foreign currency reserves quickly running out, the logical response was a devaluation capable of correcting the deficit by cutting imports and boosting exports. The theory of devaluation was economically justified, but poorly executed. The subsequent debacle threatens to scatter six years of stability to the winds. Overseas investors have taken a bath. While the equity market may have weathered yesterday better than expected, the peso's fall knocked another 10 per cent off the value of foreign investors' portfolios. Future prospects are not rosy. Corporate earnings in the final quarter will suffer from increased financial charges on their dollar debt, while economic growth could slow because of increased interest rates. Bargain hunters may return once the currency has stabilised, but bruised investors may well conclude Latin America remains as unreliable as ever.</p>

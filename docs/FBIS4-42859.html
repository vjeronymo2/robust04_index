			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Vegar: "F-16: United States Dictates Rules </F> of the Deal to Portugal"]    [Text] The Portuguese Government did not have any  money, and it wanted 20 F-16 fighter planes. The United States  gave it the money and dictated the rules. Then the United States  lent the money and took over the game. Finally, Fernando  Nogueira is asking for counterpart deals, but the manufacturer  is holding all the trump cards. The game is almost over, and the  government is losing.    The 20 F-16 fighters are vital to the defense and  sovereignty  of Portugal. As one Portuguese Air Force general lucidly  explained, "those aircraft are an attribute of sovereignty in  peacetime, in times of crisis, and in wartime. The simple reason  is that it is essential that Portugal know who is using its  airspace, that it have the means to deny access to that airspace  if it wants to, and, mainly, that all countries know that it is  capable of denying entry into our airspace."    In the name of that attribute of sovereignty, Portugal is  standing by with eyes on the ground and letting the United  States dictate all the rules of a two-way deal--with immediate  financial and industrial harm, elimination of its own will, and  abandonment of its original objectives as the result--and now it  is doing the same with Lockheed, the firm that manufactures the  aircraft. And all because of a powerful lack of political clout,  according to what is being whispered in Lisbon and said aloud in  Washington, D.C.    The deal began in August 1990 with the signing of the  contract between Portugal, represented by the Ministry of  Defense; the United States, represented by the USAF (U.S. Air  Force); and the manufacturer, General Dynamics (which Lockheed  bought in 1992). Quantity: 20 aircraft. Type: F-16A, Block 15  (the most advanced version of type A), all brand-new. Price:  $400 million (60 million contos).    Source of the money: the U.S. Administration. The fact that  Portugal does not have 60 million contos with which to buy the  F-16's has been a crucial issue throughout the deal. First of  all, because the Portuguese Government was required to buy the  aircraft from a U.S. manufacturer. Second, because the money was  to be delivered over four consecutive fiscal years (1990 to  1994) in exchange for American use of the Lajes Base in the  Azores. The only problem is that when it comes to business, the  Americans put their own interests in first, second, and third  place. The United States regarded the money as foreign aid being  granted to Portugal, not as payment for the use of Lajes. In  other words, the Portuguese Government did not insist on  acceptance of its argument that it was receiving the money in  exchange for something of value to the United States. The  Americans prevailed with the idea that they were helping  Portugal. A lot.    The result was that Portugal never even considered demanding  counterpart deals from Lockheed totaling the value of the  purchase, although that is common practice in deals of this kind.    The main argument in defense of that stand by the Portuguese  Ministry of Defense is that U.S. law forbids the negotiation of  counterpart deals when U.S. money being used for the purchase.  But that is not true. Actually, Clinton said--in a statement  made in April 1990 under the title "Policy on Counterpart Deals  for Exports of Military Materiel"--that "no department of the  U.S. Government must be directly involved or involve U.S. firms  in counterpart agreements related to the sale of military  materiel. The U.S. Administration's money must not be used to  finance counterpart deals in transactions involving defense  materiel."    Fine. The only thing is that in that same statement in which  he defends the interests of U.S. firms--as is proper for him to  do--President Clinton is clear to the point of saying that "the  decision to become involved in counterpart deals and the  responsibility for negotiating and implementing counterpart  contracts belongs to the companies involved." Because,  "recognizing the commercial reality of those contracts in a free  market, the President's policy does not restrict the negotiating  rights of U.S. industry when it comes to establishing  counterpart contracts with foreign purchasers of U.S. goods and  services."    The only possible conclusion then, and the one painfully  drawn by Portuguese officials, "is that Portugal lacks the  political clout to impose counterpart deals in the value of $400  million. The United States would not agree, and it would cut off  the financing."    At the very start of the deal, the Portuguese Government  chose to sign a contract with the U.S. Administration rather  than sign one with Lockheed directly. That choice has had  positive and negative consequences.    The department in charge of the sale was the FMS (Foreign  Military Sales), an agency of the USAF.    The reason for that choice, according to what SEMANARIO was  told by a Portuguese officer involved in the acquisition, "is  that the FMS handles all sales and hires all the subcontractors  under a single contract. If we tried to do that ourselves, we  would have to negotiate and sign some 40 contracts, with all the  resulting delays and problems." Obviously, the FMS collects a  small percentage for its services: in this case, 3 percent of  the value of the sale.    At the same time, the FMS operates as a system for  consolidating orders, meaning that it sends the manufacturer  several requisitions under a single "package," a procedure that  theoretically results in lower costs. Portugal was included in  the same "package" as Pakistan and the U.S. Air Force itself. A  few months ago, however, a minor "windstorm" blew that order  down. The United States reduced the size of its order, and for  political reasons, Congress placed an embargo on the sale of  F-16's to Pakistan. Even though it renegotiated and obtained a  reduction in the cost of some items such as spare parts,  Portugal found the price of its aircraft rising by a hefty  600,000 contos.  <H5>  Best of the Cheapest </H5>   But on the other hand, choosing the FMS brought Portugal a  few advantages, specifically in the type of F-16 chosen. These  fighter planes are divided into Type A (up to Block 15) and Type  C (up to Block 50). The C's, which are more advanced  technologically, came about because of a stated need by the U.S.  Air Force to design for itself a fighter with improved ground  attack capability. The C's have more powerful engines and more  weaponry. Portugal ended up with the most advanced model of the  F-16A--the so-called Block 15--because it is cheaper but mainly  because Portugal was able to be included in the EPG (European  Group, comprising Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Holland, which  have F-16's), which is going to design a Middle-Life Upgrading  (MLU) program by 1996. That program will make the F-16A's  technologically equal to the F-16C Block 50's (the current  state-of-the-art version of the F-16), which Greece and Turkey  recently acquired.    Procurement through the FMS also had another benefit for  Portugal. In an effort to cooperate in keeping the price under  $400 million, the Americans made a present of the Pratt &amp;  Whitney engines. Those engines had come from secondhand F-16's,  but they were overhauled and updated on the USAF's assembly  lines along with others for the USAF itself and ended up as  top-of-the-line engines: F100-PW-220E's, the jewel in Pratt &amp;  Whitney's crown. "The best guarantee of quality that we could  have," said someone who has kept tabs on the process.    In November 1992, a figurative bomb exploded on the eighth  floor of the Ministry of Defense, which is where Fernando  Nogueira has his office. Because Congress had reduced the  defense budget by $267 billion, the United States was  eliminating the military equipment funds being given to Portugal  annually. Three months later, an envoy from the Pentagon visited  Lisbon with a solution in his briefcase: the United States would  lend Portugal the shortfall at 5 percent interest. The  alternative for Portugal was to cancel the purchase or find  other financing. The Portuguese Government made a halfhearted  protest, alleging that the U.S. Administration had not fought  hard enough with Congress, but the noise it made was not very  loud. And Cavaco Silva and Fernando Nogueira even accepted the  loan. The outcome of a vital purchase: $225 million given by the  United States and $90 million granted as a loan in 1993 at 5  percent interest. In 1994 there was another surprise. The  remaining $81 million would be lent to us, but at 6.17 percent  interest. Again, Portugal accepted.    However, with $170 million of its own money (40 percent of  the total purchase) involved, Portugal finally decided to demand  counterpart deals from Lockheed. In the course of 1993, the  Secretariat of State for Defense Technologies (SEETD), headed by  Eugenio Ramos, sent the manufacturer several letters asking it  to negotiate the matter. The only sound heard from Texas, where  Lockheed's offices are located, was the wind whistling across  the prairie. Until November, that is, when the SEETD--in an  action agreed on with Cavaco Silva's office and the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs--sent a tough letter warning Lockheed that  Portugal would cancel the program if negotiations on counterpart  deals were not started.  <H5>  Lockheed Offers Very Little </H5>   It did not take the Americans long to cross the Atlantic,  but  the first meeting was not held until a week after Eugenio  Ramos--who had been directly in charge of the matter--had  resigned his post.    Obviously aiming low, Lockheed put $18 million on the table.  Its proposal was rejected by the Portuguese. First of all  because, as is true in any deal of this kind, they were entitled  to demand 100 percent of the purchase value in counterpart  deals. Second, because a cabinet decision approved in 1987  requires that very thing. Inexplicably, however, Fernando  Nogueira went to Texas in February to accept the first two  aircraft. As an adviser involved in the deal says, "Portugal  weakened its negotiating position by accepting the aircraft. It  should not have done so until all the negotiations were  concluded." Lockheed had stated at a meeting in January that it  would not go beyond $42 million worth of counterpart deals, as  SEMANARIO reported exclusively in March.    For its part, Portugal wants $90 million. Oddly, the  argument  used by the Ministry of Defense is that that is the amount being  received by Lockheed. But that is not true. What is really  happening is that Lockheed has hired a number of  subcontractors--several dozen of them--as is usually the case  when "complex machines" such as the F-16 are being manufactured.  To mention just the main ones, Westinghouse is supplying the  radar, McDonnell Douglas the injection system, Linton the laser,  General Electric the cannon, and the TEC the video system, while  the EPG is supplying 20 components of the aircraft structure  itself. However, Lockheed is responsible for hiring those  subcontractors and sharing the profits, so Portugal is fully  justified in demanding counterpart deals corresponding to the  sales amount that will be collected by the prime manufacturer.  SEMANARIO has learned exactly how the cake will be divided up:  $240 million for Lockheed and $160 million for the FMS.    By using Lockheed's isolated share of the profits as its  reference point, the Portuguese Government is unquestionably  lowering its own stake. In terms of Lockheed's $240 million and  in terms of the $171 million that Portugal will have to pay out.  And as experts involved in the negotiations unhesitatingly  admit, "between the $42 million being offered by Lockheed and  the $90 million being demanded by the Portuguese, the  negotiations are going to lead to some figure in between, as is  natural." The difference adds up to quite a few million dollars  that a weak industry cannot afford to throw away.  <H5>  Counterpart Deals Are Essential </H5>   When complex equipment as marketable as the F-16 is being  acquired, counterpart deals are absolutely essential to the  purchaser. The main counterpart deals in this case involve  technology transfer, future subcontracts for Portuguese firms  enabling them to manufacture and repair aircraft components, and  the purchase of goods and services in Portugal. A memorandum  presented by Lockheed and based on the $42 million being  proposed by that firm--it will soon be discussed in Lisbon at  the same time that the negotiations are being concluded--names  the Portuguese Air Force, the EID [expansion not given],  Edisoft, and TAP [Portuguese Airways] as the main beneficiaries  of the counterpart deals.    There is no doubt that Portugal needs the F-16's. There is  no  doubt that it ought to have conducted the negotiations  differently from the start. A clearheaded Portuguese general  puts it all very clearly: "We should have come up with the money  ourselves. We could have said what we wanted and gotten all the  manufacturers to do what they promised. We could have chosen the  best." Exactly.</p>

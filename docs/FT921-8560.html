			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (6): US withdrawal raises questions - Foreign Relations 'WE won't stay where we're not wanted, and if they want us out, we're gone.' So said Mr Dick Cheney, US Defence Secretary, after the Philippines Senate voted in September against a new 10-year treaty which would have allowed the US continued use of the Subic Bay naval base. The Senate's momentous decision means that the last US personnel should have left Subic by December 31 this year, ending nearly a century of American occupation of the deep-water harbour some 80km north-west of Manila. The nearby Clark air base was abandoned in the middle of the treaty negotiations after Mount Pinatubo erupted and smothered the facilities in ash. Many Filipinos, even those who opposed US bases on their soil because of genuine feelings of nationalism or a desire to score political points, have yet to grasp that the Americans are really leaving. But the Americans, who took control of the Philippines by defeating the Spanish in 1898 and established the Subic base three years later, are no longer so anxious to keep a costly military presence on the islands now that the Soviet Union has collapsed and their own budget deficit has grown so large. The economic and social impact of the American withdrawal from Subic, the supply base and repair yard for the 7th Fleet, will be substantial. Some 40,000 Filipinos stand to lose their jobs and direct US aid to the military and to civilian programmes is certain to fall from the current annual level of about Pounds 400m. The indirect effects are harder to quantify, but the Subic Bay town of Olongapo, its streets crammed with bars and prostitutes, is already feeling the pinch as the US servicemen depart. One western diplomat estimates that the US bases were putting Dollars 1bn into the economy every year, while the country's annual exports amount to only about Dollars 8bn. 'That's a lot of foreign exchange to let go in 18 months,' he says. But Mr Jose Cuisia, the central bank governor, remains sanguine. 'It's significant,' he says. 'But it's not going to mean the end of the Philippines either.' According to one school of thought, the Filipinos bungled the negotiations with the Americans by dithering for too long and demanding too high a price. But they could hardly have foreseen the eruption of Mt Pinatubo - which took Clark out of the equation - and even if a deal had been struck before the volcanic disaster successive US administrations would have been hard pressed to secure funds from Congress each year in exchange for a defunct air base covered in ash. In any case, the political confusion over the bases in the Philippines had as much to do with the country's schizophrenic attitude towards its former colonial masters as with greed. Filipino commentators are apt to criticise US involvement in the country (on nationalist grounds) in the same breath as asking for more assistance (on the basis of the longstanding ties between the two peoples). The close relationship, albeit weakened by the rejection of the new treaty, will certainly continue. A mutual defence pact dating from 1952 and providing for joint military exercises remains in force. American culture has permeated the Philippine islands; about 1m Filipinos live in the US and thousands of Americans are resident in the Philippines. For the workers at Subic and the towns around the bay, the most immediate concern is the future of the port and the 5,800 hectares which make up the base. Here too the government was slow to react, suggesting at first that the issue could be addressed by the new administration due to take over after the May elections. Local residents, and the Americans who are packing up their movable equipment and leaving, convinced President Corazon Aquino's outgoing government to start dealing with the problem before the voters went to the polls. Clark air base, after all, was handed over to the military and looted after the Americans left. Spurred on by the energetic mayor of Olongapo, Mr Richard Gordon, officials are airing proposals for a free port and talking hopefully of 'a new Hong Kong', but it remains to be seen whether such ideas will ever come to fruition. Residents are furious not only because the Senate rejected the 10-year treaty, but also because the Americans were told to leave within one year instead of three. 'Our mission is first to preserve, conserve and maintain the resources we have on base,' says Mrs Boots Ligsay, a training supervisor at Subic and spokeswoman for a movement promoting the 'Autonomous Region of Greater Olongapo' (Argo). 'It's a good one, and we don't want it to become another Clark. Subic Bay can be a free port and the base workers are willing to invest their hard-earned savings.' Mr Gordon, citing the sentimental value of American 'work experience and sexual experience' in Olongapo, believes he, rather than the unsympathetic officials in Manila, can persuade the Americans to leave some of their more valuable pieces of equipment behind. He is adamant about the need for the conversion of the base to commercial use. 'I think if the base leaves and there is nothing, you're going to see some social unrest,' he says. Unfortunately, the Americans seem inclined to take away the valuable floating dry-docks used for ship repair. And although the Subic workers have many of the necessary skills for commercial shipyard operations, they will be competing with established yards in neighbouring countries. Subic, western diplomats say, was ideal for the US Navy because it was a 'one-stop shop' allowing for replenishment, training in conjunction with Clark, rest and recreation, and repairs. Commercial ship repair alone might not be viable. In the meantime, the US departure from the Philippines will leave the country in a weak position with regard to its Asian neighbours. The armed forces are poorly equipped, often unprofessional and preoccupied with politics, while the economy is lagging behind those of the other south-east Asian countries. Slowly but surely the influence of the Japanese, who occupied the country with notable cruelty during the Second World War before they were driven out by the Americans, is making itself felt. Japan is the country's largest aid donor and the source of much foreign investment. Young Filipinos are largely unaffected by their parents' memories of the war. No longer can the foreign policy of the Philippines be concerned almost exclusively with the US. 'The Filipinos are going to have to take some very significant foreign policy decisions,' says one diplomat in Manila. 'What is their relationship with Asean? To what extent to they want to maintain a US defence relationship? How are they going to deal with the Japanese?' Already, in between the brothels and the American hamburger joints in downtown Manila, the Karaoke bars are spreading as the US sailors head home from Subic.</p>

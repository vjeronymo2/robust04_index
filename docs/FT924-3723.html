			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Wrong line I LIVE in Kent, and work in London. I have a second house in Middlesex, which I am renting to others. I bought a rail and underground ticket for a year. This ticket is being used to go to work and pay a weekly visit to the second house. I want to claim a quarter of the cost of the ticket from the tax I am due to pay from the house rent. Will the tax office allow this? If the house is let unfurnished, the answer to question one is no. If the house is let furnished, the answer is still really no. Although a taxpayer recently won an appeal before the General Commissioners in respect of the cost of travelling from Surrey to Manchester, where he let accommodation to students, it is most unlikely that you would be similarly successful, even if the commissioners' decision is not disturbed in the high court. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

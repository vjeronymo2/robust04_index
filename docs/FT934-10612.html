			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's trusts find favour with institutions LLOYD'S investment trusts issuing prospectuses yesterday reported strong backing from institutional investors for their plans to raise corporate capital for the insurance market. Two of the funds - CLM Insurance Fund and Masthead Insurance Underwriting - scaled down the size of their capital raising efforts because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient capacity on 'good quality' Lloyd's syndicates. The London Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit), sponsored by Samuel Montagu and James Capel, successfully raised Pounds 280m for a fund which will provide Pounds 480m in capacity for 98 syndicates. Sir Laurie Magnus, a director of Samuel Montagu, said: 'It's firmly in the bag'. The issue was fully subscribed, although Pounds 70m was placed subject to a clawback provision which will allow Limit to satisfy applications under the retail offer. CLM Insurance Fund, which is supported by Sedgwick Group and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, placed 80m shares and offered a further 30m shares for subscription in an issue designed to raise a net Pounds 105.7m. CLM scaled down its plans to raise up to Pounds 200m because of problems in finding sufficient capacity on good quality Lloyd's syndicates. Lord Rees, chairman, said the 'the fund was large enough to provide a good spread of syndicates across a range of leading managing agents - yet small enough to ensure we can be selective on behalf of our corporate members.' Masthead Insurance Underwriting, an investment company sponsored by Hambros Bank, said it had fully placed an issue designed to raise Pounds 43m with institutional investors. Masthead is providing Pounds 75m in capacity for between 20 and 25 syndicates. 'We are delighted with the support we have received from institutional investors,' said Sir Jeffrey Bowman, chairman. Institutions would have supported the Pounds 50m offer originally intended by Masthead. This had been scaled down to take into account the 'availability of underwriting capacity of the requisite quality,' added Sir Jeffrey.</p>

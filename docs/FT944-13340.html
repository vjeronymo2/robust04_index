			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Syrian talks make progress, says Clinton: Israelis disappointed at meeting with Assad US president Bill Clinton said yesterday he had made significant progress in talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria aimed at edging Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations forward. But the Israeli foreign ministry described the Clinton-Assad meeting as a 'great disappointment' and said Mr Clinton had boosted Mr Assad's prestige in the Middle East by his visit but had come away empty-handed. After four hours of talks with the Syrian president in Damascus, Mr Clinton said he had made progress but was not free to discuss the details. He said Mr Assad's remarks yesterday, in which he pledged to 'hasten the march of peace', went beyond anything he had said before. 'Syria has made a strategic choice for peace with Israel. Syria is ready to commit itself to the requirements of peace for the long term, to transform the region from a state of war to a state of peace, and to allow Arab and Israeli to live in security, prosperity and stability,' Mr Clinton said in a speech to the Israeli parliament last night. 'I believe something is changing in Syria. Its leaders understand that it is time to make peace. There will be still a good deal of hard bargaining before a breakthrough but they are serious about proceeding . . . We will walk with you on the road to Damascus for peace with security.' Israeli officials, however, said Mr Assad had merely restated Syria's hardline position demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and had embarrassed the US president by saying that no US official had ever proved Syrian involvement in an act of international terror. 'For us the visit would have been a success if Clinton had been able to broker direct talks between our foreign minister and the Syrian foreign minister,' said a senior Israeli foreign ministry official. 'The least we expected was something firm about terrorism.' Mr Clinton said later he regretted that Mr Assad had not taken the opportunity to publicly condemn acts of terror against Israelis. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said that although Mr Clinton had brought no breakthrough, Israel would not be discouraged and would continue to be patient and determined and pursue any avenue which remained open to reach peace with Syria and Lebanon. Diplomats said Mr Assad was happy that Mr Clinton had renewed US commitment to an Israeli withdrawal from all land occupied in the West Bank, Arab East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. But Mr Rabin warned: 'Jerusalem is not open for negotiations. It is not a matter for bargaining . . . Jerusalem was and will be the eternal capital of the state of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty - the beating heart of the Jewish people.' Mr Clinton had to cancel his scheduled walkabout around Jerusalem in the face of Palestinian opposition. Clinton supports Mideast bank, Page 4 Discreet intermediary, Page 19</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Export orders for French  weaponry fell by 12.5 percent in 1993, the Defence Ministry said  Tuesday [5 April].    The French armaments industry sold around 40 billion French  francs (6.9 billion dollars) of military hardware in 1993  compared to 45.7 billion French francs (7.89 billion dollars) in  1992, it said.    The fall means the arms industry must increase foreign sales  by 20 percent in 1994 if it is to meet the target set by Defence  Minister Francois Leotard to earn over 50 billion French francs  (8.63 billion dollars) in each of 1994 and 1995.    Recent statistics show wide fluctuations in the industry's  performance. Its most successful year goes back to 1984 when it  received orders from abroad worth 61.8 billion French francs  (10.67 billion dollars).    This fell to just 20 billion francs (3.45 billion dollars)  in  1989 before rising again to 33.4 billion francs (5.77 billion  dollars) in 1990 and 34.2 billion francs (5.91 billion dollars)  in 1991.    The biggest order the French arms industry received in 1992  was one for 60 Mirage 2000-5 planes from Taiwan worth 30 billion  French francs (5.18 billion dollars), while in 1993 436 Leclerc  tanks were sold to the United Arab Emirates for 22 billion  French francs (3.8 billion dollars).</p>

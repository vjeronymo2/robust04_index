			<p>BFN     [Text] JURMALA, Jun 08, BNS - Latvia's foreign policy must  remain the same after resignation of Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said Tuesday at  a press conference.    Birkavs stressed that the Saeima's [parliament] Latvian Way  faction and the leading coalition must consider the appointing  of a new foreign minister.    The new minister has rights to appoint his state ministers  and the parliamentary secretary, said Birkavs.    Presently Gunars Meierovics, Olgerts Pavlovskis and Martins  Virsis still occupy their posts.    Birkavs refused to name any concrete candidate to the post  of  the foreign minister.    Birkavs noted that, while he is performing the duties of the  foreign minister, he wanted to make several important steps in  the ministry's work because coordination of the Foreign  Ministry's activities with other ministries' work is needed.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 11 April Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in  Indonesian on page 5 reported that the recently established East  Asian Growth Area [EAGA] encompassing the eastern region of  Indonesia, the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, Brunei,  and the Mindanao islands of the Philippines--is expected to  increase Indonesia's exports from its eastern region. Marketing  agricultural commodities from North Sulawesi to Mindanao will be  easier, according to Minister for Trade and Industry Hartarto,  and transportation cost for exports to Japan and South Korea  will be reduced because of the accessiblity of the northern sea  lanes instead of going through the traditional route of the  Strait of Malacca or Singapore. Minister Hartarto stated that  EAGA may eventually even serve as a gateway for trade in Asia  and the Pacific region. Hartarto added that the government will  establish incentives to encourage businessmen to develop the  area, and local governments will be given full authority to work  with the private sector.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move to ease EC business burden A DRIVE to reduce the burdens on business imposed by European Community directives was announced yesterday by Mr John Major as part of his government's commitment to deregulation. The prime minister told a London conference that Britain had been 'over-punctilious' in its implementation of some Brussels regulations, sometimes adding its own national rules. He said the deregulation unit set up by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, would include EC directives in its proposed scrutiny of all Whitehall regulation and licensing arrangements that add to the costs of industry. The government planned to involve the private sector in the scrutiny. Every government department has been told to put forward by the end of this year suggestions for the repeal or simplification of such rules. Proposals will be considered by the cabinet in February. Mr Major said increased scrutiny of the government's implementation of Brussels regulations would coincide with its efforts at the Edinburgh summit to give substance to the idea of subsidiarity by identifying EC legislation that might be repealed outright. Speaking to the conference on 'Service for the Citizen', the prime minister underlined his commitment to pressing ahead with the Citizen's Charter, in spite of criticisms among the 'articulate and the powerful'. Mr Major said many of the critics were drawn from the privileged few who were able to ensure that they received the best from public services. His charter was aimed at those unable to work the system. Mr Major insisted that those services - notably British Rail - which failed to meet the targets in their respective charters would not be allowed to lower their sights.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Free annual report service THE FINANCIAL TIMES has launched a new service for private investors who would like to receive the annual reports of listed companies. Readers wanting companies' annual or interim report can now use a single telephone number to obtain them, free. The key to the new service is the London Share Service pages of the FT, the last two inside pages of the second section. Here's how the service works: 1. Look up the company name. Companies are arranged by industry sector. Those companies for which the service is available are marked with an ace-of-clubs symbol after the company name. At the moment, 130 listed companies have agreed to join the service. Companies which have already joined include Bank of Scotland, Hanson, National Power, Smithkline Beecham and Unilever. 2. Turn to the bottom right-hand corner of the London Share Service. In a paragraph headed FT Annual Reports Service you'll find the telephone number for the service and a code you must quote to make use of it. 3. Call the service, give the code, and ask for reports for the companies in which you are interested (only one report per company, please). The lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm on weekdays but there is an answering service at other times. Reports will be sent the next working day, depending on availability. 4. Remember that annual reports only become available a few weeks after the publication of the company's preliminary results. 5. There is no charge for using the service. The telephone call is charged at normal rates.</p>

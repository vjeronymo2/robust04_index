Self-regulation was a burden on the industry which had to be paid for by the public. Mr Darling said the government's silence on the need for a regulatory overhaul was 'astonishing'. He said the 'revelation' that up to 500,000 people may have been mis-sold personal pensions 'should have sent shock waves through the government'. Effective regulation was not a burden - 'it should be welcomed as a way of guaranteeing confidence on the part of the public, which would in turn allow the industry to develop and expand'. He added: 'What is needed is direct regulation by the SIB with responsibility to parliament. There is no point in limping on with the present system when it is increasingly obvious that it is only a matter of time before a complete overhaul is needed.'</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Rise in public borrowing PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by a record Pounds 6.4bn in March as big increases in government spending and weaker tax revenues led to higher borrowing. The monthly figure, the highest since records began, brought the public sector borrowing requirement for the fiscal year to Pounds 13.9bn. Excluding privatisation receipts, the borrowing requirement for March was Pounds 6.5bn and for the fiscal year it was Pounds 21.8bn. That compares with Pounds 4.9bn in 1990-91.</p>

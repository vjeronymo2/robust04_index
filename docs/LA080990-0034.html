			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT  </P> <P> The commentary was correct in that we are endangering the human race; not,  however, for the reasons stated.  </P> <P> While it is true that the preservation of wildlife means the loss of jobs,  these same jobs are endangered by limited resources.  </P> <P> The extinction of any species, even one as seemingly inconsequential as the  snail darter, has drastic effects on the area it habitats. In short, it causes  a chain reaction which upsets the natural balance of things. In the long run,  this hurts the human race much more than a higher unemployment rate could.  </P> <P> TAMAR ANDERSON  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

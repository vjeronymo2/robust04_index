			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: General Dynamics plans management shake-up GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday announced a Dollars 618m special cash distribution to shareholders and a management reorganisation which includes Mr William Anders, chairman and chief executive, quitting day-to-day operations to become its non-employee chairman. The group said the restructuring, which includes sharp cuts in headquarters staff and the elimination of two layers of senior management, was designed to streamline costs and make sure its corporate governance was in keeping with the 'best practices of the 1990s'. Mr Anders, a former astronaut, has carried out the most radical contraction by any US defence contractor in the post cold-war era since he become chairman at the start of 1991. He has sold off many of General Dynamics' businesses and last year distributed part of the proceeds to shareholders through a Dollars 975m stock buy-back. Yesterday, the company announced a further distribution in the form of a special Dollars 20-a-share payment to the holders of its 30.9m shares. It said that as it moved through 1993 it would evaluate whether additional special distributions or stock purchases were appropriate. A pay-out had been widely expected on Wall Street following completion several weeks ago of the company's sale of its tactical military aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.52bn. This took General Dynamics' cash balances to more than Dollars 2bn. The company is combining the roles of chief executive and chief operating officer in the person of Mr James Mellor, 62, who is currently the chief operating officer, and eliminating the roles of three executive vice-presidents.</p>

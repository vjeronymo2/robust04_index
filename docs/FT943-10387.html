			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Management: Empty room at the top - Leeds Permanent's long quest for a chief executive Yesterday was an important anniversary for Britain's fifth largest building society, Leeds Permanent. But there were no celebrations. A year ago it announced plans to merge with a rival, National &amp; Provincial, in a deal which would have created the UK's third largest society and given Leeds a much-needed chief executive. But the post-announcement merger talks came unstuck, and they called the whole thing off in October. Since then Leeds has remained without a chief executive, as headhunters have scoured the globe in search of anyone remotely qualified who wanted the job. The room at the top had been caused by Mike Blackburn's decision the previous February to leave Leeds to run Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender. Roger Boyes, Leeds' finance director, stepped into the breach to become acting chief executive, and has been there ever since. The months of waiting have thrown up two broad issues: the management of the society during the interregnum, and the poor handling of the search for a new leader. The vacancy has overshadowed whatever Leeds has done since October. Whether it was announcing a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992-93 last November; publishing a 37 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits in April; or giving details of Leeds Life, its new life insurance subsidiary, the recurrent question was whether it had found anyone to lead the society. It has become clear that the person will come from outside: an insider would have been appointed long ago. At least two senior executives from other societies - many more, according to gossip within the sector - have been canvassed about the post. The affair has become almost a standing joke and in time could affect the society's credit ratings. 'Eighteen months without a chief executive is too long, and the blame for this failure to make an appointment must rest squarely on the shoulders of the board,' says John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at the banking group UBS. The delay has added to the difficulties in finding a new chief executive. Blackburn's successor will be under no illusions about having been the first choice and may well wonder what deterred earlier candidates from taking the post. It has also added to the obstacles which the appointee will have to overcome. This is not because the organisation has been poorly run over the past one and a half years, but because the existing management has acquired a better-than-adequate track record. The longer this has continued, the more Leeds executives may question what even a paragon will bring to the organisation. The triumvirate who have been most responsible for running Leeds since February last year were all appointed by Blackburn and are all from outside the societies sector: Boyes joined the society from a background in engineering; Chris Chadwick, commercial director, from American Express; and John Miller, information systems director, from manufacturing. Boyes is careful to emphasise the contribution of the broader executive team, through the 10-strong management committee, which he describes as the 'bedrock' of the society. The past 18 months have also put a spotlight on the role of the chairman, Malcolm Barr. His involvement in the running of the organisation has been seen by some other societies as well beyond that of their chairmen, and potentially cramping for any potential chief executive considering the post since October. Boyes says simply that the chairman of a society falls into one of two categories, and unless he is merely a titular head, then he would be expected to be around a couple of days a week at least. At any rate, Barr's role is no longer a factor in the quest for a chief executive: he will retire in January at 68, and last month John King, an existing non-executive director, was appointed chairman-elect. Competitors accept that Boyes and his team have done a competent job and have the backing of Leeds' staff, but there remains a question about strategic issues. The need for a long view is particularly pressing when, as a result of the Treasury review of the sector's legislation, societies will have access to new powers. They are already facing intensified competition in high street financial services. The approach of Leeds, the UK's fifth largest society, has been based on its position as a large but not dominant organisation in the retail financial services market. In order to make effective use of its branch network, while recognising that it cannot offer every service in competition with the clearing banks, it offers a broader range of facilities to customers than some of its rivals. Boyes describes the strategy as 'ever-evolving', but it is hard to escape the conclusion that at some point it will need fresh impetus as well as fine-tuning. Future planning is where the continued uncertainty has been a problem, with executives questioning what would happen if an incoming chief executive took a totally different view of the way forward. Boyes' answer underlines the organisation's continued confidence: 'I say to them that if we have forged a robust strategy, then the case for any U-turn would need to be substantiated.' Leeds accepts it needs a more conventional management structure, and would benefit from the higher profile a new chief executive would give it. 'The current arrangement cannot be tenable in the long haul,' says Boyes. The long haul may almost be over. Fresh rumours suggest Leeds is nearing the end of its quest. It is both a good and bad comment on the society that 18 months ago finding a chief executive should have been straightforward; finding one now looks like an achievement.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y tells Water Street investors they face big loss OLYMPIA &amp; YORK yesterday told holders of securities in its 55 Water Street property, the world's largest office building in New York, they faced huge losses on their investment but could not rely on O&amp;Y to bail them out. In a separate development, a UK government minister said no decision on whether to move civil servants to O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf office development in East London was likely to be taken before the deadline faced by banks on whether to force Canary Wharf to file for insolvency protection. At a two-hour meeting in New York, O&amp;Y told holders of USDollars 548m (Pounds 309m) in two series of notes secured by the 53-storey, 3.6m sq ft building in New York that the slump in the Manhattan property market meant cash flow from the building would be insufficient to service the property's debt from next year. It told them that by 1994, cash flow generated by the building would have fallen to Dollars 5.2m, as tenants moved out, compared with interest payments on the bonds of Dollars 35.9m. The Water Street property is one of several buildings in the US which O&amp;Y has financed through single-purpose companies with no recourse to the parent. Bondholders were initially confident this structure would protect them from O&amp;Y's financial problems. But, in a pattern likely to be repeated, O&amp;Y warned Water Street bondholders yesterday they would have to rely on their own resources to make improvements to the building which are necessary to attract new tenants. A bond analyst at Jeffreys &amp; Company in New York said the Water Street bondholders were 'shell-shocked' after yesterday's meeting. The price of the Water Street notes plunged 10 points to about Dollars 35 immediately afterwards. O&amp;Y estimated improvements needed to attract new tenants could cost Dollars 100-Dollars 200m over the next five years. Meanwhile a UK government minister said it would take 'several weeks' for a decision to be made on moving 2,000 Department of the Environment civil servants to Canary Wharf or a separate docklands property. Bankers had been hoping for an earlier decision. They must decide by the end of May whether Canary Wharf should be kept as a going concern, because that is when it runs out of cash. The DoE is looking at a number of docklands sites. The front-runners are Canary Wharf, which has offered the space at Pounds 15 a square foot, and Harbour Exchange, which is offering it at Pounds 13. The Department of Transport is even further away from a decision on whether to move 1,000 civil servants to Canary Wharf. In the US, O&amp;Y's request to the Water Street bondholders appears to signal the start of a series of talks to allow O&amp;Y to continue operating its US properties without court protection. O&amp;Y excluded its US operations from last week's court order giving protection from its creditors in Canada. The operating account for 55 Water Street and an Aetna Insurance surety bond appear to be sufficient to meet Dollars 45m in interest payments due on June 30. Abitibi-Price sale, Page 28</p>

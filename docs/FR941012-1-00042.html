			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to function effectively, the transponder must be able properly to transmit and receive signals from the POE. The physical location of the transponder is a critical factor in its operation because CMVs are equipped with many other devices that transmit and receive electronic signals of varying strengths and frequencies, such as electronic engine monitors and citizens-band radios which could affect the transponder's transmissions. In addition to these internally-generated signals, there is also a possibility of external interference from electrical power transmission lines running along highway rights-of-way. Furthermore, the device must be placed to allow drivers to read the enter/bypass indication displayed on the transponder so they can respond appropriately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Documentation of Device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AVI transponder is clearly labelled in its lower right-hand quadrant, on the side facing the driver, with the name of the respective issuing program (``ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Driver Communications Module'' and ``PRE-PASS, a transportation solution from HELP, Inc.''). Two indicators, a red octagonal mark labeled ``STOP'' and a green upward-pointing arrow labeled ``GO,'' also appear on that side. A nine-pin RS&hyph;232 connector, not used for either the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 or the HELP application, is on the bottom of the transponder. The device is thus readily identifiable as a transponder issued by one of the two programs, and no additional documentation need be carried on the participating CMVs. The transponder's unique configuration and marking distinguish it from other electronic devices, such as radar detectors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Automotive Engineering Guidelines: Driver's Field of View  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practices are the standard automotive design guidelines originally developed for use by automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. They provide a common language for vehicle and component design and the accommodation of drivers. While the use of the SAE Recommended Practices is voluntary, many, if not most, of them are adopted by automotive manufacturers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The SAE Technical Board for Rules and Regulations states: ``This report is published by SAE to advance the state of technical and engineering sciences. The use of this report is entirely voluntary, and its suitability for any particular use, including any patent infringement arising therefrom, is the sole responsibility of the user.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A foundation reference for defining the ergonomic basis for cab design is ``Motor Vehicle Driver's Eye Range,'' SAE Recommended Practice (RP) J941, which establishes two-dimensional ``Eyellipses'' representing the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile distributions of driver eye locations for use in the design of the passenger cars, trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This RP was initially approved in October 1965, and completely revised in October 1985. It has been recognized as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). A method for describing and measuring the driver's direct and indirect field of view, presented in SAE RP J1050a, references RP J941.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniform test procedures for minimum performance of windshield wiper systems for trucks, buses, and multipurpose vehicles are established in SAE RP J198. This RP also references RP J941 for a statistical representation of the driver's eye location, except for head-turn considerations. The RP states that the specific areas on the windshield glazing surface ``were developed as being compatible with viewing requirements necessary to operate the types of vehicles listed in Table 1 [of the RP]''. The classification lists seven different types of vehicles, and the corresponding areas described by the intersections of planes defined by angles above, below, left, and right of the horizontal axis of the Eyellipse. The RP defines 3 areas: a central zone, Area C, an intermediate zone, Area B, and an outer zone, Area A; all are delimited by the angles listed in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``angle up'' for the outer zone of the windshield, Area A, ranges from 10 degrees for a cab-behind-engine configuration with the ground-to-H-point <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  dimension of between 0 and 40 inches (0 to 1016 mm) to 5 degrees for a configuration with a ground-to-hinge-point dimension of 50 inches (1270 mm) or greater. Angles-up for Area A in other trucks, buses, and multipurpose vehicles listed ranges from 6 to 8 degrees. Angles-up for Areas B and C range from 1 to 5 degrees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H-point means hinge point: hip hinge point on an anthropomorphic manikin, measured with the seat in the rearmost position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Confusion, collapse and cynicism: Japanese coalition flounders in political mire Japan's foreign partners could be forgiven for gaping in astonishment at the political antics of the world's second largest economy over the past 24 hours. No sooner had Japan's politicians ended two weeks of wrangling to elect a new prime minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata, than his attempt to form a government collapsed in confusion and recrimination. The cause of the crisis, which might provoke an early general election, was a walk-out by the Social Democratic Party, the coalition's largest member. The SDP felt insulted and betrayed by the formation of a new conservative grouping, called Kaishin (Innovation) by centre-right members of the alliance only hours after the socialists had voted Mr Hata to the leadership. The SDP walkout leaves the remaining members of Mr Hata's coalition 56 votes short of a parliamentary majority, without precedent for any post-war government. The socialists, some of whom seemed almost relieved to be in opposition again, have pledged to co-operate on passage of the current budget and measures to stimulate the economy. Beyond that, Mr Hata has little chance of being able to govern, unless he can somehow win the socialists back. The stakes are high and the odds poor. If he cannot produce the income tax cut before the summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in July, this will stoke US frustration, push up the yen and jeopardise fragile recovery prospects. At least two evening newspapers yesterday forecast an early general election, which would make Mr Hata's administration one of the shortest on record. 'The ruling coalition has virtually collapsed. Their power game. . . has failed,' said Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. 'The time for a showdown has come,' he said. 'For the first time, it looks as if things have got so bad that the deadlock might have to be resolved by going to the people,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo. Should they wish to precipitate an election, the SDP and LDP have enough combined weight to win a parliamentary vote of no confidence in Mr Hata, who does not yet have a cabinet or a government. A vote of no confidence could happen sometime after the passage of the budget, possibly in June, on the assumption that all involved believe it would be irresponsible to dissolve parliament without assuring the government's finances for this year. Some analysts believe the LDP and SDP might be tempted to go to the polls. Larger traditional parties would do better in a snap poll under the existing multi-seat constituency system. The new system, due to come into effect towards the end of the year, will comprise mixed single seats and proportional representation and is likely to favour smaller parties. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who as deputy leader of Mr Hata's Japan Renewal Party is the new prime minister's political mentor, is widely assumed to be the guiding hand behind the new Kaishin grouping. He appears to have been hoping to attract enough defectors from the SDP and the LDP to summon a majority. But it looks as if this latest strategem of Mr Ozawa has badly misfired. There were no new defections yesterday. Instead the socialists, the New Harbinger Party - another disaffected former coalition member - and the LDP closed ranks. 'This is typical of Mr Ozawa's high-risk tactics. It could either be a stroke of genius or a disaster. On the evidence so far, it looks like a disaster,' said a western diplomat. Mr Hata has come out of this badly. His claim on television to know nothing about plans to form a new group on the grounds that it was a purely JRP matter, sounded unconvincing to at least half the audience, since Mr Hata is head of the JRP. To the half that did believe Mr Hata's protestations of innocence, the new leader looked foolishly ignorant of Mr Ozawa's machinations. Few people fault Mr Ozawa's perception, shared by Mr Hata and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister, that Japan is evolving a two or three party system of two large groups. Kaishin's formation marks a lurch towards that system, albeit faster than most people expected. The vision might be right, but Mr Ozawa's method aroused widespread aversion yesterday. A poll by TV Asahi yesterday found that three-quarters of respondents opposed this forceful style of driving out the socialists. A straw poll unearthed a mixture of disaste and admiration with some arguing that the JRP had flouted its obligations to the SDP embodied in an almost sacred Japanese concept of giri (duty). 'What I don't like about Mr Ozawa is that he pulls the wires behind the shadows,' said Mrs Sonoko Yoshimura, a Tokyo housewife. 'I'm more cynical than angry,' said Mr Akihiko Ohkura, a print worker. On the side of those prepared to forgive Mr Ozawa's tactics, Mr Akira Terayama, deputy general manager at Okasan Securities, argued that force is needed to achieve political progress. The socialists were set to pull out of the coalition at some time, he argued. They were, however, probably hoping to do it in a less cataclysmic fashion. Additional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani</p>

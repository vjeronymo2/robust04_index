			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Damien Ntiranyuhura] </F>   [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 1 Feb (AFP) -- Gunfire shook parts of  Burundi's capital Tuesday as ethnic Tutsis and Hutus battled for  the central African country's leadership in clashes Army sources  said already left almost 20 dead the previous day. Shooting was  heard in northern parts of Bujumbura after a further night of  fighting in the central Nyakabiga district, but no casualty  figures from that violence could immediately be obtained.  Opposition supporters put up roadblocks to close off the city  centre and shops there were shut. Most of the few cars on the  streets belonged to relief workers. Youths from the Tutsi  minority, carrying stones, threatened an AFP photographer before  telling him that the government had pledged a new president  "representing all Burundis" but had failed to keep its promise.    The new trouble began after justice officials on Saturday  sacked five of the seven members of the constitutional court,  which had been due to rule on the election of Hutu Agriculture  Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira as head of state, in place of the  late Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu who was assassinated in a failed  coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October 21.    Soldiers were numerous on the streets Tuesday but did not  intervene when Tutsi youths stoned a young Hutu, the  photographer said. Ndadaye had been the first elected president  from the Hutu majority.    Military sources said almost a score of people were killed  in  clashes on Monday. An opposition coalition on Monday called on  Burundis to stay away from work until the "restitution of the  dismissed members of the constitutional court," all of whom were  Tutsis. The sacked judges themselves issued a statement  declaring their dismissal unconstitutional and accusing the  government of "seeking at any cost to prevent the persistent  risk that the court could invalidate" Ntaryamira's election.  [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi, a Hutu, was Tuesday due to  meet  party leaders in a bid to resolve the latest crisis, officials  said. For weeks after the coup bid, Kinigi went into hiding with  other government members in foreign missions here as ethnic  massacres swept across the small highland nation, leaving tens  of thousands of dead, according to relief workers, and sending  hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighbouring countries.  [passage omitted]    Former colonial power Belgium expressed "concern" at  developments in a Foreign Ministry statement issued in Brussels  on Tuesday. The statement noted that Belgium had backed the  democratisation process that led to last year's multi-party poll  and ended traditional Tutsi rule. "The Belgian Government  considers that everything should be done so that the Government  of Burundi can restore order and peace and that the political  obstacles can be raised," the statement said. It expressed  Belgium's support for Kinigi and for Ntaryamira as "elected  president," and called on all parties to take part in "national  reconciliation."</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Wholesale prices in US down again US WHOLESALE prices fell for the second month running in July, indicating that the sluggish economic recovery is generating little or no upward pressure on inflation, the Labour Department reported yesterday. A separate report showed that retail sales increased by a negligible 0.1 per cent between June and July, less than had been expected in financial markets and a warning signal that consumer caution could depress economic growth in the third quarter. The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.2 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent drop in June. The annual rate of wholesale price inflation fell to 1.3 per cent. The fall mainly reflected a sharp decline in energy prices, which fell 1 per cent between June and July, and a slight drop in food prices despite the flooding in the Midwest. Excluding food and energy, 'core' producer prices rose 0.2 per cent after a drop of 0.1 per cent in June. The latest figures strongly suggest that the surge in prices recorded earlier this year - which prompted the Federal Reserve to threaten higher interest rates - was an aberration. The recent sluggish growth of retail sales - the increase in June was revised down to 0.2 per cent from 0.4 per cent - mainly reflects a drop in car sales after an exceptionally good month in May. Excluding cars, sales rose 0.4 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent gain in June. Other data have been mixed. Employment figures for July published last week were encouraging, pointing to a solid gain in industrial production. But the first estimate of growth in the second quarter - an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent - was worse than most analysts expected. Most forecasters continue to predict a rebound in growth in the second half to an annual rate of 2.5-3 per cent. Any such growth, however, will depend on whether the signing of President Bill Clinton's budget this week, by ending a long period of uncertainty about tax rates, will revive flagging business and consumer confidence.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / German investment abroad falls by 18% GERMAN net investments abroad continued to fall this year, dropping by 18 per cent to DM8.3bn (Pounds 3.3bn) for the first six months compared with the same period last year, according to the Economics Ministry, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Belgium continues to be the favourite foreign location for German companies, which invested nearly DM2bn there for the period, down from DM2.3bn the year before. The US and the Netherlands follow closely, with DM1.5bn and DM974m respectively. The sharpest decline was recorded in France where investments for the six months dropped by more than 50 per cent to DM437m. In comparison, German companies invested DM339m in the Czech republic, which leads as an eastern European investment site. The overall decline marks the third consecutive year of decreasing German investments abroad after 10 years of nearly uninterrupted growth. The fall reflects the general slowdown in the domestic economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry gave  final approval Friday to the Navy's choice of a British combat  system for Korea's new destroyers.    The final contract saved Korea 22 billion won as the price  of  the SSCS (Surface Ship Combat System)-MK7 was cut 34 percent  from the original offer in 1992 and revised to minimize treasury  loss on the part of Korea, ministry officials said.    The advanced software system of Bae-Sema Ltd. (BSL), to be  installed in the new warships under the KDX (Korean Destroyer  Project) program, was selected over Germany's Cosys-200K1.    The Defense Ministry completely revised the screening  process  for the combat system when the German equipment was chosen in  June last year despite the Navy's preference for the British  version.    The fact that the British Navy already has a contract on a  similar destroyer system that the Koreans wish to adopt and that  the British system was estimated to have better "follow-up  logistics support" tilted Korea toward the SSCS, the officials  said.    The SSCS sets will be installed in the next-generation Navy  destroyers, now under construction, with advanced computer  operational capability.The project is due to be completed by  1998.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. S. Voinskiy, G. V. Astvatsaturyants, S. N. </F> Borkhsenius, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences,  St. Petersburg; UDC 576.3]    [Abstract] One of the most frequently encountered stress  factors in nature is rapid change in temperature, or thermal  shock, which induces the expression of a system of thermal shock  proteins in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Earlier, the  researchers here demonstrated the expression of thermal shock  proteins in mycoplasma, which has an extremely small genome and  has no cell wall. Most types of mycoplasma populate mucosa  surfaces in animals and man. In the work reported here, the  researchers used labelling and immunoblotting with polyclonal  antibodies to thermal shock proteins 60 and 70 to study  expression of thermal shock proteins. The study involved  Acholeplasma laidlawii PG8, Mycoplasma  pneumoniae FH, M. genitalium of the strain G-37  ATCC 33530, M. fermentans ATCC 19989, and M.  fermentans of the incognitus strain. Cultures were grown at  32C in a liquid medium to the middle of the exponential  growth phase. Thermal shock was effected by changing the  temperature to 42C for two hours and then changing it back  to 32C for two hours. [.sup]35[/]S-methionine was added  after the change to 42C. The cells were centrifuged, washed  with a PBS solution, and stored at -70C until they were  taken out for use. The synthesis of thermal shock proteins in  the A. laidlawii cells was accompanied by  accumulation that was apparent 20 minutes after temperature  elevation and was at its peak 1 hour after the elevation.  Proteins p17, p65, and p72 were clearly identified on  electrophoregram and in radioautography. Densitometry indicated  that the quantity of base thermal shock proteins in the cells  increased after thermal shock to 4.2 percent from 0.8 for p72  and to 4.8 percent from 0.05 for p65, which is comparable with  thermal shock protein accumulation in E. coli. The  A. laidlawii cells produced a large quantity of  low-molecular p17, which reached 7.2 percent of the total cell  protein. Immunoblotting of proteins of several types of  mycoplasma with polyclonal antibodies to total bacterial antigen  showed that appreciable changes in thermal shock protein  expression occurred in A. laidlawii and M.  pneumoniae only.

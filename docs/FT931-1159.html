			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Caird falls 41% after difficult second half Caird Group, the waste management company which released a profits warning last November, yesterday announced a 41 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, slightly below revised market expectations. Caird, which on Wednesday announced the departure of Mr Peter Linacre, its controversial chief executive, said pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 4.04m in the year to December 31. Interim profits were up slightly at Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 3.11m). The company said the second half of the year was difficult, with landfill sites affected by weakening prices. The specialist waste division performed satisfactorily in 'recessionary' conditions. Turnover fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 26.2m) following disposals and lower revenued from landfill. Earnings per share were 0.4p (4.76p). The directors are not paying a final dividend on the ordinary shares. As a result, the total for the year was 1.33p (2.7p). After payment of interim and preference dividends, there was a retained loss of Pounds 994,000 (Pounds 10.6m).</p>

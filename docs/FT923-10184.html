			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Taking the heat of molten steel MEASURING the temperature of molten steel manually is dangerous and costly, so Vesuvius International, part of Cookson, the international industrial materials group, has developed a new long-life sensor which can measure the temperature of molten steel up to 1,8000C for more than 300 hours at a time. 'Steel companies throughout the world are trying to improve the quality of their steel,'said Wolfgang Loser, president of the German-based Accumetrix division of Vesuvius. 'Our sensors will monitor the whole process, tell them second by second what the temperature is and guarantee they produce the best quality steel.' The new long life sensor, manufactured by the Accumetrix plant in Beaver Falls,Pennsylvania, is made out of platinum and rhodium and can measure the temperature of more than 18,000 tons of molten steel being cast at the rate of six tons a minute. Vesuvius is also working on a new range of sensors, the size of a walking stick, which will measure the sulphur, hydrogen,oxygen, phosphor and nitrogen content of steel.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Closing remarks" by Comrade Kye Ung-tae, member of the </F> Political Bureau and secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea  Central Committee, at the national meeting of party cell  secretaries held at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in Pyongyang on 2  April -- recorded]    [Text] The meeting of cell secretaries of the whole party,  which was held amid great interest and expectation of party  members and people across the country, will complete its work  today after successfully discussing the raised problems with  lofty political zeal and active participation of comrade  delegates.    The current conference proudly summed up the achievements  and  experience attained in implementing programmatic tasks put  forward by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic  letter, "Let us strengthen the party cells," to the participants  at the national lecture meeting for party cells held on 10 May  1991. The current conference also discussed the issue of making  all party cells a militant organization that is unswervingly  loyal to the party and to the leader [suryong] and that  tenaciously defends, protects, and further glorifies the  socialist cause.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song personally sent a  congratulatory message to the conference and extended great  trust and honor to the delegates of the conference and to all  party cell secretaries of the whole party. He provided us with  programmatic guidelines -- the militant banner -- which we  should firmly grasp in further enhancing the militant functions  and role of party cells in compliance with the demand of our  party and development of the revolution. [applause]    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il personally promoted a  conference of cell secretaries of the whole party this year -- a  revolutionary epoch-making year when socialist construction in  our country will enter a phase of new development -- and  scrupulously guided the whole course from preparation to  operation of the conference. He extended great trust and  boundless benevolence to the delegates of the conference.  [applause]    The current conference of cell secretaries of the whole  party  was a meeting of single-hearted unity that demonstrated the  invincible might of our party, which is firmly rallied behind  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the destiny of our party,  the revolution, socialism, and symbol of all of our victories;  and behind the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, based on  loyalty and filial piety. The current conference was a meeting  of loyalty that highly displayed the revolutionary faith and  indomitable will of cell secretaries of the party to tenaciously  defend, protect, and further glorify the socialist cause -- the  party's cause -- without a slight degree of wavering even amid  complex situations. [applause]    Indeed, the current conference was a historic meeting that  provided an important milestone in constantly strengthening and  developing our party by enhancing the functions and role of the  party cells and in further consolidating our socialist  encampment. This conference will be brilliantly embroidered in  the glorious history of our party. [applause]    By deeply cherishing the party's lofty trust in and great  benevolence to cell secretaries of the party, the delegates to  the conference should make active efforts to make all party  cells the loyal party cells that are endlessly loyal to the  party and to the leader by thoroughly carrying to accomplishment  the five-point tasks put forward by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song for the party cells, and the militant tasks put forward  by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his letter to the  participants of the national lecture meeting of party cells in  May 1991. They should strive to make all party cells the  militant party cells that vigorously organize and mobilize party  members and workers into the struggle to tenaciously defend,  protect, and further glorify the socialist cause. [applause]    Cell secretaries of the party should substantively carry out  political indoctrination work to foster all party members to be  genuine loyalists and dutiful sons unswervingly loyal to the  party and to the leader. They should carry out organizational  work and guidance work for party members in accordance with the  new demand of the prevailing situation and the development of  the realities. Thus, they should further consolidate the  single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks.    By upholding the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously  accelerate the general march of socialism with the revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle" among party  members and workers, the party cells and cell secretaries should  vigorously carry out organizational and political work for  thorough accomplishment of the party's revolutionary economic  strategy. They should continually effect innovations and advance  with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima  and should highly display the superiority and vitality of  socialism in our country.    The party cells and cell secretaries should thoroughly carry  to accomplishment the party's military line and should direct  great efforts to make firm political, ideological, military,  technological and material preparations so they can smash at a  stroke the U.S. imperialists' provocation at any time.    I am firmly convinced that all party cell secretaries who  are  attending this conference will keenly realize honorable yet  their responsible missions and duties before the party and  before the revolution as responsible figures for the basic  organizations of the party, will firmly establish the monolithic  leadership system of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the  whole party and whole society, will strengthen and develop our  party into the everlasting glorious chuche revolutionary party,  and will actively contribute to brilliantly accomplishing the  socialist cause, the party's cause. I now declare the meeting of  cell secretaries of the whole party closed. [applause]</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMERS GET BOOST AS TAIWAN PREMIER QUITS  </P> <P> Premier Yu Kuo-hua announced his resignation Wednesday in a move that analysts  said was a victory for Taiwan's young reformers against the ruling Nationalist  Party's most powerful conservative.  </P> <P> Yu, 75, said on state television that he offered his resignation to President  Lee Teng-hui, but there was no official word on whether it was accepted.  </P> <P> Yu said he resigned to ensure party unity, to allow a younger generation to  take over and because he is confident that Lee, who took office last year after  the death of former President Chiang Ching-kuo, had consolidated his power and  that Taiwan politics are stable.  </P> <P> Analysts said Lee will probably accept the resignation of the premier, who has  been under intense pressure to step down from young legislators in the party  who fear he will be a liability in elections to Parliament in December.  </P> <P> "Legislators who want to run for office are afraid that Yu will be a  disadvantage," said Lu Ya-li, a professor of politics at National Taiwan  University.  </P> <P> Yu took office in 1984 after serving as central bank governor. He has been  under constant public criticism for his cautious approach to economic and  political reform.  </P> <P> Newspapers have reported that Yu had reservations about President Lee's foreign  policy initiatives, which resulted this month in Taiwan officials going to  Beijing for the first time to attend a meeting of the Asian Development Bank.  </P></p>

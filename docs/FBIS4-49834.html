			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng chaired  the 19th executive meeting of the State Council today. The  meeting examined and adopted, in principle, the "Detailed Rules  for Implementing the PRC State Security Law (Draft)," and  discussed other issues.    The meeting maintained that, since the 30th session of the  Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee adopted  and promulgated it on 22 February 1993, the "PRC State Security  Law" has played an important part in maintaining state security,  in defending China's people's democratic dictatorship and  socialist system, and in safeguarding the smooth progress of  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. It maintained,  however, that detailed implementation rules should be drawn up  on the basis of the State Security Law so that the law can be  implemented more effectively.    The meeting decided that the State Council will promulgate  the detailed implementation rules (draft) after they have been  further amended.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dem plan to revise allowance - Mortgage Tax Relief MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be phased out and replaced with a new housing cost allowance, targeted at the lower paid, and covering both rents and mortgages, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday. The party's 'Manifesto for Housing' said mortgage tax relief had created 'enormous economic and social problems without actually being of benefit to home owners'. The proposals reflect the determination of Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, to set a radical agenda, distinct from both Labour and the Tories. However, tax relief would continue to be available for existing mortgage holders, even if they moved house. For those entering the housing market, relief would be available at a level equivalent to a proportion of housing costs - perhaps 50 per cent - between regionally-determined lower and upper limits. Household incomes would also be taken into account while housing benefit would be retained for those on very low incomes. Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, said polling by the party showing housing rising on the list of voters' concerns. Mr Ronnie Fearn, party spokesman on housing, called also for short term measures to ameliorate the mortgage repossessions crisis and for tackling homelessness through investment in social housing - including the release of capital receipts from council house sales.</p>

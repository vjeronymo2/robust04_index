			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Management: Game, set, match for the Rule of Benedict - Tennis and the Church of England With more than a touch of worldly scepticism, even trepidation, 13 Church of England vicars last week swapped their dog collars for track suits and converged on a south London tennis centre. The unlikely occasion was a Church-sponsored training course aimed at improving clerical coaching skills, in particular participants' ability to bring out the best in curates placed under their care. Just as the supervisor/subordinate relationship in a company can be tricky, so the chemistry between vicars and curates is potentially unstable, sometimes even explosive. Not everyone would think of a tennis court as the best place to tackle this issue, but by the time last week's 'class' had been run off their feet and showered, most confessed to having overcome initial doubts. 'I think many of us had misgivings about what it was all costing the Church, and we were wondering why we were being asked to dig out our own tennis kit,' explained one. 'But I think it has been successful. You realise there are unbounded possibilities in looking at things afresh.' Tennis, explains Stephen Bampfylde of course organisers Saxton Bampfylde International, is merely a vehicle for exploring the coaching process. 'We like it because it's fun and also because it's important for people to see that you can win and lose. It's a bonus, however, if anyone comes out at the end with a better serve or a better backhand.' Roughly three hours during the first of the two days is actually spent on court, part of it with the vicars divided into groups of three (one playing the role of coach, another the pupil with the third observing). The rest of the first day is devoted to discussion and analysis, while the second concentrates on the 'real world' problems of parish life and how the tennis analogy can be applied. 'It doesn't matter if you can't catch a ball,' adds Martin Kitchen, priest in charge of training in the Diocese of Southwark, where all the vicars attending the course have their parishes. 'The message we want them to take away is that their curates will probably arrive with a lot of learning, knowledge and skills and that it is better for these to be drawn out than for the vicar just to tell them what to do.' Whatever the difficulty for outsiders of making the connections, phrases like 'current reality', 'focused attention', 'process' and 'task' were all being happily batted around the tennis court (and who knows, may pepper sermons in south London churches for some time to come). As one participant put it: 'The clergy is used to using parable and metaphor. There is also an openness in the Church about learning from management studies, just as the Church has learnt from history, philosophy, linguistics and other studies over the centuries.' He added: 'As I see it, management is about making decisions that affect people and resources - if there is expertise from which we can learn, we should do it.' Bampfylde and partner Anthony Saxton are oblates of the order of St Benedict, or 'part-time Benedictine monks' as Bampfylde puts it. He argues that the process is two way, and suggests that the Rule of Benedict (written at the start of the sixth century) can be seen as a useful management text. 'Benedict says that those who hold authority in a community are not to be above the group,' writes Joan Chittister in a commentary on St Benedict's thoughts on the qualities to make a good abbot (or ceo?), 'they are to be the centres of it, the norm of it, the movers of it. They themselves are to mirror its values. Their job is not simply to give orders. Their job is to live out the ideals. It is an authority far removed from office elitism or pompous hierarchy or high-handed parenting.' Saxton Bampfylde, best known as a headhunter but also active in the fields of psychological assessment and team building, gives 10 per cent of its profits to charity and employs a high proportion of christians: some 80 per cent of the staff claim commitment to the faith. 'We do have our resident atheist, though,' says Bampfylde reassuringly.</p>

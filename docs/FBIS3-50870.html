			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>   [Text] I am very concerned about the situation created by  the implementation of the IVA on the general public. I am  especially concerned about the exorbitant speculation that has  been unleashed in the country, largely due to a lack of  information and control.    President-elect Rafael Caldera thus argued his opposition to  the IVA in the light of the court decision forcing the  government to suspend its implementation.    Caldera said: "I clearly informed President Velasquez'  administration" of the impoverishing effects the IVA would have  on the people.    President Velasquez feels committed and forced to maintain  the IVA because he views it as a pledge he made at the time of  his election. As a concession, he agreed to an exemption in a  number of fundamental areas such as food, medical treatment,  medicine, and travel.    According to Caldera, these exemptions were agreed upon with  the promise to increase taxes on luxury items. However, he  believes it might be better to adopt a position more like that  of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. The tax should be  imposed more heavily on sectors that are better able to pay,  which would at least partially reduce the fiscal deficit.    The president-elect returned to the issue of speculation to  point out the current government's "apparent powerlessness" in  dealing with it. In view of this situation, he said, the events  and reasons that led to the court decision were "obvious.  Everyone acknowledges them."    Caldera said: I am not prepared at this moment to issue a  legal opinion concerning the origins, background, and  consequences of this measure, which is quite new in Venezuela's  legal history. I would prefer to express an opinion after  gaining a clearer view of this matter.    Caldera announced that following the installation of the  legislature he will introduce a "complete and full proposal to  reform the tax system." The idea is to put the burden on those  who can really pay the tax.</p>

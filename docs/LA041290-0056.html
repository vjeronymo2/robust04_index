			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: GIVING AID WHEN A BANDIT SAYS: 'I WUZ ROBBED'  </P> <P> In writing recently about famous quotations that were never said, or are  commonly attributed to the wrong authors, I included a remark the notorious  bank robber Willie Sutton is said to have made in answer to a reporter's  question, "Why do you rob banks?"  </P> <P> According to the legend, Sutton answered, "Because that's where the money is."  </P> <P> I commented that "for sheer brevity, clarity and integrity," I had considered  that among the classics of all time.  </P> <P> First, I was disenchanted by reading in "They Never Said It," by Paul F. Boller  Jr. and John George, that Sutton never said it. A reporter made it up.  </P> <P> Now I am perturbed by a letter from a man named Jack, whose last name is  illegible and who gives no address, so I can not give him credit. But he says:  </P> <P> "As I understand it, Mr. Sutton was asked 'Why do you rob banks?' And he  replied, 'Because that's where the money is.' I agree with you this is among  the classics of all time. But not because of its brevity, clarity and  integrity. It is a classic because, like one of Mr. Boffo's characters, Mr.  Sutton was unclear on the concept. The reporter was asking Mr. Sutton why he  robbed, not why he robbed banks instead of other institutions, but Mr. Sutton  got it wrong."  </P> <P> I have hesitated to comment on this analysis because, not knowing Jack's full  name, it is like jousting with the wind.  </P> <P> However, other readers might have had that same misapprehension, and I feel  obliged to clarify the question.  </P> <P> First, we must understand Mr. Sutton (since Jack chooses to give him that  title). He was a bank robber. He did not mug people in the streets or  burglarize homes. He robbed banks.  </P> <P> Mr. Sutton was not a perfect bank robber. He spent 20 years of his life in  jail. But his style was flamboyant. He wore elaborate disguises and was known  as "The Actor." He escaped from Sing Sing in 1932 and used a wooden rifle to  bluff his way out of a Pennsylvania jail in 1947. In 1969, white-haired and 68,  he was released from Attica Prison. I don't know what happened to him after  that.  </P> <P> What Jack says is that when the reporter asked Mr. Sutton why he robbed banks,  he did not mean why did Mr. Sutton rob banks, specifically; but why he robbed  at all.  </P> <P> And he thinks that Mr. Sutton misinterpreted the question, taking it literally,  and explained why he robbed banks.  </P> <P> I consider that most improbable. As a reporter myself, I would not have been  likely to ask a hardened criminal why he was a criminal. The answer to that  question would be so psychologically complicated that the criminal himself  could not be expected to know the answer.  </P> <P> No, I think the reporter wanted to know why Mr. Sutton robbed banks, rather  than little old ladies or liquor stores. And Mr. Sutton told him in an answer  that was direct, logical, simple, brief and clear.  </P> <P> I am also skeptical of the documentation offered in "They Never Said It" as  proof that this was not Mr. Sutton's own rejoinder. The book says, "According  to the infamous bank robber himself, it was a reporter who thought up this  smart-aleck remark and put it in his mouth."  </P> <P> If Mr. Sutton did indeed deny authorship of the remark, he thereupon deprived  himself of his only claim to enduring fame. It was a remark that might live  long after his felonies are forgotten.  </P> <P> Furthermore, I do not consider the remark "smart-aleck." It was elegant in its  simplicity and impregnably honest.  </P> <P> I'm not sure "They Never Said It' is serving humanity by questioning the  validity of our most treasured quotes.  </P> <P> They even say it wasn't Gen. John J. Pershing, leader of the American  Expeditionary Forces in World War I, who said, on his landing in France,  "Lafayette, we are here!" The author of that splendid phrase, they say, was  Pershing's chief disbursing officer, Lt. Col. Charles E. Stanton.  </P> <P> We might as well say that it wasn't Gen. Douglas MacArthur who said, on his  departure from the Philippines, "I shall return," but a member of his staff, or  perhaps only some non-com GI who was making a vow to his Filipina girl friend.  </P> <P> But perhaps it was only made up by a reporter, as many great quotes allegedly  have been.  </P></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report After briefly testing resistance at Dollars 360 a troy ounce the London GOLD prices closed at Dollars 357.25, up Dollars 3 on the day. Traders attributed the rally to concern about the situation in Russia, but one analyst commented: 'The market is basically bearish ...The Russian rallies (on Wednesday and yesterday) have just added to the disappointment because they have been so short and have had no follow-through'. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices slipped further as the cash/three months discount widened from Dollars 11.50 to Dollars 18.50 a tonne in response to freer availability of metal for immediate delivery. NICKEL prices rallied smartly in the afternoon on news that Inco of Canada was to discuss production cuts and cost cutting measures with unions. The three months price peaked at Dollars 4,370 a tonne before easing on profit-taking to end at Dollars 4,340, still up Dollars 40. At the London Commodity Exchange both COCOA and COFFEE futures reversed early falls, the former ending little changed and the latter with modest gains in nearby positions. Compiled from Reuters</p>

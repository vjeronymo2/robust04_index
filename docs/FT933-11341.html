			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Money transfer fees 'too high' EUROPEAN banks are charging too much for cross-border money transfers within the EC, according to a new study by the European Commission. The study found that two in three banks did not provide written information about their fee scales, while the quality of service varies widely among member states. The Netherlands, Denmark and the UK had the most efficient banking services covering dispatch and receipt of money transfers, according to the study. The worst services were found in Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, EC commissioner responsible for the Single Market, described the findings as disappointing. He called for the urgent adoption of the leading European banking federations' guidelines, hinting that failure to act could lead to legislation. However, Mr d'Archirafi paid tribute to the efforts by some European banks to create automatic clearing mechanisms to improve the payments network. The Commission study estimated that in 1990 around 200m cross-border transactions of less than Ecu2,500 (Pounds 1,890) took place in the EC. On average, the cost of money transfers within the EC is around Ecu20, the study revealed. The fee rises to Ecu24 if 'double charges' - fees levied by the banks at both ends of the transaction - are included. Double charges were discovered in 42.5 per cent of all transactions. The Commission intends to publish a report in the autumn.</p>

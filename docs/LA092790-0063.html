			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PASSING THROUGH CUSTOMS;  </P> <P> CYPRIOT DANNY DANIELS HAS MASTERED SOCCER BUT NOT MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF  AMERICAN LIFE  </P> <P> The name change and the earring are immediate giveaways. Yes, Danny Daniels,  a.k.a. Haratch Danielan, has adapted to American ways since his arrival in  Northridge three years ago. But make no mistake, Daniels is a Cypriot at heart.  </P> <P> A citizen of Cyprus, an island nation off the coasts of Turkey and Syria,  Daniels comes from a world in which sons obey their fathers, even if it means  putting off their dreams.  </P> <P> At Vahram Danielan's insistence, his son came to America to pursue a college  education. If not for Danielan's intervention, Daniels likely would be playing  for a professional soccer team in Cyprus or Greece rather than scoring goals  for Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> "I had a big argument with him," said Daniels, whose father could not afford a  college education. "The only argument I've ever had with him in my whole life.  </P> <P> "My dad said: 'No education?' "  </P> <P> "I said: 'So what. My dream is not to make a million dollars. I want to have  fun and make money to live.'  </P> <P> "Then my dad said: 'What if you hurt your knee and your soccer career is over?'  </P> <P> "I said: 'I can die tomorrow. I want to have fun with soccer first. When it is  over, there's a lot of things I can do.' "  </P> <P> Daniels' determination to play was born of two experiences, those of his uncle  and his teacher.  </P> <P> "My uncle (Minas Danielan) played only two years in the pros," Daniels said.  "When I asked him what happened, he never gave a reason."  </P> <P> "My teacher, Mr. Hatchikos, was a goalie. He broke his leg. He's 42 now and he  still says he should have gone back. He told me not to make the same mistake.  He told me to go for it."  </P> <P> But Daniels' father would not bend, so his son came to Southern California to  live with older brothers Jack and Mark. Because he could not speak English,  Danny could not gain admission to a university. After a year of practice,  primarily with Jack's former mother-in-law, he learned enough of the language  to be admitted to CSUN, where he immediately joined the soccer team.  </P> <P> "I had a nightmare understanding English," Daniels said. "Even in my own  language (Cypriot) I'm not very good. I always tell the teachers from the  beginning that English is my second language so you might find some silly  mistakes in my papers."  </P> <P> Several of Daniels' teammates chuckle when they recall the time he was pulled  over by a police officer while carting them around town.  </P> <P> "The cop asked for my papers and I told her: " 'Well, I just shampooed my  car'," Daniels said. "She thought I was drunk. What I was trying to tell her  was that I took the registration out when I washed my car."  </P> <P> The language adjustment is one of many Daniels has made. He says he still  doesn't understand America's work ethic, although his schedule -- school,  soccer and a job as a waiter -- appears to emulate it.  </P> <P> "When I came here, I was shocked," Daniels said. "All people do is work, work,  work. There's too much pressure. I'm not used to that.  </P> <P> "For people over here it's gotta be Friday or Saturday to have a crazy day.  Over there (Cyprus) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever you want to party, you  party. If you don't go to work one day, no big deal. If you can't make it, you  can't make it."  </P> <P> Daniels' manners also have required an alteration.  </P> <P> "The customers in the restaurant say, 'Don't call me sir'," Daniels said. "I  say, 'What do you want me to say, 'Hey, fella'?"  </P> <P> Fortunately, Daniels is outgoing as well as polite. It has served him well as a  stranger in a strange land.  </P> <P> "Girls I have no problem with, but the way they behave I am not used to," he  said. "I am a jealous guy and they hug other guys. And they say anything they  want. Personal stuff. It is kind of embarrassing."  </P> <P> Daniels, a sophomore, has less difficulty relating to his teammates, but he  does not openly share his pro aspirations with them for fear of appearing to be  a braggart.  </P> <P> Where he comes from, it is de rigueur -- skilled players turn pro right out of  high school, and, in some cases, during high school. By the time Daniels, 20,  leaves CSUN he will be middle-aged, in terms of a Cypriot or Greek pro soccer  career.  </P> <P> Despite that disadvantage, Daniels hopes to catch on with a pro team after  college.  </P> <P> "That's my dream: To play soccer and get paid for it," he said. "I still have  time. It all depends on me.'  </P> <P> In the meantime, Daniels is showing that he can play the U. S. game.  </P> <P> In only his second match of the season, Daniels scored the tying goal in  overtime against 19th-ranked Washington. A week later, he tallied both goals in  a 2-0 victory over Southern California College. Despite missing 3 1/2 games  because of a strained Achilles' tendon that continues to pain him and requires  daily treatments, he is tied with Steve Linhart for the team scoring lead with  eight points.  </P> <P> "When I play soccer I forget everything," Daniels said. "No matter how  frustrating the game, I don't get peeved. I have fun."  </P> <P> From the beginning, soccer set Daniels apart from a family that had difficulty  staying together.  </P> <P> Daniels' two brothers and their sister, Mary, were born in their father's  native Italy. But he and another brother, Heros (Harry), were born in Kuwait  while his father was there doing business as a clothing salesman.  </P> <P> Until their late teens, Danny and Harry didn't know their older brothers, who  were in school in Italy. For several years their father also lived part of the  time in Italy because that's where his business took him.  </P> <P> Although Danny's mother, Mary, traveled to Italy with her children for visits,  Danny missed many of those trips because of tournaments in Switzerland, Austria  and Egypt as soccer became more and more important to him. During one stretch,  he was away from his family for six months. That experience helped prepare him  for the move to the United States, but there were still adjustments to be made.  </P> <P> "The feeling is different," Daniels said. "I knew I would see my mom in a few  months, but I know now I won't see her for several years."  </P> <P> His parents phone as often as they can, however.  </P> <P> "When my dad calls, all he wants to hear about is school," Daniels said. "I  tell him 'School is fine. Come over here and see one of my matches.' "  </P> <P> While Mary attended most of Daniels' matches in Cyprus, Vahram has seen his son  play only twice -- many years ago.  </P> <P> Danny would like nothing better than to have them in the stands at CSUN. Of  course if they come to the United States to visit, Daniels will be minus one  accessory: In deference to his father, he won't be wearing the earring.  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Edinburgh Festival: Shared aims and age-old traditions EUROPE'S oldest music festival, the Three Choirs, outstrips Edinburgh by two centuries, its antecedents reaching back to the Restoration. The annual programme strives to maintain a balance between tradition and innovation, with large choral works its forte - a staggering number are mounted within the space of a week, with the conducting shared between the three cathedral organists of Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester. This year's director, John Sanders, produced perhaps the week's outstanding performance, a Bach B minor Mass, in which all aspects gelled: precise chorus intonation, distinctive soloists led by Emma Kirkby, period-instrument clarity from the Brandenburg Consort. The premieres were mixed. Alongside a slightly dull brass piece from Hugh Wood and an unexpectedly-imaginative anthem from John Rutter came Philip Cannon's A Ralegh Triptych, settings of three poems penned in anticipation of execution. The angularity of Cannon's spare A Cappella writing poses a challenge. That it came across well was due to the boys' alertness in tuning and attentive direction by Donald Hunt. Cannon merits unearthing: his Ligeti-inspired Quartet, Chansons for soprano and harp or the Oraison Funebre de l'Ame Humaine for strings, all manifestly called for revival. Despite a valiant effort by the tenor, Maldwyn Davies, a tiring Royal Philharmonic Orchestra just took the edge off Finzi's sumptuous Wordsworth setting, Ode to Immortality, whose word-painting is as delicate as Britten's. A different problem is set in Janacek's inspirational Glagolitic Mass. For all the flair in big climaxes, flat choral enunciation merge with a lethargic orchestral reading. The work has much in common with Janacek's pliant operatic writing, yet only John Mitchinson, the veteran tenor, found the required energy for its impassioned Gloria and Credo. The show was saved by Mark Lee, the young organ soloist, whose playing proved one of the distinctions of the week. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rose to the Processional finale like an idle schoolboy runner who surges ostentatiously to the finishing line. Of the visitors, Richard Hickox followed a scintillating Elgar Alassio with a Mahler Fourth Symphony of breath-taking indifference. But Michael Berkeley's ritualised, Messiaenic organ concerto (its inflections suggest a debt to Jehan Alain) easily proved its repertoire worth, with Thomas Trotter an articulate soloist. More striking was Meredith Davies conducting EJ Moeran's cello concerto, eloquently played by Raphael Wallfisch, who has also recorded the work for Chandos. Davies's direction proved something of a revelation: he has been too long exiled from the podium. Chief pleasure of a buoyant Fringe was Nicola-Jane Kemp's song recital, setting Schubert and Wolf alongside a new cycle by Gloucester composer, Christopher Boodle. There were two literary tributes. A new biography of Hubert Parry, harbinger of the English revival, was prefaced by an enthusiastic talk from its author, Jeremy Dibble, at Parry's own Highnam Church, Paul Spicer's lecture celebrating the centenary of Herbert Howells set the tone for the week. Musical examples, especially those from an earlier period, left one in no doubt that Howells' importance in the British canon calls for reassessment. This summer also brought a new history of the Three Choirs by Anthony Boden, a canny sifter of anecdote, as his books on the Gloucester poets, Ivor Gurney and FW Harvey, have already shown. A sense of fun pervades Three Choirs (Alan Sutton, Pounds 20), whose meticulous research starts with the Civil War period and Restoration and supplants dry annals by a colourful, though never trite, account of the festival.</p>

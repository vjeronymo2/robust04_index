			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confused ideas about objectives of human resource management (2) Sir, I fear Sue Fernie and David Metcalf may have been asking the wrong question. By asking managers responsible for personnel matters to rate management-employee relations on a seven-point scale, they have collected data on those managers' own perception of the states of their organisations. Fernie and Metcalf go on to confuse these perceptions with the 'actual' state of these organisations. Is it surprising, then, that managers who use HRM methods are more aware of the problems they have with their people, see the benefits of improving things and rate their current position accordingly modestly, whereas those who do not are satisfied with things as they are and report good results? Would Captain Bligh have reported good relations with the crew of The Bounty? I suspect so. Mark McKergow, principal, Mark McKergow Associates, 6 Auburn Road, Redland, Bristol BS6 6LS</p>

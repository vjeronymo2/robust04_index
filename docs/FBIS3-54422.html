Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, leader of the Patriotic Forces Union  and chairman of the National Dialogue subcommittee making  arrangements for the signing of the "Pledge Document," has told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the alleged controversy over the  subcommittee was unfounded and that it did not receive  instructions from any party. He said that work was proceeding  toward completion of the arrangements, but opposition sources  warned that the situation was moving toward confirmation of the  existing undeclared secession or toward some kind of foreign  trusteeship for the country.    Denying the opposition's claims, Shaykh Abu-Luhum said the  arrangements committee is considering all possible options and  is eager to reach agreement on a venue and date for the signing  "on the basis of comprehensive national grounds, for it is  structured to include the coalition parties, the opposition  parties, and the independent patriotic forces."    He said that the document "belongs not to any particular  parties or political forces but to the Yemeni people who have  blessed and supported it because it covers public issues."    Meanwhile, sources close to Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Naji  al-Ghadir, chairman of the Higher Council of the Yemeni tribes  "Saba'" and chieftain of the Khawlan tribes, have confirmed that  he was able to bring about the release of the helicopter  belonging to the American company Hunt Oil, which operates in  the governorate of Ma'rib, its pilot, and the Indian expert who  was with him, after giving the Bani-Jabr tribe (of Khawlan) two  Toyota vehicles.

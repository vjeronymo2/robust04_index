			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juris Tubinis: "Lithuania: Kindred Spirits"] </F>   [Text] Zhirinovskiy's brothers live in Lithuania. We are  not talking about blood relatives, of course, but a kind of  spiritual tie. Certain Lithuanian politicians are full of  utterances which in essence are close to Vladimir Volfovich's  ideas. These painfully familiar thoughts and ideas are  obviously marked with the ethnic "quality stamp." And that is  not all: Vladimir Volfovich's words reverberate because they  carry from vast Russia, while similar utterances connected with  the special interests of certain Lithuanian politicians are  mainly well-known only within the borders of the tiny republic.    Fortunately, so far the ideas of the youth organization  "Jaunoji Lietuva," for example, that "measures must be taken" to  change the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of Vilnius,  where Lithuanians account for only 52.5 percent, have not  attracted any state support. The proposals made by "Jaunoji  Lietuva" are as follows: In the near future, to give up the  broadcasts in Russian and Polish which are relayed on Lithuanian  state radio, to stop the immigration of Russians to Lithuania,  and to adopt measures to ensure that university lectures are not  read in Russian. All these ideas were voiced at a meeting with  the republic's President A. Brazauskas.    But there is a topic that may cause as much of a stir as  Zhirinovskiy's speeches, because it concerns something that is  complex and important for the region's European policy -- the  Russian enclave of Kaliningrad Oblast. Kaliningrad, which local  "patriots" only call by its Lithuanian name, Karaliaucius, is  one of the trump cards of the republic's national-radicals. At  the meeting with the president, the youth organization's  spokesman L. Antanavicius stated that....recognizing that  Kaliningrad belongs to Russia creates danger for the Lithuanian  state and a threat to the security of the Lithuanian nation.    A lot of people just smile at this: What can you expect from  the spokesman of a youth organization? They are young, green,  and irresponsible. But faint similar notes can be heard  increasingly often in what serious Lithuanian politicians have  been saying. Philosopher and Seimas Member R. Ozolas, for  instance, believes that since the USSR has passed away, it has  yet to be decided whether Russia should control this region....    It is evidently no accident that the OPPOZITSIYA  [Opposition]  newspaper has also paid attention to the "Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon in Lithuania," specifically owing to claims to an  inalienable part of Russian territory. There are a lot of  Zhirinovskiy's in Lithuania, the newspaper wrote with alarm.  The young Lithuanians' appeal, "We Will Not Calm Down Until We  Get Karaliaucius," was much publicized, particularly in Kaunas.  The newspaper focused its attention on the fact that S.  Lozoraitis, A. Brazauskas's former rival at the presidential  elections, was supported by the majority of Lithuanian parties  and movements, and, after all, it was specifically he who talked  about "Lithuania's interests in Kaliningrad Oblast."    The republic's official authorities have gradually changed  their stance in respect of the oblast from a neutral one -- let  the process develop naturally, they said -- to a prejudiced one:  They started saying traditional things at international level  about the danger apparently emanating from Kaliningrad Oblast in  connection with the Russian troops that are there.    But Zhirinovskiy's kindred spirits in Lithuania are not  diplomatic at all. OPPOZITSIYA reported that a brochure written  by someone by the name of J. Ramanauskasis is being circulated  at enterprises and organizations in the city of Kaunas, and it  expounds the policy tenets of the "Party of the Revival of the  Forefathers." This party will strive to unite Lithuanians,  Latvians, and Prussians (a nationality which disappeared several  centuries ago) into a single nation by means of campaigning to  unite all the lands of the forefathers from Karaliaucius to the  Estonian border, from the upper reaches of the Daugava River and  the Neman to Naugardukas and Brasta.    "Is he not a Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy?", the newspaper  exclaims. "He does not ask the Latvians, or the hundreds of  thousands of Belorussians, or the Russians in Kaliningrad."    "The musical [zamuzitsirovavshiysya] leader of the  opposition  is unable to refrain from making statements that Russia has no  rights to Kaliningrad Oblast, while another similar politician,  who has gone over the top in his philosophizing and who has  moved from the center to the right, explains that the oblast  should be divided up between Lithuania and Poland," OPPOZITSIYA  cites these words from a letter from one of its readers.  Another author draws attention with alarm to the fact that such  notes can also be heard in speeches by an eminent politician  from the party that is currently ruling in Lithuania, Seimas  Member B. Genzialis.    According to an OPPOZITSIYA reader, whose opinion the  newspaper cites in full, it is precisely because of such  daydreams by certain Lithuanian politicians that the Kaliningrad  YANTARNYY KRAY newspaper once expressed its opposition to the  monument to Gerkus Mantus, leader of the uprising by the  vanished tribe of Prussians against the crusaders, which has  been erected. The reader believes that this reaction is not  surprising if you recall the speeches that have recently been  heard in Lithuania about "'the reunification' of Prussia"...    The Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy's do not understand how they are  harming Lithuania, OPPOZITSIYA writes. As one of the letters  says, "in a normal state the authors of such provocative  statements and others like them would be taken to court if they  were of sound mind, or they would be put into a psychiatric  hospital if not." In the opinion of the newspaper, though, they  are not that dangerous to the world, but they could bring a lot  of misfortune on Lithuania....</p>

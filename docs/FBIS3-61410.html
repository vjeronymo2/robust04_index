Yusov; UDC 546.799.6] </F>   [Abstract] In a previous work it was demonstrated that  curium can exist in the hexavalent state. Where microquantities  of this substance were sufficient for the proof of valency,  larger amounts of curium (VI) are needed for purposes such as  (VI)/(V) pair potential, absorption spectra, states of  existence, etc. In the present work an attempt was made to  oxidize curium (III) in solutions of sodium carbonate and  bicarbonate saturated with N[.sub]2[/]O and treated with  _g_-radiation from Co[.sup]60[/]. It was assumed that  oxidation of curium (III) to curium (IV) would lead to  disproportionation to form curium (VI). However, curium (III)  fails to oxidize on radiation. Oxidation of curium (III) with  sodium perxenate in cold sulfuric acid was also unsuccessful.  References 8: 4 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

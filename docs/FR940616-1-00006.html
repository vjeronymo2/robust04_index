			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.4&blank;Functions of a Governing Body <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.4(a). This proposal deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven to be a difficult concept to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Committee felt that truly effective public notice is virtually impossible to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation does not wish to promote such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because few members of the public showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior public notice, so that recipients would only be required to do what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds of matters were properly discussed in executive session. Instead, it decided to recommend that recipients look to the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act provisions, or other provisions in state non-profit corporation law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that should appropriately be discussed out of the public eye. A recipient should determine, based on that review and local circumstances, how it should conduct its business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1607.4(b). The proposed regulation includes new language to make it clear that recipient governing bodies have, in addition to the specific functions described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent in their status as boards of non-profit corporations. The Committee felt that the current regulatory language did not grant the governing body the general authority, for example, to hire and fire a program's executive director, and there should be language that granted such authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there is new language that was added to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing bodies of legal assistance programs under the Model Rules, especially with respect to the governing bodies' interference with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct of any ongoing representation. The Committee wished to make clear that while Board members were prohibited from such interference, the Board as a whole should be encouraged to adopt policies to guide the executive director's actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken representation in a case that is inappropriate under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1607.4(c). This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws. The Corporation would have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any revisions that are made in them, for the purpose of ensuring that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.5&blank;Compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.5(a). The proposed regulation makes two significant changes in the current rule dealing with recipient board member compensation. First, since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only to attorney board members, it would be consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or other non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. The regulation was revised to make it consistent with the restriction in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, this proposal reverses the policy decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the language of the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just the one on whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting on state and national support center boards, and vice versa. It prevented support centers from being accountable through their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This proposed language restores and clarifies the prior LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services Corporation Reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent with the proposed revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposal clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Such a per diem may be easier for programs to administer and may encourage board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. The last phrase of the sentence was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement could be made for expenses incurred by recipient board members, on the same terms and conditions that are applicable to non-board members when such board members are involved in other program activities not directly related to their board membership or service, e.g., attorney board members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1607.5 (b) and (c). The proposal includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition relates to a recipient's private attorney involvement program. One provision makes it clear that the Corporation could partially waive the compensation prohibition for those rural programs that operate in areas where there are so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program boards if that means that their partners and associates are barred from participating in judicare or other compensated PAI activities. The second provision was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases and participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.6&blank;Waiver <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

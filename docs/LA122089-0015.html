			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ONLY WAY TO HELP POLAND  </P> <P> After 40 years of communism, Poland is an economic and environmental shambles.  Its farmers have grown single cash crops for so long they will have to learn  agriculture all over. Times writer Art Pine reported from Krakow recently that  30,000 workers at the Lenin steel mill produce no more than what a fraction of  that number can turn out in South Korea. Inflation is running at an annual rate  of 450% and economists warn it will be 900% next year without radical reforms.  A recent Warsaw visitor reports the opening of a new office building that took  35 years to build, a paradigm for the way the whole country works. But there is  a way out of this mess -- and it rests with the old-fashioned notion of  international economic cooperation.  </P> <P> The Poles already know that help is on its way from the United States, Japan  and European countries and from the International Monetary Fund, but at a  price. Under a proposed agreement with the IMF, wages must be capped and that  will produce a 25% loss in buying power next year. Government subsidies must be  wiped out and that means prices of things like electricity will soar. The  Polish parliament has begun deciding these and other changes in economic rules  that could lead to failures of many businesses and to higher prices as the  nation moves to a market economy.  </P> <P> Alarming? Yes. But visitors find the professors and labor leaders who are  suddenly in charge of a nation -- with no experience in governing and only a  vague idea of how a free market works -- determined to change everything at  once, remarkably optimistic that they can do it, able even to joke about it.  When President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, began lecturing  members of the Polish Cabinet on the dangers of taking on too much at once,  they heard him out and then one responded: The Cabinet member said that  gradualism would not work and that Poland had no choice but to take what has  been called the Big Bang approach. Then, with a smile, he added that, anyway,  like war and generals, moving from communism to a market economy was too  important a task to be entrusted to economists.  </P> <P> After a slow start, Washington is moving to provide not only food and cash but  the kind of technical help Poland will need to do such things as create credit  lines -- something that's second-nature in the West and all but unheard of  under communism. Some estimates put the value of pledges of aid for Poland as  high as $4 billion.  </P> <P> For a time, Warsaw was overwhelmed with visitors from the West, stumbling over  one another with free-lance offers of aid, taking up the time of Polish  officials that should have been spent on planning for the radical changes  involved in creating a market economy from economic rubble. With the IMF about  to agree on its own contribution of more than $700 million, the West will have  a traffic controller on the scene to monitor the flow of aid and free up the  time of Polish officials for more important things than chatting with  well-intentioned visitors. Next to cash and technical advice, Western nations  can make no more important a contribution to Poland than cooperating with the  IMF's traffic controls.  </P></p>

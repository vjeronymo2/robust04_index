			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / IBM plan to clone microchip may spark legal row THE computer industry in the US is facing the prospect of a battle of its giants after moves by International Business Machines to clone a version of Intel's top-selling microprocessor chip. The IBM plan threatens one of the industry's longest-lasting technology partnerships. IBM, a conservative company normally, is becoming more aggressive in its efforts to restore profitability since the arrival of Mr Lou Gerstner as chairman and chief executive in April. Intel, meanwhile, has become the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer largely because of the success of its microprocessors, which were chosen by IBM as the brains of its first personal computers more than a decade ago. Since then the Intel chips have become the standard for all 'IBM-compatible' PCs. Yet while Intel has earned record profits from its microprocessors, IBM's PC business operated for several years at a loss and only recently achieved a 'very small' quarterly profit. For IBM, cloning the Intel chips seems to represent an attempt to take control of its own destiny and to boost the profitability of its PC business. IBM declined to comment on its decision. However, the company is believed to have efforts under way to produce 'clean room' versions of Intel's 486 and new high-performance Pentium microprocessors. The 'clean room' approach, which has been used by other chip companies to produce Intel microprocessor 'work-alikes', involves isolating designers from any access to Intel technology so that they must start from scratch to create a chip that emulates the functions of the original. Yet Intel has raised legal challenges to all other efforts to clone its microprocessors. Mr Tom Dunlap, Intel general counsel, has said in the past that he does not believe it is possible for any company legally to clone Intel's chips. The IBM cloning effort is believed to be in its early stages, and industry analysts point out that, like any development project, it is not certain to lead to the release of products. However, if IBM pursues the project it runs the risk of a legal challenge from Intel, one of its main chip suppliers. IBM is also Intel's largest customer. This partnership has given IBM unprecedented access to Intel's technology. Indeed, IBM is licensed, by Intel, to produce Intel-designed microprocessors. However, the terms of the licensing arrangement restrict IBM to selling these chips only as components of personal computers or circuit boards. Yesterday both Intel and IBM maintained that their relationship remained 'strong and very positive'. But it is clear that most of the benefits of the relationship accrue to Intel.</p>

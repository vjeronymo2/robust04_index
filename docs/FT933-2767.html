			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Big debt means strong medicine for voters: Bernard Simon finds a sombre mood among politicians in Canada's election campaign CANADA'S unemployment rate is stuck above 11 per cent so it is hardly surprising that job-creation is every politician's favourite issue in the campaign for the October 25 general election. What is surprising is that, in a country accustomed to a much government molly-coddling, politicians on all sides are tempering their promises of new jobs with a dose of fiscal restraint. The first ten days of the campaign have shown that, for all their concern at high unemployment, Canadians are aware of the constraints imposed by the towering debt amassed by the federal government and the ten provinces over the past two decades. So, politicians are not only arguing about the type of jobs which should be created for the 1990s, but also questioning the role of government in creating them. Spreading the sombre message that Canadians should expect less, rather than more, from their governments would have been a sure way to lose votes in years gone by. But, this time, it seems to be doing the opposite. Both the ruling Progressive Conservatives and the opposition Liberals have set specific targets for cutting the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 18bn) federal budget deficit. They have promised to overhaul the country's generous but much-criticised social security and health care systems. Ms Kim Campbell, the new prime minister, has vowed to eliminate the budget deficit without tax increases by 1998. She has yet to spell out however, how the pain would be spread. Ms Campbell opened her campaign by cautioning that it might be several years before there was an appreciable dent in the jobless rate. In Toronto last week, she bluntly told unemployed construction workers that a Conservative government would not subsidise a new convention centre for the city. She said the jobs created by such make-work projects would last no more than a year or two, and do nothing for long-term competitiveness. Despite her sombre message, Ms Campbell has dramatically revived her party's electoral fortunes. The Tories had the support of only about one voter in five when Ms Campbell took over, as premier and party leader, from her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney, three months ago. However, according to an opinion poll in the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday, the Tories have edged ahead of the opposition Liberals, with the support of 36 per cent of decided voters, the Liberals having 33 per cent. Next most popular, with 11 per cent, is the populist Reform Party, which has been waging an even more aggressive crusade against big government from its base in western Canada. By contrast, the interventionist New Democratic Party faces the prospect of losing more than half its 43 seats in the House of Commons. According to the poll out yesterday, the NDP has only 8 per cent of the national vote, two percentage points less than the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec. In their policy platform, released this week, the Liberals were careful to avoid extravagant claims of Ottawa's ability to spur economic growth. The Liberal plan, which was described by party leader Mr Jean Chretien as 'realistic, compassionate and fiscally responsible', pledges a net reduction in government programmes of CDollars 1.8bn over the next five years. Provided the economy accelerates, the Liberals aim to reduce the budget deficit from 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product to 3 per cent. They promise to create 50,000 new child-care places a year - but only if the economy has grown by at least 3 per cent in the previous year. The Liberals aim to scrap the unpopular 7 per cent goods and services tax (GST) imposed by the Tories in 1991, butthey acknowledge that it would be necessary to find the equivalent revenues elsewhere. It's a fair bet that at least some of the promises of fiscal restraint will be forgotten once the election is over. The Tories have a miserable record over the past nine years of sticking to their budget projections, and economists doubt their ability bring the deficit down to zero by 1998. Also, no-one would be surprised if the Liberals were to keep the GST, and fail to meet their own deficit-cutting targets. Even so, the emphasis on jobs and deficits means that, whichever party wins the election, Canadians and their governments are likely to be pre-occupied with domestic issues over the next few years. Many Canadians yearn for a bigger role on the international stage but the new government will have its hands full on the home front.</p>

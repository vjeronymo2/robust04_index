			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash expensive SHORT RATES in the sterling cash market were firmer yesterday as dealers took the whole day to remove the large shortage forecast by the Bank of England. As expected, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1bn at the start of what is expected to be an expensive week for money. Many of the Bank's previous repurchase agreements are due to expire this week. The shortage in forthcoming days could add up to around Pounds 7bn. To help remove yesterday's shortage, the Bank invited the discount houses to tender bills in the early round. They also offered to purchase bills in the longer dated Bands 3 and 4 at 9 21/32 per cent and 9 19/32 per cent respectively. At first, dealers waited to see whether the Bank would offer to buy these bills at slightly lower rates: only Pounds 16m of Band-3 bank bills and Pounds 29m of Band-4 bills were purchased. On top of this, Pounds 33m of Band-1 bank bills and Pounds 74m of Band-2 bank bills were purchased at the now established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. As midday approached, dealers realised that the Bank would stick to these dealing rates throughout the day. At the established rates, the Bank purchased Pounds 70m of Band-1 treasury bills, Pounds 72m of Band-1 bank bills, Pounds 20m of Band-2 bank bills, Pounds 237m of Band-3 bank bills, Pounds 1m of Band-4 LA bills, and Pounds 161m of Band-4 bank bills. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 800m. The Bank bought Pounds 37m of Band-1 bank bills and Pounds 13m of Band-2 bank bills. The Bank also provided late assistance of around Pounds 70m. The Bank was clearly not trying to signal a change in base rate policy by dealing in longer-dated bills at these softer rates. Indeed, 3-month sterling libor closed around 10 per cent. But one discount house dealer said the Bank made life much easier by trading in Bands 3 and 4, which are long dated, rather than alleviating the shortages with repurchase agreements that would be expected to mature within a month. This way, the Bank pushes the next cycle of shortages further out. Period rates reflected the tone of trading. The overnight ended up at 10 3/4 per cent from 7 1/2 per cent on Friday night. The one-week rate finished at 10 5/16 per cent from 9 1/2 per cent, and the one-month rate at 10 1/16 per cent from 9 15/16 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the methodology established by the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, the final hourly user fee rate for FEMA personnel during FY 1993 was calculated at $122.88. On December 13, 1993, a notice to this effect was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 65274). The notice also explained that FEMA would not publish a final rule at that time, pending a reconsideration of the methodology used for FY 1993, taking into consideration the comments received on interim rule 44 CFR part 354. The methodology established by the interim rule 44 CFR part 354 was continued in effect for FY 1994 as noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 26350) published on May 19, 1994. Although the revised interim rule would, if authorized by FEMA's FY 1995 appropriation, be restricted to FY 1995, FEMA reserves the option of reissuing or amending part 354 for other fiscal years provided that appropriate authority is enacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposed revision of 44 CFR part 354, fees for FY 1995 would be assessed at a flat rate based on fiscal year budgeted funds for REP Program services performed by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors whether or not these services directly support NRC licensing requirements. Under Section 354.4, Assessment of Fees, charges for services would be determined by dividing the total amount of funds budgeted for the REP Program, i.e., salaries and expenses, including travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding, by the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites benefiting from REP Program services, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount of funds budgeted for the REP Program would be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per site basis; thus, all sites will be charged the same flat fee. Under this methodology, site-specific and generic services would not be distinguished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the comments in response to interim rule 44 CFR part 354 considered by FEMA were those submitted by the Nuclear Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which has now become part of the Nuclear Energy Institute. In its comments, NUMARC recommended a methodology whereby the hourly rate for FEMA personnel would be determined by dividing that percentage of the total FEMA Salaries and Expenses budget item attributable to site-specific activities by the total number of site-specific hours expended. This hourly rate then would be applied only to site-specific activities performed by FEMA personnel. Site-specific activities performed by contractor personnel would be billed on an actual cost basis. Finally, under the proposed NUMARC methodology, costs for generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contract personnel would be recovered by charging each licensee equally for these activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methodology recommended by NUMARC was considered by FEMA, but the flat fee approach is being proposed instead because a flat fee would: (1) Provide each licensee with a bill early in the fiscal year, thus facilitating the licensee's planning and budgeting process by greatly increasing the predictability of the licensee's bill; (2) enable States and licensees to request needed technical assistance without considering any cost implications associated with site-specific oriented methodologies; (3) benefit the U.S. taxpayer by earlier deposit of funds in the U.S. Treasury; and (4) reduce the FEMA resources required to track administrative costs, thus making the accounting and billing process more efficient and cost-effective for the Government and freeing up FEMA resources for other REP program activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above considerations, FEMA used actual FY 1993 billing data to calculate a flat fee and compared this with the fees that would have been generated using the methodology proposed by NUMARC. Using FY 1993 data, the flat fee (for each site) would have been $149,928. Under the proposed NUMARC methodology, the generic portion of the bill alone for each site would have been $87,702. The site-specific portion, consisting of exercise, plan review, and other site-specific activities, would be added to this amount for the total bill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

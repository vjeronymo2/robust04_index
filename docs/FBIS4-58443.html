			<p>BFN     [Text] President Husni Mubarak has met for the second time  with members of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to  continue his extensive consultations and discussions with them.  The Palestinian side was lead by Yasir 'Arafat while the  Israeli side was lead by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    President Mubarak has been following up on the talks between  the two sides, which lasted for approximately six hours, ending  at 0130 this morning. President Mubarak met with the  delegations immediately afterwards.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement  will be signed today, adding that everything has been resolved.  Dr. Sha'th made these remarks following the Palestinian-Israeli  talks that ended at 0205 this morning.    Regarding the differences that existed between the two  sides,  Sha'th said that solutions were found for all these points, with  the support of President Husni Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He added:  Negotiations always involve give and take and we have reached  an agreement that we are satisfied with.    Concluding his remarks, Sha'th said he was pleased with what  has been achieved. He added that the beginning is always  important because this is the first time in the history of the  Palestinian people that they have had a chance to rule  themselves by themselves on their own territory. He added:  This is not all we want, it is just a start.    Foreign Minister Musa said following the Palestinian-Israeli  talks that the agreement for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles will be signed at 1100 [0800 GMT] this  morning. He added that all the outstanding issues had been  settled and that the details will be made public today. He  added: I will not announce anything on behalf of the  Palestinians or the Israelis. Everything has been discussed in  detail on the maps related to the agreement.    Asked if an agreement has been reached on the size of  Jericho, Musa said that the area of Jericho has been increased  by several kilometers, provided this is taken into consideration  [as heard]. Regarding the guards at the crossing points, Musa  said a certain agreement has been reached over this point.    Musa expressed his happiness at reaching an agreement,  noting  that some insignificant points have been left for a later stage.    Regarding the release of the Palestinian prisoners, Musa  said  this matter was discussed and many of them will be released.  The foreign minister added that the question of territorial  water was also discussed.    On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's role in the  talks, Musa noted that Christopher played a very important role.  Asked if President Mubarak played a role in persuading 'Arafat,  Musa said: President Mubarak has persuaded all parties, not  just 'Arafat, to be flexible.    Asked why President Mubarak spent so many hours in the  negotiations for the first time, Musa said that it is natural  for President Mubarak to be present throughout the duration of  the talks, since Egypt is the country that has been devoting its  efforts to solve the Palestinian issue for more than 40 years.  He added that Egypt is also the host country for the signing  ceremony of this historic agreement between the Palestinians and  Israelis.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 28.9m management buy-out at APV arm APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries, has sold Douglas Machine Corporation to its manage-ment for Dollars 28.9m (Pounds 19.4m) cash. The disposal is the latest undertaken by Mr Clive Strowger. He was appointed chief executive 18 months ago and has launched an extensive restructuring programme to re-focus APV, which expanded rapidly through acquisition in the 1980s. The sale of Minnesota-based Douglas, which manufactures case packing machines and other packaging equipment, follows the divestment of the other packaging businesses, Rose Forgrove in January last year and Ortmann &amp; Herbst in November. Yesterday Mr Strowger said: 'We are concentrating our skills in application and process engineering, automation and project management while manufacturing key components, such as pumps, valves, heat exchangers and homogenisers.' Douglas reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 4m for 1992 and had net assets of Dollars 13.9m at the end of the year. It is being acquired by a newly formed company controlled by Norwest Venture Capital Management together with members of Douglas' senior management who have a minority equity interest. As part of the deal net cash of Dollars 6.9m has been retained by Douglas. APV expects to report a profit on the disposal of about Pounds 9.5m after transaction costs and writing back goodwill of Pounds 1.6m previously written off against reserves. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt.</p>

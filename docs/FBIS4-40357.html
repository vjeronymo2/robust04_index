Three of them will be put in charge of absolutely new  governmental departments founded in accordance with the law on  cabinet activities. Namely, Bronis Bradauskas will be from now  on minister of environmental protection; Vladislavas Domarkas -  minister of science and education (until recently he was deputy  foreign minister); and Dainius Trinkunas - minister of culture  (previously, he was at the head of Ministry of Culture and  Public Education). In accordance with the above-mentioned law,  there will be two separate respective ministries from now on.    Another two newly sworn-in ministers stepped in the shoes of  their predecessors. Sylviculturist Albertas Vasilyauskas will  be minister of forestry and his namesake Aleksandras will be  minister of economics.    Almost all of the new ministers are either members or  supporters of the ruling Democratic Party of Labour.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sales at Roche rise 8% ROCHE, the Swiss healthcare and chemicals group, yesterday reported sales for the first six months up 8 per cent to SFr7.15bn (Dollars 5.1bn) from SFr6.62bn. In local currencies the increase was 10 per cent. The company does not publish half-year profit figures. The company said it expected sales to continue to improve during the second half of the year and that barring unforeseen circumstances, particularly in foreign exchange rates, the group should post a significant increase on last year's net income of SFr1.9bn. Much of the first-half growth was generated by the pharmaceuticals division which reported sales up 12 per cent to SFr1.59bn from SFr1.56bn. Excluding exchange rates, the increase was 14 per cent. The company said the German healthcare reforms introduced in January - which have led to a 13 per cent fall in the market for the first four months - had little impact. Turnover in Italy during the first half improved in spite of the fall in the market following reforms introduced in April. Roche said it expected sales in both Italy and Germany to increase this year. The vitamins and fine chemicals unit lifted sales 2 per cent to SFr1.59bn from SFr1.56bn. Roche said the vitamins business performed well. But the division's results were held up by fine chemicals, and in particular the manufacture of one agrochemical fungicide without which sales would have been up 5 per cent. The diagnostics division posted turnover up 8 per cent to SFr867m from SFr799m. The business profited from the introduction of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technology for HIV and Chlymidia, which had been well received in both the US and Europe. Sales of the fragrances and flavours division increased 4 per cent to SFr749m from SFr723m. Fragrances suffered from poor demand from the luxury perfume sector. Flavours were not affected by the recession and continued to post increases. Lex, Page 14</p>

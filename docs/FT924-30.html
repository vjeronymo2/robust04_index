			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Alternative to City &amp; Commercial liquidation CITY &amp; COMMERCIAL, a split capital investment trust which is set to be wound up in February, has put forward alternative reconstruction proposals. They offer investors the choice of holdings in a new investment trust or in one of two unit trusts managed by Abtrust Unit Trust Managers. They will need to be approved by 75 per cent of shareholders at a meeting on January 15. City &amp; Commercial, which has assets of around Pounds 62m and is managed by Invesco MIM, has two classes of shares - capital and income. The latter get all the income and are entitled to repayment at par value; capital shares are entitled to all the assets once the income shares are repaid. Had the trust been wound up, capital shareholders would have been repaid Pounds 15.50 per share. Under the new proposals, capital holders will be offered shares and warrants in a new investment trust, New City and Commercial, and/or holdings in Abtrust's UK growth unit trust. Since unit trusts trade at asset value, this option will allow holders to realise investments for cash. Income holders will be offered holdings in Abtrust's gilt fund, which can either be realised for cash, or held as a high yielding (9.17 per cent as of yesterday) investment. The new investment trust will have an equal number of ordinary shares (with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis) and debenture stock linked to the RPI. SG Warburg and Panmure Gordon have underwritten up to Pounds 40m of the stock, which will have a yield around 1.5 percentage points above index-linked gilts. The debentures are also available via an open offer at 99p per 100p nominal. Creating a new investment trust will allow shareholders to roll over their investments without incurring an immediate capital gains tax liability.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Three corporations amend directors appointment rules THREE corporations have amended their rules so that executive directors are periodically required to seek shareholder approval of their appointment. Ms Anne Simpson, director of Pensions and Investments Research Consultants, a group which advises shareholders on corporate governance matters, said the three were TSB Plc, British Petroleum and Commercial Union. All three companies insulated executive directors from shareholder endorsement, although TSB required a quarter of its non-executive directors to stand for election each year. The companies are now seeking changes to their articles which will provide for elections for executive directors. Ms Simpson said: 'This is a great step forward for shareholders. The spirit of the Cadbury report is accountability of directors, but these insulation provisions render key executives unaccountable to shareholders.' Other shareholder groups, including the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers, have called for insulation rules to be abandoned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and party chairman Tomiichi  Murayama held a joint news conference on the afternoon of 29 May  following a meeting of the SDPJ Central Committee. During the  news conference, Mr. Kubo made it clear the SDPJ was willing to  consult Prime Minister Hata in advance about the framework of  the next coalition government and the conditions for the SDPJ's  participation if the Hata cabinet voluntarily resigned en masse  in response to the SDPJ's demand.    At the news conference, Mr. Kubo said: "The possibility  cannot be ruled out that Prime Minister Hata will become prime  minister of the third coalition government."    He added: "I believe that if the Hata cabinet resigns en  masse, it will be possible for the SDPJ to discuss with Prime  Minister Hata in advance on the formation of the next coalition  government. If the 1994 budget bill is passed in the House of  Representatives, prospects would be opened for forming the next  coalition government toward the end of the current Diet ordinary  session."    In this way, Mr. Kubo indicated that, depending on Prime  Minister Hata's handling of the general resignation of his  cabinet, the SDPJ would begin talks with him about the formation  of the next coalition government shortly after the passage of  the 1994 budget bill in the House of Representatives.    The SDPJ has criticized Ichiro Ozawa, representative  secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] for the influence  he wields on the coalition government.    At the news conference, a reporter referred to the  relationship between the SDPJ and the next coalition government  and then asked Mr. Kubo: "Will Mr. Ozawa's resignation as  representative secretary of Shinseito be a condition of SDPJ  joining the next coalition government?"    Kubo said: "I have no intention of speaking ill of an  executive of another party. I will, however, speak of the  decision-making process of the ruling coalition parties if I  have to do so."</p>

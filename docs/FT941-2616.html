			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises as blue chips stage late rally Wall Street US blue-chip stocks staged a late rally yesterday as 'triple witching' expiration activity finally overpowered nagging concerns over monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.51 higher at 3,895.65. By contrast, the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a scant 0.16 ahead at 471.06. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite gained 2.33 to 472.96, as the Nasdaq composite, up 0.05 at 803.90, eked out a second consecutive record high. On the NYSE, activity was spirited, with the expiration of stock futures and options on individual stocks and indices lifting volume to 446m, compared with 303m a day earlier. Investors began on a shaky note, amid speculation over the purpose of an unusual meeting between President Clinton and the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan. Although the White House later insisted that monetary policy had not been discussed, the briefing served to intensify the focus on the likelihood of the Fed nudging up short-term rates for a second time next week. With rate worries eating into bond prices, stock indices languished during most of the session. But a final burst of program buying, concentrated on blue-chip cyclical issues, brought the week to a satisfying conclusion. Beneficiaries of the late push included such economically sensitive issues as 3M, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 103 1/4 , General Electric, Dollars 1 7/8 ahead to Dollars 104 7/8 , and Alcoa, Dollars 1 5/8 better at Dollars 77 1/8 . Among the other Dow components, McDonald's appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/4 , Disney gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47, and Chevron closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 92 3/4 . In banking, Citicorp dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 , even though Moody's upgraded the group's debt. The rating service said the move reflected 'the company's improving profitability'. Transportation stocks were among the weakest. UAL, parent of United Airlines, shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 127 5/8 while AMR, parent of American, lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 7/8 . Conrail was marked down Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS BEGINS DESIGNING BAILOUT OF THRIFT INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Congress begins the delicate and complex task today of fashioning the biggest  financial rescue in history, the bailout of the savings and loan industry,  under the threat of a possible presidential veto if it tampers with key  provisions of the plan proposed by the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady warned Wednesday that he will consider  recommending that President Bush veto the bill if Congress weakens the  Administration's proposed tough new capital requirements for S&amp;Ls or if it  includes the full cost of the rescue in the federal budget. Such actions, Brady  told reporters, would be "terrible mistakes."  </P> <P> But Congress is determined to put its own stamp on the legislation, which is  necessary to raise the money needed to close or sell 500 insolvent institutions  across the country and make good on federal insurance of individual deposits up  to $100,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shifting Cost to States  </P> <P> Members of a House Banking subcommittee have prepared 97 proposed amendments to  the Bush plan, which would cost an estimated $157 billion over its first 10  years.  </P> <P> Among the amendments are proposals to require California and Texas, homes of  the biggest S&amp;L failures, to pay some of the financial cleanup costs.  However, these amendments do not appear to have majority support within the  House Banking Committee.  </P> <P> Brady expressed greater concern Wednesday about proposals in Congress to  postpone or dilute the requirement that S&amp;Ls maintain capital reserves  equal to 6% of their assets beginning in 1991, compared to 3% now. Capital  reserves consist largely of stockholders' equity, retained earnings and cash;  the assets are mostly loans.  </P> <P> Brady contended that the tougher capital requirement is essential to ensure  that the S&amp;L crisis will "never happen again. If we give way on the capital  part, we're really asking for it."  </P> <P> But the S&amp;L industry, while stripped of much of its political credibility  by the present financial crisis, apparently retains enough influence to wage a  determined battle against the tighter financial standard.  </P> <P> Sympathetic members of Congress have prepared amendments giving thrift  institutions additional time to meet the stricter capital standards. Industry  executives argue that as many as 1,000 of the nation's solvent 3,000 S&amp;Ls  could disappear because they would be unable to raise the additional funds  necessary to meet the new standard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking a Clean Bill  </P> <P> Brady also warned that financing the S&amp;L bailout with a one-time, up-front  appropriation, which would show up entirely on the federal budget, would "make  a fool out of" the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction goals.  </P> <P> The Administration has recommended that much of the cost of the bailout be met  through a $50-billion bond sale by a new government corporation, with only the  annual interest costs appearing as part of the federal budget.  </P> <P> Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) has proposed  using direct federal financing instead, even though the full cost would  immediately be part of the budget. The annual interest expenses would be an  estimated $4.5 billion less over 30 years, he says, because the Treasury  Department can borrow money more cheaply than the new government corporation  could.  </P> <P> But Brady told reporters that the benefits would be more than offset because  Riegle's approach would swell the federal deficit, which in turn would boost  prevailing interest rates.  </P> <P> Despite Brady's warning of a possible veto, Congress does not seem prepared to  swallow a so-called clean bill -- the Administration's proposal without change.  </P> <P> "What may be a clean deal for the regulators and the industry may well be a  dirty deal for the public," said House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.  Gonzalez (D-Tex.) "A clean bill, by my definition, is one that balances public  costs with public benefits. Let's have that kind of clean bill."  </P> <P> Gonzalez has proposed several amendments that would make mortgage loans at  subsidized low rates available for people with low and moderate incomes. He  also wants to use vacant homes and apartments acquired from insolvent S&amp;Ls  to help alleviate homelessness.  </P> <P> Also at issue in Congress will be the Administration's proposal to jack up the  fees paid by S&amp;Ls for their federal deposit insurance. The S&amp;L industry  has enlisted Riegle's support for requiring banks to pay as much as S&amp;Ls by  the year 2000 for their federal insurance on deposits.  </P> <P> S&amp;Ls now pay an annual fee of $2.08 for every $1,000 in deposits, compared  with bank payments of only 80 cents per $1,000. The Bush plan would narrow the  gap by eventually bringing S&amp;Ls down to $1.80 and banks up to $1.50.  </P> <P> The premiums support the deposit insurance funds, which guarantee the safety of  accounts up to $100,000. The insurance fund for banks is in strong financial  shape, but the S&amp;L fund lacks the cash it will need to close crippled  institutions and pay off their depositors.  </P> <P> The rescue effort proposed by the Administration would draw cash from the  S&amp;L and bank industries and from taxpayers to buttress the insurance fund  and dispose of insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P></p>

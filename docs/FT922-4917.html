			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: JS Pathology agrees Pounds 23m bid as profits shrink to Pounds 1.26m JS PATHOLOGY, the UK's only quoted clinical pathology company, is being bought for Pounds 23.1m by Corning, the US speciality glass and laboratory services group. Corning is offering 175p cash for each of JS share. It will become part of its CLSI laboratory services subsidiary. Dr Jean Shanks, chairman and chief executive, has accepted for her 52.2 per cent of the equity. She and other members of the management will stay on. JS also released results yesterday for the year to March 31. Pre-tax profit, which peaked at just over Pounds 4m in 1987-88, fell from Pounds 2.66m to Pounds 1.26m. A Pounds 1m tax credit after three years of over-provision led to earnings per share of 8.5p before the gain and 16.5p after it, compared with 13.2p. The final dividend is omitted leaving shareholders with 1.8p (5.5p) for the year. Mr Eric Rothbarth, finance director, said the group had assumed no capital allowances when it was in fact entitled to them. Net assets stood at Pounds 13.6m and net debt had risen to Pounds 4.9m after the completion of a Pounds 14.5m investment in new premises at Camden Lock, north London. The disruption and cost of the move, from Harley Street, was one of the reasons for the profits decline over the past two years. Others were cuts in corporate occupational health schemes during the recession, increased competition and a reduced number of clinical trials in the wake of pharmaceutical company mergers. JS came to the USM in 1985 with a market value of just over Pounds 19m and a flotation price of 160p. On the brink of the October 1987 crash, it had soared to 675p. Mr Rothbarth said the company's p/e ratio had tended to run at between 20 and 60, 'making it difficult to value'. Although the group was emerging from a difficult period, the decision to sell would enable the management to 'get down to serious work' after being chased. Corning made the only offer, but there had been interest from other parties and Dr Shanks, at 66, had been keen to see the company 'in safe hands.' Mr Rothbarth added that benefits would follow from liaison with CSLI's laboratories in the US and from doing pathology work for some of its European operations. It was announced on May 26 that JS was in bid talks following a 33 per cent jump in its share price to 153p. In February the price had sunk to 94p. It gained 16p yesterday to close at 170p.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Mercury set for large job losses Mercury, the UK telephone company operated by Cable &amp; Wireless, will today announce job losses of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of its 11,400 workforce, Clive Cookson writes. Lord Young, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman, warned last month that 'a substantial cost and headcount reduction programme' would be required to prepare Mercury for a more competitive telecommunications market. Details of the cuts are to be given this morning in briefings to the workforce, stock market analysts and journalists. Although unions are prepared for 1,100 jobs to go, some analysts believe the cuts will eventually exceed 2,000 over a number of years. Mercury's half-yearly results, released last month, surprised analysts by showing a Pounds 3m decline in operating profits to Pounds 96m in the six months to September 30, although turnover rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 797m. Although Mercury is gaining customers, most of the growth is coming from the residential sector rather than the more profitable business sector.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] leader Clarence  Makwetu held talks with President F.W. de Klerk. Mr. Makwetu  said afterwards that the PAC was considering the working  structures of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. He said  the PAC wanted to address the escalating violence in the country  and to resolve the issue of indemnity for its returning exiles.    [Begin recording] [Makwetu] They suggested that we look into  the documentation of the TEC and see whether it will be possible  for us to join the subcouncils of the TEC in order to solve such  problems.    [De Klerk] We suggested that the PAC should fully normalize  its position by now signing the necessary documentation,  abandoning violence, and not merely suspending it, and becoming  part of the TEC and the transitional structures.

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COSMONAUT SPACE EFFECTS MINIMAL  </P> <P> Two cosmonauts who spent a year in space suffered fewer physical effects than  expected, and there do not appear to be any barriers to even longer missions,  Soviet space specialists said today.  </P> <P> "Longer flights, we believe, are quite possible, and we think they will be  carried out," Anatoly Grigoryev, director of the Institute of Bio-Medical  Problems of the Soviet Health Ministry, told a news conference. Grigoryev said  cosmonauts Musa Manarov and Vladimir Titov, who returned to Earth on Dec. 21,  suffered some atrophy of their calf muscles and some loss of calcium, as have  other cosmonauts, but an exercise and training program lessened the effects.  </P></p>

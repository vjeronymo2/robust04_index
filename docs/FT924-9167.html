			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki's surge confounds investors - A rally was to be expected after a dismal three years The Helsinki Stock Exchange has put in an extraordinary run over the last two months, with the Hex index rising by more than 50 per cent since its 5 1/2 -year low of 548 registered on September 4. On two consecutive days earlier this week the index jumped by 5 per cent; after profit-taking yesterday it closed 11 points down at 827.6. After three years of steadily falling share prices, a rally was to be expected. Most observers, however, have been caught out by the strength of the surge, particularly as economic fundamentals have not altered that dramatically. For many, the big question now is when the downward correction will come. Much of the impetus for the recent rally has come from a steep downward trend in interest rates in the last month. The key three-month Helibor rate has fallen from more than 16 per cent to 11.6 per cent. The relaxation of monetary policy is the direct result of reduced pressure on the markka, following the announcement of the government's austerity programme on October 14. Until the measures were announced, interest rates had to be kept high to protect the currency as international confidence in the Finnish currency had been badly eroded by the government's decision to float the markka on September 8. Observers acknowledge that the stock market is anticipating an improvement in the Finnish economy. 'This is more of a hope than a fact,' says Mr Juhani Erma, head of the Finnish stock exchange. Nevertheless, there are indications that the economy is at least on the turn. The recent batch of eight-month figures from the corporate sector have revealed reduced losses if not actual profits - at least for export-orientated companies, which have benefited from the two devaluations. At the same time the Finance Ministry has come out with a report that suggests the economy is 'regaining its balance', spurred by an expected 2 per cent increase in GNP next year and a strong rise in exports. Other factors are also at work. One is the liberalisation of the rules on foreign share ownership which will take effect on January 1, 1993. This move, which removes the distinction between free and restricted shares, is expected to prompt a big increase in foreign buying, as international equity portfolios are adjusted to the new situation. Another factor is the planned overhaul of the tax system, which will improve the attraction of investing in equities, while making it less advantageous to have money on deposit in the bank. One of the most striking aspects of the recent equity rally has been the sharp rise in turnover. During the summer, trading volumes of just FM20m (Dollars 4m) a day were typical. Recently, however, turnover has regularly been in the FM50m to FM100m range. The group to benefit most from the upturn has been the banking sector, which has jumped 101 per cent over the last month. But it is a special case, partly because bank share prices had fallen so low, and partly because there is a highly speculative element to the current buying interest. It is certainly no indication that the sector's problems are over. Two other groups which stand out are metals, up 44.8 per cent this year, and forestry, up 14.9 per cent on the back of improved international competitiveness following the devaluations. The cynical will suggest that it has all happened too quickly. No major corporate reports or key economic indicators are due out in the next two weeks, so it is hard to see where further sustenance will come from in the immediate future. Some would say a relapse was inevitable, perhaps even in the next few days. The biggest cloud on the horizon is the current negotiations over 1993 wage levels. It remains to be seen if the government's proposal to freeze wages will be accepted by the unions, in view of the expected sharp fall in disposable incomes as a result of the austerity package. If the government has to back down to any significant extent, the markka could once again be under pressure. That could force interest rates back up and sink stock market confidence almost as fast as it has risen.</p>

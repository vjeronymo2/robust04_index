			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Crown offers deal in ferry dispute THE CROWN Estate yesterday attempted to settle a dispute which threatened to close one of the oldest ferry services in Europe by offering a new franchise to the operator. The Crown Estate, which manages property on behalf of the sovereign and owns the ancient rights to the Tilbury-Gravesend river crossing on the Thames, east of London, has abandoned plans to increase the annual licence fee from Pounds 200 to Pounds 9,000. White Horse Ferries, the operator, has been offered a 150-year franchise at a fixed annual fee of Pounds 200. The proposed terms were welcomed yesterday as a partial victory for the ferry operator, which last month suspended services from Tilbury after Crown Estate warnings that it was breaching the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' on the river. However, the company said: 'We are continuing talks with the Crown Estate commissioners. We are still not satisfied.' The dispute centres on the right to operate the service, which White Horse purchased last year from Sealink Stena, the ferry operator. The Crown Estate said Sealink Stena's franchise was non-transferable. Franchises from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign. White Horse owns the rights for services in one direction only, from Gravesend to Tilbury. The Crown Estate said it would be 'amazed' if White Horse turned down its 'generous' offer.</p>

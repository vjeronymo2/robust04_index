			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REDEVELOPMENT GETS MIXED REVIEWS IN  HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> The people of Hollywood have given the Community Redevelopment Agency decidedly  mixed reviews over its handling of the massive redevelopment of the city's  movie capital over the last two years.  </P> <P> During a state-mandated biennial field hearing at the Hollywood Roosevelt  Thursday evening, redevelopment agency officials heard speeches and critiques  from more than 75 residents, activists, city administrators and advisers about  the agency's performance in engineering the planned restoration.  </P> <P> The CRA's seven commissioners also approved a landmark social plan to earmark  up to $92 million over the 30-year life of the plan to deal with the most  pressing needs in Hollywood.  </P> <P> But, as expected, the more than 300 people who showed up at the sometimes  raucous meeting were there to speak their minds about the redevelopment plan,  perhaps the most beleaguered renewal project in the agency's history.  </P> <P> Several scuffles erupted when recalcitrant speakers refused to yield the  microphone and were led from the podium by police, with one confrontation  spilling out into the posh hotel lobby. Protest signs such as "CRA:  Blood-sucking leaches" (sic) were prominently displayed, but attendees were  mostly well-behaved, in contrast to the noisy, jeering crowd that shouted down  CRA supporters at the first biennial meeting in 1988.  </P> <P> Some at Thursday's meeting sharply criticized the CRA for failing to respond to  residents' concerns about the crime, violence and general urban decay that has  plagued the 1,100-acre section of Hollywood that makes up the redevelopment  district.  </P> <P> But others said redevelopment is needed to restore Hollywood to its former  glory, and that the CRA is doing its best to engineer the renewal in the face  of contentious protest groups who have filed lawsuits to block it.

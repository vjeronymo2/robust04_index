			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political observer Yuriy Lepskiy: "`Essentially </F> Reform Is Only Starting Now,' Aleksandr Livshits, Leader of the  Russian President's Group of Experts, Stated at a Kremlin  Briefing"]    [Text] Yesterday President Yeltsin signed six edicts which  begin a new stage in the economic reform. The president's new  edicts contain a number of clauses which can only be described  as sensational. They include the repeal of quotas and licenses  for deliveries for export. A whole tribe of officials who used  to receive bribes for issuing licenses and quotas will remain  without "under the counter" earnings. A special edict of the  president has put taxes in order. It is planned to reduce their  number and to lower them by 10-20 percent. A preferential tax  regime is being introduced for enterprises with foreign  investments, only in the production sphere, it is true.    The creation of new federal state enterprises is ending.  Some of the existing ones will be transformed into public  enterprises. The president's edicts also provide for the  introduction of order in clearing operations.    In Aleksandr Livshits' opinion this is the start of a  fundamental reform in the state sector economy about which a lot  has been said recently but for whose reform they have not had  time, being engaged in political battles. This stage of the  reform, he believes, has become possible only with the advent of  relative political stability in Russia and the president's  edicts are nothing other than the literal execution of the  commitments he assumed under the social accord treaty.</p>

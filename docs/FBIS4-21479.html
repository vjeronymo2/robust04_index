			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Johanna Mannila: ``Carbon Dioxide Committee </F> Calls for Effective Energy Conservation: Enduring Forest Policy,  Modernized Autos, More Research, and Restoration of Marshes to  Natural State, on Wish List"]    [Text] Active and enthusiastic energy conservation programs  will increase in Finland if the Second Carbon Dioxide  Committee's recommendations are implemented. The committee  considered ways of decreasing Finland's carbon dioxide emissions  to conform to the Rio pact.    In addition to effective energy conservation and an enduring  forest policy, the committee wants to modernize autos, increase  research on energy, and restore drained marshes to their natural  state. The generation of carbon dioxide emissions will also be  prevented by cutting down on waste.    The committee also proposes an increase in the protection of  large timber stands and old forests and that trees be allowed to  grow older than they are at present. Forests serve to absorb  carbon dioxide, that is, trees bind the carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere to themselves.    In the committee's opinion, making more efficient use of our  forests would only slightly lessen the role of absorption. The  committee estimates that the amount of growing timber in areas  used by the forest industry will increase from 1.8 billion cubic  meters to about 2.05 billion by the year 2000 if logging  operations remain at their present level.    The amount of carbon contained in the entire timber stand  would increase from about 600 million tons to about 730 million.  The average amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during this period  would be over 40 million tons a year, whereas the figure was  about 27 million tons in the late 1980's. Absorption problems  will only arise if logging operations rise to over 70 million  cubic meters a year.  <H5>  Rio Agreement Goes Into Effect Next Month </H5>   According to the agreement on climate concluded in Rio in  1992, emissions of greenhouse gases must be stabilized by the  turn of the century and restored to their 1990 level.    The agreement is to go into effect in a month since 50  countries have ratified it. Ratification is pending in Finland,  but parliament will decide on the matter this spring.    The committee submitted its proposal to Environment Minister  Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) on Friday [4 February]. ``It is  not impossible to achieve this goal, although the target set for  the industrial nations is a very exacting one. We need long-term  decisions on energy taxes based on carbon dioxide,'' Pietikainen  said. According to her, we must advance at the pace of the other  industrial nations in adopting taxes so that Finland's ability  to compete will not suffer.    According to Pietikainen, just as with investments in  [cleaning up] the environment made in Estonia and Russia,  projects involving reforestation in developing countries will  probably be chalked up to Finland's credit when each country's  carbon dioxide balance sheet is determined. The countries that  have ratified the agreement on climate will decide on the matter  in future follow-up negotiations. Pietikainen estimated that the  reduction of carbon dioxide in neighboring areas by perhaps 2  million tons would count in Finland's favor.    The committee does not reject the alternative of additional  nuclear power, even though parliament did decide to rule out  construction of a fifth nuclear power plant. The chairman of the  committee, Jorma Routti, stated that there would be a need for  resorting to the nuclear alternative in Finland in the long run.    Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas; the  others are CFC compounds, methane, and nitrous oxide.    Finland produced 58 millon tons of carbon dioxide emissions  in 1990. All greenhouse gases totaled about 80 million tons.  Nearly 30 million tons of carbon dioxide are bound in forests  every year.  <H5>  No Simple Solution </H5>   The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere may alter the earth's climate and natural  environment. There are no simple ways of solving the greenhouse  problem: Simple solutions are not enough. The committee  summarized its proposal in 17 points:     -  Implement a government energy conservation program.    -  Adopt taxes on carbon dioxide in such a way that our ability  to  compete internationally is not weakened.    -  Subsidies for investments that conserve energy.    -  Research and development on more efficient production of  energy.    -  Modernize cars, more public transportation.    -  Research on community structure.    -  More natural gas.    -  An increase in the use of bioenergy, that is, wood.    -  Maintain a willingness to use more nuclear power if this  meets  with public approval.    -  Restoration of drained marshes to their natural state.    -  Reduce community waste.    -  Reduce the need for fertilizers, whereupon nitrous oxide  emissions will decrease.    -  Increase the use of incineration technology and exhaust gas  conversion devices.    -  See to it that forest carbon reserves increase and that the  carbon stored in forests and marshes is not released into the  atmosphere.    -  Support research on the total amounts of greenhouse gases and  the amounts absorbed.    -  Active cooperation with Estonia and Russia to conserve energy  and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    -  Promote reforestation, restoration, and energy projects in  connection with aid for development.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carbon Dioxide Emissions Due to Energy Production and Use in Finland in 1990 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source                                |Amount (millions of tons)             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry                              |23                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Households                            |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Services                              |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Traffic                               |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other                                 |2.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Carbon Dioxide Committee's second report, 1994.                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

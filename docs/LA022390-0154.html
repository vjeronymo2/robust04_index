			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CLOUD FORMS OVER 72ND RACE  </P> <P> Democrat Jerry Yudelson hoped to turn the brown malathion mist into political  gold Thursday as he launched his campaign against Republican Assemblyman Curt  Pringle by attacking the incumbent's response to the controversial medfly  spraying.  </P> <P> But the issue of helicopters spraying pesticide over Garden Grove's 72nd  Assembly District loomed as a possible major issue between all three candidates  in the race, as each strongly protested the malathion spraying Thursday and  emphasized the steps he is taking to halt its use.  </P> <P> Immediately after the first of two late-night sprayings over Garden Grove,  Yudelson said he organized a citizens opposition group to fight the use of the  pesticide.  </P> <P> "I've testified against the spraying more than half a dozen times; I've written  letters to the community newspapers, and now I am organizing a campaign to  pressure the state commissioner of food and agriculture to come here to Orange  County and hold hearings on this issue," Yudelson said at a press conference in  Garden Grove.  </P> <P> "Where, we might ask, has our state Assemblyman Curt Pringle been during all of  this?" he said. "We haven't seen him at a single public hearing on the issue.  We were told early on that he wrote a letter to the governor expressing  concern. . . . Big deal."  </P> <P> Pringle said Thursday evening that Yudelson is "just dead wrong about my  response."  </P> <P> The freshman assemblyman said he has supported two bills to regulate the  spraying, including one Democrat-led proposal that would halt the spraying  until the governor's health panel rules that malathion is safe.  </P> <P> "The people who are running for office against me are coming in and saying,  'Look at the wonderful things I am doing for you,' and all they're doing is  attending rallies," Pringle said.  </P> <P> Democrat Tom Umberg, a candidate in the June 5 primary against Yudelson, said  Thursday that he also opposes the spraying and that he agrees that Pringle's  response has been weak.  </P> <P> Umberg said he is working with Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) -- whose  district is also being sprayed -- to make sure "Orange County is included in  any effort to stop the spraying."  </P> <P> "We've been bouncing around various suggestions . . . everything from  overflight height limitations to restricting the helicopters from taking off at  Orange County airports," Umberg said. "My house is being sprayed too, and I  have three little kids. I am concerned."  </P> <P> The race for the 72nd Assembly District is shaping up as one of the most hotly  contested campaigns in Orange County during the 1990 election cycle.  </P> <P> Umberg has the backing of some of the county's most wealthy and influential  Democratic Party leaders. Yudelson has been endorsed by Orange County  Democratic Chairman Michael Balmages, who was at his side at the press  conference.  </P> <P> Yudelson, who ran unsuccessfully against Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove)  in 1988, is an environmental consultant and a former state environmental  officer under former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Umberg is a former U.S. attorney.  </P> <P> Yudelson also said Thursday that he would run his race against Pringle, and not  against a fellow Democrat.  </P> <P> Both Democrats have promised to attack Pringle for his role in the decision to  place uniformed guards at several polling places in Latino neighborhoods on  Election Day in 1988. Federal and local agencies are investigating whether it  violated the voters' civil rights.  </P></p>

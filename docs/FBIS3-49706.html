Only if the project were joined by Russia, some security  zone  could be envisaged, Miklosko said. If, however, the situation  in Russia radicalizes through an increase in Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's power, the joint security project would be just a  formality again, Miklosko stated.    The fact that British Prime Minister John Major and German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to mention Slovakia among  candidates for NATO membership was not accidental, Miklosko  said, adding that conflicts with ethnic Hungarians, political  instability, some statements by politicians, in particular by  Premier Vladimir Meciar, and Slovakia's endangered democracy are  the reasons for this.    The opposition Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR),  however,  assesses the Prague meeting of the Visegrad Four with Clinton  positively, AD SR Chairman Milan Knazko told journalists today.    He said that he did not conceive Partnership for Peace as a  final solution, but as a great opportunity for the future, since  cooperation by the Visegrad countries could speed up their  admission into NATO.    Knazko also said that statements such as that by Transport  Minister Roman Hofbauer, published in the pro-Meciar daily  REPUBLIKA, "the Czech Republic is changing, whether it wants to  or not, from the European heart into the final part of the  European digestive tract," do not help improve Czech-Slovak  relations. Knazko noted that the AD SR would support the effort  by the KDH to dismiss Hofbauer.</p>

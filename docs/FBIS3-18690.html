The opposition, on the  other hand, accuses the government of hindering an upturn  through omissions and implementing inappropriate measures. That  was the tenor of a five-hour debate in the Bundestag on economic  policy and the government's action program for more growth and  employment. The debate was heavily influenced by election  campaigning. Despite skeptical statements from economic  associations and institutes, Economics Minister Rexrodt stressed  that the government expected the economy to grow by 1.5 percent  this year. He pointed to the increasing number of orders from  abroad and "an astounding level of demand in the construction  sector." In view of the high level of unemployment, the  economics minister appealed to the parties to collective  agreements to display restraint in discussing their differences.  A strike "is the last thing that we need now."    The Social Democratic Party of Germany's [SPD] main speaker,  Saarland's Minister-President Oskar Lafontaine, said that wage  cuts and wage freezes were completely inappropriate in the  current economic climate. The result would be a further  reduction in consumption and higher unemployment. In addition,  recipients of low incomes would find themselves in an even more  difficult situation. Pensions will also have to be reduced next  year. Lafontaine accused the government of failure. In view of  the weakness of consumption and the low level of investment, the  Federal Government should not have raised any excise taxes and  it should support medium-sized business in particular. Instead  of that, the government canceled the equity capital assistance  fund in 1991, and now, shortly before the elections, it wants to  reintroduce it. It has canceled further training for budding  master craftsmen. By contrast, the SPD wants to reduce  ancillary wage costs and do more for medium-sized business.  Lafontaine, like SPD Bundestag Group economics spokesman Jens,  called on the Bundesbank to further reduce interest rates  despite the substantial increase in the money supply that was  recently reported. Jens went on to say that a strike is indeed  not desirable, but if it does come to that, then it is Rexrodt's  fault, because he has completely aroused vain hopes.    The deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, Faltlhauser,  accused Lafontaine of playing "a dishonest game." Speaking in  the Bundestag, he said that the minister-president of Saarland  was only opposed to a wage freeze for election campaign reasons,  while in negotiations on a public sector collective agreement,  Saarland was supporting employers demands for a wage freeze.  The CDU/CSU Group's economics spokesman, Haungs, was confident  that several hundred thousand jobs would be created over the  next few years.    Companies have begun to enter new markets with new products.  The Federal Government's action program, which Haungs described  as optimistic, would aid the formation of companies and the  creation of new jobs, including part-time jobs. The SPD, on the  other hand, wants to waste billions. Haungs recalled the  planned "Ecological Modernization" future investment program,  under which the Social Democrats wanted to spend 10 billion  German marks within 10 years. In addition, there would be  additional subsidies for the steel industry, modernization  loans, and assistance to promote exports. "What the SPD is  planning is redistribution, not growth," concluded Haungs.    Free Democratic Party [FDP] economics spokesman Count  Lambsdorff took the same line and in addition attacked SPD  chairman Scharping. Scharping is a "master at not having a  clear political profile," who says one thing today and something  different tomorrow. Thus, he promised coal subsidies in Dortmund  and the abolition of the coal pfennig in Hannover in one  weekend. "He is like master juggler Rastelli," said Lambsdorff:  "We are longing to see how many more balls Mr. Scharping will  produce." The SPD is promising every citizen his own assistance  program. They extend from research and technology, through the  restructuring of east German companies and reducing the burden  on reinvested taxable profits, to a uniform child allowance.  However, Lambsdorff also criticized the CDU/CSU. It makes one  think that at its Hamburg convention, the CDU sacrificed the  "social market economy" trade mark to the mood of the times.  Referring to Chancellor Kohl, Lambsdorff said that whoever  maintains that coal, agriculture, and shipbuilding "cannot be  judged according to free market criteria and even speaks of  future development in this context is very far away from Ludwig  Erhard." He criticized CDU/CSU demands for nursing assistance  insurance paid for by contributions from employers and  employees, taxes on people without children as well an industry  policy involving supervision, protectionism, and the formation  of cartels through a technology council. Lambsdorff also  rejected Haungs demand that the money currently used for coal  subsidies should be used for the creation of new jobs. One  should not set some kind of new subsidy carousel in motion.  Despite his criticism, Lambsdorff said that the FDP would  continue to support the CDU/CSU.    While Alliance 90/Greens Deputy Schulz called the latest  government annual economic report "a report produced by the  blind, deaf, and dumb," the chairman of the Economics Committee,  Ost (CDU), said he considered the government's assessment to be  correct. Ost accused the SPD of "having misgivings" about  everything that is new. He recalled the Social Democrats  opposition to nuclear energy and the Transrapid train project.  Ost and Jens then argued about the level of state debt. Ost  praised the coalition for ensuring that the federal debt had  only doubled since 1982, while when the SPD was in government,  the level of federal debt increased -- albeit from a very low  level -- five-fold.</p>

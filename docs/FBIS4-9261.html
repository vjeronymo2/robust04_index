			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] "Intensive" talks between Slovenia and  Croatia have resulted in the signing by the Slovene and Croatian  prime ministers, Janez Drnovsek and Nikica Valentic, of a  package of agreements on cooperation in various fields (Zagreb  Radio, 7 February). According to the 25 March Maribor daily  VECER, seven of these Slovene-Croatian agreements were ratified  by the Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly on 24 March.    Describing the proceedings in the Croatian Assembly, VECER  reports that agreements on maritime fishing, reciprocal  implementation of court decisions, legal aid to citizens,  establishment and authority of joint bodies to examine and  delineate borders, economic and trade relations and cooperation,  employment, and cooperation in culture and education were  adopted without debate. One deputy, the paper reports, raised  the issue of layoffs of Croats working in Slovenia and another,  a representative of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ], requested an explanation regarding the rights of Croats  living in Slovenia. Croats in Slovenia do not have the status of  an ethnic minority, VECER points out, and are therefore not  entitled to rights, such as education in their native language,  granted to the recognized minorities: Italians and Hungarians.  An article in the 31 March issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK  analyzing Croatian-Slovene economic relations comments that the  joint commission of the two countries' Chambers of Commerce "is  not active enough." The article reports that this was also the  opinion of a Slovene economic delegation headed by Vojka Ravbar,  state secretary of the Ministry for Economic Relations and  Development, that visited Zagreb in March to discuss "unresolved  questions" of bilateral trade. Explaining the decline in  bilateral trade, the Slovene delegation stated that Slovene  firms had been looking elsewhere for partners, because of cases  in which Croatian firms had failed to fulfill contractual  obligations. The delegation cited the lack of an agreement on a  free trade zone as another negative factor in economic  relations, noting that Slovenia had signed such agreements with  the Czech and Slovak Republics and was in the process of doing  so with Hungary. The latter agreement was signed on 6 April,  according to a Budapest Kossuth Radio report of the same day.    Judging by the statements of the Slovene delegation, VJESNIK  concluded, the two sides agree that problems with  denationalization and privatization had "slowed" economic  development in both countries and contributed to problems in  bilateral trade. The sides reported "dissatisfaction" with the  state of bilateral trade and viewed the "politicization" of  economic problems as especially detrimental to cooperation. An  analysis of Slovene-Croatian economic relations in the 29  January issue of the major Ljubljana daily DELO reports that  trade with Croatia had declined from $8.2 billion in 1990 to  less than $1.5 billion in 1993. Croatia is Slovenia's  third-largest trading partner, following Germany and Italy;  Slovenia holds the same rank among Croatia's trading partners.  Trade is unbalanced, however, DELO notes, with Slovenia having a  "considerable" trade surplus with Croatia. In spite of such  negative trends, the paper observes, Slovene economists view  trade with Croatia as important to Slovenia's own economic  well-being. In this context, DELO cites economist Dr. Franjo  Stiblar's observation that "Croatia remains an important and  interesting trading partner for us... and it is to be hoped that  Croatia will succeed in stabilizing its economy, since that  would also have a favorable effect on the revival of Slovenia's."</p>

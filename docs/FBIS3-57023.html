After a prolonged conversation between the two countries'  leaders in the Elysee Palace there was a ceremonial signing of  the French-Georgian treaty, which will create the legal  framework for the future relations of cooperation between the  two countries. After this, Eduard Shevardnadze signed on  Georgia's behalf the Paris Charter for a New Europe - the basic  document of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe, marking the end of the Cold War and proclaiming the  principle of the settlement of all conflicts by peaceful means.    The conclusion of the treaty between France and Georgia  means  that we are establishing special relations of cooperation and  interaction between us, Francois Mitterrand said at the signing  ceremony. Today Georgia is encountering significant  difficulties of a political and economic nature, and it can  count on the solidarity of its friends, the French president  noted. We face interaction in Europe, which is now being built  anew, and both our countries bear responsibility for the success  of this, the French head of state said.    The signing of today's documents represents a historic  moment  for Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze said in his reply. Today we  are going through a difficult period, but I believe in Georgia's  future, and it is linked above all with the fact that we have  friends in the world, the Georgian leader said. We arrived in  Paris with great hopes, and I must say that these hopes have  come true. Today we are opening a new page in the relations  between our countries, the head of the Republic of Georgia said.    Eduard Shevardnadze summed up the initial results of his  visit to France at a news conference today. The main aims of  the visit are to establish normal relations with France and  discuss the most important political problems with its leader,  and these have been achieved, he said. France, he remarked, has  promised aid for Georgia in various fields, including by taking  an active role with Russia, the United States and Germany in the  work by states friendly to Georgia to find a way of resolving  the Abkhazia conflict.    Georgia is placing particular emphasis on developing  relations with Russia, Eduard Shevardnadze said. He stressed  that there are high hopes in his country for the visit to  Tbilisi by President Yeltsin, scheduled for early February. I  hope that these hopes are justified, he said.    I spent much time with my French counterpart discussing the  new Russia and its new role in the world, meaning in the  post-communist period, Eduard Shevardnadze remarked in reply to  a question from ITAR-TASS. We noted that this role can only be  performed if Russia takes a democratic path, he commented. We  believe the adoption of a new Russian constitution to be a  significant event and attach great importance to the part that  the country's presidency can play in guaranteeing democracy, the  Georgian head of state said.</p>

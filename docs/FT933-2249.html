			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: The 'wrong man' wins at Leeds - Piano competition There was a melodramatic surprise-ending to the final round of the Harveys Leeds International Pianoforte Competition this weekend: on the official jury's vote, the wrong man won. Popular myth says that Leeds often picks the wrong man (no woman has won yet). But popular myth is wrong: since the 1966 contest, when Hans Keller detonated a public row about his fellow-jurors preferring flashy Rafael Orozco over the deeply musical Victoria Postnikova, there have been just two years, 1981 and 1984, when there was serious doubt about the winner's superiority - arguable superiority, anyway - to some of the runners-up. This time, however, the lucky 'wrong man' was Ricardo Castro, a 28-year-old Brazilian with strong fingers and sound tempi, good sense and good taste, but little evident personality. For the finals he chose Beethoven's monumental 'Emperor' Concerto - a strange competition-choice. Alone among Beethoven's piano concerti, it was not composed for himself as soloist, for by then he was deaf. Roughly speaking, either you can play it or you can't (Castro could); if you can, it still takes a major artist to give it an individual stamp, and this pianist did not. Just as in his semi-final recital - his excellent Schumann let down by an un-buoyant finale, his thrill-free Liszt - Castro met all the requirements creditably but delivered no bonuses. Nothing to challenge the wit and brilliance of Leon McCawley's Beethoven First; still less the mature breadth, power and deep feeling of Mark Anderson's Brahms First; and both those artists had offered memorable playing in the semi-finals too. Either the jury (mostly piano-teachers, including Castro's own) was prescient beyond our ken, in which case he may learn to open up and become exciting while he fulfils all the engagements that now await him; or else, as one suspects, he was a compromise choice. BBC2 outdid itself. Do viewers realise how vastly better such BBC coverage is than comparable TV elsewhere? The camera-work was faultless, the editing geared faithfully to the progress of the music (director: Rodney Greenberg). The composer Michael Berkeley was again a canny, sympathetic presenter, the pianist Paul Crossley a perceptive - and bracingly candid - unofficial assessor of the performances. Mischievously, BBC2 held its own phone-in ballot: of about 35,000 votes 12,000 went to Anderson, 10,000 to McCawley and 6,000 to Maxim Philippov - but Berkeley was too polite to report the remainder. Young Philippov played Rakhmaninov's Third Concerto with splendid passion and very few rough patches, more impressive than most of his solo recital earlier. Justifiably, he won the Rakhmaninov prize donated by the composer's grandson. Margarita Schevchenko was charming in the Beethoven First, still employing her all-purpose expressive manner (after the climactic note in most phrases a swift wilt, ever so delicate). Filippo Gamba offered a sturdy Beethoven Third, somewhat dour. For all these pianists Rattle was a superbly supportive, creative partner - abetted by the CBSO's first oboe, who is a treasure.</p>

			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (1): The shape of things to come Floating down a Venetian canal or walking under the arched ceilings of a medieval cathedral could all happen in the not-too-distant future without the traveller leaving the armchair - see picture, right. By holding a spaceball - that replaces the remote control pad - the armchair traveller can explore the world through a virtual reality interface and enhanced three-dimensional-type pictures on the home TV. This futuristic tourism is just one of the TV-based home services being developed by BT Laboratories at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich in Suffolk. Known as VRHS (for virtual reality home services), engineers are working on a range of intuitive interfaces that could transform the way that TV is viewed.</p>

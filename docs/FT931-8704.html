			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown signals shift in economic strategy MR GORDON BROWN yesterday shifted decisively the ground on which Labour will formulate its economic strategy by stressing that the advancement of individual opportunity would lie at the heart of its plans for economic regeneration. Confirming his party's determination to drop the tax and spending policies judged to have cost it the last election, Mr Brown argued that economic and industrial modernisation could only be achieved by advancing individual opportunity. In an attempt to sideline past Conservative attacks on Labour's tax plans and to defuse internal party debates about the respective roles of the public and private sector, the shadow chancellor unveiled what he termed 'the new economics of individual potential'. Mr Brown, whose strategy was endorsed earlier this week by the shadow cabinet, said Britain's relative economic decline could not be attributed to governments choosing the wrong exchange or interest rates or spending and borrowing too much or too little. 'The real problem is our limited capacity for sustainable economic growth which in turn arises from a failure to invest in the future of Britain and in individual potential,' he said. He said Labour's approach would from now on be guided by the principle that the main enemy of growth is 'simply the failure to employ the skills energies and talents of the people'. Against that background, Labour should approach tax and spending without 'a prior disposition in favour of either,' he argued. 'We are not against wealth. We are against poverty and the unfair waste of individual potential'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah, Hani Naqshabandi, Salih Qallab, </F> and Hanan al-Badri: "Sanaa: Aden Is a Must, Even If the War  Continues"]    [Excerpts] While Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN  secretary general, continues to race against time to avert what  he described as a big tragedy that would afflict Yemen if the  fighting between northern and southern forces is not halted,  Yemeni Defense Minister Colonel 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi has stated that  Sanaa is determined to enter Aden. He also stressed that the  leadership in the north is discussing how to storm the city  without harming its residents. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, member of the General People's  Congress General Committee, has revealed that Sanaa has made  contacts with Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders whom it  described as moderate both before and after the war broke out.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-'Anasi listed the  names of some of these leaders. They include Salim Salih  Muhammad, the No. 2 in the YSP, and Dr. Yasir Sa'id Nu'man,  chairman of the Central Committee secretariat.    Al-'Anasi said that Sanaa is offering concessions "from a  strong position and for the sake of sparing Yemeni blood." He  stressed that Sanaa's basic conditions still stand, especially  with regard to incriminating the 16 people who declared and have  perpetuated the secession, including YSP leader 'Ali Salim  al-Bid and Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas.    But 'Ali Salih 'Abbad Muqbil, member of the YSP Political  Bureau and member of the Yemeni parliament speakership, has  stressed that Sanaa knows that there are concessions it is going  to make regarding these people. However, he ruled out the YSP's  backtracking on the decision to secede.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Muqbil said that the  appointment of northerners in the new Aden government confirms  that the YSP does not rule out the possibility of returning to  unity once again.    He said that the state proclaimed in the south is a  preparation for a new state under unity.    He stressed that Sanaa tacitly agrees to the presence of  international observers, but it fears that that might perpetuate  the secession. [passage omitted]</p>

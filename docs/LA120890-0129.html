			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN FINDS THE GAME IT EXPECTED AT LSU  </P> <P> Bob Boyd keeps doing favors for Dale Brown. Nineteen years ago, when Boyd was  men's basketball coach at Southern Cal, he turned down the LSU job and instead  recommended Brown. And in the five years he was coach at Mississippi State,  from 1981-86, Boyd lost to Brown and LSU eight of 10 times.  </P> <P> Then last summer, Boyd called Brown and asked if his Chapman College team could  come to Baton Rouge and play LSU.  </P> <P> Despite Chapman's Division II status, Brown said yes, and the inevitable  happened Friday night:  </P> <P> The Tigers, ranked 18th, shredded the Panthers, 101-68, before a paid crowd of  11,488 in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.  </P> <P> "It only clearly points out what good friends we are and how long we go back  together," Boyd said. "I'm talking about since the '50s."  </P> <P> LSU won for the third time in a row to improve to 3-1; Chapman lost its third  consecutive game to drop to 3-3.  </P> <P> For LSU, this was a tuneup for today's game against No. 2 Arizona. Chapman  plays today in Lake Charles, La., against 1-4 McNeese State, a Southland  Conference school.  </P> <P> "This game went about how I thought it would," Boyd said. "It fairly well  depicted the relative strengths of the two teams. We might have been a little  gun-shy early."  </P> <P> What the Panthers understood was that to get to the basket, they had to go past  Shaquille O'Neal, LSU's 7-1 sophomore center. In most cases, they didn't.  O'Neal had six blocks -- three in each half -- and was a major reason Chapman  shot just 39.7% from the field.  </P> <P> O'Neal played just 20 minutes and led LSU with 18 points and a game-high 16  rebounds.  </P> <P> Chapman was led by 6-4 junior Roger Middleton, who scored a game-high 22  points. Andre Hill, a 6-2 senior, scored 14 points and had seven rebounds.  </P> <P> "Bob's team is a little tiny small-college team, but they tried to execute as  best they could," Brown said.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to run the score up, and yet I was afraid of cutting it down too  close and playing Mr. Nice Guy and then getting defeated. But it came out  fine."  </P> <P> It was evident from the start it would be just fine for LSU. The Tigers were  much taller and quicker and built a double-digit lead less than four minutes  into the game on a three-point shot by Mike Hansen Mejias that made it 15-5.  </P> <P> That marked the start of a 17-3 run, capped by an O'Neal jam, that made it 29-8  with 10:59 left in the half. Chapman got the lead to less than 20 just twice  after that.  </P></p>

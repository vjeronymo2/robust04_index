			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAND SHOWED COURAGE  </P> <P> I'm filled with admiration for Rod Tompkins, the savings and loan officer who  wrote Judge John Rhoades asking justice for Daniel Dierdorff ("S&amp;L Official  Pleads Against Lenient Dierdorff Sentence," Jan. 7).  </P> <P> I agree 100% with Tompkins. I think there have been far too many judicial wrist  slaps for business executives who've broken laws, in contrast with tough  sentences often given to such people as Tompkins' teller who have not enjoyed  exalted status.  </P> <P> Aside from the merit of Tompkins' views, I applaud his courage in making them  known. I don't think it takes any great courage to write pleas for leniency or  character references -- unless the subject is Charles Manson. But it does take  courage to ask the opposite for somebody who has been prominent, and who  actually has been in the same field as the writer, particularly when what's  written may be publicized.  </P> <P> I imagine Tompkins will be harshly criticized -- perhaps ostracized -- by some  of his associates. I'm sure, however, there are many who feel as I do, that he  did what was right, and are glad he had the courage to do it.  </P> <P> PAT HIGGINS  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Names group turns on Lloyd's Lloyd's of London has come under fire from a previously largely supportive group of Names for allegedly overstating the assets the insurance market's members need to continue underwriting. The Association of Lloyd's Members says in its newsletter, published today, that Lloyd's solvency rules 'appear to exaggerate solvency deficiencies and minimise allowances for potential profits'. Solvency rules govern the amount of capital which Names, the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's, must deposit with the market. The association says Lloyd's could be double-counting up to Pounds 2bn in losses from claims on errors and omissions policies (which cover agents against negligence awards) and catastrophe reinsurance, and suggests Names are being asked for the money unnecessarily. The newsletter says: 'These anomalies will prevent otherwise solvent Names from continuing to underwrite . . . and alarm unnecessarily Names who have ceased to trade. In part they represent fictitious losses which do not exist and will never have to be paid.' Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, yesterday rejected the claim, saying it mis-stated the true position and held out false hopes to many members. Separately, Lloyd's said it expected gross premium income to rise to Pounds 8.72bn in 1994 from Pounds 8.61bn last year, according to information in its first quarterly business report.</p>

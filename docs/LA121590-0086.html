			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> LIFE TERM IMPOSED FOR NIGHT OF VIOLENCE  </P> <P> A judge sentenced a 21-year-old man to 26 years to life in prison plus a  separate life term for a night of violence that resulted in the stabbing death  of a 3-year-old Fullerton girl, the attempted murder of his own mother and a  knife assault on her boyfriend. Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon  also recommended that Michael Robert Pacewitz serve his sentence at the prison  mental facility at Vacaville.  </P> <P> Pacewitz called the police last March 3 after fatally stabbing little  Marcelline Onick 44 times while she slept in the Fullerton apartment where he  was baby-sitting. Prosecutors contend Pacewitz killed the little girl to get  back at his mother, Elena Fontaine, who baby-sat the girl and treated her like  a granddaughter. Hours earlier, Pacewitz stabbed his mother repeatedly at her  Anaheim home, nearly killing her, and assaulted her boyfriend, prosecutors  said.  </P></p>

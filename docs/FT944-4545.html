			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / US presses Israel on Palestinian poll The US yesterday backed Palestinian demands for Israel to move quickly towards permitting long-delayed Palestinian elections, and said Israel was not seeking to modify the peace accords. 'We recognise the importance of holding elections at an early date,' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said after meeting Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in Gaza. Mr Christopher's remarks came as the Israeli cabinet debated whether Israel can honour the next phase of the peace process (troop redeployment from West Bank population centres ahead of elections) without changing the peace agreement. The cabinet is split on how to reconcile redeployment of Israeli troops with security for the 120,000 Jews living in 150 West Bank settlements. Some ministers favour regrouping settlements into blocks; one or two favour halting the peace process until the PLO meets Israel's security demands for clamping down on Islamic extremists. The debate was sparked by warnings from senior army officials about the difficulty of guaranteeing security to Jewish settlers after redeployment, and a statement by Premier Yitzhak Rabin that the government should consider whether Israeli troops would remain in town centres during elections. The Palestinians have said they will not vote under the barrels of Israeli guns and warned any attempt to alter the peace agreement unilaterally would seriously violate the process. Observers said Mr Christopher's remarks were meant as a signal to Israel, before it concludes cabinet talks today, that Washington backs implementing the agreement as it stands. After a second cabinet session yesterday, several ministers said that the possibility of uprooting a few settlements virtually impossible to protect after redeployment had been much discussed. Mr Rabin has so far ruled out uprooting settlements and said he would stick to the agreement which postpones the settlement issue until later negotiations. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said that despite differences, cabinet endorsement of the peace agreement's framework was overwhelming. Mr Peres is to meet Mr Arafat today to discuss the cabinet debate and seek to remove obstacles to implementing the agreement. Mr Christopher, who earlier met Mr Rabin, sought to assure Mr Arafat that Palestinian fears of Israel unilaterally changing the agreement were unfounded. 'When I was with Prime Minister Rabin he said they intend to carry out the (agreement). As far as I am concerned, there is not an issue about modification.' Mr Christopher stressed to Mr Arafat that Israel had legitimate security concerns as it faced redeployment in the West Bank and urged him to keep up pressure on Islamic extremists opposed to the peace accord.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLIND WOMAN'S LAWSUIT AGAINST RTD TOSSED OUT  </P> <P> A lawsuit brought by a blind woman who said she was knocked down and trampled  by passengers during an incident aboard an RTD bus has been dismissed,  attorneys said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Millicent Collinsworth sought unspecified damages in her suit charging that the  Southern California Rapid Transit District was negligent in operating an  overcrowded bus and not providing a safe place for passengers.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Robert W. Zakon ruled Monday in a  pretrial hearing that the suit contained "no tryable issues of fact" -- a  decision that led to its dismissal, said RTD attorney Jerry Ramsey.  </P> <P> "The commissioner ruled that the bus company didn't have a duty to protect  (Collinsworth)," said Janet Gullixson, the blind woman's attorney. Gullixson  said she will appeal the dismissal.  </P> <P> The suit grew out of a 1987 incident that later became the basis for a  television movie. Collinsworth, accompanied by her guide dog, was returning to  her Hollywood home on a bus she had boarded in Westwood. Investigators said a  passenger wearing a backpack and standing on the crowded bus "went berserk" and  began flailing his arms and demanding to be let off.  </P> <P> In the commotion, the man's backpack apparently struck Collinsworth in the  face, cutting her lip. Gullixson said the disturbed passenger also stepped on  Collinsworth's dog, a Labrador retriever, and knocked the woman to the floor.  </P> <P> Collinsworth said she pushed her way off the bus with her guide dog and walked  more than 15 blocks to her home without anyone offering to help her.  </P> <P> She said that, at first, she did not know her lip had been cut in the scuffle.  She said she mistook the blood from her nose and mouth for tears, and realized  she was hurt only when she arrived home and reached for her keys and discovered  her hands were sticky with blood.  </P> <P> Ramsey said Collinsworth reported no injuries to the bus driver. "If we had  been told that there was a passenger hurt, we could have stopped," he said.  "What can we do to help her if we had no knowledge that she was hurt?"  </P> <P> Gullixson countered that the RTD "has rules that blind people should sit behind  the bus driver -- obviously so the drivers can watch them."  </P></p>

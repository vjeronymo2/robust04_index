			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN WARS;  </P> <P> COMPARING THE 43-INCH SONY AND 70-INCH MITSUBISHI  </P> <P> Forty thousand dollars for a TV set? Honest. And, no, it's not made of gold and  diamonds.  </P> <P> It's the Sony PV-4300, featuring a 43-inch tube-the largest and most expensive  direct-view (tube) TV on the market. Before Sony recently made this one  available to consumers, the largest picture tube available was 35 inches,  selling for at least $2,500 in sets made by companies including Zenith, JVC and  Sharp.  </P> <P> The reason the big-screen Sony is so expensive, explained Jim Palumbo,  president of Sony's Consumer Display Products Co., is that the few on the  market are handmade. He said the company has no immediate plans to put it in  mass production, which would significantly lower the price. But that price  hasn't been a deterrent to at least three people. Palumbo said Sony has sold  three of the PVM-4300s so far.  </P> <P> On the other hand, for a mere $6,000, Mitsubishi offers the largest  rear-projection TV on the market, the 70-inch VS-700 2R. Mitsubishi makes  rear-projection TVs with 100-inch and 120-inch screens, but they don't have  cabinets and require custom installation.  </P> <P> As luck would have it, Sony's PV-4300 and the Mitsubishi VS-700 2R are side by  side at Rogersound Labs in Santa Monica. The Sony unit is available in Southern  California only at that Rogersound Labs and at Circuit City in West Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> This comparison setup was an opportunity to match the biggest direct-view TV  versus the largest rear-projection TV. In terms of brightness, clarity and  sharpness of color, the Sony, a digitally enhanced set known as improved  definition TV (IDTV), is the easy winner.  </P> <P> But this was no surprise, since direct-view sets, with their relatively small  screens, always offer a better picture than do sprawling rear-projection sets,  which sacrifice clarity for size.  </P> <P> Though it can't quite match the quality of picture on the giant-tube Sony, the  rear-projection Mitsubishi does offer a surprisingly good picture. If you sit  in the viewing seat set about eight feet directly in front the screen, you can  see the optimal picture the set delivers. Up closer or looking at the screen  from different angles, though, you see the fuzziness surrounding the images.  </P> <P> But getting close to the Sony didn't make the picture seem any less excellent.  </P> <P> Still, compared to the common rear-projection picture of a year or two ago, the  Mitsubishi shows there's been a marked improvement in this kind of TV set.  </P> <P> In terms of sound, both are equipped with Dolby Surround sound. The Sony sound  seemed sharper, particularly the highs, but the Mitsubishi's sound was still of  high quality.  </P> <P> In screen size, of course, the Mitsubishi was naturally superior. Companies  manufacturing big rear-projection sets count on the fact that the upscale  customers who can afford them prize size over picture clarity and color  sharpness.  </P> <P> Some industry observers have speculated that the marketing of this 43-inch set  indicates that in the near future, Sony may introduce a mass-produced line of  sets with screen-size somewhere between the big one and the 35-inchers.  Palumbo, though, said right now Sony has no such plans.  </P></p>

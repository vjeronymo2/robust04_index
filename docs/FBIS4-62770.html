			<p>BFN     [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow region) May 17 TASS --  Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov  continue their space mission aboard the Mir space station.    The crew devoted much time over the past few days to  geophysical explorations fulfilled with the use of photographic  equipment and videospectromic instrumentation installed on the  Kvant-2 module.    They made snapshots of the areas of Chernobyl and the Aral  sea, agricultural lands in the Krasnodar territory and the  Kalmyk Republic as well as industrial areas in Kazakhstan.    Under the programme of experiments on extra-atmospheric  astronomy, the cosmonauts carried out several sessions of  observations and registation of galactic and extra-galactic  sources of roentgen radiation. They also continued to measure  spectres of space radiation in various ranges of wave lengths.  The aim of the explorations is to get scientific information on  interaction between physical processes in the universe and  near-Earth space.    An adjustment of the station's orbit was made on May 16 with  the propulsion unit of the Progress M-2 spacecraft.    The flight plan for Tuesday provides for astrophysical,  medical and technical experiments, re-equipment of the station  and modules with new instrumentation brought to the station by a  ferry.    The cosmonauts feel well. Work aboard the station proceeds  normally.</p>

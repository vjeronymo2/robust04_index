			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION LAUNCHES DRIVE TO PROTECT FLAG;  </P> <P> PHONE-IN 'SIGNATURES' WILL SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT  </P> <P> Veterans groups, conservative organizations, local politicians and a television  commentator launched a nationwide petition drive Saturday to support a proposed  constitutional amendment that would prohibit desecration of the American flag.  </P> <P> But the newly formed National Save the Flag Coalition is not canvassing  neighborhoods for signatures -- it is relying on a national 900 telephone  number to attract supporters.  </P> <P> During a press conference in Burbank on Saturday, organizers blasted the U.S.  Supreme Court's June 21 decision that flag-burning is protected by the First  Amendment and said they hope to get at least 10 million people to pick up their  phones and dial the 900 number as an act of protest.  </P> <P> "We regard that flag as something that is alive," said Bruce Herschensohn, a  KABC commentator. "It should have the rights of any citizen of the United  States."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Names Recorded  </P> <P> By calling 1-(900) 860-9138, the phone company will automatically record the  name and address of the phone's owner, which will then be transferred to the  petition. The call costs $2 for the first minute and $1 for each additional  minute that the caller listens to a prerecorded message denouncing the court's  decision.  </P> <P> The National Save the Flag Coalition is composed of a variety of groups  including the American Freedom Coalition, the American Legion of Los Angeles  County, the World Bible Society, the American Pistol and Rifle Assn., Christian  Voice and the Moose Lodges.  </P> <P> "The flag is more than a symbol. It is really the soul of America," said state  Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), who wore red, white and blue  suspenders at the news conference. "When an American sees the flag, he just  doesn't see a flag. He sees the hopes and dreams and aspirations of all  Americans."  </P> <P> Herschensohn, who made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican U.S. Senate  nomination in 1986, said he will take the petition to Capitol Hill in  September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Produced TV Program  </P> <P> The American Freedom Coalition, one of the principle organizers of the  petition, produced the television program "Oliver North: Fight for Freedom" and  sponsored a petition to have him pardoned. The organization, which is  headquartered in Washington, has about 500,000 members, according to Robert  Spitz, executive director in California.  </P> <P> "We support traditional American values," Spitz said.  </P> <P> The U.S. House of Representatives on June 27 passed a resolution by a 411-5  vote to express its "profound concern" over the Supreme Court decision. Two  days later, members of the House -- with President Bush's backing -- introduced  a constitutional amendment that would ban desecration of the U.S. flag.  </P> <P> Before the amendment can become law, it must be approved by Congress and  three-fourths of state legislatures.  </P></p>

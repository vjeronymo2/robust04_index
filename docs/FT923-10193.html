			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Building workloads drop 25% CONSTRUCTION industry criticism of the government's handling of the economy intensified yesterday after publication of a survey indicating a 25 per cent fall in work during the past 12 months. A survey of 1,000 offices of quantity surveyors, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, showed that order books during the three months to the end of June had fallen by a quarter compared with the same period last year and by 4.7 per cent compared with the previous three months. Since much quantity surveying work, like that of architects, occurs early in the construction process, the findings can be related to the prospects for the industry as a whole. Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris cost consultants, one of the largest firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'All we get from ministers are platitudes. They seem to be unaware of the long-term damage which is being done to the construction industry.' Mr Vickers said there was increasing concern that the government would cut capital investment in construction as a means of controlling public expenditure. His comments were made ahead of publication today of forecasts from the National Council of Building Material Producers. They are expected to show a further sharp fall in construction output and indications that the recovery will be delayed until 1994. A separate survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects estimates that a third of the country's 30,000 registered architects are unemployed or working below capacity. It says architects' earnings fell by 2 per cent on average last year to Pounds 23,000, the first decline in cash or real terms since records began in 1976. A survey to be published today by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors is expected to reveal a steep decline in expectations since the general election. It is expected to warn that the outlook for orders and jobs is the worst for years. MOST commercial property lenders expect no improvement and even a decline in the market over the next year, according to a survey of 58 banks and other financial institutions, Vanessa Houlder writes. It shows that lenders have revised their forecasts as the expected recovery has failed to materialise. This month, only 48 per cent expect an improvement in the market over the next 12 months, down from 55 per cent in January and 70 per cent in July last year. The report by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Chartered Surveyor Weekly magazine suggests that the next six months may be critical for struggling property companies. Sixty-nine per cent of those polled expect the upward trend in receiverships to continue over the next six months. Confidence Barometer. Chesterton Financial, 54 Brook Street, London W1A 2BU.

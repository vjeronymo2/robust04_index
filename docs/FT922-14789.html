			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Italy sees signs of change ahead of saint's day poll: Robert Graham looks at the choices before voters A RAIN of red sand on Rome, yellow snow in Sardinia. For a nation mistrustful of psephology but long accustomed to reading auguries, the portents of change are in the air as Italians prepare to go to the polls in tomorrow's general election. Tomorrow is the saint's day of San Vincenzo Ferreri, and 23 of the 11,927 candidates celebrate their birthdays. But the only statistical certainty about the outcome is that, based on the 1987 results, those called Vincenzo, after the saint, stand 3.6 times less chance of being elected than the Guiseppes. Family names count too. Mr Luciano Benetton, one of the four founders of Italy's best-known family clothing company, is hoping his name will ensure election as candidate for the small Republican party. The elections are also a big test for the sentimental appeal of Italy's most infamous politician, Benito Mussolini, and the country's greatest actress, Sophia Loren. Ms Alessandra Mussolini, the 28-year-old starlet niece of Ms Loren and grand-daughter of Il Duce, is standing in Naples for the neo-fascist party MSI. The appearence of the voluptuous Ms Mussolini has been ignored by the Italian press, though attention from the international media has created the impression she alone can solve Italy's problems of rising crime, institutional atrophy and a yawning public sector deficit. The elections are the first real challenge to the post-war hegemony of the Christian Democrats and much is at stake. A sign of Christian Democrat efforts to pull out all the stops was the behaviour of Mr Enzo Scotti, the interior minister. In Naples, he was found distributing stencils to illiterates so that they can shade in their preferred candidates' names, thereby getting round a new rule obliging voters to spell these out. In the early stages of the campaign Mr Scotti earned near universal ridicule for claiming a plot was afoot to destabilise the country following the Mafia killing of Mr Salvartore Lima, the Christian Democrat boss of Sicily. Even the ever cautious Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, dismissed the suggestion as a 'worthless bit of currency'. A mixture of Italians' new-found wealth and the disappearence of the Communist party has taken the campaign off the streets. The mass meetings have gone. Television now dominates. This has lead to the banning, for the duration of the campaign, of at least one 'unhelpful' programme on state-run but Christian Democrat-controlled RAI TV. To convince voters that Italy can win not only Hollywood Oscars but also its place in Europe, RAI TV wheeled on Henry Kissinger and Mikhail Gorbachev to shower praise on the achievements of an ossified conservative administration. The beggar who stands on one of Rome's main streets, displaying a sign 'thinking is not begging', had a smart answer yesterday when asked for whom he would vote. 'Beggars are not choosers,' he said with aplomb. But tomorrow 47m voters will choose.</p>

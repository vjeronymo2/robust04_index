			<p>BFN     [Text] Clashes in Yemen today took place mainly in the  oil-rich governorate of Shabwah. Foreign correspondents who  visited al-Mukalla area in Hadhramaut said the southern forces  are reinforcing their positions in Shabwah and that military  aircraft are flying over the governorate, parts of which the  northern forces claimed earlier they had captured. Civilians in  Hadhramaut have been called up to assist the forces in Shabwah.    Meanwhile, political sources in Sanna say President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih is working on achieving swift military gains to  pressure, to the greatest possible degree, the south should a  cease-fire be reached.</p>

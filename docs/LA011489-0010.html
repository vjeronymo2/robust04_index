			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALL OVER A MALL  </P> <P> The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, a major new shopping mall in Southwest Los  Angeles, has been billed as a showcase of business opportunity in Los Angeles'  black community. So why was the experienced black manager hired to run the  place suddenly ousted and replaced by a white person with no mall experience?  </P> <P> Alexander Haagen, the developer of the mall project, insists that the dismissal  of Louis George after only four months on the job was not racially or  politically motivated. But the cold facts of the case raise troubling  questions. George came to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza after managing three  other major malls over the last 16 years. He has been replaced by Janice Hahn  Baucum, an assistant manager at the plaza who had no experience in mall  management before joining Haagen's development company late last year. Her  co-manager is Leo Ray, a black architect who is also an associate of Haagen.  </P> <P> Questions about George's removal have been raised not just because Baucum is  white and inexperienced, however. She is also the daughter of Los Angeles  County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who represents the South-Central Los Angeles  area. Haagen is a friend and political supporter of Hahn and other members of  the county Board of Supervisors. No one is suggesting that Hahn had any role in  his daughter's sudden promotion. In fact, given the supervisor's long record of  service to the black community and his reputation as a savvy politician, such  an egregiously tactless move would be uncharacteristic. But what is going on?  </P> <P> Local civil-rights leaders are understandably upset by the decision to replace  George, who gave up a position managing a large mall in La Jolla to come to the  Crenshaw district. John Mack, president of the Urban League, said that the  black community "deserves some straight answers to some serious questions"  about George's firing. We agree.  </P></p>

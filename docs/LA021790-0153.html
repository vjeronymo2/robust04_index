			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUEEN OF KINK NOT TAKING IT LYING DOWN;  </P> <P> EROTICA: 'POST-PORN MODERNIST' ANNIE SPRINKLE, WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY AN  ORANGE COUNTY CONGRESSMAN FOR RECEIVING FEDERAL ARTS FUNDING, SAYS SHE IS THE  TARGET OF A CENSORSHIP EFFORT.  </P> <P> Annie Sprinkle has come to terms with the unpleasant reality. With a hint of a  grin, the "post-porn" performance artist and former queen of kink concedes that  she needs Rep. Dana R. Rohrabacher just as much as he needs her.  </P> <P> "I like exploring forbidden places," Sprinkle, 35, explains in her  sometimes-dreamy, sometimes-deliberate voice. "I like breaking taboos, pushing  limits.  </P> <P> "If we didn't have the other people on the other side, making the taboos and  setting the limits, I wouldn't have anything to explore."  </P> <P> The 42-year-old Rohrabacher, who represents northwestern Orange County, has  never met Sprinkle, a former prostitute and the star of more than 100 hard-core  pornographic films. But he's been thinking about her a lot lately.  </P> <P> The Republican congressman has leveled his guns at an 80-minute, one-woman show  that Sprinkle performed last month at the Kitchen, one of New York's best-known  showcases of avant-garde performance art. Rohrabacher's complaint is that, as  he understands it, "Annie Sprinkle: Post Porn Modernist" was staged with the  assistance of the United States government.  </P> <P> "Does the following performance sound like an appropriate use of tax dollars to  you?" Rohrabacher asked last week in a "Dear Colleague" letter circulated to  all 435 members of the House of Representatives. The letter, which has become a  hot item around Washington, went on to list various acts reportedly performed  by Sprinkle with an assortment of inanimate objects and gynecological  instruments.  </P> <P> Whether the Sprinkle shows ever actually received any of the taxpayers' money  is a matter of some debate: Government officials in New York say they  "purposefully did not fund" them because, artistically, the shows were found  wanting. Still, the controversy has become the latest touchstone in  Rohrabacher's campaign to prevent the National Endowment for the Arts, which  Congress funds, from supporting indecent or obscene artwork.  </P> <P> Last year, Rohrabacher tried unsuccessfully to eliminate government funding for  the arts, citing the Libertarian argument that art ought to be free of  government interference. He later returned to the issue when he aligned himself  with conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in an attempt to ban NEA  sponsorship of "offensive" artwork.  </P> <P> The latest flap pits Rohrabacher against Sprinkle, the NEA, the New York State  Council on the Arts, and The Kitchen Center for Video, Music, Dance,  Performance and Film in lower Manhattan. While Sprinkle's artistic credentials  may be open to dispute, those of the Kitchen apparently are not. The New York  State Council on the Arts has helped support the Kitchen for nearly 20 years.  Among the theater's other patrons are the American Express Philanthropic  Program, the AT&amp;T Foundation, IBM, Chase Manhattan, CitiBank, the Morgan  Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and the New York Times Foundation. Its board of  directors includes Laurie Anderson, a performance artist, and Philip Glass, a  composer and musician, both of whom have performed there. The New York Times  has referred to the Kitchen as "New York's pioneering and premiere space for  the avant-garde performing arts."  </P> <P> "It's not a fly-by-night organization," said Tim Mulligan, a spokesman for the  New York arts council.  </P> <P> Officials of both the embattled NEA and the New York State Council on the Arts  insist that they did not specifically approve financing for Sprinkle's  performances and that their money did not support her shows.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, however, contends that the NEA underwrote the Sprinkle shows at  the Kitchen in two ways: indirectly, through a $60,000 grant to help pay the  Kitchen's operating expenses, and through a $25,000 grant from the New York  arts council for a series of shows this year. The New York arts council  receives $500,000 from the NEA.  </P> <P> "The (state) arts council receives funds from the NEA, but those funds are used  for administrative salaries, and not granted to the Kitchen," said Barbara  Tsumagari, the theater's executive director. Furthermore, Tsumagari said, the  arts council did not use any state funds to support Sprinkle's shows.  </P> <P> The Kitchen originally applied for a state arts grant for 36 shows in its  performance art series, including four shows by Sprinkle. The state arts  council approved a $25,000 grant for 32 shows, but did not specifically list  the shows that were to be funded.  </P> <P> "The council purposefully did not fund the full series because it believed that  the Annie Sprinkle presentation was not of an artistic quality to warrant  council support," the council said in a statement.  </P> <P> As for the $60,000 operating grant from the NEA, Tsumagari said, "because the  endowment gives (operating) money does not mean the endowment is literally  funding every single activity of an institution." Tsumagari said Rohrabacher is  attempting to hold the national endowment responsible for the actions of the  institutions that receive its support.  </P> <P> "I think that's a very dangerous argument," she said. "I think his use of this  incident is reckless because (what he says) is not factually accurate."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher dismissed that explanation. "It's clear from everything they've  said that they did not prohibit the use of any of their funds for Miss  Sprinkle's performance," Rohrabacher said. "They felt that denying funds to an  act that was as sexually graphic and even pornographic as the one Miss Sprinkle  was engaging in . . . would be an act of censorship. . . . These people are  living in the Twilight Zone."  </P> <P> For her part, Sprinkle chooses not to discuss the specifics of the financial  dispute. But she will tell you, "My (tax) money goes to a lot of things I don't  like. I'm paying for nuclear bombs. I'm paying for wars. . . . My tax dollars  are going for art that I think is really stupid and boring and trivial."  </P> <P> Furthermore, Sprinkle says, "in a sense, I feel I am government-sponsored in  general. I pay taxes, I'm a taxpayer, I walk on city streets, they give me  water, they have police to protect me. So they're sponsoring me to do whatever  it is that I do."  </P> <P> Annie Sprinkle is anything but reticent about discussing her views of art,  pornography, censorship, the federal government, Rohrabacher and sexuality, not  necessarily in that order.  </P> <P> Sprinkle, born Ellen Steinberg in the San Fernando Valley, looks more like a  New Age Goldie Hawn than a pornographer. Her dark hair is barely tamed. She  favors tie-dyed tights under short, black skirts. And she can screw up her face  into a self-consciously innocent grin that would put Fanny Brice to shame.  </P> <P> She loves diamonds. But not the usual variety. She wears a real one in an upper  incisor and shows off a black, diamond-shaped tattoo that circles her right  ring-finger.  </P> <P> "It's my diamond ring," she says.  </P> <P> She lives in a modest, midtown Manhattan apartment that houses an extensive  library of literature on Tantric and Taoist sexual practices, whimsical  pornographic photos, an energy altar of incense and candles, and a pair of  black spike-heeled boots that hang on a wall.  </P> <P> "Those are bed boots," she says. "You can't stand up in them."  </P> <P> Another wall is filled with Polaroid photographs of men and women in various  stages of undress and display.  </P> <P> "This is my friend Les, the transsexual," Sprinkle explains. "He was a woman  who became a man. Here I made him up as a woman. This is me dressed up like a  guy. This is my Tantric sex teacher. This is my mother. . . ."  </P> <P> Sprinkle is serious about her work and what she says is the threat of  censorship. But she bounces her way through the thickets of philosophical  debate with the off-kilter finesse of a Gracie Allen.  </P> <P> "I consider myself a sex researcher," she says. "I study my own sexuality, I  study other people's sexuality. . . . I read a lot of books. I do it every  which-way. . . . That's what I do in life. That's my job. And that has taken me  into all kinds of areas, including pornography and prostitution. And now art."  </P> <P> Sprinkle describes her move out of pornography and into performance art and the  higher realms of sexuality as a journey that has delivered her from the "junk  sex" that is the staple of most Americans' diets.  </P> <P> "In terms of mainstream porn, I find it boring and dull, and I'm over it," she  says. In its place, Sprinkle says she is exploring the outer reaches of  sexuality in an eclectic approach that combines Eastern philosophy, meditative  breathing, spirituality and healing.  </P> <P> "Sex is not really about genitals, it's more about energy. You can learn to  build energy, share it with a partner, send it out to the universe, channel it  for healing, or whatever. You can have an orgasm just from breathing."  </P> <P> In an article on feminist pornographers that appears in the most recent issue  of Mother Jones, Sprinkle is quoted as saying, "I want to be the Shirley  MacLaine of porno."  </P> <P> Despite Rohrabacher's graphic description of her performance, Sprinkle says her  show was not intended to arouse.  </P> <P> The show was "not about being erotic," she says. "My work is about  deconstructing mainstream images of what is sexy."  </P> <P> In one segment, for example, she projects on one side of the stage erotic  photographs that she has taken in her apartment/studio. On the other side are  photographs of the models as they arrived for the photo session, in street  clothes and without makeup. The piece is called, "The Transformation Salon."  </P> <P> "It totally smashes their image of what a model is," she says. At the end of  the piece, Sprinkle tells the audience: "Maybe there's a little porn star in  some of you, and maybe not. But I can tell you from a lot of experience that  there's a lot of you in every porn star."  </P> <P> In "Bosom Ballet," Sprinkle cups, twists and nearly ties a knot with her ample  breasts. Writing in Mother Jones, Laura Fraser observed that the piece works at  "exaggerating people's big interest in big breasts."  </P> <P> In another piece, Sprinkle performs oral sex on inanimate objects. However, she  says the piece, which features a background tape of men's voices making  suggestive remarks, is intended to deal with the subject of sexual abuse.  </P> <P> "I cry, I scream, I spit. It's very visceral," Sprinkle says. "But the  congressman, he saw it as just sucking on sex toys. . . . It was a prop to  express pain and agony and sadness and grief. If you take it out of context, it  may sound like a 42nd-Street (pornographic) show, but it was so far from that."  </P> <P> But is it art?  </P> <P> An earlier version of the show received a favorable review in Art Forum, a  national art magazine. "Sprinkle went beyond nakedness, revealing so much of  herself that it transcended eroticism to become something even more primal,"  reviewer C. Carr wrote. Sprinkle also has been interviewed by Drama Review,  another highbrow publication.  </P> <P> "Annie has been looked at by the serious art community," the Kitchen's  Tsumagari explained. "(Her) program I think is a serious work that deals with  very serious issues. It is well within the tradition of experiment that the  Kitchen has pursued for 20 years."  </P> <P> A statement released by the theater said, "The performances of Annie Sprinkle  were an important and timely contribution to an on-going examination of gender  issues as they relate to the mass media . . . (including) the nature of  pornography and the treatment of women."  </P> <P> Even Rohrabacher said he is unwilling to say that Sprinkle is not an artist.  </P> <P> "I can't make that judgment. Let's let the people decide for themselves what's  art and what isn't. If people want to spend their money to see Annie Sprinkle,  they have every right to do so, and she has every right to present herself to  the public.  </P> <P> "The only thing I'm complaining about is when, directly, or indirectly, they're  putting tax dollars into her garter belt."  </P></p>

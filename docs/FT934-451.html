			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Fashion: Nights of languor, luxury and discomfort - Shops are full of exotic nightwear. It's glamorous, but can you sleep in it? Have you had a good trawl through a posh nightwear department lately? If so you may wonder what kind of lives the buyers of such garments lead. Very different, I feel sure, from life chez moi. Sad, really, how underprivileged it makes one feel. Here, in their beautiful profusion, are folderols to gladden the eye of any potentate: garments so wondrous, so exquisite, so vertiginously priced, that it would take a potentate to pay for them. But where are the potentates in my life? Nowhere to be seen, that's where. Take (if you have Pounds 500 to spare) the pure silk softest rose-pink negligee, photographed right. Delicately, palely, ravishingly seductive, these are night-clothes waiting for Cecil B de Mille and his cameras, for smooth-browed suitors, for intimate little suppers of champagne and caviar, for standing about in looking lovely but they are not - perish the thought - garments conducive to a good night's sleep. But this does not mean they do not have a role. These are garments to keep some dreams alive, garments for the wives men wish they had, and just possibly for the wives they did once have, and most of us are given something like it at one or other of the Christmasses that punctuate our lives. Mine, a specially winsome turquoise silk number, edged with exquisite lace, spends most of its life beautifully folded in tissue paper in a bottom drawer. I am never quite sure why I do not wear it more often but I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that it cannot go near the washing-machine and it takes a good hour and a half to iron. Nightwear like this comes loaded with nostalgic references. It reeks of leisured evenings, of discreet help lurking in the background, of carefree distancing from domestic tribulations. It reminds us of those soft, sensuous pre-Lycra days, when nightdresses were made of fabrics that draped and fell and swished most satisfyingly. Modern technology has produced materials that ape this kind of luxury very effectively - even when you know that it is not really silk you can hardly tell the difference. Not surprisingly, the place to find some of the best of the lookalikes is our chief knicker supplier (Marks and Spencer) but even grand emporia, such as Harrods and Harvey Nichols, offer good selections. So beguiling is some of the nightwear that it is not surprising that the boundaries between what was once thought suitable only for the bedroom and what could appropriately enter the ballroom have blurred. One of the most frequently spotted evening dresses this season has been a floaty M &amp; S nightdress. Worn with leggings underneath (to preserve not just modesty but give it the fashionable layered look and an air of mystery) and some of Philippe Model's fabric shoes, it can look wonderful. Some nightwear has got quite terrifyingly modern. Dolce e Gabbana, has produced a whole collection that is almost entirely - I ask you - black. Harrods, which has as comprehensive a department full of nightwear as you could hope to see, has gone big on designers this season and says that it has, in retail-speak, 'been walking out of the department'. This is something of a mystery to me, for if I had been unloading the delivery van, I would have dispatched it straight to separates (casual). There were some sporty-looking double-trousers (the top half of the trousers stops halfway down and longer length trousers peek out below) all in a tough sweatshirt material. I daresay that customers are finally taking that endless perky advice to think laterally and are wearing it down to the gym. Some people's idea of boudoir chic revolves around the biggest most luscious white towelling robe of all (mine did until I had a close encounter with a health farm). Egeria, I am reliably informed, is the Rolls-Royce of white towelling robes. Soft, thick and luscious, Fenwick of 63, New Bond Street, London W1, says it sells masses of them all year round, even at Pounds 215 a time. Even more luxurious and imbued with the understated sexiness that menswear often confers on women, is a pure soft cashmere dressing-gown. Pringle does them in a host of colours, and though at Pounds 747.50 they are even more expensive than the rose pink silk, they do at least keep you warm. For those spending long weekends in draughty country houses it may well be a necessary investment (save on BUPA and the central heating). If those prices send you into a tailspin then a good troll through a store such as Fenwick will produce plenty of less expensive solutions to the search for a little night glamour. M &amp; S has done its customers proud this winter. It offers classic pure silk cream pyjamas - very Katharine Hepburn - at Pounds 60 a pair and a matching beautifully plain long silk wrap for another Pounds 60. For those who aim for a clean-scrubbed, wholesome look rather than world-weary glamour, tartan could be the answer. It does look effortlessly chirpy. At Harrods, the tartan nightshirt featured in its catalogue and selling at Pounds 49 has been one of the winners of the season. M &amp; S (again) has a big selection of checks and tartans. For a more sportif sort of look there are red-based tartan pyjamas at Pounds 25 and a matching dressing-gown at Pounds 35. Of course, if all she wants is something comfortable to go to sleep in, then it is hard to beat a capacious T-shirt. But let her buy that for herself - a T-shirt under the tree is not, I think, conducive to a harmonious festive celebration.</p>

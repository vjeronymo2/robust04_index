			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TEEN DRIVER'S TRAGIC RECORD TOLD  </P> <P> The teen-age driver of the car that struck and killed Olympic swimming champion  Victor Davis is "shaken" because he was involved in another fatal accident  earlier this year, his lawyer said.  </P> <P> In addition, the Montreal Gazette reported today that the 19-year-old driver is  already facing charges of impaired driving from an incident that occurred in  May, 1988.  </P> <P> The youth is to stand trial in Quebec Court Dec. 15 on charges of impaired  driving and driving with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters  of his blood. He pleaded innocent to the charges at an arraignment in October  last year.  </P> <P> Last May, the youth tried in vain to save a close friend who drowned after  their boat was swamped by waves, lawyer Jeffrey Boro told the Gazette. The  youth had been piloting the boat before it was swamped, and his friend drowned  after being unable to swim ashore.  </P> <P> Passengers in the car that struck Davis on Saturday have told a newspaper that  the young driver had not been drinking.  </P></p>

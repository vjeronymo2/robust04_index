			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Solidarity messages  came to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea  from Indrajit Gupta, general secretary of the National Council  of the Communist Party of India, and from the National Standing  Committee of the National Convention Party of Ghana supporting  the Korean people's struggle to defend their national dignity  and the sovereignty of their country.    The general secretary of the National Council of the  Communist Party of India in his message said the council highly  estimates the DPRK's stand against U.S. pressure and for the  resumption of talks with the United States to solve the  "question of nuclear inspection" of the DPRK.    The National Standing Committee of the National Convention  Party of Ghana in its message actively welcomed and supported  the DPRK's proposal to hold negotiations with the United States  over the establishment of a new peace arrangement that can  prevent arms buildup and creditably ensure peace on the Korean  peninsula.    The National Convention Party of Ghana expresses firm  solidarity for the struggle of the Workers' Party and people of  Korea to achieve national reunification through a confederacy,  the message said, and urged the United States to accede to the  DPRK's negotiation proposal to replace the Korean armistice  agreement by a peace agreement and to withdraw its troops and  nuclear weapons from South Korea.</p>

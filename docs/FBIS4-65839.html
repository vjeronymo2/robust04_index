			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- Leading Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] politicians have reacted with harsh criticism  to the acceptance speech of future President Roman Herzog at the  Federal Convention in Berlin. "The best thing one can do is not  to comment on the speech," SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said on  Monday evening [23 May]. Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse  stated that Herzog immediately lived up to his reputation as an  arch-conservative and terrified half of those present. Peter  Struck, parliamentary manager of the SPD group, called the  speech "disastrous."    SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that Herzog  probably did not prepare his speech well. Therefore, one should  not weigh his every word. Reinhard Hoeppner, SPD land chairman  of Saxony-Anhalt, was "relatively shocked" by the speech.    Joschka Fischer, Hesse environment minister and Greens top  politician, shook his head and said: "Read the speech; this  says more than any comment." Former FRG Interior Minister  Gerhart Baum stated: "My skepticism regarding the newly elected  president has not declined after this speech."    On the other hand, Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said  that Herzog's election is a "good day for Germany." The elected  head of state is a man who has always felt committed to German  unification. CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos expressed the  conviction that Herzog will be a good president.

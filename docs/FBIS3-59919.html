He said Ukraine would dismantle 20 of the 46 strategic  missiles by the end of this month.    The decision comes only days after last week's meeting of  top  Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. officials. Until now Ukraine has  refused to give up the weapons without security guarantees from  the United States.</p>

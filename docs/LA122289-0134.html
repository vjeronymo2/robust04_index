			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY TO HOLD JULY 4 FIREWORKS DISPLAY  </P> <P> The city has decided to sponsor an annual public fireworks display on the  Fourth of July, starting next year.  </P> <P> Hiring a fireworks show company, renting a stadium and staffing the event will  cost about $52,600, with $2,000 coming back to the city from rental of space to  food and game vendors, said Ronald E. Hagan, community services director.  </P> <P> The idea for an annual fireworks show arose in October when the council  considered banning the sale and use of fireworks in Fullerton. The council  voted 3 to 2 to keep state-approved fireworks legal.  </P> <P> The fireworks show is planned for the Fullerton High School Stadium, where the  city held a fireworks show in 1987 to celebrate the city's centennial.  </P></p>

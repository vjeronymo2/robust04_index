Elias] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- Voting procedure for the  April election was announced on Thursday [24 February] by the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. Voters will have their  identification checked at the doors of polling stations where  party voting agents will also conduct ID checks. The voter will  have both hands studied under ultra-violet lights.    The voter's knuckles will then be dipped in an invisible but  UV sensitive marking fluid which will wear off in about a week.  The voter will hand in his identity document or temporary voter  card to an official who will mark it and then a ballot paper  will be given to the voter with the ID document. The voter will  then go to one of the voting compartments and vote in secret  before placing the ballot paper into a ballot box for the  National Assembly election.    The voter then moves to another table where his ID is  checked  again before a second ballot paper, this time for the provincial  legislature, is folded and handed to the voter.    The voter then votes again in secret and casts the ballot in  a box marked for the provincial legislature election, the IEC  announced at a press conference at the World Trade Centre.</p>

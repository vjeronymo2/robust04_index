			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the president and Defense  Ministry have stated that the creation of Russian military bases  on Latvian territory is not planned. As for the instruction of  the Russian head of state, according to the explanations, a  technical error crept into its text.    We remind you that this error provoked a loud reaction in  Riga. Latvian officials have accused Moscow of imperial  ambitions.    Meanwhile, according to an Interfax report, Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, who came to Pskov today, has stated that the  circumstances of the appearance of the said instruction of the  president were strongly reminiscent of the so-called version No.  1.    Kozyrev gives the assurance that neither he nor Defense  Minister Grachev know from whence the instruction was taken or  who agreed it with whom.    In the foreign minister's opinion, it is an attempt to set  the president, government, Foreign Ministry, and Defense  Ministry at loggerheads.</p>

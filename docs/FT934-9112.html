			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / US growth is back but doubts remain THE QUESTION exercising the minds of US forecasters is not whether the pace of economic growth has accelerated - it undoubtedly has - but whether faster expansion will prove sustainable and whether it will put upward pressure on inflation and short-term interest rates. The mood in the US bond market and, to a lesser extent, stock market last week was grim. The sudden wave of bond sales reflected investors' concern that faster growth would inevitably put upward pressure on prices, bringing forward the timing of a long-feared tightening of US monetary policy. But this negative reaction to recent statistics may have been hasty. There are good reasons to believe that the pace of growth will taper off somewhat early next year and that inflation will remain subdued for at least another year. 'The market's pessimism about the inflation outlook is hard to understand,' muses Mr Jack Beebe, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He says inflationary pressures have been gradually squeezed out of the economy in the past four or five years and predicts consumer prices will rise less than 3 per cent this year and by only about 2.5 per cent next year. Barring 1986, when the collapse of oil prices temporarily depressed inflation, this would be the best outturn since the mid-1960s. Figures out this week threw frustratingly little light on underlying trends. The producer price index fell more sharply than expected last month but consumer prices registered their biggest gain for six months - and the increase could not be entirely explained by higher petrol taxes. However, if Mr Beebe's optimistic forecast does prove correct, bond prices are likely to rally again, pushing yields back below 6 per cent. Meanwhile, a short-term acceleration of economic growth is unquestionably under way. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the third quarter; excluding the negative effect of flooding in the midwest, growth would have been about 3.5 per cent. This compares with disappointing annual rates of expansion of 0.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters. Economic statistics released recently suggest the economy will be stronger still in the current quarter: the annual rate of growth could easily exceed 4 per cent. The sharp fall in long-term interest rates in the first half of the year appears to have given interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy a powerful stimulus. New home sales, for example, rose to a seven-year high last month. More new and existing homes are being sold than at any point in the Reagan boom of the 1980s, despite adverse demographic trends. Surprisingly, there are even signs of a recovery in non-residential construction. A 20 per cent vacancy rate is still holding back new office construction but supermarkets are again being built as are industrial structures. Led by heavy purchases of computers, real business equipment investment grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent in the third quarter after double-digit rises in preceding periods. After allowing for inflation, consumers' purchases of durable goods grew at an annual 7.5 per cent. Vehicle sales soared to a four-year high last month. Other reliable barometers of economic health are also flashing green. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the fortunes of manufacturing industry - rose more than four points last month to 53.8 per cent, the highest level since February. Payroll employment rose 177,000 in October, more than analysts expected; factory overtime hours are at an all-time high while the average length of the working week is higher than at any point since the second world war. The slight rise in unemployment - from 6.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent - was, paradoxically, also a sign of strength because it reflected a big increase in the number of people actively seeking work. The big question is whether the more rapid growth can be sustained. The recovery of the past two years has been saw-toothed with periods of robust growth followed by near stagnation, as occurred at the start of this year. Nearly all forecasters agree that the economy cannot sustain growth at an annual rate of above 4 per cent. The consensus view is that growth will fall back to an annual rate of about 3 per cent next year. But some analysts are more pessimistic. 'I'm sceptical that a faster recovery has really taken hold,' says Mr Bob Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He predicts growth will fall to an annual rate of about 2 per cent in the first half of next year. He points out growth is currently being boosted by temporary factors such as a run-down in personal savings and warns that the neutral fiscal stance of the past two years will turn contractionary in the new year as tax rises in the Clinton budget begin to bite on higher-income households. Defence cuts, corporate restructuring and weak overseas economies, meanwhile, will continue to exert a negative pull on US growth. Optimists will reply that US productivity trends are surprisingly strong. Productivity rose at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the third quarter and has grown at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent since the end of the recession, considerably faster than in the upturn of the 1980s. This suggests the gap between actual and potential long-run growth may be smaller than many analysts suspect. It also lends credence to projections by Mr Beebe and others that the cycle of disinflation is not yet complete.</p>

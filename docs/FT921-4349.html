			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Top Democrats jockey for advantage in Florida GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts both wrapped up their Super Tuesday campaigning in Florida yesterday with a final bid to win votes in this patchwork state that has become the crucial battleground for today's 11 state contest. While Mr Tsongas is expected to win in his home state of Massachusetts and in neighbouring Rhode Island, the day will belong to Mr Clinton, who appears assured of the lion's share of the votes in Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma - where Mr Tsongas's campaign failed to get his name on the ballot - Tennessee and Texas. Only in Florida are the two competing flat out, though Mr Clinton holds the advantage. 'If Tsongas can win Florida I think he can come away and claim victory, even if Clinton wins everywhere else,' said Dr Darryl Paulson, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Saint Petersburg. Florida's economy has suffered severely in the current recession. Unemployment is up to 8.7 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent four years ago. Tourism, a mainstay of the state's economy, suffered its sharpest downturn last year since the 1972 oil crisis, with the number of visitors dropping 4 per cent to 39.3m. The real estate and construction industry is blighted. Mr Clinton started his Florida campaign early, winning a December straw poll of Democratic party delegates and building up a solid organisation. He is strong in the northern panhandle, adjoining Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, and has worked to build support in south Florida, with appeals to retired and Jewish voters in the 'gold coast' from Miami to Palm Beach. Mr Tsongas has campaigned more in central Florida, focusing on cities such as Tampa and Orlando. He has recent history on his side - another Massachusetts politician, Governor Michael Dukakis, won Florida's primary in 1988 - and has an edge with the many transplanted north-easterners in the electorate. He is also favoured by the generally well off and well educated electorate - a type of voter to whom he has appealed most in other states. Mr Tsongas has won endorsements over the last weekend from most of Florida's main newspapers. In addition, black voters, who have in other states voted overwhelmingly for Governor Clinton, make up a smaller proportion of the electorate than in any other southern state. But Mr Tsongas will not have the support of crossover Republican voters that has boosted him in some other primaries: unlike states such as South Carolina, where voters may choose to vote in either party's primary, Florida's ballot is open only to registered Democrats. Both men have lashed out at each other in press conferences, campaign tracts and television advertisements. Governor Clinton has attacked Mr Tsongas's positions on social security and Israel, appealing to Florida's many retired and Jewish voters. Mr Tsongas has hit back, accusing his rival of being willing to promise anything to win votes. He still faces an uphill struggle, however, and said he was following a 'silver medal strategy' in the state.</p>

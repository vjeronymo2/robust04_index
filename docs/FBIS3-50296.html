			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wojciech Pomianowski from Berlin: "Foretaste of </F> Membership; Ministers and Experts After NATO Summit"]    [Text] "Partnership for Peace" is not a substitute  for Central and East European countries' membership in NATO --  such is the message coming out of a Berlin conference on  European security which ended Tuesday [25 January].    At the invitation of Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  of  Germany, the conference participants -- defense ministers and  deputy defense ministers, experts, scientists, and journalists  from 14 countries -- assessed the results of the recent NATO  summit and the "Partnership for Peace" program.    The Berlin meeting had an informal nature but it is regarded  by political circles as significant from the standpoint of  shaping public opinion. It was the first meeting of this kind  after the recent NATO summit and it was important for countries  of Central and East Europe -- including Poland -- because it  served the purpose of providing information on positions taken  by the individual countries.    The participants at the Berlin meeting unanimously agreed  that the outcome of the NATO summit is positive. There were  differences of opinion with regard to assessing the role of  "Partnership for Peace." Representatives of the countries of  East and Central Europe which are making efforts to become NATO  members emphasized that the "Partnership" program should be  regarded as a step on the way to membership in NATO.    Such a view was aired among others by the Polish Deputy  Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski. He said "Partnership for  Peace" is a kind of program which should well serve to prepare  Poland soon for full NATO membership. But Milewski also  stressed that what is also needed is political protection  against political dangers which are occurring. Such a  protective shield could be provided by the status of associate  NATO or Western European Union membership, or at least the  function of an observer in NATO's political agencies. A Euro-  Atlantic security system is indispensable in the future which  would be based on volunteer membership by countries of North  America and Europe, including Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic  states. Such an alliance should then sign a treaty of  cooperation with Russia.    Speaking before Polish journalists, Minister Milewski said  that the position he presented was received with quite a bit of  support among conference participants. Similar views were  expressed -- among others -- by the Slovak defense minister and  the Hungarian deputy minister. A different position was taken  by Russia's representative -- Sergey Karaganov who is a deputy  director at the European Institute of the Russian Academy of  Sciences and an advisor to President Yeltsin. He said widening  NATO to cover the area all the way to the Russian border would  create the danger of a military, economic, and social isolation  of his country for many years to come.    According to Minister Milewski, Germany is currently our  most  important partner in implementing the goal of European unity and  Poland's integration with the European Union and with NATO.  Jerzy Milewski talked in Berlin among others to Jorg Schoenbohm  -- a secretary of state in the Federal Defense Ministry -- about  bilateral cooperation between the two countries' defense  ministries against the context of European processes and the  "Partnership for Peace" program.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Maxwell's Death - The First Anniversary: Private empire consumed Pounds 1.7bn ROBERT Maxwell's private companies consumed nearly Pounds 1.7bn in a doomed attempt to survive during the last year of the life of the tycoon, who died a year ago today. The total is nearly double the estimates compiled four months ago when his two youngest sons, Kevin and Ian, were arrested. Most of the money went to banks to repay loans and pay interest on debt. It is now clear that little is likely to be recovered from the Maxwell pension funds and the public companies - Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communication Corporation - which suffered combined losses of about Pounds 1bn in cash, assets and broken contracts. Attempts to recover the money have stalled as lawyers prepare for highly costly legal actions expected to last several years. Lawyers' and accountants' fees incurred in unravelling Maxwell's legacy and tussling over the empire's scanty remaining assets total more than Pounds 30m so far. Administrators of the collapsed companies, who have reconstructed more than 10,000 complex financial transactions, are now confident that they have identified most of the assets. Maxwell's private companies were a labyrinth of more than 400 separate entities, some of them no more than brass plates in offshore tax havens designed to shuttle money around the empire. By the start of last year, nearly a year before his death, they were tottering under some Pounds 1.5bn of debt and might have collapsed without injections of cash from the public companies. In total, the private companies repaid Pounds 501m of loans to banks last year and made Pounds 123m of interest payments. They also passed at least Pounds 400m of the assets flowing in to them - including property, shares from the pension funds and a stake in Berlitz, an MCC subsidiary - totalling more than Pounds 400m to banks. As the crisis increased through last year, the private companies also pledged much of their majority holdings in MCC and MGN, at one point worth more than Pounds 900m, to banks. Next to the bank loans in significance, the greatest part of the cash was consumed in a series of alleged share-support operations designed to prop up the value of the two public companies. A small part of the share buying - Pounds 49m - was publicly disclosed as required under UK companies legislation. But the majority - Pounds 204m - was routed secretly through Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and Maxwell's control over the shares he bought was not disclosed. Those shares in turn were re-pledged to banks so more loans could be raised. Losses in the private companies - including AGB, the market research company, and The European newspaper, which had been one of Robert Maxwell's favourite business ventures - soaked up Pounds 111m. The private companies also struck property and financing deals with MCC and MGN that they were later unable to fulfil and the public companies have been forced to write off more than Pounds 100m against their profits. In spite of the empire's financial crisis during last year, the private companies scattered a further Pounds 80m on acquisitions across three continents, mainly on property. Investigators are still inquiring into the exact destination and purpose of Pounds 75m. That includes Pounds 25m channelled through PH (US) Inc, a Liechtenstein-owned financial holding company registered in the US, which continues to trade and is outside the direct control of administrators in the UK. Public outrage and political pressure since Robert Maxwell's death have pushed the Liechtenstein authorities and lawyers into unprecedented openness, even though the principality's wealth has been built on strict rules of confidentiality. However, Liechtenstein's Crown Prince said last week that the request for assistance from British authorities came only this September, even though he had offered co-operation early in the year. Accountants have been quicker to gather information on the trusts, and are relatively confident that no hidden 'pot of gold' remains. Aside from small sums of cash, most of the assets were held as shares in MGN and MCC as part of the alleged share-support scheme and have been pledged back to banks. The Maxwell Foundation, which owned PH (US) Inc, has already acted to change the directors of this company, and has sold one of its trading subsidiaries, Sphere Inc, a California computer games manufacturer. Some of the money consumed consisted of Pounds 71m in dividends from MGN and MCC, and Pounds 226m in the disposal of stakes in a number of companies including Central TV and TF1, the French broadcasting company. The private companies also consumed Pounds 37m in cash paid to Mr Maxwell by the former owner of the near-bankrupt New York Daily News to take the company off its hands. Investigators have questioned the legality of much of the transfers of cash and shares from the pension funds and public companies. Some of the transactions they regard as unusual date back to 1989, more than two years before Robert Maxwell died. The irregular transactions will be subject to long legal disputes which will have to determine whether directors authorising the transfers could have known that the private companies were unable to repay the money. Lawyers and accountants have come under intense scrutiny for the level of professional fees charged, although they reply that the courts and creditors are monitoring their bills. Administrators are becoming increasingly selective in the pursuit of further recoveries, in case the fees incurred outstrip the assets to be realised. The hopes of most of the pensioners for the long term rest with the work of the Maxwell pension unit headed by Sir John Cuckney, which has so far raised Pounds 6m in donations and Pounds 2.5m from the government. The Serious Fraud Office has so far made four arrests. As well as the brothers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert Bunn, both directors of Maxwell private companies, face charges. Trials are not expected to begin before early 1994.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM. . .

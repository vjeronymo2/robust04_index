			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (6): Euro-scepticism slows an inevitable process - While Europe has seen fewer cross-border mergers recently, more may be on the way THE PACE of cross-border European mergers and acquisitions has slowed markedly over the last three months. This lull in activity - attributed by experts to currency uncertainty and the growing strain of high real interest rates - is all the more disappointing after a pronounced recovery in the volume and value of deals in the first half of 1992. Figures from KPMG show that the number of deals last year averaged just 250 a quarter (around Dollars 6bn every three months) - significantly less than in the go-go days of 1988-90. The first and second quarters of 1992, by contrast, saw cross-border transactions to the value of Dollars 11.8bn and Dollars 15.7bn respectively, encouraging hopes of a sustained pick-up throughout the rest of the year. It is in this context that the 160 deals recorded between July and September - worth Dollars 7.7bn - will be seen as something of a setback. One obvious question is whether Euro-scepticism - as manifested in the French and Danish referendums and opposition to the Maastricht treaty - may have dealt a mortal blow to European corporate activity. The answer is almost certainly not. Taking the long view, the current process of European integration can be seen to date back to the postwar years. Initially, it developed in a largely political framework, industrial consolidation starting in earnest only in the early 1980s. The momentum gathered pace in the middle of the decade with the adoption of the single market programme and all the attendant hype. But just as all trade barriers will not be lifted by December 31 1992, so the restructuring spurred on by this deadline will continue, probably well into the 21st century. 'The present uncertainty is not going to stop deals,' notes Mr Vincent Thompson of Hambros Bank. 'Companies still view the European market as of fundamental importance, regardless of doubts over Maastricht.' Mr Thompson acknowledges, though, that events of recent weeks have done nothing to whet the appetite of foreign predators eyeing up UK targets, while erratic stock markets tend to discourage the flow of deals. According to Mr Nick Cowley at KPMG's international headquarters in Amsterdam, booming economies in the late 1980s often masked the cost of strategic errors. 'In current economic conditions buyers will have to be more selective, and in some countries of course the currency risk has now returned. The ERM undoubtedly encouraged deals because the risks had in effect been reduced to the width of the relevant currency bands.' Mr Cowley emphasises, though, that the single European market is already a reality. 'Companies will increasingly be up against pan-European competitors, which means there is bound to be more consolidation.' French companies, so far at any rate, have proved to be the most active cross-border raiders. Between January 1 1988 and June 30 this year they splashed out Dollars 37.5bn on 775 foreign acquisitions, against Dollars 20bn and Dollars 10.7bn by their British and German counterparts (representing 982 and 335 deals respectively). Americans and Australians have been the most persistent predators from outside the EC, though the value of HSBC's bid for Midland Bank on its own was roughly 150 per cent that of all the Australian deals over the period from 1988 to mid-1992. Countries which have attracted most cross-border interest in these four and a half years are the UK (where companies worth more than Dollars 85bn have been sold to foreigners), France (Dollars 23.3bn) and Germany (Dollars 22bn). The game from now on will be to spot which sectors are ripe for further M&amp;A activity. Those which have consistently featured in the last few years include oil and gas, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, electricals and electronics, food, drink and tobacco, financial services, transportation, and paper and board products. Many experts believe that the process of consolidation in the food industry still has further to go. Certain subsectors such as chocolate - where two-thirds of the European market is controlled by five companies - are admittedly highly concentrated. Hence the fierce battle between the leading US food companies Kraft General Foods and Hershey to take over Freia Marabou of Norway, a company with proven brands and a strong market position. That said, the structure of the industry in, say, Italy - where there are some 10 times as many food companies as there are in France - points to continued activity in some parts of the European Community. Changing consumer tastes are likely to ensure that, though whether it will extend to cross-border venturing in food retailing, as some observers suppose, is another matter. Corporate strategists in the financial services sector have also been busy, though much of the concentration has taken place within national borders. Countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal have specifically encouraged mergers as a means of bolstering their banking systems ahead of the expected foreign onslaught which 1993 promises to bring. Full-blown insurance mergers have been few and far between. This year's ill-fated effort by Denmark's Hafnia and Norway's Uni Storebrand to forge a major Scandinavian grouping is likely to serve as a discouragement for some time to come. However, big French companies such as UAP and Assurances Generales de France have discreetly been building up European networks; while they and other continental giants have their hands full at the moment, Brussels' efforts to prise open the notoriously restrictive European insurance market may well lead to a new wave of takeovers. Similarly, the EC's liberalising moves in air transport may act as a spur to consolidation. That said, although Air France has finally joined forces with Belgium's Sabena, the highly nationalistic airline business will not easily conform to sensible economies of scale. Equally, it may be wishful thinking to assume that there will be rationalisation in the motor industry simply because the US market can survive with just three major manufacturers. Perhaps the next M&amp;A wave will be characterised by more joint ventures, as architects of deals seek to overcome these sensitivities. Transactions may also be structured more along the lines of the recent Reed-Elsevier merger, with the burden of financing reduced.  --------------------------------------------------                    THE TARGETS  --------------------------------------------------                     Number     Value (Dollars bn)  -------------------------------------------------- UK                  1320            85.307 France               925            23.386 Germany              901            21.922 Netherlands          424            12.228 Italy                514            10.772 Spain                489            10.063 Belgium              270             4.040 Greece                27             1.403 Ireland               68             1.383 Portugal              78             1.312 Denmark              150             1.069 Luxembourg            14             0.047 Other                 41             4.002  --------------------------------------------------</p>

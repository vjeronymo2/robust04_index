			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W.VA. SCHOOLS CLOSED TO COOL OFF TEMPERS IN TEACHERS STRIKE  </P> <P> All West Virginia's public schools were closed Wednesday for the rest of the  week as more than 8,000 striking teachers swarmed the state Capitol to denounce  Gov. Gaston Caperton's proposal to end their illegal weeklong walkout.  </P> <P> "Things are just getting out of hand in terms of tempers," state school Supt.  </P> <P> Hank Marockie said in shutting down schools in all 55 West Virginia counties  today and Friday.  </P> <P> Local superintendents have had the option of closing schools since the strike  began March 7, and more than 25 of them chose to do so Wednesday. Marockie's  order, however, affects all 55 counties.  </P> <P> Marockie said after the cooling-off period, county school systems will be  expected to take action to discipline teachers who remain on strike. That  action could range from reprimands to firing.  </P> <P> Caperton went on statewide television Wednesday night saying he sympathized  with the teachers, but that there was no money for raises.  </P></p>

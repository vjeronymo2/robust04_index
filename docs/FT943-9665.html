			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Glasgow sets out trams proposal Glasgow yesterday unveiled detailed routes for a light railway system that will cross the city. Strathclyde Regional Council hopes the first phase of the new network will be operating by 2002 at a cost of Pounds 150m. The 20km tram system will run along a mixture of dedicated track and city streets from Maryhill, north-west of the city centre, through the centre to Easterhouse on the eastern fringe. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive says the tram system will provide links to areas poorly served by public transport and dissuade people from driving into the city centre. The trams will be long, single-deck vehicles similar to those in continental cities and will carry at least 150 people. Glasgow hopes to join Manchester and Sheffield, which have systems, and Croydon and Birmingham, which have plans for reintroducing trams. The reintroduction of trams is held up by the difficulty of securing public-sector finance. Mr Gordon, who admitted that financing the project could be 'problematical', said he hoped the council would allocate part of its capital spending programme to the project, obtain European Union financing and get a government grant under Section 56 of the 1968 Transport Act. Mr Stephen Lockley, chief executive of Strathclyde PTE, said the executive could award a contract to a private-sector group to design, build, operate and maintain the network. But he acknowledged that the 'vast bulk' of the financing would still come from the public sector.</p>

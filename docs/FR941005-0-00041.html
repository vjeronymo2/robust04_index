			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service considers ``all free-flying  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falco peregrinus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> not otherwise identifiable as a listed subspecies, to be endangered under the similarity of appearance provision in the 48 conterminous States'' (49 FR 10520, March 20, 1984). Therefore, arctic peregrine falcons will be protected as endangered or threatened while migrating through the 48 conterminous States as long as American peregrine falcons that occur in this area are classified as endangered or threatened. American peregrine falcons are known to occur or could occur in all areas in which arctic peregrine falcons are found in the 48 conterminous States, so protection would be complete in this region. The protection of this provision would not extend beyond such time that the American peregrine falcon is delisted. The Service anticipates that recovery will eventually allow the American peregrine falcon to be removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife. At such time, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act will govern the take of arctic peregrine falcons, as will the appropriate State regulations. State regulations applying to falconry currently vary among States and are subject to change with time. The applicable State regulations, however, may be more but not less restrictive than Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The similarity of appearance provision does not apply to arctic peregrine falcons while they are outside the conterminous United States. Although American peregrine falcons occur in northern areas, such as Alaska, there is no overlap in the breeding ranges of the two subspecies in Alaska (arctic peregrine falcons breed north of the Brooks Range and along the west coast near Norton Sound whereas American peregrine falcons breed south of the Brooks Range). If this proposal is enacted, therefore, the taking of arctic peregrine falcons within their breeding range would not be prohibited by similarity of appearance protection and would, therefore, be governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Additionally, the similarity of appearance protection is provided by United States domestic law; this protection does not apply to arctic peregrine falcons outside the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Migratory Bird Treaty Act regulates the taking of migratory birds for educational, scientific, and recreational purposes, such as falconry. Section 2 states that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to determine if, and by what means, the take of migratory birds should be allowed, and to adopt suitable regulations permitting and governing the take. In adopting regulations, the Secretary is to consider such factors as distribution and abundance to ensure that take is compatible with the protection of the species. Existing regulations applying to the use of raptors for falconry and the captive propagation of raptors are outlined in 50 CFR 21.28 to 21.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to Federal regulations, Alaska State regulations would apply to harvest of arctic peregrine falcons in Alaska. Alaska State regulations outlined in 5 AAC 92.037 do not currently allow for the use of arctic peregrine falcons for falconry, but it is likely that State regulations will be amended to allow harvest in the near future. Alaska State regulation 92.037(b)(3) requires that ``no person may permanently export a raptor taken from the wild in Alaska unless the person has legally possessed that raptor for at least one year.'' The Service anticipates little or no pressure within Alaska to amend this latter regulation; therefore, the take of arctic peregrine falcons in Alaska should remain limited to the roughly 30 falconers who are permanent residents of Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Falconry regulations in Canada and Greenland do not allow foreign falconers to take raptors, so this delisting will not result in United States residents taking arctic peregrine falcons within these countries. Take of arctic peregrine falcons in Canada and Greenland by residents of those nations is not affected by United States domestic law; therefore, delisting will not affect regulations allowing harvest in those countries. In addition, as mentioned above, international trade in arctic peregrine falcons is regulated as a result of the subspecies' inclusion on the CITES Appendix I list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Future Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(g)(1) of the Act requires that the Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, monitor species for at least 5 years after delisting. If evidence acquired during this monitoring period shows that endangered or threatened status should be reinstated to prevent a significant risk to the species, the Service may use the emergency listing authority provided for by the Act. At the end of the 5-year monitoring period, the Service will, based upon results of monitoring efforts, decide if relisting, continued monitoring, or an end to monitoring activities is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service included a draft monitoring plan in the September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51035) proposal to delist arctic peregrine falcons. The public was asked to provide comments and suggestions for improving the draft plan. Of the 39 parties responding to the proposal, 15 specifically addressed the monitoring plan, including 11 State fish and game agencies, one Federal agency, the government of Trinidad and Tobago, and two non-governmental organizations. Of the 15 that addressed the plan, five supported the plan as written, five stressed the importance of implementing the plan, two stated they supported delisting only if the monitoring plan was implemented, and three suggested modifications to the plan. The parties suggesting improvements raised three different concerns; those concerns and the Service's responses are given below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has chosen an inappropriate criterion for considering relisting if population size again declines. Thirty-five pairs found nesting along the Colville River in 1959 should be considered the historical norm for this population, not 57 pairs found in 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

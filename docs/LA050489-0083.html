			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PALOS VERDES ESTATES PARKING BUST LEAVES OPINION DIVIDED  </P> <P> Everyone has an opinion on the great Palos Verdes Estates parking bust.  </P> <P> Police Chief Gary Johansen said some people have called him a defender of the  law, while others say he has turned the affluent city into a police state.  </P> <P> The source of the strong feelings: the arrest, handcuffing, fingerprinting and  frisking April 21 of two business-women who, police say, wiped chalk marks off  the tires of their cars to avoid parking tickets.  </P> <P> The Police Department filed misdemeanor charges this week against Rosina Baur,  manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Malaga Cove Plaza  shopping center, and Anne Bisco, a receptionist with the same office.  </P> <P> If convicted, each faces up to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. They are  to appear in South Bay Municipal Court on June 6.  </P> <P> The case has aroused strong feelings on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where Baur  has lived for 30 years and Bisco arrived several weeks ago.  </P> <P> Some residents have called or written to praise the 23-member Police Department  for freeing more parking space at the crowded shopping center, while others  called the arrests a gross overreaction to a minor problem. The 50 writers and  callers are evenly divided on the issue, Johansen said.  </P> <P> "Nobody is in the middle," Johansen said. "Either we are the Gestapo, or they  say, 'Right on, you did exactly the right thing.' "  </P> <P> The incident has its roots in an ongoing parking problem in Malaga Cove Plaza.  A meter maid who came to enforce the one-hour parking limit at the picturesque,  Spanish-style shopping center reported that she left chalk marks on Baur's  Mazda and Bisco's Toyota, only to return later and find the marks wiped off.  </P> <P> The meter maid reportedly notified Officer Robert Connor, who walked into the  Coldwell Banker office and told Baur and Bisco that they were under arrest. The  women followed Connor to his squad car, where they were handcuffed and driven  to Police Department headquarters for booking, authorities said.  </P> <P> Bisco acknowledged that she wiped a chalk mark off her car's tire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moving Car Legal  </P> <P> But Baur denied that she did, saying that she merely moved her car to another  space when she saw the meter maid coming. Such a move is legal since the  one-hour time limit applies to individual spaces, not to the entire lot, a  police official said.  </P> <P> The women said their arrests were unnecessary and that Officer Connor told them  he was going to arrest them to "teach them a lesson" against parking illegally  in the lot.  </P> <P> They asked the Police Department not to press the charges.  </P> <P> Bisco said she expects to be through with the case after going to court and  paying a fine. But Baur has hired an attorney, Ray Legg, to fight the charge.  Legg said several witnesses will verify that Baur moved her car and did not rub  off a chalk mark.  </P> <P> "The officer was clearly wrong and still went ahead and arrested her," Legg  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adverse Publicity  </P> <P> Johansen said that Connor and other officers have been instructed not to  comment on the incident but that the department is "feeling put upon" by the  adverse publicity from the case.  </P> <P> Johansen insisted that the department acted properly in arresting the two  women; tickets are not issued for misdemeanors. "This is the only law we have  on the books to deal with this problem," he said. "We didn't have any other  choices."  </P> <P> The chief defended Connor's arrest of Baur and Bisco, saying the women would  have objected more and suffered greater embarrassment if police reports and  citations had been completed in the public shopping center.  </P> <P> The handcuffing, fingerprinting and frisking are all standard procedures that  are not waived for any arrestees, Johansen said.  </P> <P> Johansen said it is ironic that merchants should complain about parking  enforcement, since patrols at Malaga Cove Plaza were increased in March at the  request of the Malaga Cove Businessman's Assn.  </P> <P> "We've had complaints from business people that their customers have no place  to park," Johansen said. "It's kind of like they want it both ways."  </P> <P> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:  </P> <P> Readers comment on arrest. Page 9  </P></p>

An IDF soldier sustained a slight head injury when hit by a  stone in Rafah. The soldier received medical treatment and was  sent back to his unit.    The security forces and the IDF are maintaining very high  alert in anticipation of terrorist attacks by Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], mainly suicide attacks.    Security has been augmented and alert declared also in the  Qatif Bloc settlements following an 8 March Hamas leaflet  announcing a five-stage action plan against settlers.

After receiving treatment from  an Army doctor who was summoned to the site, he was evacuated to  a Jerusalem hospital.    In downtown Ramallah, two local residents were slightly  wounded while hurling stones at Border Police. In an attempt to  capture the stone throwers, the policemen fired rubber bullets.  The casualties were evacuated to the central hospital in  Ramallah and then sent home.

The Hayarqon District Police launched an investigation after  leaflets calling for murdering soldiers and settlers were  disseminated in various locations in Tel Aviv. The leaflets,  handwritten in Hebrew and Arabic, were placed in mailboxes early  Wednesday morning.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 10 March  adds that "in Rafah, the Army last night captured a wanted  terrorist in what was described as an initiated action," and "a  firebomb was thrown at an Egged bus at al-Jalazun, but caused no  injuries or damage."]</p>

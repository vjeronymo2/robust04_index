Since the Government of Brazil has undertaken measures to significantly improve the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and market access for persons relying on intellectual property rights and will take additional steps in the future in connection with its intention to implement the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Rights, the USTR has decided to terminate this investigation and monitor implementation of these measures under section 306(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the USTR has decided to revoke the Government of Brazil's identification as a priority foreign country under section 182 of the Trade Act, as amended, by section 1303 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This decision is effective as of Monday, February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Jon Huenemann, Deputy Assistant USTR for Latin America and Caribbean Affairs (202) 395&hyph;5190, Joseph Papovich, Deputy Assistant USTR for Intellectual Property (202) 395&hyph;6864, or Thomas Robertson, Assistant General Counsel (202) 395&hyph;6800, Office of the United States Trade Representative. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On May 28, 1993, the USTR initiated an investigation of the Government of Brazil's (Brazil) acts, policies and practices concerning the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights under section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2412). See 58 FR 31788 (June 4, 1993). The investigation covered the issues that are the basis for Brazil's April 30, 1993, identification as a priority foreign country under section 182(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2242): (1) several areas in the patent law; (2) failure to provide copyright protection for software as a literary work, too short a term of protection for software and penalties for copyright infringement that are insufficient to deter piracy; (3) inadequate protection for trade secrets; (4) no protection for semiconductor masks works (layout designs); and (5) significant levels of copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting. The original deadline for determinations under section 304(a)(1) of the Trade Act with respect to the investigation was November 28, 1993, but this was extended until February 28, 1994. See 58 FR 64351 (December 6, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the context of the five rounds of discussions that took place during the investigation, Brazil indicated that it has undertaken and will undertake as part of its domestic reform efforts a number of actions to improve the protection of intellectual property in Brazil, and to provide greater market access for products relying on the protection of intellectual property. These include improvements in the areas of protection for trademarks, semiconductor mask works (layout designs), patents and computer programs; market access for computer programs; and improvements in the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including efforts regarding the importation of pirated and counterfeit goods and the penalties for infringement of intellectual property rights. Moreover, since initiation of this investigation, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations has been successfully completed. Brazil has stated its intention to present the results of those negotiations for the approval of its Congress, including the provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the measures that Brazil has undertaken and will take in the future, the USTR has decided to terminate this investigation. The USTR will monitor Brazil's implementation of these measures under section 306(a)(2) of the Trade Act. In addition, pursuant to section 182(c)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, the USTR has decided that the information received warrants revocation of Brazil's identification as a priority foreign country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Irving A.

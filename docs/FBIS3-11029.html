			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The commander of the 3d Brigade headquartered in  [Cali], General Rafael Hernandez Lopez, said yesterday that over  the past six months raids have been carried out in northern,  central, and southern Valle del Cauca Department, zones where  members of the so-called Cali Cartel operate.    "We have been carrying out four or five raids each day in  all  those sectors where we believe there are presumed drug  traffickers or subversives. What is happening is that now we  have intensified them because the intelligence has improved," he  added.    According to the general, 11 raids were carried out in Cali  yesterday, seven in Palmira, four in Buga, and some others in  Popayan and adjoining areas.    He added that in the course of these raids they have seized  property, and vehicles, and have entered ranches and houses, but  so far no individuals have been arrested.    In Ciudad Jardin neighborhood, in southern Cali, in the past  few days various raids have been carried out in which  authorities found a building under construction which contained  a jacuzzi, gymnasiums, a sauna, and other luxuries.    The identity of the owners and the origin of the money  invested in that building are a mystery, and the authorities  decided to open an investigation to determine the identity of  the owners.    Other sources revealed that among the property seized are  armor-plated vehicles, one of which belongs to Fernando Tello  Dorronsoro, a Liberal member of the House of Representatives  running for reelection in Valle.    Spokespersons for the Prosecutor General's Office said that  the vehicle was seized during the raid of a residence presumed  to belong to former beauty queen Martha Lucia Echeverri.    With regard to several media reports on Thursday night [24  February] that one of the operations was on the verge of  capturing an important Cali Cartel leader, Gen. Hernandez said  it was false.    In addition, he said that all of confiscated items as well  as  "important documents which were being analyzed" will be turned  over to the Regional Prosecutor General's Office which is  conducting the investigation.  <H5>  A Strike in Bogota </H5>   In other news, a band of criminals which supposedly tried to  sell information processing equipment to the Cali Cartel was  dismantled last Thursday in Bogota by the Judicial and  Investigative Police whose units captured four of the members.    The operation took place at the intersection of calle 60 and  highway 17, in the Chapiero district, and the following items  were seized: 47 Minitelt data processing units (video, textual),  four Hewlett Packard monitors; sixty cartridges of various  calibers, and one piece of sound equipment.    According to preliminary investigations, the subjects had  contacts with the above-mentioned drug trafficking group and  their activities were discovered by an undercover agent and  through laborious intelligence work.    The four arrested were Salomon Gonzalez Garcia, Eduardo  Hurtado Galvis, Luis Daniel Parra Munoz, and Jose Maria Larrea  Corredor.</p>

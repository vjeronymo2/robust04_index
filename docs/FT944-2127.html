			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Compaq sides with Intel over Pentium Compaq Computer, the world's largest personal computer manufacturer, has sided with Intel in the controversy over a flaw in Intel's Pentium microprocessors. The PC maker said that after thorough analysis it has concluded the vast majority of PC users will not be affected by the flaw, which can cause errors in mathematical calculations. Compaq said it would continue to sell Pentium-based PCs. Compaq's decision is a vote of confidence for the Intel chip, following IBM's move earlier this week to halt shipments of Pentium-based PCs. IBM says errors due to the Pentium flaw could occur once in every 24 days and users of common spreadsheet programs may be seriously affected. Intel, which was forced to acknowledge that its flagship product was flawed last month when a professor in Virginia discovered errors in his research results, contends the rate of errors is fewer than once in every 27,000 years. Compaq said it has examined data from Intel and IBM and conducted its own study of the Pentium problem. 'We have confirmed that the statistical likelihood of errors is extremely remote,' said Mr Jim Paschal, Compaq vice-president of desktop computing. The assumptions upon which IBM based its calculations are valid only for very highly numeric intensive applications, he said. Several other PC manufacturers have this week announced they would continue to sell Pentium PCs, in spite of the flaw. Critics charge, however, that such companies may be acting out of self interest to avoid stalling sales during the busy Christmas sales season. Compaq's motives are less open to challenge because its PC models are based on earlier 486 microprocessors and the company has in recent months been highly critical of Intel's efforts to promote the Pentium chip as the PC engine of choice for home PC buyers.</p>

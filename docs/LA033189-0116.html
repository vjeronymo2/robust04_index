			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLED; HE WOULDN'T GIVE UP CAR  </P> <P> Suspected gang members shot and killed a man for failing to give them his car  while stopped at a red light in South-Central Los Angeles. In another attack  prompted by an attempted theft early Thursday, a 19-year-old was chased and  stabbed near Huntington Park by three men demanding his football jacket.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a third incident of violence left a 4-year-old girl hospitalized  Thursday with a gunshot wound suffered during a relative's argument with  another woman over a mutual boyfriend.  </P> <P> Vincent Rogers, 23, of Los Angeles died early Thursday after being shot around  midnight, police said. They said two men approached Rogers' Cadillac and  demanded the car as it idled at a traffic signal at Broadway Street and  Florence Avenue.  </P> <P> Rogers was shot after he refused to turn over the car, said Detective Don  Watson. The assailants are reported to be local gang members, he said.  </P> <P> A woman riding with Rogers took the wheel of the car and drove several blocks  to a police station. Rogers was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical  Center, where he died after surgery.  </P> <P> Shortly before 1 a.m. Thursday, three young men believed to be gang members  approached 19-year-old Felix Pena as he was walking home to Huntington Park on  Clara Street.  </P> <P> They asked Pena where he was from, a gang greeting, police said. Pena replied  "Nowhere," and the youths demanded his Dallas Cowboys football jacket.  </P> <P> Police said such jackets are among the type of athletic wear that is popular  with gang members.  </P> <P> Pena fled and was chased by the men, who caught him and stabbed him in the  face, wrist and abdomen. Pena stumbled about half a block to a telephone and  dialed 911.  </P> <P> Pena underwent surgery at County-USC Medical Center Thursday morning and was  listed as serious but improving, a hospital official said.  </P> <P> "We've had numerous thefts of jackets" in the last two months, Bell Cudahy  Police Detective George Richards said, but this was the first violent incident  in the Bell area.  </P> <P> "Usually they give them up," Richards said. "That stuff can all be replaced. .  . . I'd give them my jacket, pants, shirt -- whatever they wanted."  </P> <P> Earlier Wednesday, a 4-year-old girl at the Jordan Downs housing project was  shot in the neck about noon.  </P> <P> The shot was fired after the girl's 16-year-old relative and friends threw  rocks and bottles at a car containing a woman who was vying for the attention  of a man and considered the girl's relative her rival, said Detective Jim  Dieli.  </P> <P> The girl was listed in stable condition at Martin Luther King. The driver of  the car, a 22-year-old woman, was arrested. The shooter is still being sought  and police say they have contacted her family.  </P></p>

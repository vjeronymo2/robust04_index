			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from the "Views" column: "A `Solution' </F> of Massacre"--capitalization as published]    [Text] IT IS TRAGIC that at the end of the current  century, which has been marked by the horror of two world wars,  that human blood does not yet matter.    IT IS TRAGIC for the European Union and the international  community to express abhorrence at the bombing of civilians in  Sarajevo while, at the same time, they threaten a massacre  through air raids against the same place where the blood was  shed.    IT IS TRAGIC for the bombing, which will certainly kill  people and cause bloodshed and will most probably mean an  extension of the Balkan war, to be regarded as one of the  "measures" that "would be a first step toward realizing the  European Peace Plan."    IT IS TRAGIC to express abhorrence for the ongoing  bloodshed,  to discuss peace plans at the table while under the table arms  are being passed to all the belligerent parties.    IT IS TRAGIC for people who desire peace to play games  behind  their backs and the same people pay the price with blood, the  blood of civilians, the blood of children.    IT IS TRAGIC for human logic not to find a solution, the  solution that the people desire, and in the name of these people  to commit crimes with the same people as victims.    IT IS TRAGIC for everyone, both Europeans and non-Europeans,  to know that here are the Balkans, and the Balkans are the  powder keg of Europe and still, those who make any decisions for  air raids and the like do not realize that they are paving the  road to a new Vietnam.    So, IT WOULD BE tragic if in the end the international  community did not avoid "the major evil" to which it will be led  with the air raids by ignoring the value of human life and the  blood that will be shed.    FOR THIS "major evil" the expression of any abhorrence would  be the glorification of hypocrisy and cynicism. Greece, since  both the government and the parties agree, ought to react in  every way against such a "solution." The presidency of the  United Europe offers to Greece additional possibilities.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / United Biscuits up 12% despite price pressures in UK United Biscuits (Holdings) yesterday reported a 12 per cent rise in underlying interim profits with better performances in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific more than covering a downturn in the fiercely competitive UK market for biscuits and snacks. Pre-tax profits before exceptional gains for the 28 weeks to July 16 rose from Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 80.1m. On an FRS3 basis, the year earlier pre-tax profits were Pounds 134.1m after the Pounds 62.7m gain on the sale of Terry's, the chocolate maker. The profits beat most City forecasts by a small margin but the shares eased 1p to 319p after UB disappointed some analysts by failing to raise its dividend from 5.5p a share. 'No dividend increase was prudent,' said Mr John Warren, finance director. The company was conserving cash to invest in promising countries such as China and to improve productivity. It was also rebuilding dividend cover from about 1.7 times to about 2 although this would not preclude dividend increases. UK operations were affected by price deflation. McVitie's, the leading biscuit brand, saw volume grow 2 per cent without any value increase. The division's UK sales rose 1 per cent to Pounds 312.3m but operating profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 32.5m. But McVitie's overseas profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 10.4m on sales up 13 per cent to Pounds 168.8m. KP snacks saw the UK market volume rise 1 per cent but fall 0.5 per cent in value. KP's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 207.8m with a strong contribution from the Phileas Fogg brand. Profits were slightly ahead at Pounds 15m. A strong Asia Pacific performance and a flat result in continental Europe left KP division profits up 2 per cent at Pounds 26.6m on sales up 3 per cent at Pounds 454m. Heavy restructuring and brisk growth of specialist brands at Ross Young's, the UK frozen foods business, helped lift profit by Pounds 0.9m to Pounds 16m on flat sales. Keebler, the troubled US cookie and snack maker, showed the first signs of a turnround. Profits rose from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 19m on sales up from Pounds 585.7m to Pounds 622.6m. Snack sales fell by one-third after Keebler ended deeply discounted promotions. Net debt rose from Pounds 454.9m to Pounds 466.8m, and gearing from 55 to 61 per cent. Earnings per share were 10.7p against 17.1p including the Terry's gain and 9.6p without. Lex, Page 18</p>

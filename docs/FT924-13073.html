			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Base rate cut THE TIMING and the size of yesterday's cut in base rates from 9 per cent to 8 per cent took dealers by surprise. Pressure had been mounting all week for a reduction in domestic rates but the market was anticipating only a half point cut. When no announcement came at 10am - the Bank of England's usual time for signalling base rate changes  -speculation dwindled. Shortly after midday the Bank announced that houses wishing to use their borrowing facilities were invited to do so at 2.30pm when the interest rate would be 8 per cent, one point lower than the rate at which the Bank last lent to the money markets. The previous rate cut was on September 22 when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, ordered a 1 percentage point drop within days of pulling out of the European exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday's cut takes UK base rates 1 1/2 points lower than Germany's Lombard rate. The government's decision to cut rates was widely interpreted as a panic reaction at the end of a week in which, as one dealer put it, '98 per cent of the population turned against the government'. Many believed the government would wait until the Autumn statement in November to announce another cut. However, the political pressure for the government to act, following a string of dismal economic indicators and the announcement that 31 coal mines were to close, became overwhelming. Short sterling futures bounced 50 basis points immediately, with the December contract moving to discount a further  1/2 point cut by its expiry. At the close, the futures market was discounting rates of just over 7 per cent by the end of the year. The day's shortage was Pounds 500m. The Bank operated in new bands buying a total of Pounds 173m of bills in bands 1 and 2 at 7 7/8 per cent. It also lent Pounds 350m to the market at a rate of 8 per cent for seven days. Cash money market rates, dropped eratically lower. The three-month sterling interbank rate was quoted at 8 3/32 per cent from 8 1/2 before the Bank's signal of an easing during its midday market operations. Further along the curve one year money was quoted at 7 7/16 per cent down from 8 3/16 per cent.</p>

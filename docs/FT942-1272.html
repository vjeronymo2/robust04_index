			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (2): Can the non-oil sector fill the gap? - The economy, although most indicators are pointing upward, uncertainty lies ahead Norway, long bolstered by the benefits of North Sea oil, is entering a critical phase that will determine whether it can sustain its position as one of Europe's most prosperous nations into the next century. This year, almost all the economic indicators are pointing upward after several years of recession and stagnation. The economy as a whole is set to grow by up to 4 per cent in 1994 and do even better next year. When oil and gas revenues are excluded, the forecasts still show healthy growth, with so-called mainland GDP expected by the OECD to increase by 2.25 per cent in 1994 and by 3 per cent next year. Inflation, at less than 1 per cent a year, is among the lowest in Europe. The total government deficit for 1994 is estimated to reach 2.8 per cent of GDP, again among the lowest in western Europe. The balance of payments will show a large surplus of more than 2.5 per cent of GDP. Unemployment, the key domestic political concern, has stabilised and should fall slightly to 5.5 per cent of the workforce (although a further 3 per cent are on government training schemes). In the next few years, however, there are challenges to be faced which raise important question-marks over whether this optimistic outlook in the short-term can be extended into a pattern of steady long-term growth. This autumn, Norwegians, along with their Nordic neighbours in Finland and Sweden, will decide in a referendum whether to join the European Union: the minority Labour government, the opposition Conservative party and the vast majority of the business community say a vote against membership would threaten already low investment flows and weaken the economy in the long term - but so far a majority of voters are still against joining. Moreover, the stream of oil and gas revenues that has so boosted Norway over two decades is expected to start declining at least by the end of the century. Norway has already suffered one big oil 'shock', when prices fell dramatically in 1986. In the space of one year, the oil industry's contribution shrank from 18.5 per cent of GDP to 11 per cent. Over the subsequent years, heavy increases in production have pushed the figure back up to 16 per cent of GDP, but oil production will start to fall in 1996. Natural gas revenues will help, at least for some years, to meet the shortfall. But the concern is whether the country's relatively weak non-oil economy, which is dominated by the public sector, will be strong enough to fill the gap as output from the petroleum sector starts going down. These worries have been exacerbated in recent years by a sharp deterioration in the public finances. An expansionary fiscal policy, adopted by the Labour government since 1990 to offset the rigours of recession, has led to a deepening of the state budget deficit (as distinct from the overall consolidated government deficit) to 12.5 per cent, excluding oil-related items. In its latest report on the Norwegian economy, the OECD warned: 'Unless this deficit problem is addressed, the implications for the future would be a reduced level of government expenditures or higher taxes relative to GDP.' The government is well aware of these longer-term difficulties and has set out, in a 1994-97 programme presented to parliament last year, a strategy for dealing with them. It is based on a significant tightening of fiscal policy, a move to hold down transfer payments in favour of infrastructural investments, and a general shift in emphasis from the public to the private sector. Mr Svien Harald Oygard, the senior official at the finance ministry, says that already the effects of this programme are beginning to be felt. This year, public expenditure will rise by less than 1 per cent - well below the levels of GDP growth. The growth in the public sector's share of employment, which rose from 23 per cent to 30 per cent from 1980 to 1992, is set to stop. Low recent wage settlements, a weakening of the value of the Norwegian krona since it was floated in late 1992 and a steady fall in interest rates over the past year have helped produce a significant improvement in the cost-competitiveness of Norwegian industry. 'We feel now that we are achieving growth that has a sounder base, with further strengthening of our competitiveness and increased investments, and growth that is better balanced between the public and private sectors,' says Mr Oygard. 'I believe we will continue with an ambitious incomes policy and quite a strong tightening of fiscal policy to allow room for a monetary policy that is not so tight.' Mr Steinar Juell, chief economist for Christiania Bank, gives the government credit for so far sticking to its programme to get the public finances under a tighter rein. But he still sees some warning lights in the longer-term perspective. He remains afraid that inflationary pressures will resurface as unemployment comes down, and is worried by some evidence - such as a smart recovery in car sales - that private consumption might return to unhealthy levels. It is estimated to increase by 3 per cent this year. Although the savings ratio, at more than 5 per cent, is still comfortably positive - compared with alarmingly negative in the late 1980s - it is once again falling. 'The turnaround has been much stronger than I had expected,' says Mr Juell. 'I thought people had longer memories and would be more careful.' Mr Juell and the OECD also share worries about the need for further structural reforms in the economy. Among these are the so-called sheltered sector of the economy - industries such as agriculture and food-processing - which are protected by subsidies and import controls. If Norway votes to join the EU, such protections will have to be progressively removed. With agricultural assistance making up 77 per cent of producer income, some 75 per cent more than the OECD average, reforms are seen as essential in the long term to achieving a competitive and vigorous agro-industry. But staying outside the EU would remove the incentive to achieve such changes. Tackling such issues is a necessary part of preparing the Norwegian economy for the time when oil revenues decline. 'It is not possible to do that much (to prepare for the post-oil era) without adopting a centrally-planned economy. It is therefore all the more important to emphasise the competitivity of manufacturing industry,' says Mr Juell. 'We must avoid the mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s. We have to keep wages and inflation under control and eliminate the budget deficit. Then it will be easier to create alternative employment.'</p>

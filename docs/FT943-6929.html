			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Hyundai workers agree to end 63-day strike Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, South Korea's largest shipbuilder, yesterday agreed to end a 63-day strike that could prove to be a watershed in the country's labour history. Analysts believe the conclusion of the strike may also signal the end of the widespread labour militancy that has plagued South Korea since the trade union movement was freed from state restrictions in 1987. The industrial action at Hyundai was virtually the only long strike to affect Korean business this year, in sharp contrast to the nationwide labour unrest that embroiled the country just a few years ago. Sizeable wage rises and dwindling public support have been the main factors for the recent improvement in labour relations. Other trade unions once known for their militancy, such as that at Daewoo Shipbuilding, have quickly concluded pay agreements this year. The strike at HHI confirmed the reputation of its workers for being the country's most aggressive, an attitude bred by the company's past authoritarian management practices. But the strike exposed the dwindling influence of its union leadership. The HHI union was previously able to trigger sympathy strikes at other Hyundai companies, but failed this year to gain such support. Moreover, the final days of the strike revealed a split in the HHI union, with some workers rebelling against the leadership's hard-line stance. This led to violent clashes between the rival factions. In its final settlement with the company, the union made a significant concession and agreed to accept the principle of no pay for no work. This is considered an important victory for the government, which has promoted the policy to curb strikes. But the HHI workers will receive an 11.3 per cent rise in monthly pay and generous bonuses that will mostly cover wages lost during the strike. The company also agreed to drop criminal charges against 49 activists who had led an occupation of the shipyard after executives ordered a lockout earlier this month. The company hoped the wage settlement will set a precedent for smoother labour relations. The strike is considered the most costly in HHI's history, with lost sales of Won473bn (Pounds 380m). HHI had set a sales target of Won4,000bn for this year. Labour unrest has occurred almost annually since 1987, with severe strikes in 1989 and 1993, when sales losses amounted to Won300bn.</p>

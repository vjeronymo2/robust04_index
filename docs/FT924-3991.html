			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / People: Jones quits Welsh development role Gwyn Jones, one of Wales' younger entrepreneurs, is stepping down as chairman of the Welsh Development Agency so that he can spend more time on his growing business interests and his role as BBC governor for Wales. The 44-year-old Jones, who was picked for the job by former Welsh secretary Peter Walker in 1988, will remain chairman until March 31 1993, or until his successor is appointed, if earlier. Prior to taking on the WDA job, Jones had been a successful businessman, having set up, and sold, a computer software business. Although Jones had only recently been reappointed as chairman, his decision to quit is not totally unexpected. Being a small country, Wales suffers from a shortage of well qualified people to take on the growing number of public appointments. It has been known for some time that Jones was keen to lighten his workload, especially since he took on the job of being the governor on the BBC board representing Wales. The WDA has been one of the more successful government-backed regional agencies in attracting inward investment. Since Jones took over, it has attracted twice as many projects as it did four years ago and last year Wales topped the UK regional investment league table. See Observer</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE: L.A.'S BIG CONVENTION BUSINESS IS MOVING ON;  </P> <P> TOURISM: ONCE RANKED AS A LEADING SITE FOR THE LUCRATIVE CONVENTION INDUSTRY,  LOS ANGELES IS TAKING A BACK SEAT TO OTHER CITIES, INCLUDING NEARBY ANAHEIM.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is losing out to other cities across the United States in the  lucrative convention and tourism business. No longer is the city ranked as a  top U.S. convention site, and Anaheim's more spacious facilities have more than  four times as many national conventions booked through 1994 as Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The reasons are many. City officials, downtown landowners and convention  organizers all agree that the major problems include an acute shortage of hotel  rooms and continued delays in city plans to expand and upgrade the aging  Convention Center.  </P> <P> Some already-booked L.A. conventions are looking to pull out of their  commitments as they get word of all the foot-dragging that seems to be going  on.  </P> <P> In 1985, the city issued $350 million in bonds to finance a Convention Center  expansion that was to be done this year. That prediction was later changed to  1992, then 1993, and now there is talk of completion in perhaps 1994.  </P> <P> While the City Council in 1988 approved an original engineering estimate of  $243 million, the lowest bid submitted this year was for $287 million. After  plenty of debate over how to handle the escalating costs, the Convention Center  Authority decided June 21 to award the construction to low bidders George Hyman  Construction Co. of Baltimore and M. A. Mortensen Co. of Minnesota.  </P> <P> Now the City Council must approve a plan of finance that essentially allows the  project to go over budget. The council is expected to take the issues up within  the next two weeks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the 28 acres of land cleared over a year ago for a  350,000-square-foot exhibition hall stand idle.  </P> <P> Things aren't much better across the street on the east side of Figueroa Street  at Pico Boulevard, site of the planned Pacific Basin Plaza hotel project.  </P> <P> The Community Redevelopment Agency, which is responsible for finding a  developer for the project, spent more than nine months negotiating with Calmark  Commercial Development Inc. The negotiations finally broke down this spring and  on May 25, the CRA sent out a new request for proposals (RFP) to the five  owners of the block bounded by Figueroa, Pico, Flower Street and 12th Street.  </P> <P> The 1.9 million square-foot hotel/office/retail complex is considered an  important part of the Convention Center's expansion plans and city officials  are anxious too see the projects 1,781 guest rooms become a reality.  </P> <P> Northview Corp., a subsidiary of Uri Sheinbaum's Calmark Holding Corp., filed  for bankruptcy protection in March. His company still has an interest in the  Pride Partnership, which is one of several owners of the proposed Pacific Basin  hotel site. Other owners include the Waxman Family Trust, investor Chit Young,  the City of Los Angeles and Ohbayashi America Corp. Ohbayashi controls more  than two-thirds of the site and reports that its agreement to let Calmark  negotiate on its behalf with the CRA has expired.  </P> <P> Ohbayashi is now shopping for a joint venture partner to help build Pacific  Basin -- preferably, executives say, an American company.  </P> <P> Despite its involvement in several U.S. projects, said executive vice president  Kuni Aoto, "We have no expertise to develop by ourselves in the United States.  We have to rely on other people." As for the company's search for a new  partner, he said negotiations are "very sensitive . . . I still do not have any  conclusion."  </P> <P> Ohbayashi is expected to pick a joint venture partner sometime in July. The CRA  will then review Ohbayashi's development proposal plus any alternative  proposals that may surface from other owners on the block.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Downtown L.A. First in Permits  </P> <P> Look for abundant construction activity this year in downtown Los Angeles, the  Simi Valley, Rancho Cucamonga, Newhall and Irvine.  </P> <P> These areas posted the highest dollar amount in building permits issued in 1989  throughout the five-county megalopolis we call Los Angeles. Western Economic  Research Co. Inc. of Van Nuys collected this building permit data by ZIP codes  and L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce chief economist Jack Kyser organized the  numbers into a report.  </P> <P> Among the findings: Downtown Los Angeles rated tops with a total of $445.4  million in recorded permits last year for commercial, residential and municipal  development in ZIP codes 90015 and 90014. The total for six downtown ZIP codes  posting significant new building permits in 1989 was $683.1 million compared to  $326.9 million in 1988.  </P> <P> Simi Valley ZIP code 93064 was right behind downtown Los Angeles with $167.1  million in mostly residential and industrial construction planned. Rancho  Cucamonga was next with $140.5 million in planned development within ZIP code  zone 91730. Irvine ZIPs 92714, 92718 and 92715 are slated for a total of $272.2  million in mostly commercial construction activity and Anaheim is slated for  another $178.2 million in mostly residential development within two ZIP code  areas.  </P> <P> Turning back to Los Angeles County, it took less planned activity in 1989 to  make the top of the list than the year before -- indicating a slowdown in many  areas. Newhall (91350) was number three on the L.A. County list with $131.6  million in planned construction activity in 1989 compared to $165.4 the year  before.  </P> <P> Calabasas (91302) was fourth on the L.A. County list with $106.8 in development  planned last year, almost all of it residential, compared to $247.8 million the  year before.  </P> <P> Other areas worthy of note include Brentwood (90049) with $94.5 million in  permitted construction, West L.A. (90025) which posted $89.7 million in planned  projects, LAX (90045) with $74.9 million, Westwood (90024) with $73.8 million  and El Segundo (90245) with $73.2 million.  </P> <P> Areas with less activity than expected include Lancaster/Palmdale, Long Beach  and South Orange County. As it has for years, South Central Los Angeles remains  inactive.  </P> <P> Most permitted projects, reported Kyser, get built within about two years of  approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SALES: USC Converts May Co. Structures to Garages  </P> <P> USC has acquired three May Co. warehouses on 4.4 acres south of downtown Los  Angeles, and the university plans to convert the structures into a 2,000-car  parking facility.  </P> <P> USC is paying $15.5 million for the property, which has been valued in excess  of $29 million. May Co., in turn, will get a hefty tax deduction for the  difference and recognition as the biggest corporate donor to the institution's  six-year fund-raising campaign.  </P> <P> The warehouses -- six stories high and totaling 1.1 million square feet -- are  located just east of the Harbor Freeway along Jefferson Boulevard. The need for  campus parking has grown acute in recent years and the university projects a  total of 4,000 current parking spaces will be lost over the next 20 years to  make way for more campus construction.  </P> <P> The new USC Parking Center is less than two blocks from USC and less than a  block away from USC Plaza, a large hotel and office project being planned by  USC's Real Estate Development Corp.  </P> <P> Ken Ruby Construction Co. of Los Angeles and Turner Development Co. of  Montclair have acquired 35 acres in Montclair and plan to begin construction in  July on the $42.4-million Turner Montclair Center, a mixed-use, multi-tenant  business park.  </P> <P> SDC Development of Newport Beach has acquired 31 acres in Ontario from Los  Angeles-based BKY Investments Inc. and plans to build a $40-million business  park just off the Pomona (60) Freeway. The project will include 156,000 square  feet of industrial space and 206,000 square feet of showroom space, anchored by  a 40,000-square-foot Levitz Furniture Store.  </P> <P> The Koll Co. of Newport Beach and Ohbayashi America Corp. have purchased 297  acres of land for $32 million from Union Pacific Realty in the Mira Loma  section of Riverside County; a new business park is planned. The two developers  are already cooperating on the $200-million 550 South Hope building project in  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Nearby, Boise Cascade Corp. has purchased 27 acres in the 190-acre Empire  Business Center from developer Mira Loma Ventures. Plans call for construction  of a 200,000-square-foot facility at the site.  </P> <P> Golden West Ontario Associates has purchased 577,000 square feet of industrial  space comprising the Etiwanda Distribution Center for $11.4 million. One of the  two buildings involved in the deal is completed and leased. A second building  is set for completion in September.  </P> <P> TCW Realty Advisors has bought 11812 San Vicente Blvd. in Brentwood for more  than $20 million from Coral Plaza Ltd. The 68,000-square-foot building is 88%  occupied but has a ground-floor bank branch standing empty. Brokers involved in  the deal include Auerbach Financial Ltd., the Klabin Co., Lowe Associates and  Jack Shanfeld Ltd.  </P> <P> Real estate broker Fred Sands has acquired the Wilbur Medical Plaza in Tarzana  for $9 million from the Resolution Trust Corp. The three-story, 52,264 office  building is located at 5620 Wilbur Ave.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEASES: Law Firm Renews at South Coast Plaza  </P> <P> Law firm Rutan &amp; Tucker renewed its lease for five floors of office space  at South Coast Plaza Town Center's Central Bank Tower in a deal worth an  aggregate of $25 million. Since locating at South Coast Plaza in 1981, the firm  has doubled in size and will now fill 90,000 square feet.  </P> <P> HOT ZIP CODES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Postal ZIP codes with over $50 million in building permits issued for major  projects in 1989.  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES COUNTY  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.00IN:3.65IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

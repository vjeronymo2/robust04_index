			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Opec agrees to cut production: Deep divisions remain over future policy on oil prices despite deal MINISTERS from the Organ-isation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed on Saturday night to cut their production by just over 1m barrels a day in a desperate bid to shore up oil prices. The deal was a hasty compromise stitched together after five days of the toughest talks amongst oil producers since the Gulf crisis. But the deal failed to hide deep divisions within the organisation over its future policy on oil prices. The agreement, designed to underpin world oil prices, could be undermined as Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of Opec's largest producers, expressed doubts about its terms. Saudi Arabia called the credibility of the deal into question when Mr Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, said he was dissatisfied with his country's production allocation. Mr Nazer was under strong pressure from King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, to resist attempts by other producers to force the kingdom to cut its output below 8m barrels a day (b/d). Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, would have liked to have seen the organisation implement a substantially larger production cutback to help make prices firmer. He said: 'I cannot accept this ceiling and believe it cannot help the price.' The overall production ceiling agreed by Opec's 13 members calls for a reduction in the flow of oil to 22.9m b/d from current production of 24.2m b/d, with members reducing output by an average of 9 per cent. But since Saudi Arabia has said it will not abide by its allocation of 7.9m b/d and will produce at around 8m b/d, overall Opec output will be slightly higher than 23m b/d in the next two months. There was general agreement that it was crucial to signal to the market that producers were willing to cut production. Prices since last November have declined by over Dollars 4 a barrel. According to Mr Mike Rothman, senior energy futures analyst at Merill Lynch, an agreement to cut production to 23m b/d will do little more than keep oil prices where they are now - at about Dollars 18.50 a barrel for North Sea crude. Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister said: 'I don't believe it's enough to bring about a meaningful price recovery which we'd all hoped for, but it's large enough to arrest a further deterioration of the market.' Saudi Arabia invested billions of dollars during the Gulf crisis to help make up for the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude from the market. It is unwilling to slash output back to its former level of 5.4m b/d. Russian workers strike, Page 3</p>

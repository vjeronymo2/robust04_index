			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italcable slips after tariff cuts ITALCABLE, Italy's state-owned international telecommunications carrier, reported a 19.7 per cent fall in net profits to L132.7bn (Dollars 106.84m) last year, from L165.3bn in 1990, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. However, it is maintaining its dividend at L230 an ordinary share and L250 a savings share. The downturn was expected after an average 20 per cent cut in international phone tariffs introduced in January 1991.</p>

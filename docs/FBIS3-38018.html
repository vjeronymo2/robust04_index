			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     A Russian Constitutional Court source said the president  has neither the authority nor the moral right to veto the  amnesty resolution passed by the State Duma, the lower house of  parliament.    The source, who asked not to be identified, told Interfax  that, under the Constitution, the resolution is not subject to  approval by either the upper house of the legislature or the  president. The resolution is thus definitive and cannot be  revised, but theoretically it can be checked by the  Constitutional Court, the source said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Streletskiy report under the "Special Services" </F> rubric: "Federal Counterintelligence Service Knew About the  Coup `Version' and Informed Russian Leaders About it in Advance"]    [Text] The Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service  [FCS] had the text of the scandalous document at its disposal  several days before the so-called "Version No. 1," with the  details of an alleged coup d'etat being prepared in the country,  was published in the press. More than that, the text procured  by FCS officers had been immediately forwarded to "the top" --  to the Russian president's staff. The authorities, therefore,  did know about the planned publication, but preferred to take no  preemptive measures thus unwittingly helping the noisy scandal  erupt.    In the FCS Public Relations Center, they would not tell your  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent in detail about precisely how  the chekists had managed to obtain "Version No. 1." FCS  officers are currently going ahead with operation-technical  measures with experienced specialists taking part whose task is  to locate the author of the text. According to Aleksandr  Mikhaylov, head of the FCS Public Relations Center, "it is  extremely difficult to determine the circle of politically  interested persons because `Version No. 1' contains far too much  downright gibberish." It is the document's gibberish quality,  as well as the fact that it was promptly sent over to the  president's staff, that made FCS officers believe there would be  no scandal. Nevertheless their prognosis was not justified.  This probably did not surprise professional chekists much.  Many of them have long been complaining of the fact that the  country's leadership often either ignores "hot" information  coming from the security organs, or having taken the information  to consideration it takes absolutely inadequate measures. "This  happens every time -- we suggest one thing but they do something  totally different," chekists complain.    In the FCS they predict that the bad example set by the  authors of "Version No. 1" would be emulated by numerous  "graphomaniacs with a political itch." Thus more "versions" may  surface in the near future. The counterintelligence service  vows to monitor closely the circumstances in which they come to  see the light of day.</p>

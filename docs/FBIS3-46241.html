			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] The reshuffle of the leadership of the seven  military regions of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has  continued with the retirement of the political commissar of the  strategic Nanjing Military Region.    The provincial media has reported that Lieutenant-General  Liu  Anyuan has been replaced by Major General Fang Zuqi. Military  sources said yesterday General Liu's retirement was due to age  and not to factional struggles.    General Fang is among a corps of young officers who have  been  promoted to the top echelons since the reshuffle began following  an enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in  mid-December. His last post was director of the Political  Department of the Beijing Military Region, a position he  occupied for less than a year. Responsibilities of the Nanjing  region include the Taiwan Strait and monitoring Taiwan's  military strength.    In addition to General Fang, two other senior staff of the  Beijing region, Lieutenant-Generals Li Laizhu and Zhang Zhijian,  have gained promotions in the last few weeks.    Sources close to the PLA said at the enlarged CMC conclave,  the top brass also discussed military organisation, strategy and  geopolitics. "The CMC will further streamline the command  structure by concentrating decision-making powers at the  headquarters level," an informed source said. The source said  the CMC was studying a recent suggestion by its think-tanks that  an organ similar to a Western-style national security council be  set up.    Aside from members of the top brass, such a council, which  might be attached to the Communist Party's Central Committee,  would incorporate civilian defence, intelligence and foreign  affairs experts. In terms of geopolitical strategy, the CMC  endorsed the shift of emphasis from the north and northeast to  the south and the east of the country.    Western military analysts said following improvement of  relations with Russia and other members of the former Soviet  Union, the focus of Chinese defence and power projections had  moved to the southeastern fringe. They said the majority of the  large-scale war games held by the PLA last year had taken place  along the south and eastern coasts.    The analysts said as a result of this new strategy,  expansion  of naval capacity continued to be a top priority with the  national armaments modernisation programme. However, Chinese  sources said both the CMC and the central Government had decided  to tone down media coverage of the expansion of the Chinese  Navy. The main reason was Beijing's desire to remove the  suspicion and anxiety of its Asian neighbours.</p>

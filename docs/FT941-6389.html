			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Treasury confirms 160,000 more pensioners to pay tax Labour claimed a success for its campaign on taxes last night when the Treasury admitted that 160,000 pensioners have been brought into the tax net by the freezing of personal allowances for the over-65s. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a Commons written answer that the freezing of the allowances in the last two Budgets would raise Pounds 140m. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury chief secretary, said Mr Dorrell's response revealed 'a very unfair Tory tax increase, and another broken Tory promise'. She added: 'This is going to hit people on very low occupational pensions very hard. It will provoke anger and bitterness among people who will think they are being penalised for having a small occupational pension.' Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the freezing of allowances was a 'back-door way of increasing income tax, hitting those people least able to afford it'. Mr Dorrell, who was answering a question from Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said 200,000 elderly married couples on low incomes would gain from changes to their allowances. He said the incomes of pensioners receiving income support will have risen by at least 11 per cent over the two years to April, when the Budget measures take effect.</p>

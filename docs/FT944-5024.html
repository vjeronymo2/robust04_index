			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Getting value out of your valuer - In a Nutshell Don't employ unqualified people to give advice on rating matters following the latest uniform business rate revaluation to be announced early next year. So says the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation, which represents public- and private-sector staff involved in local taxation. If the institute is to be believed, the UK is full of 'bogus rating consultants'. The institute's advice is to wait. Lists of valuations will be published by the Valuation Office Agency early in 1995 showing new rateable values that will come in next April. In the meantime, Business Rates: Your Guide is available for Pounds 5.99 from the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation. Tel 071 831 3505.</p>

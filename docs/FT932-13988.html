			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Management: Ford's new 'Asset' The opportunity to obtain a university degree by demonstrating a number of practical abilities, such as developing a new wiring system, is being offered by Ford UK. The BEng degree - developed as part of the 'Asset' initiative funded by the Department of Employment - is part of a wider joint effort to make education more relevant to industry. From this year the degree in engineering will be awarded by Cheltenham-based Anglia Polytechnic University (APU), based mainly on a Ford employee's portfolio of work experience. John MacDonald, a senior lecturer at APU who has been on secondment to Ford for several years, says APU has offered combined technology courses to Ford engineers for some years. Participants, who took up to four years on day-release to gain a degree traditionally, had to have some formal qualifications, such as a Higher National Diploma. Under the new scheme the work-experience of the student is accredited. A degree is made up of a total of 360 credits with up to 240 of these allowed to come via the accreditation route. 'We would expect an individual to study on day-release for at least two years,' says MacDonald. About a third of the 3,500 engineers at Ford's research and development plant at Dunton, near Basildon, have an engineering degree. The company hopes that by 1997 this will have risen to 50 per cent. This is all part of a wider upgrading of workforce skills by Ford, says MacDonald. 'Ford is now becoming a company that helps to educate its employees - rather than just offering them training.' The Asset initiative is funding 12 projects, all - except Ford's - developed by universities or polytechnics. The projects are all pilots but many of the ideas are likely to be taken up by the government which is intent upon extending vocational routes into higher education.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVITIES FALTER AS VISTA STEPS BACK TO THE FUTURE  </P> <P> It was to have been a grand display of computerized convenience: North County  residents can now avoid a long drive to San Diego and instead go to the Vista  courthouse to get, by way of state-of-the-art technology, certified copies of  birth, death and marriage certificates.  </P> <P> Wowzers! A computer terminal is linked to the mother computer in San Diego --  where more than 1.5 million birth, death and marriage certificates are on  computer file. And a state-of-the-art laser printer is set up in Vista, so the  record can be officially reprinted in, say, three seconds.  </P> <P> Supervisor John MacDonald was there. So was County Recorder Vera Lyle and  County Clerk Robert Zumwalt and a bunch of other high-ranking bureaucrats  looking sharp in their dark-blue power suits. There was a county photographer,  a ribbon to cut, even the first customer in line, wanting her son's birth  certificate.  </P> <P> A clerk sat at the keyboard and typed in the appropriate code. The screen  remained blank.  </P> <P> And, for the next 40 minutes, the screen stayed that way, blank. Clerks punched  in different letters and codes on the keyboard. Lyle, ribbon-cutting scissors  still in hand, fidgeted with a cable. Someone else turned the machine off, and  on, and off, and on again.  </P> <P> Blank screen.  </P> <P> Two high-ranking managers each got on separate telephones to computer  technicians in San Diego. They talked about mainframes and host computers and  how the whole system was "down."  </P> <P> Lyle fidgeted some more with the cable.  </P> <P> The customer was handed a piece of paper to fill out her request the  old-fashioned way, just in case. "We can mail her the certificate in a day or  so," a bureaucrat grumbled.  </P> <P> Lyle fidgeted some more with the cable.  </P> <P> Finally, the computer screen came on.  </P> <P> At about the same time, a courthouse electrician moseyed into the Superior  Court clerk's office in Vista and saw all the commotion. He walked over to the  computer.  </P> <P> "It hasn't worked for 40 minutes," someone sighed to him.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I know," he said.  </P> <P> Huh?  </P> <P> "I had all the computers 'down' so I could work on the controllers," he said,  speaking computer-talk. "I was doing something for the marshal's office. It was  on the log, that the computers would be down."  </P> <P> "But we had this big ceremony today!" a bureaucrat in a nice suit moaned.  </P> <P> "No one told me," the computer tech said.  </P> <P> Georginne Smith finally got her son's laser-printed birth certificate and  smiled.  </P> <P> Lyle, the county recorder smiled.  </P> <P> Annette Evans, the chief deputy county recorder, smiled. Last year countywide,  she said, 83,000 copies of records were made -- and more than 20,000 will  probably be made in Vista this year for people who don't want to drive to  downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> But call first and make sure the computers aren't down.  </P></p>

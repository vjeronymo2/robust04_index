He emphatically pointed out:  "China will hold dialogues about human rights on an equal  footing; however, China strongly opposes any country's  interference in other country's internal affairs under the  pretext of human rights. Any pressure on other countries under  the pretext of human rights and any statement or action which  interferes in another country's internal affairs should be  condemned."    Zhu Qizhen pointed out: "The Chinese Government has  advocated  on many occasions the establishment of a just and reasonable new  international political and economic order with peace and  stability on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence and of the recognition of the diversity of the world  and differences among various countries."    He said: The world is still turbulent and changeable, beset  with many destabilizing factors, and is not peaceful. The peace  and development so cherished by mankind face a serious challenge.    Touching on the establishment of a new international  economic  order, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: All countries have the right to  independently choose their own social system, economic mode, and  ways of development according to their own national situation.  The developed countries should respect and show concern for the  interests of developing countries, provide aid to developing  countries without adding political conditions, strengthen  dialogues between the North and South, and promote South-South  Cooperation.    Zhu Qizhen briefly introduced China's great achievements  over  the past 15 years since the start of reform and opening up. He  then said: "China is still a developing country with a low  income. To develop into a mid-level developed country, it will  require unremitting efforts for several generations. It is  highly absurd for some people to consider China's economic  development as a kind of `threat' and to disseminate the  so-called `China threat.'"    When he finished his speech, the audience warmly applauded.  Delegates from a number of countries came forward to shake hands  with him and expressed their admiration and congratulations for  his speech.    The current session opened on 21 March and is expected to  end  on 26 March.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURATEUR'S 'FIRE &amp; SPICE' FILLS COOKBOOK GAP  </P> <P> The flood of cookbooks published annually in the United States has left few  cuisines uncovered. One exception is that of Sri Lanka, a gap that has been  filled with the publication this year of "Fire &amp; Spice" (McGraw-Hill,  $19.95) by Heather Jansz Balasuriya and Karin Winegar.  </P> <P> Balasuriya is owner-chef of the Sri Lanka Curry House in Minneapolis, which  opened 12 years ago and was at that time the only Sri Lankan restaurant in the  United States. Other restaurants have since opened in California  </P> <P> Born in Colombo, Balasuriya has lived in the United States for 15 years and  knows well how to reproduce her cuisine with ingredients that are available  here. Most of the book is dedicated to a rich parade of Sri Lankan curries,  breads, chutneys and desserts. But Balasuriya has also included a chapter of  American dishes such as hamburger, pizza, Sloppy Joes and spaghetti spiced up  with Sri Lankan seasonings. A glossary explains unfamiliar ingredients, and a  source list names Los Angeles area Indian markets that can supply some of them.  </P> <P> The following recipe is Balasuriya's version of distinctive, dark roasted Sri  Lankan curry powder. Balasuriya condones using ground spices and dried curry  leaves instead of fresh if it is more convenient. And she advises that grinding  whole spices with a mortar and pestle will give better flavor than a food  processor.  </P> <P> HEATHER'S ROASTED CURRY POWDER  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon mustard seeds  </P> <P> 1/4 cup ground cumin  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons ground coriander  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons fennel seeds  </P> <P> 20 to 25 curry leaves  </P> <P> 10 cardamom pods, crushed  </P> <P> 6 whole cloves  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper  </P> <P> 6 (1-inch) lengths dried pandan leaves  </P> <P> 3 (1-inch) pieces cinnamon stick  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon crushed dried red chiles  </P> <P> Heat large skillet over low to medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cover and roast  until mustard seeds start to pop. Stir in cumin and coriander. When ground  spices begin to turn light brown, add fennel seeds, curry leaves, cardamom  pods, cloves, pepper, pandan leaves, cinnamon sticks and chiles.  </P> <P> Stirring continuously to prevent burning, roast spices until dark golden brown,  7 to 10 minutes or longer, depending upon heat of stove. Immediately grind  spices very fine, using mortar and pestle, food processor or spice grinder.  Store in airtight jar. Makes about 3/4 cup.  </P></p>

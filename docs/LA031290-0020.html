			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POOL USE  </P> <P> I am a swimmer, but not much of a swimmer. It has never occurred to me to enter  a swim meet but swimming offers me a safe, low-stress workout that my  40-year-old body appreciates.  </P> <P> Since I learned of the Westwood Recreation Center last May, I have utilized the  pool on an average of two to three mornings a week.  </P> <P> I am very concerned about the recent uproar regarding the Southern California  Aquatic Masters Swimmers Club sharing the pool with residents. I feel I have a  unique perspective regarding the situation (Metro, Feb. 23). From May through  December I swam "solo," paying $1 a session and enjoying my workout. During  those months I never had to wait for a lane because of the masters workout or  felt uncomfortable about the activity in the pool. Quite the contrary. One  morning I asked the coach about the program and was encouraged to join their  workout.  </P> <P> For the last five weeks my swimming routine has improved significantly, my  motivation to get in the pool at 7 a.m. has increased with new-found  enthusiasm. I have never seen anyone waiting for a lane to swim independently.  Rather than being a detriment to the facility, I believe the masters program  offers a positive alternative within the community.  </P> <P> I see no reason why both groups can't swim together and utilize the pool to its  fullest potential.  </P> <P> REBECCA REDSHAW  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

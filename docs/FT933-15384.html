			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Mr and Mrs Middle Japan make cautious party switch - Robert Thomson takes tea and talks politics with an ordinary family WITH A slight dent in their white Toyota and a crowded 90-minute train ride to central Tokyo, Tadaaki and Toshie Koizumi are self-consciously middle Japanese. They buy vegetables from a local co-op, have a restless 20-year-old daughter who wants to live abroad, and intend to break the voting habits of a lifetime at the coming election. Tadaaki is an engineer at East Japan Sugar Industries, linked to the Mitsubishi family of companies, while Toshie works part time at the local school preparing lunches. Kneeling around a coffee table, they take green tea and discuss the candidates in the No. 1 constituency in Chiba, where corruption is an unsurprising part of political life. 'There's not enough talk of policies. People keep talking about reform, but it's not clear what they mean,' Tadaaki said. 'We don't get clear answers on things like taxation or the defence forces.' Both were raised in households loyal to the ruling Liberal Democratic party, but Tadaaki, 48, and Toshie, 45, have never voted LDP. They are swinging voters this year, but the party will not get their support on July 18, when a general election is likely to leave Japan with a coalition government and the expectation of further instability. 'We have always voted for the Socialist party. We realise that they have problems with their policies, but we thought that a strong Socialist party could provide a balance against the LDP. We never really thought they could win an election,' Tadaaki said. In Chiba No. 1, five seats are to be contested by nine candidates, typical of the multi-seat system in Japan. If reforms are introduced after the election, the electoral boundaries would be narrowed and only one representative chosen. Voters would also select about half the total of MPs through proportional representation. All the old and suddenly-surfaced parties are represented. There are two LDP candidates, including one who has ties to Tadaaki's soccer club, which inspires a certain affection in him. Another sitting LDP member has rebelled, joining the Japan Renewal party, formed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister. To the Koizumis' eye, the JRP is indistinguishable in personality and policy from the LDP. Nor are they much impressed by Komeito, the party backed by Soka Gakkai, the Buddhist movement, which tends to do well in times of low voter turnout - the party can count on the faithful to show their devotion at the polling booth. Komeito has one Chiba seat, and volunteers have started the ring-around and the door-knocking to ensure that it is retained. The Koizumis are still fond of Mr Kenichi Ueno, the former Socialist party representative, and may have voted for him, had he not resigned last year after a European sojourn in the company of a gangster and a golf course developer. Mr Ueno, one of the more doctrinaire members of his still strongly Marxist party, was unable to resist temptations common to Japanese politics. He admitted that Mariya, the developer and stock speculator, paid Y300,000 (Dollars 2,800) a month towards his office expenses, and police are investigating the approval of a Mariya-built golf course - a Chiba graveyard was moved to make way for the clubhouse. Mariya officials also boasted that they regularly supplied Mr Ueno's fridge with fine cuts of Japanese beef. 'I think it's very unfair. I was surprised about the links to golf courses and so on, but he took nothing like the amounts LDP politicians have pulled in,' Toshie said. The absence of Mr Ueno, and his party's inability to reform itself have prompted the Koizumis to look elsewhere for the first time, probably to the Japan New party. The JNP, formed by a provincial governor, did surprisingly well at a Tokyo city election last month. Toshie and Tadaaki are still uncertain about the JNP's policies, which are pro-reform but vague. They worry about the dispatch of Japanese troops to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, fearing that it could be the start of a more aggressive military policy. And they are bothered by a separate military issue, the rusting army trucks dumped in a plot opposite their home. The Koizumis are unsure whether the coming election will lead to a clean-up of Japanese politics or of their rubbish mountain, but they admit to more than the usual excitement. Most interesting, Tadaaki says, is that 'you can't be certain' that the LDP will win, as it has since 1955. Both are certain to vote, but their 20-year-old daughter is unlikely to bother. 'She has absolutely no interest whatsoever in politics,' said Toshie. It is a matter of concern to them that, at the turning point in Japanese politics, their otherwise active daughter has been struck down by apathy.</p>

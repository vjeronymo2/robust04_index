			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The position of the  general director of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA  SR), Dusan Kleiman, seems uncertain after today's meeting of the  Slovak Coalition Council, which was mostly taken up by  discussion of the situation in the Slovak media.    Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Democratic Left Party  (SDL) Milan Ftacnik told journalists after the meeting that  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be meeting with Kleiman soon,  so that the latter could "explain his behavior with TA SR  property and its transfer to private persons."    According to the Slovak press, Kleiman gave the order for  the  agency's publishing rights to the "pro-Meciar" paper REPUBLIKA  to be transferred to the paper's editor-in-chief, Jan Smolec, by  March 20. They were transferred back eight days later, but  during this time TA SR operated the newspaper and paid its  costs. The press is also saying that the very publishing of the  loss-making REPUBLIKA by the agency is a violation of the law.    Ftacnik also said that the situation surrounding the Slovak  Television and Radio Councils and the Council for Radio and  Television Broadcasting also had to be clarified. The law  should be changed so that each parliamentary party nominated an  expert to the Council, he said.    "The Councils' activity could thus be renewed without the  suspicion that the ruling majority of the moment will always  fill it with its people, people who suit it," Ftacnik said,  adding that it was not impossible that a bill would be put  before parliament at the end of April.    Deputy Vladimir Miskovsky said that reservations concerning  television news broadcasting were the main reason for the  intended changes. Critics said, for example, that with party  press conferences more coverage was given to the opposition than  to the governing parties.    Speculation about alleged "painful spots" in the government  coalition was groundless, Ftacnik said. "Sometimes there are  differences in opinion concerning the speed or effectiveness of  several measures, but we always agree in the end," Miskovsky  said of the state within the coalition, which comprises the SDL,  three centrist groupings and the Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH). The coalition is also supported by the Hungarian  minority parties, representatives of which also attended today's  meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Li Miaoying (2621 5379 5391) and </F> Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556): "Foreign-Funded Enterprises in  Guangdong Play All Kinds of Tricks To Evade Taxes"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- A  relevant official from the Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau  has revealed that investigation results have shown that  approximately half of the foreign-funded enterprises in  Guangdong have evaded taxes in one way or another. The problem  is becoming increasingly serious and has had an impact on  Guangdong's financial revenue.    The official said that the phenomena of tax evasion -- such  as the non-synchronous growth of the industrial output value and  the amount of tax receipts -- are quite conspicuous in many  localities in Guangdong. The gross output value of the  foreign-funded enterprises in a certain city in Guangdong  accounted for 60 percent of the industrial output value of that  city, but the taxes paid by these enterprises accounted for only  15 percent of the total.    The Taxation Bureau official said that, in one or two  cities,  60 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises had evaded taxes.    Foreign-funded enterprises play all kinds of tricks to evade  taxes. The major ones are as follows:    1. Prices for imported goods are overstated and prices for  exported products are understated, resulting in losses or low  profits as recorded in the accounts. Foreign-funded enterprises  which import materials and export finished products evade taxes  by exercising control over the rights of purchase and sales  abroad and by overstating the prices for imported goods and  understating the prices of exported products, and the accounts  show low profits or losses. A foreign-funded toy plant in  Foshan City, in which over $4 million was invested, announced  accumulated losses of $1.8 million after operating for less than  one year. An investigation by the taxation departments showed  that the plant had tried to evade taxes by reporting losses.  Although the plant claimed to have suffered heavy losses, it  continued to inject enormous amounts of money to expand the  scale of production.    2. "Surrogate pregnancy" is used to avoid attention. The  products of a foreign-funded cosmetics plant in a certain city  are in great demand both at home and abroad, but the plant  announces heavy losses after operating for two years. At the  same time, another cosmetic company which produces the same type  of products is set up in the same city. Although its scale of  production is relatively small, it posts record sales of over  6,000 cases of cosmetics in a six-month period. Investigation  has shown that the products manufactured and sold by the company  were in fact "borrowed" from the plant. The taxation department  demanded that the plant pay 6 million yuan in back taxes.    3. Depreciation is overstated to increase the production  costs.    The taxation department official said that he believes many  foreign-funded enterprises have suddenly become rich through  evading taxes.    The issue of foreign-funded enterprises evading taxes in  Guangdong has attracted the close attention of the relevant  government departments. The State General Administration of  Taxation set up an anti-tax evasion group not long ago in  Shenzhen City, where many foreign-funded enterprises are  concentrated. The group will monitor and control foreign-funded  enterprises' tax payment on the basis of extensively collecting  various kinds of data. The Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau  is also working out effective measures to deal with the problem.  An official concerned said that the new tax system implemented  this year would be conducive to effectively carrying out  anti-tax evasion work. The use of unified value-added invoices  beginning from 1 July, for example, would be helpful to solving  the problem of tax evasion.</p>

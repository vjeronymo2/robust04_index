			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch economy bounces back The Dutch economy has grown by 2.2 per cent this year, far exceeding the 0.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product achieved in 1993, the central statistical office said yesterday. Reviewing the year, it noted that the sharp increase ended five years of steady decline in GDP growth from a peak of 4.7 per cent in 1989. This year's economic rebound was firmly led by exports, up 5 per cent in volume terms over 1993 when exports rose by just 2 per cent. By contrast, domestic economic growth was relatively weak, with consumer spending rising 1.5 per cent. This marked the first time in three years that the rise in consumer spending did not outstrip the wider economy. Although investment grew at a modest 2 per cent, this represented a reversal of the previous year's 2 per cent decline. West German industrial orders fell 0.2 per cent in October from September, but were up 10.4 per cent year-on-year. Slovakia posted a Sk160m (Pounds 3.26bn) foreign trade surplus in October, taking its January-October surplus to Sk1.38bn.</p>

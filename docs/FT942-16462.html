			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Hint of genius on a leaky boat - Alastair Macaulay finds Vanessa Redgrave tap dancing on a shaky 'Brecht in Hollywood' In an under-prepared production of a long sprawling anthology called Brecht in Hollywood, Vanessa Redgrave is currently putting to sea in a sieve. Aircraft noise is audible and distracting; some of the material is read, and not all the rest has been adequately learnt; the programme shows which last-minute cuts have been made; large chunks of the evening are performed in German . . . The list of problems goes on. Brecht in Hollywood has nothing going for it except strobe-like flashes of genius. Do not expect a story, or consistent roles, or sets. Do not expect a show which will re-tell parts of the life story of Bertholt Brecht. Do not expect material selected solely from Brecht's years in America (1941-47). Do not expect what the title Brecht in Hollywood leads you to expect: ie a survey of serious socialist anger marooned amid the entertainment industry at its most capitalistic. (The programme reveals that there have been efforts to give the show the more appropriate, less catchy, title of Brecht in Exile.) Expect only scenes, and songs, and readings, that show facets of Brecht's unflinching scrutiny of the great cultural ironies of his (and our) time. Wilful blindness to fascism and anti-Semitism; exile from home, and social displacement; nihilistic despair amid the lures of capitalist luxury; moral seriousness co-existing with the weakness of the flesh . . . Brecht remains a uniquely disturbing artist and this show - like (though unlike) The Life of Galileo, seen recently at the Almeida - reminds London of his importance. And indeed his prescience. His ironic and eloquent sketch here, Visit to the Banished Poets, reminds us of the famous exiles of Ovid, Euripides, Villon, Dante; and it ends with a memento of the poets whose work has been destroyed. We, however, hear it with ears that have heard more than Brecht had about the exiles and silencings of Soviet artists, and it startles us all the more. One of Vanessa's two colleagues is Ekkehard Schall, long celebrated for his acting with Brecht's Berliner Ensemble, and here demonstrating some acting of truly Stanislavskian intensity and characterful detail. (Just how detached the correct Brecht style should be is one of world theatre's endlessly debatable mysteries, like how comic Chekhov should be.) He gives us scenes as the rising fascist Arturo Ui - a terrifyingly forceful time bomb, whom he irradiates with dark slyness, fierceness, and, most alarming of all, a certain driving stupidity. And his Galileo is a conception more startling than Richard Griffiths's at the Almeida - more burnt-out, more burningly ironic - or it would be were it not for the excessive thickness here of his German accent. As for Vanessa, she keeps doing everything that you might regard as shooting herself in the foot. She starts the show, by reading, head down, in that extraordinary Vanessa monotone that can sometimes, but not here, be so infuriating. She sings, not often in tune, and with a voice that is notably hoarse in its upper notes even when speaking. She does a tap dance and (kind of) the splits, neither with particular distinction. For heaven's sake, the woman is 57. And yet she is luminous. There have been times when I have been irritated by (this is tricky to explain) how carefully she has worked to achieve an effect of spontaneity. Here, however, she is marvellously fresh. Even tap dancing in a Mahagonny excerpt, she manages on the one hand to convey a kind of charmingly enthusiastic tackiness, while on the other keeping up a relaxation in her upper body and face that is a reproof to those tensely tapping Australians in Hot Shoe Shuffle. (And then she takes off her shoes, and carries on dancing, blithely.) Her Jewish Wife (from Fear and Misery of the Third Reich) beautifully evokes the conflicts of feeling in a woman who is about to leave the husband who will not realise the doom that encompasses her here. Her account of How to Seduce an Angel - spoken while occasionally licking the creamy froth from a bowl of egg whites - is a gem of naughty charm. The simplicity of her playing, and her attention to her colleagues, are all exemplary in themselves, and do great honour to Brecht's many layers. Rade Serbedzija, the third member of the team, has great charm in a wide range of roles. These are some of the many virtues of Brecht in Hollywood, and they grow larger in my mind as I think about them now. But it is a messy, long, under-cooked meal of an evening. Goran Stefanovski devised it, and Lenka Udovicki directed it, and if they had done so with more discipline they would have done everybody a favour. Not least Brecht. At the Bridge Lane Theatre, Battersea, SW11, until April 30.</p>

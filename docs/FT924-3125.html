			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Firm demand for Dollars 2bn Citicorp offering CITICORP'S Dollars 2bn global offering of credit card backed securities, launched yesterday for pricing today, met firm demand from investors in both the US and Europe. The offering, consisting of Dollars 1bn of two-year notes and Dollars 1bn of five-year notes, is backed by Citicorp credit card receivables. The indicated pricing is 17 to 20 basis points over the London interbank offered rate for the two-year notes, arranged by Citibank, and 30 to 32 basis points over Libor for the five-year notes, arranged by Salomon Brothers. The notes will be priced tomorrow at par or slightly below. Both two-year and five-year notes were issued in conjunction with junior tranches of notes arranged by JP Morgan. Dealers said that demand for the two-year notes had been particularly strong in the US, where the large money funds provide a ready investor base. 'Most of the US funds are able to go out as far as two years, and are prepared to do so when the yield is high enough,' said one trader, who added that the same sort of investor base did not exist in Europe. Citicorp has already launched an issue of floating-rate notes backed by credit card receivables, earlier this year. The deal completes Citicorp's Dollars 5bn securitisation programme this year. The company expects to have a Dollars 5-6bn borrowing programme again next year, an official said. Exportfinans, the Norwegian export lending agency, plans to use a novel structure which will allow it to add to its Tier 1 capital. The agency has filed a proposed public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US for a Dollars 100m issue of preferred capital securities. The structure, which has not been used before, was developed by Goldman Sachs. The concept is similar to preferred stock, expect that legally the securities are not shares. Nevertheless, the Norwegian regulatory authorities have approved the securities as Tier 1 capital. The securities will be denominated in dollars and will entitle holders to receive fixed-rate quarterly interest payments, subject to certain conditions. The subordinated debt will be undated, but Exportfinans will have the right to redeem the securities at par after 10 years, subject to regulatory approval. Other Norwegian borrowers might be able to use the same type of instrument, but borrowers from other countries would need to convince their regulators to approve the structure as Tier 1 capital.</p>

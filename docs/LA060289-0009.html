			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER GETS PROBATION IN ATTACK ON DAUGHTER  </P> <P> A Lancaster judge Thursday sentenced Ava Casey Brown to five years probation  for running her 16-year-old daughter off the road in a high-speed car chase, in  line with an appeals court decision that threw out Brown's original five- year  prison term.  </P> <P> Brown, of Littlerock, was originally sent to state prison for assault with a  deadly weapon and child endangerment, but was released eight months later by  order of the state Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> In her ruling Thursday, Lancaster Superior Court Judge Margaret M. Grignon  cited the appellate court's decision, which questioned the appropriateness of  the prison term imposed by former Lancaster Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen  in 1987.  </P> <P> Brown, a nurse's aide and Sunday school teacher, ran her daughter, Renee Casey,  off the road in a car chase after Casey stayed out late without permission.  Brown pursued Casey at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. and bumped her car at least  twice, causing a crash in which Casey's teen-age passenger suffered a broken  collarbone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angry Debate  </P> <P> At Thursday's sentencing hearing, which included angry debate over allegations  of racism made by Brown and her supporters, Grignon said Brown's lack of a  criminal record and the spontaneous nature of the crime met legal criteria for  unusual cases in which probation is appropriate.  </P> <P> "In light of the appellate opinion, the probation report . . . and in light of  the fact that the defendant has spent time in state prison, I see no purpose in  sending her back to state prison," the judge said.  </P> <P> Grignon said Brown's incarceration would severely disrupt the lives of her  three other children. She ordered Brown to pay $100 in restitution to Arintha  Anderson, the passenger injured in the car crash.  </P> <P> Brown, 37, wept outside the courtroom as she was congratulated by her fiance,  Mark Alston, and friends from the predominantly black Sun Village neighborhood  of Littlerock.  </P> <P> "It's over with," she said. "Thank you, Jesus. I'm going to sit down and write  a book about my experience, and I'm going to plan my wedding."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Immediate Release  </P> <P> This year, the appellate court upheld the conviction. The three-judge panel  ruled that Judge Coen, who is now in San Fernando Superior Court, erred when he  rejected a probation officer's report urging that Brown get probation, declared  Brown a danger to the community and set bail at $100,000. Criminal defense  experts called the appellate court decision to release her immediately on her  own recognizance extremely rare.  </P> <P> Brown and her supporters have alleged that she was the victim of harsh  treatment by a white judge and jury because she is black.  </P> <P> Those accusations were criticized Thursday by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent C.  Cahill, who asked Grignon to impose a sentence of six years in state prison.  Cahill pointed out that the appellate court had upheld the conviction,  including a finding that Brown intended to commit great bodily harm.  </P> <P> He called Brown an unrepentant, "self-righteous" woman and said the unfounded  claims of racism "cheapen and dilute valid cries of racism."  </P> <P> "One of the most insidious forms of racism is when someone cries racism where  none exists," Cahill said. "A mother rammed or bumped her daughter's car and  forced it into a ditch. I don't care what color she was, that's outrageous  conduct. The only racism I ever saw were the allegations of racism by Ava Brown  and her supporters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Praised  </P> <P> Brown and her supporters praised Grignon and repeated their criticism of Cahill  and the original judge and jury, saying Brown would not have been treated as  harshly if she were white.  </P> <P> "I would maintain that there were racist overtones," said the Rev. Samuel  Hooker, Antelope Valley NAACP chapter president. "Throughout the whole process,  not just the sentencing. I hope the  </P> <P> system would recognize that we would like to see justice. If you're guilty, you  do deserve punishment."  </P> <P> Brown's attorney, Leonard E. Chaitin, said the state appellate judges were the  heroes of the case and praised Grignon for ignoring Cahill's hyperbole.  </P> <P> Brown said she is not bitter about her imprisonment. Although she did not feel  she belonged in prison with hardened criminals, she said, some of them were  most helpful in urging her to write letters to the appellate court asking to be  released.  </P> <P> "I learned a lot in prison," she said. "I learned how to get along with people  who really have a hard heart."  </P> <P> Brown said her daughter, now 19, lives with relatives in Arizona and remains  estranged from her.  </P></p>

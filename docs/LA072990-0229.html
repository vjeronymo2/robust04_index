			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS PICKS  </P> <P> Dressed to Kill  </P> <P> The brilliance of Brian De Palma's "Dressed to Kill" is apparent within seconds  of its opening gliding shot.  </P> <P> This variation on themes of sex, voyeurism, guilt and murder, in "Psycho" and  "Vertigo," is a sustained work of terror -- elegant, sensual, erotic, bloody, a  directorial tour de force. Echoes of Hitchcock are everywhere. De Palma never  lets up. To his view of city life as a sleek-surfaced, unhelpful maze of chrome  and glass, he adds an unlikely element: humor along with eroticism and terror,  as seen on Angie Dickinson's face (above).  </P> <P> (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.) Sheila Benson  </P></p>

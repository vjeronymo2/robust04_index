			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: National Express blames recession for 45% decline NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach service operator floated late last year, yesterday blamed a 45 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits on the continuing effects of the recession on domestic services and the costs of a redundancy programme designed to cut the workforce by 10 per cent. Reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 585,000 on turnover of Pounds 57.4m in the 28 weeks to July 10, the company said the performance would have been healthier had it not been for Pounds 427,000 in exceptional redundancy costs in its UK express coach arm. The figures compare with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.06m on turnover of Pounds 56.9m in the 28 weeks to July 11, 1992. A maiden interim dividend of 2.5p is declared, payable from earnings per share up from 0.2p to 1.3p. Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, said the decline was due to the poor performance of the express coach division, which reported an operating loss of Pounds 621,000 compared with a deficit of Pounds 211,000 in 1992. The division 'has not yet seen any evidence of sustained economic recovery', he said. The group has been strengthened by the acquisition of three new businesses for a total of Pounds 159m: Scottish Citylink, the scheduled coach operator; Eurolines (Nederland), part of the inter-European network; and East Midlands International Airport. The airport's trading results have not been included as the purchase was completed after the end of the results period. The group's other divisions, meanwhile, moved ahead. Operating profits at Eurolines (UK) were Pounds 462,000 (Pounds 411,000); Airport Coach Services was up to Pounds 241,000 (Pounds 219,000). National Express has shelved plans to upgrade its core coach business with refurbished stations and a new reservation system while it assimilates its new acquisitions. The company has, however, been careful not to abandon its investment plans, designed to woo passengers back from British Rail, and has only postponed them until the coach market shows signs of generating the passenger volume to make the outlay worthwhile. In the meantime, the group says its has substantial spare cash which it intends to use to develop its new businesses rather than embark on further acquisitions.</p>

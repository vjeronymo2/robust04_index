			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OH, YOU KIDS  </P> <P> I hate Chris Willman! How could he write such a bad review of New Kids on the  Block's album "Step by Step" (June 3)? I've heard three of the songs on the  album and it already sounds like a hit to me! New Kids must be "all right" if  they are No. 20 on the pop chart already!  </P> <P> New Kids make music that teen-agers can relate to! That's not all! My mom  happens to love them.  </P> <P> Why don't you go to a concert and see how many adults go with their kids. My  mom would never be caught dead at one of my brother's Metallica concerts!  </P> <P> Next time you write a review on them, remember, New Kids rule! And people will  always stick up for them!  </P> <P> KELLY SMITH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

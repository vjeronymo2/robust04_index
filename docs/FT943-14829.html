			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Belarus pushes Russian links Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the new president of Belarus, yesterday promised to 'do everything possible' to conclude an economic union, including a single currency, with Russia and said that 'there is no way out of our economic crisis without Russia.' He is to talk to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, this morning by phone and will ask for an early meeting. Russia and Belarus have already agreed to work out proposals for an economic union by the end of this month - though the Belarus central bank has strongly objected to the loss of economic sovereignty entailed in giving away the right to print its own currency. Mr Lukashenko said he regretted the collapse of the Soviet Union and said he was 'catagorically against' the withdrawal of the 40,000 Russian troops from Belarus. He also favoured a 'state regulated economy. I am ready to meet businessmen tomorrow and to say to them - help me out of our crisis. If they help me, I'll help them. If instead they just think of ways to make a bigger profit, then they'll find it hard.' He said he would fulfil his pre-election promise to stop privatisation 'because the people feel its all just a trick and only for criminals. But if there is a privatisation that can be done in the interests of the people, then we would look at it.' Three into one, Page 23</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIX WAYS TO PROTECT AGAINST LITIGIOUS BUYERS;  </P> <P> DISCLOSE DEFECTS, PROVIDE AN INSPECTION, GET AN INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER  REPAIRS.  </P> <P> Selling your home or other real estate is not easy. With prices so high, buyers  have become very picky and demanding. They expect the property to be in perfect  condition. But no home is without flaws, so sellers and their realty agents  must know how to protect against buyers who are only too anxious to sue for  damages.  </P> <P> For example, last year I sold a newly remodeled home. As far as I knew,  everything was in tiptop condition. However, just last month I received a bill  from the buyer who expects me to pay the cost of cleaning the sewer line, seven  months after the sale was closed. To guard against being liable for frivolous  claims like this, smart home sellers and their realty agents take these  precautions:  </P> <P> Disclose, disclose, disclose. The best protection a home seller and his/her  realty agent have against a litigious home buyer is to disclose in writing all  known defects in the property. For example, recently I inspected a home for  sale where the realty agent left written disclosure forms on the kitchen  counter so all prospective buyers could take a copy to study.  </P> <P> California was the first state to require sellers and their realty agents to  provide written home defect disclosures to buyers. In states without similar  disclosure requirements, the best real estate agents ask their sellers to fill  out voluntary disclosure forms to protect both home sellers and their agents.  </P> <P> Provide a one-year home warranty policy for the buyer. Most realty agents  recommend their sellers provide a one-year home warranty policy, costing around  $250, which pays for repairs to the plumbing, wiring, heating and built-in  appliances. Such warranties prevent buyer complaints.  </P> <P> To illustrate, about a week after I moved into my current residence, the water  heater began to leak. I'm sure the seller had no knowledge of this problem, but  it was nice to phone the warranty company and have a new water heater installed  the same day at a cost of only a $25 service fee. As a result, the seller and  realtor never heard any complaint from me.  </P> <P> Have the home professionally inspected at the time of listing. The best realty  agents recommend their home sellers obtain a professional inspection at the  time the house is listed for sale. The cost is around $300 in most communities,  sometimes less. Such a report is reassuring to prospective buyers who may have  doubts about a home's structural soundness. It also reveals any defects found  by the inspector, so the buyer cannot later complain about nondisclosure.  </P> <P> Obtain a termite inspection report when listing the home for sale. Another  technique the best professional realty agents use is to order a termite and  structural pest control inspection report at the time the home is listed for  sale. This prevents costly surprises for the seller later.  </P> <P> Most home buyers and mortgage lenders insist on such reports, so it is best to  know the extent of any damage up front. The seller can elect to either have the  damage repaired or to give the buyer credit for the repair cost.  </P> <P> Of course, the buyer can hire his/her own inspection company but if a report  has already been obtained, the buyer will usually accept it.  </P> <P> Be sure the realty agent carries errors and omissions insurance. Despite all  precautions, just in case something goes wrong and an unexpected defect later  materializes, be sure the realty agent carries errors and omissions insurance  from a reputable insurer. Beware of self-insured agents who may not have  adequate reserves. A realty agent without "E and O insurance" is like an  uninsured motorist -- very dangerous.  </P> <P> Sell the home "as is." Finally, after using all these techniques, if you are  the seller and are not certain of the home's physical condition or if you want  to avoid any possible liability for a defective condition, such as an  inadequate septic tank, sell the home "as is." That means the seller and realty  agent have disclosed known defects and make no warranties or representations  and will not pay for any repairs.

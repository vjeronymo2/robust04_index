			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed "K.M.": "Sonatrach: Strategic Redeployment"] </F>   [Text] With the recent implementation of the new  organizational scheme for its general management (see EL WATAN's  issue No. 1049 dated Saturday, 12 March 1994), the national  company Sonatrach [National Company for the Transport and  Marketing of Hydrocarbons] has seriously initiated the first  phase of three of its modernization plan.    This modernization process was explained by Mr. Abdelhak  Bouhafs, Sonatrach's director-general, at a conference, which he  gave in December 1993.    The first stage, covering the years 1992-95, aims at making  Sonatrach an Algerian petroleum and industrial group having its  hydrocarbon activity in every direction. This stage aims to  strengthen the company's basic technical skills and seek  excellence in these skills.    The second stage, which overlaps the first, goes from 1992  to  the year 2000. The aim is to make Sonatrach an Algerian and  international petroleum and industrial group throughout the  energy field, in chemistry, and associated services.    Last the third stage, which will kick off the third  millennium, should see Sonatrach turn into an Algerian and  international petroleum group that is integrated and diversified  in the new skills that have emerged out of the proximity of  skills such as services, the farm-produce industry, etc.  According to Mr. Bouhafs, four major phenomena arising from an  analysis of the worldwide hydrocarbons economy argue in favor of  such a modernization.    He first cited a return to integration, with an upwards  return by Western companies and a downward expansion of  activities by producing countries. Second, he noted the more  pronounced breaking up of the market and the preeminence of  stock market phenomena in the setting of international prices  for the resource, resulting in their instability and their  decrease in real terms. The third phenomenon related to the  major technological expansion of international companies and  their refocusing on the hydrocarbon industry.    Last, Mr. Bouhafs mentioned an affirmation of the role of a  relatively recent player in the petroleum world, the petroleum  group that had emerged from the producing countries. This  development of the worldwide hydrocarbon industry convinced  Sonatrach's leaders that an increase in petroleum receipts would  be more the result of efficiency on the part of the petroleum  group which, according to Mr. Bouhafs, will have to be different  from Sonatrach's current organization in its technological  development and structural and managerial reinforcement. In this  spirit, the Sonatrach group will be built around three areas of  responsibility:        -  The group level, in which the general management will  play the role of an industrial holding company.    -  The operational  activities branches level, which is responsible for activity  management and development.    -  The operational base unit level.    At the same time these organizational measures are being  carried out, Sonatrach is continuing with its development plan  begun in 1992 and that should make it possible, as of 1996, to  double exports of natural gas, substantially increase GPL  [expansion not given] and condensate production, and slow down  the rate at which the production of crude oil is declining.    At his 22 December conference, Mr. Bouhafs wondered whether  the oil market would come up to the expectations of Algerians  who will have made very major investments to develop and  modernize their petroleum and especially their gas industry. He  replied as follows to his own question: "It is widely recognized  that forecast analysts are influenced by economic conditions to  the detriment of a prospective move. The last two decades have  illustrated the implications of such a move: in the 1970's, it  was the source of investments in the development of costly  nonconventional energy sources and of excessive diversification  strategies for the activities and skills of oil companies."    "These strategies and programs were abandoned several years  later, with diametrically opposed goals: now the emphasis has  been put on technology to improve the use of conventional  petroleum and gas and generalize their use. (...) This reminder  allows us not to ignore economic conditions but to generalize  them. In other words, where we are concerned, we should pursue  our petroleum and gas development plan."</p>

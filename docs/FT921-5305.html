			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Housing starts data help Dow to record high Wall Street DESPITE ANOTHER rise in bond yields, an increase in monthly housing starts and a rise in leading economic indicators helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average reach another new record close yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the end of trading the Dow was up 14.98 at 3,290.25, eclipsing its previous record close of 3,283.32 which was achieved last week. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 0.41 at 412.86, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, still prey to profit-takers, edged 1.22 lower to 634.25. Turnover on the NYSE was 202m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 906 to 780. On Monday the main influence on stock market sentiment was the big jump in bond yields, and the fear that high long-term interest rates might stifle the economic recovery. Yesterday, however, the market shrugged off another increase in bond yields, concentrating instead on the rise in January leading indicators and the 12.9 per cent advance in monthly housing starts. Both sets of data back up other recent evidence pointing to a modest recovery in economic activity. ITT jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 in turnover of 1.6m shares after the company announced that it expected to realise a Dollars 400m gain from the sale of its 30 per cent stake in Alcatel NV, the telecommunications subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom of France. ITT also said that it may use the cash to buy back some of its own stock. UAL rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 153 after the airline filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission plans for a shelf offering of up to Dollars 1bn of equipment trust certificates. Toys 'R' Us firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 in busy trading after Mr Michael Exstein, analyst with County NatWest, reiterated his 'buy' recommendation on the stock, arguing that the decision of the toy retailer's main rivals, especially Child World, to focus on profitability will aid Toys 'R' Us, which has been under strong pricing pressure from competitors recently. Santa Fe Pacific rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 11 3/4 following an upgrade from Shearson Lehman Brothers, which believes the decline in the railroad company's stock price now makes the shares attractive. Amdahl fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange as some industry analysts cut their earnings estimates for the computer company on the news that it is delaying shipment of its 5995M computers until the third quarter. Nutmeg Industries rose Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 24 1/4 following fourth quarter profits for the sportswear manufacturer and retailer of 23 cents a share, a big improvement on the six cents a share earned at the same stage in 1990. On the over-the-counter market, Sunrise Technologies plunged Dollars 4 1/2 , or 26 per cent, to Dollars 13 after the company projected a first quarter loss from operations. Canada TORONTO share prices closed little changed in moderate trading which was concentrated mostly in the last two hours of the session because of a technical problem between 10 am and 2 pm EST. According to preliminary data, the composite index slipped 2.68 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 3,576.7 and losing issues edged winners by 268 to 251. Volume of 19.5m shares was above the previous 18.4m, and trading value was CDollars 213.9m against CDollars 201.4m.</p>

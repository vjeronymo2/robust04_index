			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Serb President Slobodan  Milosevic has received Douglas Hogg, the minister of state in  the British Foreign Office, who arrived in our country today.    President Milosevic said there was no real chance of the  international community playing a positive role in the Yugoslav  crisis as long as it failed to face the truth, as long as it  accused Serbia of the aggression, as long as it fueled  fundamentalism, and as long as it continued sanctions against  the Serbian people in flagrant contravention of the UN Charter.  By accepting the EU's proposals, the Serbian side has  demonstrated its commitment to peace. It has transpired that  the war is being waged by those forces that instigate the Muslim  side into armed conflicts, something that is undoubtedly to  their detriment and claims a large number of casualties. It is  obvious that the policy of pressures and threats has resulted in  total fiasco and that a peace process, whereby all warring  parties are treated equally and the international community is  impartial, is the quickest way to peace, a normalization of the  situation, and a just political solution to the crisis.    President Slobodan Milosevic pointed out that the  continuation of economic sanctions against our country was  counterproductive, as they represent an obstacle to the  restoration of peace. This is why the international community  ought to abolish them.    It was stressed during the talks that the international  community should exert strong influence to discourage and thwart  the proponents of the war option and that it should be decisive  in stopping Muslim armed provocations and offensives against the  Serbs side to stop the war from escalating and to prevent  further destablization in the region.    Serbia favors an agreement on a permanent end to hostilities  on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina through an  unbiased involvement of the UN peace forces. For this reason,  the efforts to restart the negotiationg process are the  international community's priority task. The republic of Serbia  will continue to favor negotiations as a way of resolving the  crisis and will insist that the peace process cannot be  developed through the use of force but rather through equal  respect for the interests of all three sides.    The Yugoslav minister of foreign affairs, Vladislav  Jovanovic, also took part in the talks.</p>

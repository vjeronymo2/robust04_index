			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PAYBACK TIME FOR BIRD IN BEATING MILWAUKEE  </P> <P> Hot Rod Hundley, the one-time Lakers' court jester and a long time play-by-play  announcer in the NBA, calls Larry Bird the greatest player of all time.  </P> <P> That's high praise from Hundley, who roomed with Elgin Baylor and preceded  Jerry West at West Virginia before they became teammates in Los Angeles.  Hundley said Bird's intelligence and understanding of the game puts him above  all others.  </P> <P> Among other things, the 6-foot-9 Boston Celtics' star can adjust for the  benefit of his team. After nine seasons as the "small" or shooting forward,  Bird, 34, shifted to power forward this season.  </P> <P> The move, made possible by the return of guard Brian Shaw from Italy and the  play of rookie guard Dee Brown, has proved an instant success. The Celtics are  one of the big surprises of the season.  </P> <P> Bird, snapping out of a shooting slump, scored 18 of his 30 points in the first  quarter Wednesday night at Boston to lead the Celtics to a 129-111 rout of  Milwaukee.  </P> <P> The Bucks, who had won four in a row to take first place in the Central  Division, made it a game for only the first eight minutes. Tied 20-20, the  Celtics, with Bird showing the way, spurted to a 34-24 lead and were never  headed. Bird made his first six shots.  </P> <P> On a three-game trip last week to Texas, Bird was only 12 for 48 until he made  three long baskets to end Sunday's game in Houston. Bird picked up where he  left off in Texas, making 11 of 15 shots.  </P> <P> The Celtics have won 13 of their last 15 and their 17-4 record leads the  Atlantic Division by three games. It is the second-best record in the league  and five games better than at this time a year ago.  </P> <P> "I like the challenge of playing a new role," Bird said. "There are new  matchups and new defensive assignments. Unfortunately, when you aren't  shooting, it doesn't make any difference what position you play."  </P> <P> There was something else on Bird's mind for this one. In their previous meeting  Nov. 13 at Milwaukee, Bird had played one of the worst games of his career. He  had only five points in 28 minutes and the Bucks won big.  </P> <P> "I knew it would happen," moaned Buck Coach Del Harris. "He never forgets after  a poor game."  </P> <P> Houston 108, Philadelphia 100 -- When the Rockets last won in the Philadelphia  Spectrum, Akeem Olajuwon was only 10.  </P> <P> He had 29 points and 15 rebounds and, almost by himself, ended the Rockets'  23-game losing streak at Philadelphia. Houston last won there Jan. 2, 1974.  </P> <P> The Rockets led by 11 points in the first quarter and increased it to 21 in the  second quarter before Charles Barkley rallied the 76ers.  </P> <P> Barkley had 29 points, but he and the other 76ers' big man, Rick Mahorn,  couldn't match the rebounding of Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe. The Rockets' big men  had a 25-12 advantage.  </P> <P> San Antonio 92, Charlotte 81 -- There was no letdown for David Robinson and his  Spurs after a decisive victory over the NBA champion Pistons Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Robinson had 24 points and 17 rebounds at Charlotte, and the Spurs pulled away  steadily in the second half. The victory enabled the Spurs to take over first  place in the Midwest Division.  </P> <P> Although they made only 44% of their shots, the Spurs trailed only once.  </P> <P> Atlanta 118, Miami 93 -- Dominique Wilkins had 28 points and 14 rebounds at  Miami to lead the Hawks to their fourth victory in the last five games.  </P> <P> Wilkins had two three-point baskets in a 10-2 run in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Seattle 99, Indiana 90 -- The Pacers, the only team that hasn't won on the  road, made it a close game before losing their 11th in a row away from home.  </P> <P> But the Pacers' turnovers contributed to 13 of the SuperSonics' points in the  fourth quarter. Dale Ellis played his first game of the season and had eight  points for Seattle. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

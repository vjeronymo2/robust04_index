			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Keeping the coolie in a crisis THE BIG Euro-event of the week came on Tuesday when the Financial Times got three top editors to put their point of view on 'whither Europe.' There was Rolf Schmidt-Holtz of Stern, Claude Imbert of the French business magazine le Point and Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun. Of the three Schmidt-Holtz was certainly the most balanced in his formulation of where Europe stood today. Germans always talk good sense in public. It was the British and French contributions that struck a nice counterpoint. On one side was a typical illogical xenophobia, on the other the clear exposition of national interest and attitudes from Mackenzie who asked key questions like 'can we trust the Belgians?' Imbert said he wanted to abandon what he called the absolutism of free trade. This was the 'doctrine established in our most glorious period of economic growth, when the coolies of Asia were restricted to pulling rickshaws; the coolies now sit at computer screens.' He also argued that the globalisation of commerce 'brutally concentrates the production of rich countries in the least labour intensive industries.' This destroys small and medium-sized business, 'submerged by countries which offer their work forces no social protection and pay them wages 20 or 30 times lower than our levels.' Thus imperialism masquerades as social concern. It weeps for sweatshop coolies in front of their computer screens who work till they drop dead because they have no pension, but adds that the poor should not be be rich because they are poor, and they must not be allowed to change that because if they do it will be at our expense. 'Social provision' is the Euro-mantra of today. Our unemployment benefits show what a caring society we have and mark us out from the poor. But jobs too are 'social provision' and the economy which has proved itself least able to create jobs is that of France. And we are supposed to believe that is the fault of countries like Malaysia. Malaysia is an archetypal low-wage poor country, 'doing Europeans out of jobs.' Unemployment is 0 per cent, well officially anyway. Life expectancy is 70 years, more than 75 per cent of adults are literate and infant mortality has been cut by 80 per cent since independence in 1963. These achievements have been gained not through 'social provision,' but the efforts of 'coolies behind the screens.' In the orthodox French view this is terribly wrong: Malaysia's growth has been based on doing somebody else out of a job. One can, therefore, only marvel at the way French exports to Malaysia have grown steadily over the past 10 years. On the other side of this trade account, Malaysia now controls more than 0.25 per cent of the French import market. It is against this threat that the trade barriers have to be raised. Imbert also said that the EC provided a common market that was large enough to guarantee competition and innovation at its heart. He concluded that the protective systems of the Common Agricultural Policy should be made available to other sectors. By mysterious means, I have come upon a fragment of a conversation between Senator Smoot and Congressman Hawley from 1929 which started with the former's observation, 'I think, my friend, that no clean cut all-American worker should be diddled and doodled out of his job by wine-swilling, boozed up Frogs, Krauts and Limeys and their sly furrin' ways.' 'You are quite right, Senator Smoot. We can produce every blamed thing we want right here in these United States.' So the Americans gave us the Smoot-Hawley tariff act and its descendants, fascism, global poverty and world war. The underlying assumption of Imbert's view is that crooked employers in poor countries are grabbing an unfair share of the world market. Yet the total value of French exports is greater than those of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean put together. The French have always been wrong on international trade policy and even made a mess of it when they thought they had played an ace in creating the CAP back in the 1950s. They thought the Treaty of Rome's advantages for German industry were balanced by guaranteed excess profits for French agriculture. But as Jim Rollo of the Royal Institute of International Affairs points out, the CAP saved German agriculture by imposing high prices which ensured its uncompetitive farms could survive. Low prices would have driven the Germans, and eventually the British, out of the farm business and given France what it deserved, the position of food supplier to the Community. But that would have implied a competitive marketplace which France could not accept even when it was in its interests. This week European ministers agreed on more barriers to immigration into Europe from poor countries. And there was another French demand for barriers to their exports. Thus we protect Europe's 'high level of social provision' whose greatest monument is the unemployment giro cheque. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

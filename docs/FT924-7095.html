			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Britain tells China it supports greater HK democracy BRITAIN told China yesterday that it strongly supported proposals by Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, for greater democracy in the territory and that they were fully consistent with previous agreements between London and Beijing. Mr John Major, the prime minister, assured Zhu Rongji, Chinese vice-premier, that Britain wished to co-operate with China to ensure a smooth transition from British to Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, in accordance with the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong's future. Their 45-minute meeting in London, described by Mr Major's office as 'brisk and businesslike', may have gone some way towards bridging the rift in Sino-British relations opened when Mr Patten announced his proposals last month. China says Mr Patten's plan is in breach of the joint declaration. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, discussed Hong Kong at length with Zhu during an hour-long meeting which the Foreign Office said was 'very amicable'. Mr Hurd told Zhu that Mr Patten's proposals represented no change in British policy on Hong Kong and that they were consistent with the joint declaration and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He invited counter-proposals and further discussions. Zhu aroused concern in Hong Kong with remarks in London on Monday which suggested that the dispute might affect economic relations between Britain and China. He asked rhetorically whether, following Mr Patten's proposals, the joint declaration should 'go with the wind'. Share prices in Hong Kong fell in response, with the Hang Seng index dropping 206.31 yesterday to 6,088.52 in heavy trading. Zhu is understood not to have repeated the implied threats in yesterday's meetings. Mr Patten, who is also in London for discussions with Mr Major and Mr Hurd, told journalists: 'I hope that we can enjoy a calm and rather cooler debate over the next few months. But it's very difficult if all that happens when you put forward proposals is that some people say 'no', albeit very loudly.' Mr Major also told Zhu of Britain's concern about human rights in China  - during his visit to Beijing last year, he gave Chinese leaders a list of names of people suspected to be political prisoners. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, is to follow this up by leading a six-member team to China for a week-long visit next month. Mr Major welcomed Beijing's decision to receive the delegation.

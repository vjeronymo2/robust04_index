			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign airlines raise stakes in DHL LUFTHANSA, the German airline, and Japan Airlines are increasing their stakes in DHL International, the world's largest air courier company, from 5 per cent to 25 per cent each at a time of rapid growth in the express delivery business. Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading house is lifting its holding from 2.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, giving the three companies a majority of 57.5 per cent in Hong Kong-based DHL International which will continue to be run independently. The remainder will be held by the original founding managers. The rise in the three companies' stakes came through the exercise of options taken out when the original investment was made in December, 1990. No price was given but a figure of about Dollars 500m (Pounds 274m) was put on the full deal, including the likely increase to a majority, when it was announced two years ago. Lufthansa said the decision to increase its stake reflected the buoyancy of the express packages and air cargo delivery market, the strength of DHL's own results, and its favourable experience with DHL as a partner. Mr Patrick Lupo, DHL's chairman, said group turnover this year would be around Dollars 2.5bn, an increase of more than 20 per cent on 1991. DHL's European revenues are forecast to reach Dollars 1bn this year, with growth of 25 per cent in the first quarter. After the US and the UK, Japan and Germany are DHL's two biggest markets. Mr Lupo said there was no intention to bring in other partners or for the present three to increase their stake further.</p>

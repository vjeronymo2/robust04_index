			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Tiphook chairman's bank got Pounds 3.5m fee Institutional shareholders are unhappy over a Pounds 3.5m payment which Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing company, made to a merchant bank boutique in which Tiphook's chairman, Mr Rupert Hambro, has an indirect shareholding. Mr Hambro, a non-executive director of Tiphook since 1990, took over as interim non-executive chairman of the group in March and will step down this month, although he will continue as non-executive director. His family company has a minority stake in JO Hambro Magan, which received its fee for advising on the recent Pounds 722m disposal of Tiphook's containers division, which saved the group from collapse. A leading institutional fund manager said that, as a matter of policy, he did not like to see non-executives involved in a financial advisory role. Tiphook said Mr Hambro had no executive role in Hambro Magan, which had fully earned its fee by introducing the group to the eventual buyer of the container division, Transamerica, the US financial services group. The whole transaction had been supervised by the group's non-executive directors, merchants bankers and lawyers. Mr Alton Irby, deputy chairman of Hambro Magan, said: 'We identified Transamerica, brought the deal to the table and negotiated one hell of a price. At least for now, we've saved the company. In one way, one wonders if we got enough.' Mr Hambro, who was paid Pounds 62,000 by Tiphook last year, has already been at the centre of controversy in his role as chairman of Tiphook's remuneration committee. There was an outcry last month when the group's annual report revealed that directors saw their total remuneration increase from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 6.41m in the year to April, a period for which Tiphook reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 331m. Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's chief executive, was the highest paid of the directors, with a bonus of Pounds 250,000 helping push his total pay from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.34m. Mr Montague, who recently stepped down as chairman, agreed to a substantial cut in pay from an Pounds 816,000 package down to Pounds 200,000 as of March, but will receive a total minimum bonus of Pounds 250,000 over the next five years. The bonus was to recompense Mr Montague for his agreement that he would not compete with Transamerica's container operations for five years.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: 'Paving the way for a return to confidence' The following is an edited text of the conclusions of the two-day European Council summit: THE European Council agreed on resolutions to a wide range of issues essential to progress in Europe. This paves the way for a return to confidence by its citizens in European construction which will contribute to the recovery of the European economy. In particular the European Council reached agreement on the following major issues: The problems raised by Denmark in the light of the outcome of the Danish referendum on June 2 1992 on the Maastricht treaty. Guidelines to implement the subsidiary principle and measures to increase transparency and openness in the decision-making process of the Community. The financing of the Community action and policies during the rest of this decade. Launching of enlargement negotiation with a number of Efta countries. The establishment of a plan of action by the member states and the Community to promote growth and to combat unemployment. Treaty on European union - state of ratification: The members of the European Council reaffirmed their commitment to the treaty. Ratification is necessary to make progress towards European union and for the Community to remain an anchor of stability in a rapidly changing continent, building on its success over the last four decades. The European Council agreed to the texts set out in these conclusions concerning the issues raised by Denmark in its memorandum 'Denmark in Europe'. This will create the basis for the Community to develop together, on the basis of the Maastricht treaty, while respecting, as the treaty does, the identity and diversity of member states. Subsidiarity: European union rests on the principle of subsidiarity. . . It aims at decisions being taken as closely as possible to the citizen. The European Council reaffirmed its commitment. . . to a more open Community. The European Council welcomed the measures the Community has recently decided to take in the field of transparency. These include producing the annual work programme in October, to allow for wider debate including in national parliaments. Accession of new member states: Official negotiations with Efta countries seeking membership of the union will be opened immediately after the treaty on European union is ratified and the agreement has been achieved in the Delors II package. Given the agreement reached on future financing and the prospects for early ratification of the treaty on European union by all member states, the European Council agreed that enlargement negotiations will start with Austria, Sweden and Finland at the beginning of 1993. The European Council invited the Council of Ministers to take decisions on the opening of negotiations on the same basis with Norway as soon as the Commission's opinion on its application is available. Negotiations will to the extent possible be conducted in parallel. Promoting economic recovery in Europe: The European Council discussed the prospects for growth and the rise in unemployment. On the internal market, the European Council noted with particular satisfaction. . . the programme will in all essential respects be successfully completed by December 31, 1992. This is a historic moment for the Community, marking the fulfilment of one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty of Rome. Free movement of persons: The European Council has had to take note of the fact that free movement within the Community. . . cannot be assured on January 1, 1993. The work necessary to achieve this result without creating dangers for public security and compromising the fight against illegal immigration, although having progressed, is still under way. However, noticeable changes benefiting travellers will occur during the course of next year. Migration: Deeply concerned by the intensification of episodes of intolerance, which it has strongly condemned, the European Council has underlined that there must be no room for racism and xenophobia in today's Europe, and has reiterated its determination to oppose such attitudes with renewed vigour. Size of the European parliament: The European Council agreed. . . the following number of members of the parliament, from 1994, to reflect German unification and in the perspective of enlargement: Belgium 25, Denmark 16, Germany 99, Greece 25, Spain 64, France 87, Ireland 15, Italy 87, Luxembourg 6, Netherlands 31, Portugal 25, United Kingdom 87. Total 567. Former Soviet Union: The European Council welcomes the start of negotiations with Russia on a partnership and co-operation agreement and looks forward to swift progress in negotiations with the other states.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Top Italian tips - Appetisers Three chefs from London's top Italian restaurants - Maddalena Bonino from 192, Francesco Zanchettta from Riva and Claudio Pecorari from Cibo  - will be your teachers if you decide to join one of seven cookery courses to be run later this year by 'Tasting Italy'. The courses will take place at La Chiara di Prumiano, a country hotel in Chianti. Mornings only will be spent in the kitchen. The one-week courses, limited to 20, begin on May 4, 11, 18 and 25 and October 12, 19 and 26 and cost Pounds 795 per person including scheduled flights, accommodation, tuition and meals. Contact Sara Schwartz, Tasting Italy, 5, Stockwell Avenue, London SW9 5SY. Tel: 071-627-0475. Sadly, more culinary casualties. Frith's in Soho's Frith Street has closed its doors and, in the next street along, La Bastide has also shut. Gloom, too, on the news-stands. Taste magazine, which had risen from the ashes of A la Carte, folds. With Taste's demise there can be little hope of a British magazine to rival America's Gourmet or Bon Appetit, France's Gault Millau or Cuisine et Vins de France. Even New Zealand, with a population of only 3m, boasts the successful Cuisine. Fortunately, there have been a number of restaurant openings; Les Saveurs at 37a Curzon Street, W1 (071-491-8919) offers a three-course lunch menu at Pounds 21 and a six-course dinner menu at Pounds 39.50. Cooking is French, strongly influenced by the Orient. And a French 'takeover' of a former jewel in the Indian gastronomic crown has quietly been completed at 34 Charlotte Street, W1 (071-636-1178) where Pied a Terre has replaced Jamdani. Set lunch Pounds 17.50, dinner Pounds 36. The Khun Akorn, a Thai restaurant in Old Brompton Road, SW3 has opened a sister restaurant at 121, Earl's Court Road, SW5 (071-373-3018). Above the Grouse and Claret pub in Little Chester Street, Belgravia, SW3 (071-245-1224) is another Thai restaurant, the Oriental Brasserie, which serves a lunchtime buffet (Pounds 14.95) and set price menus from Pounds 19.95. Above the Black Bull pub at 358 Fulham Road, SW10 (071-352-0625) Harvey's Cafe serves interesting and well-priced food. Restaurants that offer good value and are in the right location have been able to benefit from the property glut. Management at The Tall House at 134 Southwark Street, SE1 (071-401-2929) could not believe their luck when the company next door decided to relocate outside London. They have been able to expand sideways, increase the size of the kitchen, give their tables more space and develop their wine bar. London's most authentic Turkish restaurant, Istanbul Iskembecisi, has moved across the road from 4 to 9 Stoke Newington Road, N16, increasing its size three-fold (071-254-7291). Open all week, noon to 5am. The Square at 32 King Street, SW1 (071-839-8787) opened just as 1992 was being ushered in. Any restaurant which opens with such a broad, easy-to-read and keenly-priced wine list should be worthwhile. However, the cooking does not yet match the wine list in value. Although it may quickly improve, our meal was marked by a singular lack of generosity. The bill of Pounds 75 for two included a half bottle of excellent Sicilian white (Terre de Ginestra 1990 Pounds 5.50) and three glasses of champagne. But the main courses came without vegetables, salad or potatoes and there were no amuses-gueules or petits fours. Wine merchants' special deals abound. The bin ends of Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex, look more tempting than most and from January 27 even Oddbins, arguably the most successful chain, is discounting 300 wines including lopping Pounds 2.50 off five top champagnes and Pounds 5 off Chateau Pichon Lalande 1985 to bring it under Pounds 20 a bottle.</p>

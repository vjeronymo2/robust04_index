Dana Hills will be among the top candidates  for the wild-card spot in the Division III playoffs, with Brea-Olinda in the  same position in Division VI, when first-round Southern Section pairings are  made Sunday.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> County rushing leader Dana Riddle of Rancho Alamitos gained 144 yards in 34  carries to end the regular season with 2,082 yards, the fourth-best  single-season total in county history behind Servite's Derek Brown (2,301 in  1988), Edison's Kerwin Bell (2,226 in 1979) and Valencia's Ray Pallares (2,085  in 1985).  </P> <P> ODDS AND ENDS  </P> <P> Tough Ticket: As expected, Capistrano Valley's quaint stadium was packed for  the showdown between No. 1-ranked El Toro and No. 2-ranked Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Fans began filling the stadium at 5 p.m. and the 3,500 bleacher seats were  taken by 6 p.m. It was a hot ticket; just ask Mission Viejo mayor William  Craycraft.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, Craycraft telephoned Capistrano Valley principal Tom Anthony  and asked if Anthony could reserve a couple of seats and a parking space at the  school for his family. Anthony politely declined.  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Gardening: Green and pleasant gifts - Robin Lane Fox solves present problems for the whole family with a trip to the nearest garden centre If in doubt, give a gardener a gadget. If in funds, give yourself four of the five new types of Christmas tree which have pushed prices up to Pounds 5 a foot. If you are canny, however, you will know already that conventional Christmas trees sell for Pounds 1.50 a foot deep in the country and that the prices usually drop before the needles on Christmas Eve. Personally, I would prefer to be given a plant. As presents, plants seem to be socially unacceptable unless they are overheated house-plants which will die by the end of January. Like dogs, hardy plants are not just for Christmas. Unlike dogs, they improve the garden and can be left inside until the weather improves. Thanks to the better garden centres, plants look tempting in their close season. Like good supermarkets, they show plants which look fresh and worm-free and tempt customers who never go near open country. As a result, you can now give them as presents without leaving earth on the carpet or being unacceptably rustic. This year, amazingly, you can even give hardy plants in flower. I have had a fascinating time hunting through the centres and their main suppliers, looking for hardy flowerers which are six months out of season. Here are my top six, aimed at solving common family present problems and priced from big suburban centres. For Nigels and Tanias, who garden in shade in London and spend the summers south of Florence, this year's answer is a camellia. Plants of the hardy varieties are already flowering and I would opt for the double white 'Swan Lake' which looks heavenly in a two-litre pot, even at Pounds 14.95. For aunts and uncles on light soils in south-east England, I would capitalise on the mild weather and choose the craziest sight of the year: medium-sized plants of Ceanothus 'Gloire de Versailles', which have been standing outdoors and flowering freely, four months after their season, at a price of only Pounds 8.95. Remind the Bernards and Catherines that these plants are hardy in most winters, but not all, and that they might be better in a well-lit shed until spring. They look lovely as a foil to old-fashioned roses if you prune them gently in April to keep them at a height of about 5ft. For Gill and Max, who have just settled in their home for life, choose a long-term winter shrub and look no further than the witch hazels which prefer neutral or acid soil and will improve with age. They, too, have been flowering frantically to attract givers and, for Pounds 19.95, you can lose your head with a full-flowering Hamamelis 'Pallida', whose pale yellow flowers are the prettiest of the usual varieties. Evergreens are their natural companions and need less of an explanation when non-gardeners unwrap them - anyone can appreciate a good leaf. Some of the bigger centres are stocking the cream-variegated form of Rhamnus, a great favourite of mine against a south or west wall. For Valerie and David, who open their gardens to the public, the best buys on the circuit are fresh plants of the evergreen Osmanthus heterophyllus 'Variegatus', at Pounds 8.95. Garden centres can still surprise us all among the usual range of mallows and buddleias: I have grown a plant of this osmanthus with its mildly prickly evergreen leaves for the past 20 years. It has moved homes with me, but it is still only 3ft high and wide. It is very chic and striking and it has just flowered suddenly for the first time in the mild November. While planting out the forget-me-nots, I became aware of an exquisite scent which traced back to the lines of tiny white flowers hanging from its branches. It is the thinking person's alternative to yet more squares of clipped green box. I could never resist a viburnum, especially if I could not remember whether Aunt Judith's soil in Wiltshire was acid or not. The winter varieties are predictably good this week, but you can also find flowers on the spring-flowering carlesii this week or on the bigger and stronger 'Park Farm Hybrid'. When there are still flowers all over the place I have less time for those centres which are trying to sell callicarpas with violet-mauve fruits by calling them 'Beauty Berries' and pricing them at Pounds 24.95 each. The small print tells you that you need a group of three in order to be sure of a proper crop. Instead, I would go for a yellow-berried cotoneaster which is excellent up any great-uncle Edward's drainpipe, even in semi-shade. 'Expery' or 'Rothschild' are the best varieties. You can still find plants with yellow berries untouched at 'only' Pounds 8.95. What about those difficult people, young couples who have nothing but principles and mean, for the moment, to stay together for years, or open-handed people who have so much more money than you and may well try to humiliate you by dishing out a crate of champagne? Outflank the young Simons and Kirstys by giving them the nucleus of their fruitcage for the future. This year, the blackcurrant bushes are looking eminently unwrappable because they are thick with buds, though still without leaves. 'Baldwin' is a sound, later-cropping variety which will be at its best when the superstores have moved on through the calendar and are trying to sell you loganberries instead. The champagne Charlies need more generous treatment. Do not be stampeded into buying the neatly-clipped standard of evergreen privet or bay at Pounds 70 because it looks fancy: you could grow one yourself for very much less and they look better in pairs, increasing the bill. Instead, go for unarguable quality which even the idlest garden-watcher will know how to pronounce. This week, there are super magnolias, looking large, clean and advanced in bud. Big bushes of Magnolia alba superba range from Pounds 14.95 to Pounds 49 for extravagant specimens, 4ft high and wide. The rustica rubra form of this variety can be found at even greater sizes, up to Pounds 70. My personal choice would have to be Magnolia loebneri 'Leonard Messel', root-wrapped in hessian and about 4ft high at a cool Pounds 69, complete with dozens of visible buds. These large magnolias will transplant easily into gardens so long as you water them over a dry spring and early summer. After five years, smaller sensible transplants will probably have overtaken them, but Christmas is not a time for being sensible. If you are wondering how to measure up to a millionaire's fire-power, enlist a magnolia's flower-power and be fairly sure that she will not know what it really costs.</p>

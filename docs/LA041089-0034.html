			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK COUNCIL INCUMBENTS' LUCK MAY RUN OUT IN TUESDAY'S RUNOFF  </P> <P> At least one of two Burbank City Council members running for reelection may  lose his seat Tuesday in runoffs during the city's general election, political  insiders say.  </P> <P> Mayor Al F. Dossin and Councilman Michael R. Hastings, who are both seeking  second four-year terms, are facing two political novices -- attorney Tim Murphy  and Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. George Bonney.  </P> <P> Although City Hall observers expect Dossin and Hastings to do well, their  opponents also stand a chance of knocking either or both incumbents out of  office, according to political insiders.  </P> <P> Murphy and Hastings appear to be the front-runners.  </P> <P> By appearing at fund-raisers and neighborhood meetings, Murphy seems to have  maintained the momentum he established in last February's primary election.  </P> <P> "I think he has an excellent chance," said Lew Stone, president of the Burbank  Firefighters Assn., one of the city employee unions backing Murphy. "Tim has  name recognition throughout the city, and a number of people I've talked to  said he's one guy that should be on the council."  </P> <P> Murphy finished third behind Hastings and ahead of Dossin in the city's Feb. 28  election, when candidates were running for three seats on the council.  </P> <P> Businessman Tom Flavin received more than 50% of the vote and won one of the  seats. Councilwoman Mary Kelsey lost her seat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Dark Horse  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who has called Bonney the dark horse of the race,  said she feels the fire captain might have a chance. "He's a long shot, but  he's working really hard," she said. "People sense his sincerity, and he's not  on an ego trip."  </P> <P> In the city's only other race, City Treasurer Jack Whitney is defending his  seat against Jim Rogers, a retired bank executive. Whitney, 79, has been  treasurer for nine years.  </P> <P> Dossin is leading the four council candidates in campaign contributions,  according to documents filed with the Burbank city clerk's office.  </P> <P> Dossin has $13,541 in contributions; Murphy, $12,730, and Hastings, $8,067.  Bonney has not accepted any contributions.  </P> <P> Dossin and Murphy are endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers Local 15, the Burbank Firefighters Local 778, the Burbank City  Employees Assn. and other local unions.  </P> <P> Dossin and Hastings are endorsed by the Burbank Board of Realtors and the  Burbank Police Officers Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth a Common Issue  </P> <P> The candidates seem to agree on the city's most prominent issue -- slowing down  rampant development. They all supported a recently passed planned-growth  initiative to slow the building of apartment complexes in the city.  </P> <P> Both Murphy and Bonney said the present council is not acting fast enough to  stop development, and is being unresponsive to citizens who want to protect  their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "I'm just tired of seeing Burbank deteriorate," Bonney said.  </P> <P> All the candidates except Dossin said they have refused campaign contributions  from developers.  </P> <P> But Hastings' campaign has received a boost from the Southern California  Caucus, a political action committee of developers and other business people,  spending $16,902 on his behalf. Despite the support, Hastings has insisted that  he is not controlled by developers.  </P> <P> Hastings expressed shock Friday at a mailer sent by the caucus. The mailer said  "out-of-town" unions would be circulating in neighborhoods Saturday, "pimping  for their hand-picked candidates. Their objective is simple -- total control of  the City Council."  </P> <P> Hastings said he had nothing to do with the mailer. When asked if he was  disassociating himself from the caucus, he said, "If this is the kind of  material they put on, then, yes, I am."  </P> <P> Of all the candidates, Hastings, 35, an advertising executive, has taken the  most bashing since the primary election. Foes at council meetings have  criticized him repeatedly for the developers' support. They also say he was  responsible for pressuring a city department head to fire an employee two years  ago, an accusation that Hastings denies.  </P> <P> Many residents who live in the hillside areas of Burbank also have blasted  Hastings, saying he flip-flopped on bringing popular acts to the Starlight  Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Hastings was one of the council members who approved an agreement with World  Entertainment Services to bring major entertainers to the city-owned Starlight  Amphitheatre. But when numerous residents complained about the crowds and noise  that would result from large shows, he withdrew his support of the agreement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Dictator'  </P> <P> "I'm a representative of the people, not a dictator, and I only did what the  people wanted," Hastings said.  </P> <P> "There's no question that people are out to get me, but that's what happens  when a person is pro-active," he said of his reelection bid. "I've done a lot  of things, and I'm going to offend some people. But I think voters can see  through the lies."  </P> <P> Hastings has been one of the council's strongest proponents of slow growth. He  has angered some of his colleagues with his unusual approaches: He wrote an  ordinance that banned toy guns in Burbank; was the force behind commissioning a  controversial war memorial, and established a yearly benefit for the homeless.  </P> <P> If elected, Hastings said, he would work to complete the tentative deal between  developer Alexander Haagen and the city to bring a major shopping mall to  downtown Burbank. He said he also wants to work on a master plan for 225 acres  owned by Burbank-based Lockheed Corp. that the city wants to develop. Lockheed  is selling the property as part of a move out of the city.  </P> <P> Murphy, 35, a deputy public defender, has said there has been too much  development under the present council and that he would work to control growth.  He cited a number of large developments -- including a controversial 129-home  tract on hillside land -- that were approved. Many of the projects were in or  around residential areas dominated by single-family homes, and density  restrictions for some properties were loosened to accommodate the developments.  </P> <P> Murphy said he is unhappy with the way council meetings are conducted. He said  the televised meetings too often have degenerated into a forum for people to  voice personal business or to blast city officials, and that the council has  not controlled the proceedings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Using Television'  </P> <P> "People are using television to beat people up," he said. "The council has not  brought a professional tone to the meetings. That kind of stuff does not belong  here."  </P> <P> Murphy is head of the Neighborhood Awareness Committee, which four years ago  staged a failed bid to establish districts within Burbank that would be  represented by individual council members. Murphy said he wanted to improve  relations between neighborhoods and the council.  </P> <P> Dossin, 59, an insurance salesman, said he was happy with his role in getting  Haagen to deal with the city for the shopping center. He also said he helped to  keep industry out of the Rancho equestrian area, which is characterized by  homes where people keep horses.  </P> <P> Dossin said he also wants to control growth and traffic around Burbank.  </P> <P> "It's also important that we get busy on planning for that Lockheed property,"  Dossin said, adding that the city might be able to put another shopping center  on the land.  </P> <P> George Bonney, 55, is a resident of the equestrian area, and residents of that  area have been walking door-to-door throughout Burbank asking voters to support  him. Bonney said he would work to mitigate the negative effects of increasing  development in commercial and residential neighborhood.  </P> <P> He said he was also concerned about the commercialization of the Starlight  Amphitheatre. "I'm an environmentalist, and we should not have anything that's  going to rob the hillsides of their beauty," he said.  </P></p>

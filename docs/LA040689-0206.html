			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COWBOYS' COACH GETS 10-YEAR PACT  </P> <P> Jerry Jones, the new majority owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has given Coach  Jimmy Johnson a 10-year contract, the NFL club announced today. Jones made the  announcement to potential advertisers for Dallas' KRLD Radio, the Cowboys  flagship radio station.  </P> <P> The 10-year contract is not without precedent. The late Clint Murchison, the  original owner of the Cowboys, gave Tom Landry such a contract in the mid-1960s  when Landry was suffering the losing woes of an expansion team.  </P> <P> The Cowboys announced Johnson's contract from their Valley Ranch headquarters.  When Jones bought the team in late February, he would not release details of  the contract of his former Arkansas football teammate.  </P></p>

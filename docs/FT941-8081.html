			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Renewed selling of the Footsie futures contract in the closing minutes of the session cut short attempts at a rally, indicating another sell-off today, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened sharply down at 3,358 but well above the worst fears. The continued depression in global bond markets, along with continued fears on US inflation, brought further selling of the contract and it fell through its recent support level of 3,342. Although March stabilised at the lower levels over the lunchtime period, it traded at a discount to cash throughout the session, pulling the underlying cash market lower. An attempted rally in the last hour petered out after another retreat in UK gilts and German bonds brought a further sell-off. March closed at 3,332, a 17-point discount to cash and around 10 points below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 7. Volume at the official close stood at 14,736 lots. In traded options, most of the activity was carried out in the index option. Of the day's total of 35,745, some 14,525 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,312 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Steel was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,313 contracts. In the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the OMLX, a mere 105 lots were transacted.</p>

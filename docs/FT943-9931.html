			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: Rising commodity prices, and their effect on producers' costs, were mentioned as one of the new inflationary risks by the Bank of England in its quarterly report, published last week. So particular attention will be paid to today's producer prices figures. The consensus is for the annual rate of output price inflation to remain at 2 per cent in July, while input price inflation slips back to 1.3 per cent, from June's 1.4 per cent. Tuesday: The delay in compiling European Union trade data these days means that the world trade data for the UK released today, relate only to May. June figures for trade with non-EU countries have already been released. Analysts are expecting May's whole world deficit to widen to Pounds 1bn, from Pounds 803m in April. Wednesday: The markets will see the minutes of chancellor Kenneth Clarke's meeting with Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, on July 6. Since it has been clearly signalled that the duo did not agree on a base rate rise either then, or at the more recent July 28 meeting, the main interest will be to see whether Mr Clarke is showing any concern about inflation.</p>

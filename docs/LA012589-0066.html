			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN WOULD TAX CUSTOMERS;  </P> <P> TREASURY PROPOSAL TARGETS DEPOSITS AT FEDERALLY INSURED INSTITUTIONS  </P> <P> White House is considering forcing customers of banks and savings and loans to  pay a large part of the multibillion-dollar cost of rescuing the S&amp;L  industry, where hundreds of institutions are failing because of widespread  fraud and mismanagement.  </P> <P> Even as President Bush was promising last week not to raise taxes, Treasury  Department officials were trying to win support from Congress for a proposal to  tax depositors who put money in federally insured institutions, congressional  sources said yesterday.  </P> <P> Treasury officials met secretly with leaders of the House Banking Committee  last week and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met with Senate Republican  leaders again Tuesday and discussed the proposal, which would impose a tax of  as much as 30 cents for every $100 deposited at a federally insured  institution, the sources said.  </P> <P> "It's the reverse toaster theory," said Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Chairman L. William Seidman, when asked what he thought of such a proposal.  "Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit, you give  them one."  </P> <P> The proposal -- one of several options the White House is considering to raise  the $50 billion to $100 billion that it is expected to cost to clean up the  S&amp;L industry -- received a very chilly reception in Congress, getting what  one White House official called "the Bronx cheer."  </P> <P> Brady is expected to give Bush a list of options as early as next week to pay  for the S&amp;L cleanup. The options will range from issuing bonds backed by  the S&amp;L industry, to taxes on deposits or other consumer services offered  by banks and S&amp;Ls, to a direct hit on the U.S. Treasury, sources said.  </P> <P> Congressional sources said they did not know if the negative reaction on  Capital Hill has caused Brady to remove a tax on customer deposits from the  list of options. But they said one option that Brady still is considering is  some other sort of "user tax," possibly a special fee that customers of a bank  or S&amp;L would pay on services other than deposits, such as a home loan.  </P> <P> Under the proposal presented to lawmakers in recent days, Treasury officials  envisioned charging what amounts to about one-third of a penny for every dollar  of the $3 trillion deposited in checking, savings and other accounts at  federally insured banks and S&amp;Ls nationwide. The tax would raise an  estimated $9 billion a year, enough to cover the government's annual interest  payments on the $20 billion to $30 billion it will have to raise annually for  several years to close hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors.  </P> <P> The proposed tax would apply to deposits at S&amp;Ls and at commercial banks,  sources said, so there would be no shift from one federally insured type of  institution to another. But congressional leaders said such a tax would make  banks and S&amp;Ls less competitive with money-market funds and other savings  accounts that are not federally insured.  </P> <P> And, the leaders said, such a tax would be a nightmare to administer. Treasury  officials have not worked out how the fee would be collected, they said.  </P> <P> But no matter what method is used, congressional sources said, customers would  end up paying the fee under the Treasury proposal to tax deposits.  </P> <P> Lawmakers in the House promptly objected to the proposal, and senior  Administration sources said Brady received a similarly cool response from  senators.  </P> <P> Although Bush will be given the Treasury's list of options soon, the  Administration is not expected to unveil the proposals to the public until late  February during hearings before the Senate Banking Committee, aides on the  committee said.  </P> <P> Officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations have said they want to exhaust  every source of private funding to pay for the S&amp;L bailout before using  federal money.  </P> <P> A senior Administration source stressed Tuesday that Administration officials  have reached no conclusions and have expressed no preference for one option  over another of the many they will present to Bush.  </P> <P> They would not discuss whether any increase in the premium would be charged  directly to depositors or added to operating expenses. Bush repeatedly had said  he will not raise taxes, using the phrase "Read my lips" as a rallying cry  during his campaign and after his election. In interviews last week, he  repeated his pledge not to raise taxes, and his newly appointed budget  director, Richard Darman, reaffirmed that policy in confirmation hearings  before the Senate last week.  </P> <P> Darman made it clear that any charge that looked like a tax would be considered  a tax by the new Administration, regardless of whether the charge was called a  user fee or any other name.  </P></p>

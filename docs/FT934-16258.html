			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television I have greatly enjoyed Plain Tales from Northern Ireland(BBC 2, 8.00), the series about rural life in Northern Ireland by writer and producer Carlo Gebler. Each film has been admirably understated, unhackneyed, and illuminating. Tonight is the last film, about a border village where it is the start of the duck-shooting season at the local gun-club. Catholics and Protestants take an innocent pleasure in a day's shooting. Last year there was a ghastly incident when a grizzly bear ate a camper so it is good to see them getting a better press on Living Dangerously: Grizzly] The Bear Facts (BBC 1, 8.30). The camera films them catching salmon underwater. I hold the minority view that dogs are not honorary humans and ought to live in kennels. The Dog's Tale (BBC 2, 9.30) is better tonight. Surprisingly, the Dalai Lama appears, talking about reincarnation and his dog, and in the parish of San Rocco in Italy, they honour the dog who befriended the plague saint. However, hagiologists know that French Catholics did once venerate a dog-saint, St Guinefort.</p>

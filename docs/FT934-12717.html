			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Benefit fraud costs Pounds 5bn a year, say officials MORE THAN Pounds 5bn a year of government money may be lost through fraudulent benefit claims, according to Whitehall officials investigating abuse of the social security system. Officials say the investigation, launched earlier this year, has uncovered far greater abuse of state welfare than had been thought, with many examples of improper claims for old age pensions, unemployment assistance and child benefit. Until recently, ministers had estimated that the state lost some Pounds 1bn a year in fraudulent claims. But officials say the investigation  -by four Department of Social Security officials under the aegis of the Whitehall efficiency unit, set up to uncover wasteful government expenditure  -has produced evidence of fraud on a much greater scale. 'The study shows that the amount of benefit fraud is much higher than expected,' said one official yesterday. 'It would not be wrong to say that the figure is in excess of Pounds 5bn per year.' That compares with an total annual bill for welfare benefit of around Pounds 80bn. The scale of benefit fraud is being cited by ministers as the principal reason for considering the introduction of an identity card system for benefit claimants. If implemented, this would be the first time the state has required British citizens to carry any form of formal identification other than a passport. Civil liberties groups have strongly opposed such a move as an infringement of individual rights. But DSS officials did not rule out the possibility yesterday that the ID card system could be introduced for all 21m benefit claimants. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday that the introduction of an identity card system would depend on the final presentation of the efficiency unit's report, due in a month. But Downing Street officials say the introduction of an identity card system is backed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has closely monitored the investigation. Officials said that, to overcome civil liberties concerns, the information stored on an identity card would be 'of no use to the police'. The favoured identification method would involve social security and pension claimants having some form of 'hand scan', he said. The hand image would then be stored electronically on a card. This would allow the cardholder's identity to be ascertained with an error factor of one in 100,000 - enough to prevent an individual drawing money with a stolen card, but a certainty factor too low to be used in a court of law.</p>

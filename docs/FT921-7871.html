			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul holds its breath ahead of reforms - Turkish government proposals for the equity market Turkey's stock exchange, like a nervous debutante waiting to be asked to dance, is holding its breath as the government puts the finishing touches to the reform package which helped take Istanbul's 75-share index to a 1992 peak of 5,128.91 a month ago. There has been some profit-taking recently by investors who feel that the market may have already discounted the impact of the reforms. It has come a long way from a low of just over 2,500 last October. Yesterday the index closed 7.74 down at 4,174.22, compared with over 5,400 in February 1991, and its all-time high of 5,749 on August 2, 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. Trading in 135 stocks, Istanbul's equity market is still considered undervalued on a price/earnings ratio of 12, compared with around 24 for the US. It is hoped that the reforms will bridge some of the gap. One proposal is to allow insurance companies and pension funds to invest in the stock market - providing some badly needed liquidity. Other measures seek to give increased investor protection by tightening up on insider trading, and regulating the actions of fund managers. At present, trades are frequently not booked in the client's name, which enables the bank or the broker to use their clients' portfolios for their own trading purposes; for example, selling the market short. Officials say that this will now be regulated. Settlement is a major headache, particularly for foreign investors. There is a proposal to introduce a two-week account period. Currently, deals have to be settled within 48 hours. Companies are also required under capital market rules to distribute a fixed percentage of their profits as dividends. In the past, say brokers, this resulted in a deluge of rights issues, with the inevitable dilution. As a result, the stock market's earnings per share, measured in real terms, have actually fallen over the past three years. There is also an increasing expectation that Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, will go further in pushing for wide-ranging legislation to regulate the market and at the same time attract new investment. The government has already announced a change in the withholding tax on treasury bills which will encourage investors to move funds to the stock market. And, from February, banks will have to separate their capital markets departments from general banking activities, putting them on an even footing with the brokers. Banks hitherto have used their foreign exchange and interbank lending departments in support of their broking activities, giving them a clear advantage over brokerage houses. Market leaders in Turkey include Arcelik, the consumer electronics subsidiary of Koc Holding, Turkey's largest trading conglomerate. Construction companies with interests in the former Soviet Union are also attracting attention as Turkish businessmen eye up opportunities in the new republics. Of the key indust-rial sectors, cement remains attractive. Brokers say that there is still plenty of money in the market, pointing out that daily trading volume has increased by more than three times since the general election last October. However, there remain serious liquidity constraints. One analyst estimates that, of the total market capitalisation of TL83,460bn (Dollars 14.5bn), perhaps as little as TL18,000bn is available to investors. A broker's analyst said: 'The market basically seizes up if the volume goes above Dollars 100m.' Computerisation, due to be introduced in 1993, may help to ease this problem, but fundamental, structural issues need to be addressed. Investors are more concerned at the lack of clarity in the regulatory stance of the Capital Markets Board, the government authority which oversees the market. They also want the government to tackle the problem of persistently high inflation which, at 70 per cent, is eroding corporate earnings.</p>

Thus, the committee called on the  government to change its diplomatic stance toward the United  States.    In this weekly situation analysis report, the situation  analysis committee maintained that "public opinion is critical  of the fact that ruling and opposition circles in the United  States took on an interfering manner in our domestic affairs in  calling for the abolition of the security law at the same time  as North Korea's claim urging abolition of the South Korean  National Security Law, thus leading one to believe that the  United States was assuming a North Korea-leaning diplomatic  attitude."    The situation analysis committee also said that "by fully  mobilizing former government officials, businessmen, and  religious figures, the United States has diversified its  diplomatic channels to highlight its position. Contrary to  this, our country merely depends on official diplomatic  channels." Thus, the committee proposes that we reexamine our  methods of diplomatic activities with the United States.</p>

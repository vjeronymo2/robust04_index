			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Observance of International Conventions Should </F> Be Mutual"]    [Text] The British government has accused the Islamic  Republic of establishing contact with and of helping the Irish  Republican Army. The Iranian Charge d'Affaires in London,  Gholamreza Ansari was called to the Foreign Office and handed a  protest note by British officials. The Islamic Republic has  denied the British allegation.    Regardless of London's objection and Iran's denial, and  considering the fact that influential Irish-Americans are the  main suppliers of arms and money to the IRA, the question which  begs for an answer is whether or not Britain or any other  Western country has the right to question Iran's actions  regarding adherence to internationally accepted conventions?    From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have  repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which  regulate relations between individual countries. The 1961 and  1963 Vienna Conventions requiring the observance of mutual  diplomatic rules among nations and emphasizing the reciprocity  of action regarding Consular staff and activities, have been  openly ignored by the West through their overt and covert  support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in their countries.    Western powers, Britain among them, can not plead ignorance  when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups  they harbor in the West, because all they have to do is to  instruct their embassies in Tehran to monitor anti-Iranian  radios who teach their elements inside the Islamic Republic how  to manufacture home-made bombs and slaughter innocent Iranian  citizens.    The government of the Islamic Republic has been under  increasing domestic public opinion pressure which questions the  wisdom of Iran's policy of not allowing Bader-Meinhof, Direct  Action, or the IRA to have offices in Tehran, while anti-Iranian  terrorist groups enjoy almost full diplomatic rights in Bonn,  Paris, and London. The Iranian public is consistently  questioning the government why it adheres to international  conventions regarding aiding and abetting terrorists when  Western countries so openly and flagrantly ignore the same  conventions.    The damage, both in human and monetary terms, caused by  anti-Iranian terrorist groups harbored, financed, and armed by  Western countries, are huge compared to those caused by the  three above-mentioned Western terrorist organizations. This  latest baseless British protest over the Iran-IRA contact is but  a smoke-screen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian  terrorists are providing materiel and personnel to the  Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic  Republic. The British protests are also meant to cover up the  fact that Western intelligence sources are encouraging these  same anti-Iranian terrorists.</p>

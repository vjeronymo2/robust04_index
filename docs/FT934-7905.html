			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Income up at Stock Exchange SHARPLY higher turnover on the London Stock Exchange in the six months to June 30 led to a 4 per cent rise in income to Pounds 98.1m from Pounds 94.5m the year before. After costs, which include a Pounds 10.3m charge related to development of the system designed to replace the SEAQ price display system, the exchange's operating surplus was Pounds 8.6m, compared with a Pounds 1.5m loss the year before. The 1992 results included a Pounds 13.5m charge relating to the development of the now-abandoned Taurus settlements system. New equity issues raised Pounds 8.6bn in the period, more than double the level of the first six months of 1992. Turnover in UK equities rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 268bn. The exchange said that it expected its costs in the second half of the year to match its income closely. The exchange noted that its tax charge of Pounds 7m was disproportionately high in relation to the pre-tax surplus. 'This arises because a significant proportion of our expenditure is not allowed against current income for tax purposes,' the exchange said.</p>

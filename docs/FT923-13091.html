			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Government abandons full-scale BR sell-off - Emphasis will be on improving rail services / Franchise authority will award contracts to private sector THE white paper on the future of British Rail starts by acknowledging that the corporation cannot be sold off to the private sector like other public utilities, whether in one great lump or in parts. Its losses are simply too big. So there will be no stock market flotation or trade sale of BR. Instead the corporation will go on running the railways indefinitely, but attempts will be made to improve the quality of services by creating more opportunities for the private sector to operate trains. The first step will be to split BR into two. One part, to be named Railtrack, will own the track, signalling and other infrastructure, and charge for its use. The other part - presumably still called BR - will run the trains. The government will then try to get the private sector interested in taking over train operations. The freight operations will be sold outright, but on the passenger side the government hopes to contract-out train services through franchises. A franchise authority will be created to carry out the franchising on the government's behalf. The government will decide what grants will be available for subsidising loss-making services, and will set broad objectives for service levels, quality and fares. The authority will then hold open competitions among private companies to see which offers the best terms for taking the contracts. Beyond these broad principles, however, the government seems to have little idea about how the franchises will work in practice. The white paper does not spell out what franchises will be available, when they will be offered or how long they will last. Everything, apparently, is negotiable: it all depends on what the private sector is interested in doing. The white paper is also hazy about how private companies are to obtain their trains and drivers. Ideally, it suggests, it would like them to buy or lease trains, but it recognises that such an obligation could be a barrier to entry. So it concedes that most franchisees will want to use BR's existing trains, and these will be available to rent. InterCity services get a special mention in the white paper. The government believes that some of these are close enough to profitability to be sold. But it also recognises that this will not happen in the lifetime of the present parliament. In the meantime, therefore, these will be franchised on a so-called 'line-of-route' basis, such as the East Coast Main Line from London King's Cross to Edinburgh or the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to Sheffield. The passenger-services section of the white paper observes that BR staff are likely to be keen to bid for franchises as well as the private sector. The government is not only prepared to accept such bids, but intends to encourage them by offering help with legal and financial advice. Also worth noting is that Railtrack will receive no subsidies. It will have to make a living - and pay for infrastructure investment - out of charges to train operators. The level of charges is a severe bone of contention with would-be train operators, but the white paper ducks it. Instead it is to be the subject of a separate report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, later this year. On the freight side, the government's targets are more ambitious. It sets a goal of getting all the freight and parcels businesses privatised in the course of the present parliament, but again it is thin on detail. It suggests that the freight businesses would be more likely to find buyers if they were split up into their constituent parts. For example, users of the coal, metals, construction materials and petroleum trainload services might be interested in buying and running these business. Distribution companies might be interested in other parts of the business, as might BR's own staff. The white paper does not address the contentious issue of what will happen to BR's loss-making freight services. If all rail freight is to be privatised within the present parliament, the implication is that the unwanted services will close - hardly an environmental plus for privatisation. In addition to the franchising of BR's existing services and the sale of the freight operations, the government hopes to get new services on to BR's tracks by opening access to any would-be operators who can meet required standards. But as the white paper acknowledges, the lack of spare capacity on BR's busier tracks will limit the scope for this, as will arguments about how much different types of passenger and freight services should be charged for using the infrastructure. Some of these rows will be sorted out by an official regulator, a body to be set up independently of the franchise authority. The regulator's job will be to ensure fair play between operators over rights of access. The white paper also says the private sector could run stations. Some might be rented to franchisees, and others sold or leased. Safety issues, like so much in the white paper, are to be the subject of further study, though it is stressed that these are of paramount importance. Closure procedures will remain unchanged, and there is a commitment to maintaining a single timetable and compatible ticketing. And there is one item calculated to endear the white paper to BR's staff: 'Concessionary travel arrangements for employees, and their dependants, and for retired staff will also be safeguarded.'

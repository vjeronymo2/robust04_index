			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Mystic Pizza (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), one of the few genuine hits to emerge last  year from independent American film making, takes a fairly old idea -- three  bachelor girls on the loose -- and gives it a patina of freshness by using New  England coastal city backdrops and casting a delightful archetypal trio: Julia  Roberts (the reckless beauty), Lili Taylor (the vivacious kook) and Annabeth  Gish (sensitive and brainy). "Mystic Pizza" refers to the seaside pizzeria  where they all work; the director, Daniel Petrie Jr., piles on the toppings and  makes it tasty.  </P> <P> Also on Sunday, The Hot Rock (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) is a caper movie with a  bungling gang led by Robert Redford and George Segal on an inept diamond heist.  Based on a Donald Westlake novel, adapted by William Goldman and directed by  Peter Yates, it suggests that someone was thinking of the 1958 Italian caper  classic, "Big Deal on Madonna Street" -- though they weren't thinking hard  enough.  </P> <P> Invitation to Hell (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is another variation on Faust.  Made for TV, it was directed by Wes Craven in 1984: the same year he made  horror history with the first "Nightmare on Elm Street."  </P> <P> Michael Cimino's Year of the Dragon (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a  controversial revenge thriller about an obsessive cop (Mickey Rourke) battling  a suave Chinatown drug king (John Lone) through streets running with blood, sex  and exoticism. Like all of Cimino's work, it's excessive, somewhat delirious  and visually overwhelming -- and, since Oliver Stone co-wrote the script, the  dialogue bristles with profanity and wild verbal energy.  </P> <P> Joseph Ruben's The Stepfather (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., repeated Saturday  at 8 p.m.), also written by Donald Westlake, has a simple premise: a teen-age  daughter suspects her bland stepfather of secretly being a maniac -- and she's  right (as we know from the first scene). What makes "Stepfather" special is  Westlake's clever construction, Ruben's camera pyrotechnics and a mesmerizing  performance by Terry O'Quinn as the mild-mannered maniac: a psychotic who wants  to create a Norman Rockwell world and can't understand why people keep messing  it up.  </P> <P> In Woody Allen's recent stretch of superb comedies, the 1988 Radio Days  (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is sometimes slighted. Yet it's as great as  anything he's done recently: a reminiscence of his Brooklyn boyhood, told  through the double-frame of his family's charming foibles and the radio shows  they all loved (symbol of distant, glamorous Manhattan). It's as  autobiographical as "Annie Hall," as sweet and fantastic as "The Purple Rose of  Cairo."  </P> <P> On Thursday, there's good news and bad news for John Wayne fans. The good news  is that Sands of Iwo Jima, the 1949 Allan Dwan movie which ranks as one of the  Duke's paradigmatic war epics, is playing (Channel 11 at 8 p.m.). The bad news  is that it's apparently been colorized. Wait till next time, pilgrims.  Meanwhile, The Seduction (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) has Morgan Fairchild as a TV  newswoman terrorized by a crazed fan: a movie that probably should be  de-colorized, and maybe even de-filmed. The pick of the evening is probably  Frank Perry's macabre piece of Hollywood camp, Mommie Dearest (Channel 13 at 8  p.m.), with Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford -- in a story based on Christina  Crawford's memoirs -- delivering the kind of no-brakes performance that can  knock you out and haunt your dreams.  </P> <P> Arthur Penn's Dead of Winter (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) seems better in  retrospect. It's a cliched melodrama, with Mary Steenburgen as a bewildered  actress in a snowbound house, persecuted by crazy people -- but once you  realize the story is worthless and derivative and going nowhere, you can  appreciate the grace-notes by the brilliant Penn and by Steenburgen, one of our  most radiant actresses.  </P> <P> On Saturday, there's the usual smorgasbord. Under Fire (Channel 9 at 8 p.m.) is  a good, rock 'em, shock 'em political thriller, done in the best imitation  Costa-Gavras style by director Roger Spottiswoode, co-writer Ron Shelton ("Bull  Durham") and actors Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman, as American newsmen caught in  the caldron of the Nicaraguan revolution.  </P> <P> Also on Saturday: Avenging Angel (Channel 9 at 11 p.m.) is appalling trash  about an underage hooker who redeems herself by becoming a vigilante. Mary My  Dearest (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.), a rare 1982 Mexican film, boasts a screenplay  by no less than Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez; it's directed by Jaime  Humberto Hermosillo. And Kung Fu: The Movie (Channel 13 at 8 p.m.) recalls more  weird executive casting choices -- when Bruce Lee was turned down for the  original martial arts TV series. Here, the producers make amends by casting son  Brandon Lee as a Manchu assassin on David (Caine) Carradine's trail.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

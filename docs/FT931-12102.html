			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Property: Listed building legislation MY ARTICLE on January 9 mistakenly reported that Simmons &amp; Simmons and Jackson-Stops says in its Guide to the Legislation Relating to Listed Buildings that the law requires such buildings to be maintained. Owners may, however, be served repair notices or a compulsory purchase order if the building is becoming derelict. After a fire, there is no explicit obligation to rebuild, but restoration work would usually require consent.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DARKIE TOOTHPASTE GETS NEW NAME  </P> <P> The Colgate-Palmolive Co. will change the name of its Darkie toothpaste, a  best-selling brand in Asia, and redesign the label depicting a grinning black  minstrel, company officials said today.  </P> <P> The toothpaste, which is not sold in the United States, will be renamed Darlie  and the label will be changed to a "non-racially offensive silhouette" of a man  clad in a top hat, tuxedo and bow tie, the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> The toothpaste's name and package had been basically unchanged since the  product was launched in the 1920s by the Hawley &amp; Hazel Group, said  officials of Colgate, which bought half ownership of the group for $50 million  in 1985.  </P></p>

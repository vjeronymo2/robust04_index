			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F> Krejci; place and date not given: "Benes Decrees Were the  Reality of the Time"]    [Excerpts] In a regular interview with the prime minister,  we discuss the topical events of the past week. [passage omitted]    [Krejci] The Czech Republic has a deficit on the clearing  account with Slovakia. What do you see as the reason for this  happening?    [Klaus] There are many reasons. First, the partition of  Czechoslovakia disrupted various cooperative ties that  ordinarily exist within a single economy.    Another factor is the fact that the Slovak koruna devalued  in  relation to the clearing ECU. Moreover, the import surcharge  was introduced. These three moments combined represent an  increase in the price of Czech imports to Slovakia and, vice  versa, a reduction in Slovak exports to the Czech Republic.  That, of course, leads to an increase in the flow of goods from  Slovakia to the Czech Republic rather than vice versa.    The third important factor is that imports to any country  are  a function of the development of the gross domestic product of  that country. The correlation between the two quantities is  obvious according to direct proportionality: The richer the  country is, the more it buys. The reciprocal is also valid --  the poorer the country is, the less it buys. That is the third  reason leading to the demand for Slovak, and foreign goods in  general, being higher in the Czech Republic than vice versa.    The fourth reason is a certain conscious decision, on the  Slovak part, of the type: "We have a deficit, something must be  done about it." That gives rise to a certain psychological  atmosphere that leads some Slovak firms to simply not shop on  the Czech market.    Only fifth is the issue of administrative problems and the  renowned certificates. There is not such a genius who could  weigh the effect of all these factors precisely. Only a few of  them can be directly affected by the Czech Republic.    [Krejci] Can or will the Czech side undertake something?    [Klaus] We are not likely to introduce any artificial import  barriers. Nor can we create in Slovakia a greater demand for  Czech goods. At most, we could do something about the exchange  rate of the koruna within the framework of the clearing account.  These are very minor measures, however, with a long-term rather  than an immediate effect.    A while back, when Slovakia devalued and introduced the  import surcharge, everybody wondered why a turnabout in the  trade relations did not occur the next day. I spoke then about  the so-called "J" curve, according to which the balance of  payments will worsen before it begins to improve. That is  precisely the phenomenon that took place. After the  devaluations and import surcharges, the problem of the Slovak  trade balance continued to worsen a while, and now it began to  improve. If we did something similar regarding Slovakia, the  short-term effect would not be at all favorable, and good  results could come only in the long run.    [Krejci] During the recent Sudeten German Days, German  Government representatives also demanded that the Benes Decrees  be abolished. Views are even being expressed in our country  that the decrees were inhumane, first and foremost, because they  proceeded from collective guilt. What do you think of the Benes  Decrees and of their possible annulment?    [Klaus] The Benes Decrees were a reality of the era in which  they evolved. At the same time, it is confusing to describe  them as the Benes Decrees, because the issue involved a  government resolution that the president of the republic then  signed. This also involved edicts with which the victorious  World War II powers agreed. However, it was mainly the Czech  and Slovak public at that time that applauded them  enthusiastically. It is impossible to assess slightly  differently today -- half a century later -- this or that  phenomenon. The Benes Decrees had certain consequences. The  idea that it is possible to undo them somehow is  incomprehensible and alien to me. It simply cannot be done.    [Krejci] How, then, do you assess the demands from the  German side to abolish the decrees?    [Klaus] I do not know if it is possible to say "from the  German side." Let us assess them as partial German demands.  Are we to allow these few people to dictate to the Czech  Republic Government what it should have on its agenda, where we  should go or not go? It seemed curious to me that Mr. Otto von  Habsburg said, with reference to me in an interview for MLADA  FRONTA DNES, that my rejection of a dialogue is an expression of  the weakness of my arguments. This is not true, however. Many  people recall how, a year ago, I said that I will participate  cool-headedly in any dialogue. Perhaps, since they do not want  to hear them at a distance, I could sell them my arguments from  close by. You know very well that the government coalition has  come to the conclusion that a direct dialogue will be rejected  in this country. I fully respect this. However, I can say on  my own behalf that I would take part in it cool-headedly and  that in no way would I be afraid of it.</p>

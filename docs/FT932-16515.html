			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Employers veto German pay initiative A POSSIBLE breakthrough aimed at averting all-out strikes in eastern Germany's metal and electrical sectors was yesterday thrown into confusion after disagreement between regional and national employers' associations. The plan was drawn up at the weekend between Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, Mr Hasso Duvel, regional head of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, and Mr Erwin Hein, president of the Saxony regional employers' association. It proposed that workers in the state's metal and electrical industry receive a 26 per cent pay increase this year, compared with the 9 per cent first offered by the employers. A 26 per cent rise would bring their incomes up to 82 per cent of western German levels, as called for in a contract signed in March 1991 between the unions, the employers, and the managers of eastern German enterprises. Next April, metal and electrical workers would have had their incomes increased to 91 per cent of west German levels. The 1991 agreement envisaged income parity by April 1994. Wages in eastern Germany are currently between 65 and 70 per cent of western German levels. Under the Saxony proposal IG Metall would have postponed the timetable towards equalising eastern and western wages by nine months to January 1995, and called off warning strikes which began last week. IG Metall officials yesterday said the agreement, mediated by Mr Biedenkopf, a leading member of the Christian Democratic Union, and once tipped as a possible successor to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, could 'serve as a model for the rest of eastern German states'. Over half of IG Metall's 300,000 members are based in Saxony. Saxony's metal and electrical employers will today meet to decide whether to accept the plan. But the proposal, clearly favouring IG Metall, must also be approved by Gesamtmetall, the federal metal and electrical employers' association, which yesterday rejected the deal outright. A spokesman said the association 'would not accept the compromise. We are sticking to 9 per cent. And that is that. We will not go back to the original timetable towards income parity (between eastern and western German wages),' he said. Last month Gesamtmetall, followed last week by Arbeitgeberverband, the steel employers' association, broke the 1991 contract. They said they could not afford the wage increases because of the recession in western Germany, the deteriorating economic circumstances in the five new eastern German states, and persistent low productivity levels which are 70 per cent below western Germany. IG Metall, anxious to boost its support in eastern Germany, started organising warning strikes throughout the region last week to put pressure on the employers. Until yesterday, it still intended to hold a ballot among its east German members for indefinite strikes in the region, and protests in the rest of Germany from April 24.</p>

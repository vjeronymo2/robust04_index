			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Wage rise threatens Brazil prices move Brazil's government plans to increase minimum wages by nearly 8 per cent from September, in a move that could undermine efforts to beat inflation through the Real currency, due to be launched on Friday. In an effort to cut inflation from around 50 per cent a month, Brazil intends to link the Real at parity with the US dollar and limit the amount of the new currency to be issued. The finance ministry and central bank had also been seeking a delay in increasing the minimum wage, to give these anti-inflationary measures time to take hold. However, President Itamar Franco has now agreed to an increase in the minimum monthly wage from Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) to Dollars 70, ahead of a 'full review' later this year. The government has suggested that calls for an increase in the minimum wage to Dollars 100 have been defeated. But the president's agreement to the increase will add to pressure from Brazil's military, who are pushing hard for a big pay rise this year. The September hike in minimum wages is likely to lead to further demand from lower-paid workers, and therefore higher prices, at a time when monthly inflation was expected to have stabilised at low single figures. The rise will also affect Brazil's social security system, which uses the minimum wage as a benchmark for benefits and pensions. It is likely to raise the annual cost of total benefits by at least Dollars 500m and take the government's budget into deficit. A balanced budget and strict money supply rules are the key to underpinning the Real and preventing yet another inflationary cycle. Meanwhile, economists said frost in southern Brazil since the weekend would have a limited effect on domestic food prices. Brazil has halted all new coffee exports indefinitely and cancelled contracts agreed upon since the weekend after the worst frost in more than a decade damaged 15 to 30 per cent of next year's coffee crop. Although vegetable prices have already started to rise, they are likely to be balanced by falling meat prices as farmers sell cattle rather than see their quality decline on frost-affected pasture. However, due to other price increases in advance of the launch of the Real, overall inflation is now expected to top 50 per cent for June, technically taking Brazil into hyper-inflation.

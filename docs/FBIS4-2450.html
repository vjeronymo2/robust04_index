			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Wang Wei-chun; from the </F> "Hookup" program]    [Text] Answering an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan  on 8 April, Premier Lien Chan pointed out that the government  and the public have identical points of view regarding the  tragedy which took place on Lake Chientao [Qingdao] in Zhejiang  Province, maintaining that the Chinese Communist authorities  were inhuman and irresponsible in handling the incident, and  that the mainland authorities totally lack a sense of rule by  law.    The premier indicated that the Chinese Communist authorities  should not be forgiven for their total disregard of  sensibilities, human rights, and humanitarianism. Station  correspondent Wang Wei-chun reports:    [Begin recording] [Wang] Premier Lien again used strong  wording to condemn the Chinese Communist authorities for their  handling of the tragedy that occurred on Lake Chientao. Premier  Lien stressed that places which cannot ensure the safety of  tourists are not qualified to welcome visitors.    [Lien] As one Chinese saying goes, one should not enter a  state besieged by danger, or live in a state of unrest. Before  we visit a place for sightseeing purposes, we must make our  decision carefully. How can a region of danger or unrest, or a  region that cannot ensure the safety of its visitors, consider  itself qualified to welcome visitors from the outside?    [Wang] Premier Lien also urged tourism services at home to  examine their operations. He pointed out that under a plan  drawn up by the Ministry of Communications for developing  sightseeing in Taiwan, the government will improve the  sightseeing environment every year. On the other hand, he urged  the Legislative Yuan to quickly finish examining the regulations  which the Executive Yuan has drafted for developing tourism so  that departments in charge of tourism will become more effective  in supervising travel safety.    Meanwhile, in view of the fact that some legislators of  nonruling parties have insisted on linking the tragedy on Lake  Chientao with the controversy of reunification and Taiwanese  independence, Premier Lien pointed out that the most important  thing the government and the public can do at present is to work  together to make sure the death of the 24 citizens is justly  settled. He said the focus of the tragedy should not be blurred.    This is China Broadcasting Corporation correspondents Ho  Chien-min and Wang Wei-chun at the Legislative Yuan. [end  recording]</p>

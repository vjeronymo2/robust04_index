Shakhray tried to dispell fears of conservative lawmakers  that the treaty may ruin the federative structure of the country  and is an infringement on its territorial intergrity.    The fact that Tatarstan had agreed to hold new parliamentary  elections to the Russian parliament "is the recognition of the  Russian sovereignty on the territory of the Republic of  Tatarstan, as well as that Russian laws are acting there", he  told lawmakers on Friday adding that "accusations of separatism  against Tatarstan had also been lifted".    December 12 elections in Tatarstan failed mostly because of  the opposition of its leadership to them. However, Russia and  Tatarstan then reached a compromise that the federation agrees  to sign a bilateral treaty with its republic, on which the  latter insisted, while Tatarstan's leadership would hold new  elections to the parliament.    The signing of the treaty became possible after the sides  dropped their political and national ambitions and switched to  concrete agreements to settle the disputes, according to  Shakhray. It turned out that "it is possible to evade political  tensions at negotiations", Shakhray said. The treaty does not  raise the status of Tatarstan, he added.    "Relations by agreements (between Russia and Tatarstan) is a  mechanism of self-tuning of the Russian Federation, while  federation for Russia is a way of democratic organisation of  society which is the only possible way of the development of the  multi-national people of Russia without a crisis", Shakhray  stressed.</p>

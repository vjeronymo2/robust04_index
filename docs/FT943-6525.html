			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Diller warns against industry's stampede - Raymond Snoddy reports on the QVC chairman's Edinburgh speech Barry Diller, chairman of QVC, the innovative TV home-shopping channel, has issued a stark warning that major corporations are launching multi-million - and even multi-billion - dollar experiments in new media convergences without any understanding of what these convergences are really about. Diller's company grew by exploiting television, telecommunications and computers. But he says there are those in these industries who are doing 'truly stupid things' in anticipation of enormous markets that do not yet exist. 'Telecom companies, broadcasters, book publishers, silicon chippers and software companies fear that, if they don't rush helter-skelter into each other's businesses, the great dance of the next century will pass them by,' Diller said at the weekend. He was giving the annual Worldview international lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The entertainment executive, who recently failed in his attempt to merge QVC with CBS, the US broadcasting giant, said that Hollywood was going to Silicon Valley and vice versa - each thinking the other would succeed, but not exactly sure at what. At the same time publishers were spending millions of dollars digitalising books and magazines, and slapping them on to floppy disks and CD-ROMS, in the happy belief that all their intellectual properties are naturally interactive - 'whatever that means'. The mega-Titans, the telephone and cable companies, were fighting over who gets into each other's businesses fastest, in the belief that all will be well if they can just own the content that flows down their wires. 'It's more complicated - and a lot simpler - than that,' said Diller, who added: 'All these companies' intentions are good, but I think, regrettably, the networks to multimedia hell are going to be wired with good intentions.' The crippling mistakes that most people are making is to insist on defining convergence along the dimensions of technological innovation, and by defining convergence as a 'natural extension' of their existing businesses. The result is that the programmers, 'those organisers of the creative process', are playing the smallest, rather than the largest, role in the truly radical transformations now under way in the communication industries. The programmers must be encouraged to play the role 'of the spark, the ignition to do new things, to make new programmes, to get audiences to respond in new ways. The aim should not be to turn a personal computer into a TV set, a book into a personal computer or a video game into into a movie. 'It means having the willingness to subordinate your media expertise, instead of imposing it. It means treating a new medium on its own terms, not yours. It means having the patience to relax and follow your curiousity, instead of hyperventilating and chasing the crowd,' said Diller. As as example of new thinking, the QVC chairman said the one area where he invested in research at the home-shopping channel was in creating 'smart agent technology'. This is software that puts together a profile in great depth, 'about who you are, what you like and what you are interested in'. It creates a 'sensitive' duplicate of an individual inside the memory of the computer. This can then be matched in milli-seconds with a database of goods and services. 'I think smart agents are going to be the single most important mechanism for empowering the entire industry. It will finally make mass media fit the individual. 'When it does, people will change their habits. And when people change their habits, watch out,' he concluded.</p>

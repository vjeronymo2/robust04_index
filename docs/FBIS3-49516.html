Our editor Jana  Zemanova is at Hrzan Palace.    [Zemanova] The meeting behind closed doors between the Czech  and Slovak Prime Ministers Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar is  drawing to an end in Hrzan Palace. It is a part of today's  series of bilateral talks on security and further cooperation  between Visegrad countries at prime ministerial level.    During the previous meeting between Czech Prime Minister  Klaus and his Polish counterpart Waldemar Pawlak, the two  politicians explained to each other a certain tension which was  generated by Prague's individualist attitude to the acceptance  of the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan. This is how Klaus  described this situation:    [Begin Klaus recording] I think that relations are not as  tense as it would appear from some media headlines. We have a  whole number of projects we would like to execute together.  These projects should be directed at practical forms of  Czech-Polish contacts and cooperation. I think that our views  on this point were completely identical. [end recording]    [Zemanova] What is important is that the two prime ministers  jointly emphasized the willingness to continue to cooperate and  to meet for further talks as soon as possible. According to  Pawlak, economic cooperation will have priority in future  relations between the Czech Republic and Poland. After all,  this can be documented by the presence at the talks of Czech  Economics Minister Karel Dyba.</p>

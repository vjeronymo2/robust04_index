			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: The tailors who have reinvented British style - A look at the innovative designers who have breathed new life into the Savile Row suit A FEW years ago the outlook was bleak for the British tailor. The late Nicholas Ridley, then Minister of Environment and unable to understand why all men might not want to wear suits from Marks &amp; Spencer, changed the rating system of the tailor's premises from light industrial to full retail status which threatened, either to put most of the West End tailors out of business or, at least, banish them to a shopping mall at Heathrow Airport. Savile Row's quietly dwindling clientele appeared to consist mainly of large men from north America and small ones from the East. Young British men appeared to be perfectly happy to slouch around in shapeless suits, a couple of sizes too big for them. It seemed that the great British sartorial heritage of simple, understated, wool clothes that stretched back to Beau Brummel was doomed. But gradually, increasing numbers of stylish young men could be spotted all over London sporting rather good, obviously British, clothes. These outfits encompassed the traditional British trademarks: a natural shoulder line, accentuated waist and a gentle flare on the hips. They were often made from tweeds and worsteds. But they were decidedly modern products from young tailors able to combine traditional tailoring techniques with a contemporary sense of style. 'Men had become very educated about fashion. Whereas once they would have invested in the security of a designer label, they began to have faith in their own sense of style and looked to a tailor to realise it,' says Timothy Everest, probably the most successful and best known of the new tailors. From modest beginnings three years ago, he now boasts over 1,500 clients ranging from foreign advisers to John Major to television presenters. His bohemian atelier in a shabby, picturesque corner of Spitalfields is a quantum leap away from Savile Row. 'I love the traditions, the craft and the quality of the Row, but feel it's important to add something more modern, accessible, affordable and relevant to the way men live today,' he says of his contemporary style. His sentiments are echoed by Richard James, a designer who made his name creating exuberant ready-to-wear interpretations of British classic style and who operates a successful made-to-measure service from his shop in Savile Row. 'Tradition is wonderful, but it is not a sacred cow. The modern tailor has to appreciate how men's lifestyles have changed: they are used to wearing lighter, softer clothes and no longer need a 20 ounce tweed; they have given up worrying about wearing brown shoes with blue suits and love mixing unexpected fabrics, patterns and textures,' he says. Georgina Godley, who switched from ready-to-wear to custom-making, feels the tailoring revolution has only just begun. 'I love to break new ground by using modern high tech fabrics to create clothes that have the authority of tailoring but the comfort of sportswear,' says Godley, whose more notable commissions include a stretch worsted suit with built-in spats, a prisoner-of-war boiler suit, a lavender boucle and angora jacket and a multi-pocketed micro fibre travelling jacket that can roll into a ball without creasing. Her prices start at about Pounds 800. Even pop musicians, are starting to turn to tailors to create an image. 'They like the idea of employing a tailor to create a look that won't be seen on other artists,' explains Ozwald Boateng, whose streamlined, futuristic, updated-Steed-like clothes are worn by Seal and members of what he describes as the 'acid jazz scene', happy to pay the Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000 his suits cost. All the tailors I spoke to sense a disenchantment with expensive designer fashion and say sensible pricing has contributed to their success. 'Men are looking for good value and service, at an affordable price and are questioning paying for high overheads and marketing campaigns. They know what they are paying for, when they order a suit,' says Everest, who charges from Pounds 650 for a fully bespoke suit. Richard James, whose suits cost from Pounds 850, says, 'I do not know anybody who wears designer suits now. Men's dressing has returned to the idea of personal style rather than an imposition of somebody's else's ideal.' Both also admit they have been lucky with fashion's swing to a more shaped and slimmer silhouette for men: a look that is hard to achieve off-the-peg,unless you have a perfect figure. However, like many trends, the new tailors include some charlatans and well-meaning individuals, who although big on ideas, often lack tailoring skills. Many never get the hang of measuring accurately, interpreting a fitting properly and appreciating the proper 'balance' of a garment. Others promise a fully 'bespoke' suit, but deliver a bad, factory-made pastiche of the real thing. You should therefore find out exactly what is on offer before you order. A real bespoke suit, made to the old method perfected in Savile Row, is built by hand from complex layers of canvas, stitching and padding. It conceals a man's bad points and enhances his good ones. It should fit perfectly and be so comfortable that lesser garments feel clumsy by comparison. Below this ideal of the tailor's craft, there are many levels of manufacture ranging from the perfectly respectable to the very depressing indeed. To avoid confusion, Everest offers two very distinctive levels of make: a bespoke service, which is 'as good as you will find on Savile Row' and a City Line: an up-graded version of a basic City suit, which although machine-made, offers many of the nuances of bespoke such as real button holes, some hand-finishing and proper ermazine linings. This type of suit is less soft in appearance than the hand-made variety, and is proving popular with men who need well-priced, hardwearing basic suits for business. 'There are a lot of men who would like to have clothes that reflect their personality, but who don't want the pomposity and expense of Savile Row,' explains Serena Kelsey, whose hand-made bespoke suits start at Pounds 500 and whose peripatetic, made-to-measure service, has proved so popular that she has opened a shop, midway between the City and the West End. A similar company, Norton &amp; Townsend is also enjoying considerable success with its visiting service that offers a range of classic made-to-measure styles which are made-up in a factory in Yorkshire. The renaissance of the British tailor is particularly remarkable as the success of its practitioners, most of whom work as small traders without any major backing, has coincided with the biggest recession in the fashion industry for years. In addition to an emphasis on good value, personal style and service, the new tailors are offering a quintessentially British style. James says: 'The vast majority of our clients are British.'

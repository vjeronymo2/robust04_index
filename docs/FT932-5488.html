			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Baring Chrysalis plans to raise Dollars 110m Baring Chrysalis, a London-listed investment company specialising in emerging markets, is seeking to raise Dollars 110m (Pounds 71.4m) via an issue of new shares. About Dollars 60m is being raised via a placing of 12m C shares at Dollars 5 each, with a further 10m shares being offered to existing holders at the same price. The C shares will eventually be converted into ordinary shares. The rationale for issuing a separate class of shares is twofold; the new shareholders will bear the costs of the issue; the trust's investment performance will not be distorted by market movements before the new money is fully invested. Baring Chrysalis, which was established in December 1990, is a Cayman Island registered fund, and not an authorised investment trust. It currently has assets of about Dollars 140m.</p>

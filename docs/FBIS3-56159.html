[Ziyamukhamedov] Following the signing of bilateral  interstate agreements between the Republic of Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan and the Mukus conference of the heads of Central  Asian states on the problems of the area adjoining the Aral Sea,  Presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev and Islam Karimov visited  Urgench, the ancient towns of Khiva and Samarkand, where they  visited world famous architectural monuments. This concluded  president Nursultan Nazarbayev's official visit to Uzbekistan.    [Ganiyeva] What are the main political results? What new  elements will the meeting contribute toward mutual relations  between the two states?    [Nazarbayev] First, the meeting concluded six months of work  to bring our economic integration closer. Our experts and  governments intend the program to last until the year 2000. As  a result of this work an agreement was signed on joint economic  space.    [Karimov, in progress] ...which presupposes, above all, a  free economy, a free movement of goods, capital, labor  resources, manpower, services, and so forth. My view is that  that we are now tackling problems, difficult economic problems,  and we are thereby also settling political issues. Today we  have made the first step toward integration.

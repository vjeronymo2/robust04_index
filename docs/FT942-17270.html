			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Cash boost aids Tory campaigns The Conservative party's finances took a marked turn for the better last year in a development which may help improve its prospects in the forthcoming local and European election campaigns. As Mr John Major was forced on the defensive with further questions over his leadership during a visit to Essex, it emerged that the party may have achieved its biggest-ever surplus in the financial year just ended - breaking a run of four consecutive deficits. Preliminary figures are believed to show the party had a surplus of about Pounds 2m last year, on income of Pounds 13m, which helped it to trim its accumulated deficit from Pounds 19m to Pounds 16.5m. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said he believed the party had 'turned the corner' as far as its finances were concerned. This meant 'we will certainly be able to spend on the election campaigns'. He added that the party hoped to put on a 'good show' with poster campaigns, particularly before June's European elections. A satisfactory performance in these and the local elections which precede them in May is seen as vital to Mr Major's leadership prospects. The prime minister yesterday tried to shore up his embattled position by swapping 'the wild world of Westminster' for the 'real world' of Essex. As more backbenchers privately predicted that he would be forced to stand down later this year, Mr Major fiercely denied that he was the cause of Conservative divisions. Sir Norman has called for a period of silence from Tory backbench MPs who have lost confidence in the prime minister. He insisted that Mr Tony Marlow, Mr John Carlisle and Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the three MPs who have publicly called on him to resign, did not represent the view of the Conservative party in parliament or in the country. But while few MPs were prepared to publicly call for Mr Major's resignation, many said a leadership challenge in the autumn was inevitable unless the party performed unexpectedly well in the European elections. Sir Norman said that the improved financial circumstances would enable his policy of diverting resources from the centre to marginal constituencies to continue. He said the party was aiming to increase the number of agents it employed from 220 to about 300. In response to further attacks on Mr Major's leadership Mr Jerry Hayes, Tory MP for Harlow, warned that the party would do 'appallingly' in the June European elections if discontented MPs did not 'shut up'. Mr Major appeared irritated when asked on BBC Radio whether his away-day visits to Basildon and Harlow were intended to save his job. He replied: 'That has been said for the last two years. 'It is important for a prime minister, any prime minister, to escape from the wild world of Westminster and come and see what is happening in the real world of the country.' Questioned about the disunity within his party, he said: 'All political parties have their differences on Europe.'</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Howard says at least 2,000 DoE staff will relocate to Docklands THE GOVERNMENT yesterday hardened its commitment to relocate at least 2,000 civil servants in Docklands as ministers sought to give a breathing space for the administrators of the failed Canary Wharf development. Separately, Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators, made 44 of Canary Wharf's 198 office staff redundant. They said further redundancies among office staff would follow 'as certain of the group's activities are completed'. Most of the 218 estate management staff at Canary Wharf will keep their jobs, they said. 'The joint administrators do not envisage any material reductions to these employees as they wish to maintain the full services to existing tenants.' In the House of Commons, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said Canary Wharf was among three sites under study for the move by civil servants from the Department of the Environment. The others were Harbour Exchange and East India Dock, both on the Isle of Dogs. Mr Howard said he expected to conclude soon an outline deal to lease space at one of the sites. Officials said a decision was likely before the end of this month. He repeated that there could be no subsidy, 'hidden or otherwise', in the deal. He also said the government would go ahead with the extension of the Jubilee line only if the owners of Canary Wharf contributed the Pounds 400m agreed previously by Olympia &amp; York. Ministerial colleagues said Mr Howard's announcement - which included details of a prospective move of another few hundred civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry - was designed to emphasise the government's confidence in Docklands. That in turn should help give the administrators of Canary Wharf a breathing space in their efforts to salvage the project. The environment secretary repeated that the government would not intervene directly in any rescue operation. But Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, is understood to be in active contact with potential purchasers of Canary Wharf. Mr Howard said the move by his staff and the DTI's Radio Communications Agency could be followed in the longer term by the relocation of civil servants from other departments. He also signalled he was in discussions with the Treasury on possible compensation - perhaps travel allowances or relocation expenses - for civil servants affected by the move. One minister involved in the negotiations said the high quality of accommodation available at Canary Wharf made it a frontrunner. The government would have to satisfy the National Audit Office that it was the best value for money. Mr Howard, who faced pressure from some Conservative MPs to confirm that the government would go ahead with the Jubilee line extension, said he was confident that the owners of Canary Wharf would come up with the agreed contribution. The maintenance of Canary Wharf will be discussed this week at meetings between individual tenants and the administrators. The tenants will also seek assurances about the security of the project and the payment of rent on former properties, one of O&amp;Y's inducements for them to move to Canary Wharf.</p>

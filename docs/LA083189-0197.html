			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS SETTLE LAST CASE IN COLLAPSE OF BUTTERFIELD SAVINGS  </P> <P> Federal regulators, acknowledging a lack of evidence, have agreed to settle the  last piece of litigation accusing defendants of conspiring to defraud  Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana and contributing to its collapse  four years ago.  </P> <P> The tentative settlement, reached Monday, would bring the government's total  compensation in two lawsuits it had filed to about $6.5 million.  </P> <P> The bailout of Butterfield, which regulators declared insolvent and seized in  August, 1985, cost the federal government $281 million. That's the amount of  federal assistance pledged in the sale of Butterfield last September to Downey  Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, which operates a now healthy Butterfield  as a subsidiary.  </P> <P> Within a year of the S&amp;L's failure, regulators filed two civil lawsuits  against 19 defendants alleging they conspired to defraud Butterfield through a  series of about 50 real estate transactions in the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> In one suit, regulators claimed that Donald W. Endresen, Butterfield's former  president and chief executive, and other directors and officers conspired to  increase the S&amp;L's sagging net worth by inflating the value of the  properties. That suit was finally settled earlier this year when the  defendants' insurer agreed to pay about $5 million.  </P> <P> In the second suit, regulators accused 13 Oregon brokers, appraisers and  companies of conspiring with Endresen and S&amp;L officials to pay inflated  prices -- a total of $85 million -- for the Pacific Northwest properties,  mostly in Portland. The properties were worth less than $50 million, regulators  alleged.  </P> <P> Regulators previously settled with nine Oregon defendants, receiving a total of  about $500,000, lawyers said. Monday's tentative settlement with three brokers  and an appraiser would bring the government an additional $1 million. The U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles is expected to approve the last settlement within  a month.  </P> <P> None of the defendants in either lawsuit admitted any liability in settling the  cases. In an unusual twist, two of the remaining Oregon defendants will receive  letters explaining that there was insufficient evidence for the government to  bring fraud and conspiracy claims against them.  </P> <P> The discovery process "did not supply as much evidence as we had originally  believed of fraud or conspiracy to defraud," said Peter Diedrich, a Los Angeles  lawyer representing the federal government.  </P> <P> The last defendants are brokers Michael J. Safley, R. Michael Van and Thomas V.  Clarey, and Portland, Ore., appraiser Alan A. Paget. The brokers were doing  business as Riverside Realty in 1984 when the alleged damages were incurred.  </P> <P> The settlement calls for the federal government to receive $1 million from the  defendants' insurance company. In return, Safley and Van will be provided a  letter explaining the lack of evidence against them.  </P> <P> According to John Folawn, who represents Safley and Van, the bulk of the  settlement will come from Paget's insurance policy.  </P> <P> Paget was named in the lawsuit because the government claims that some of his  appraisals were inadequate. They allege he used faulty economic data, incorrect  zoning and invalid professional standards in arriving at property values.  </P></p>

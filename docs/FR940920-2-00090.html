Other towns in the vicinity are Maricopa, Stanfield, Casa Grande, Avondale and Buckeye, Arizona. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Summary of Proposed Actions: Seventy nine miles of former vehicle ways reclaimed; 16 miles converted to pedestrian and/or equestrian trails. Four access routes shortened. Seventeen vehicle barriers constructed. Four new trails and seven trailheads established and two existing trails and trailheads improved and maintained.

Six wildlife water catchments and associated fencing modified, and along with two others, maintained. One new pump installed in a wildlife water well. Transplants of desert bighorn sheep and aircraft telemetry following allowed. Installation of new wildlife catchments to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Animal damage control allowed.

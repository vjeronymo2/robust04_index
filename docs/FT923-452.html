			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): We are all consumers now THE CONSUMERIST MANIFESTO: ADVERTISING IN POST-MODERN TIMES by Martin Davidson Routledge Pounds 35/Pounds 10.99, 217 pages PERHAPS the only comfort to be drawn from the UK's recession is that it has stemmed the avalanche of meretricious books about advertising, public relations and marketing generally - Lord knows, there are enough of them around. But useful books on advertising still manage to find a publisher and fortunately that includes the The Consumerist Manifesto. Despite a thoroughly opaque, misleading title - probably invented by a public relations team which has not read the book but is desperate to find an audience - The Consumerist Manifesto has appeared at a time when the advertising world is still busily examining its own navel, wondering if its immediate future will be as commercially appalling as its recent past. Davidson's analysis of what advertising does and how it does it weaves a sometimes inebriated path between academic and industrial sources. But he does a good job of unpicking the ponderous anti-advertising moralisms of left-inclined culture-watchers - such as Raymond Williams  - and usefully reminds us that, after all, practitioners of advertising are often very intelligent and have a powerful influence in contemporary society. We ought to frame the kind of absurdity otherwise intelligent people commit when they dabble in fields beyond them. Here is Umberto Eco: 'For a Milanese bank clerk a TV ad for a refrigerator represents a stimulus to buy, but for an unemployed peasant in Calabria the same image means a confirmation of a world of prosperity that doesn't belong to him and that he must conquer. That is why I believe TV advertising in depressed countries functions as a revolutionary message.' The irony is that such half-baked thinking is precisely what leftist critics of advertising and consumerism normally accuse advertising of being responsible for. Davidson balances their miscomprehensions of the advertising process with a challenging polemic as to the essence of contemporary society. We are all consumers now, he argues: 'Consumption is now the basic mode for all activity in our society, not reading, not using, not appreciating, not participating, not producing but consuming . . . built into this is the demand that the world accommodate us better, that we consume it more not less; in other words we consume aspirationally.' In other words, though Davidson does not make this point explicitly, we have moved from being swayed by the unique selling point (USP) of the product to being persuaded by its ESP, or emotional selling point, and the best advertising, in the UK at least, has moved ground recently to reflect that subtle but crucial socio-cultural change. That is a useful insight which advertisers and advertising agencies are increasingly grasping and exploring. To bemoan the cultural shifts which underlie the move towards widening consumerist mentality, and to sneer at advertising - the most visible expression of consumer aspiration, is to spit into the wind. The Consumerist Manifesto is a timely and, though sometimes quite derivative, a very useful summary of most of the key intellectual issues underlying the functions and methods of advertising, itself one of the most complicated and powerful forms of human communication.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RID PEELING SURFACE OF MOISTURE PROBLEM BEFORE NEW PAINT JOB  </P> <P> When excess moisture is trapped in a home, it often manifests itself in a rash  of blistering, cracking and peeling paint.  </P> <P> Smothered under a fresh coat of color, Country Home magazine says, even small  amounts of moisture can cause wood to swell and break the adhesion of the  bottom layer. Hence, beautifully painted walls, ceilings and other surfaces  quickly transform into ragged skins.  </P> <P> There is no sense in repainting a damaged surface until moisture problems have  been solved. The first step in treating peeling paint is to locate and remove  sources of moisture.  </P> <P> Install exhaust fans and vents to remove excess interior moisture from  bathrooms. Check for leaky plumbing or disconnected dryer exhaust pipes. Keep  moisture from entering the home from the outside by correcting the following  conditions.  </P> <P>  -- Faulty Flashing.  </P> <P>  -- Leaking gutters.  </P> <P>  -- Defective roof shingles.  </P> <P>  -- Deteriorated caulking in joints and seams  </P> <P>  -- Shrubbery growing too close to painted wood.  </P> <P> After the moisture problems have been solved, allow the home to dry out  thoroughly. Once dry, the damaged paint should be scraped off. The the surface  can be repainted.  </P> <P> If working with a historically significant structure, keep a small sample of  the original paint. Cover a small area with a metal plate or mark it in some  way so that future investigators will have a record of the building's paint  history.  </P></p>

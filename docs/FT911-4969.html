			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Management: The dangers of making lawyers redundant - Property has been hard hit in today's straitened times. Robert Rice reports on how different organisations coped D J Freeman &amp; Co, the firm of City solicitors which advised Wiggins, has itself fallen victim to the the property market recession. For the second time since September, the firm, which is one of the top ten commercial property specialists, announced earlier this month that the current economic climate had forced it to make staff cuts. This time, two salaried partners and up to six equity partners, together with six assistant solicitors will be leaving. Although D J Freeman appears to have been particularly badly affected by the property slump, other commercial law firms have not escaped either. Three other large City law firms, Richards Butler, McKenna &amp; Co, and Titmus Sainer &amp; Webb have all laid off property lawyers in the past six months. Other firms equally affected have taken the decision to carry excess capacity. David Solomon, D J Freeman's chief executive, hopes the latest redundancies will be the last. There are signs, he says, that the property downturn may be plateauing with a number of foreign investors, particularly from Sweden, Japan and the US, beginning to show interest in the UK market again. But on the surface D J Freeman appears to be guilty of adopting a rigid approach to its current problems. Income from property work is down so cutting costs by making property lawyers redundant is the answer; cut costs, profits up. In the legal profession, however, such a short-term approach - particularly reducing the numbers of assistant solicitors - can be dangerous. The work of redundant senior assistants will have to be taken over by someone else, probably a partner, but may not support a partner's hourly rate. A 'succession gap' may open up as a consequence of removing people who would have formed the next generation of partners and when things pick up again good assistants may be hard to find. The firm may be tempted to promote people into partnership too early or may spend a period 'under-partnered'. All these factors can hold back growth and development. A better approach is to weed out those solicitors who have already been promoted beyond their level of capability and those who, though competent at their present level, show no ability to rise to the next irrespective of the department they work in. An attempt should also be made to persuade good lawyers to be flexible about where they work. In other words, just because property work is down does not necessarily mean that property lawyers should be made redundant. Solomon denies that D J Freeman has been guilty of such short-term thinking. Some hard decisions had to be taken and the firm has lost some good people, he says. But every attempt was made to persuade good lawyers to move sideways. Three property lawyers have moved into the litigation department. Others were offered a move to other departments but wanted to stay in property work and some were 'not suitable' for transfer, he says. McKenna and Richards Butler both attempted to find other work for their under-employed property lawyers. McKenna set out to lose 13 jobs in its property department. In the end only one para-legal was re-allocated elsewhere in the firm. Four of the 13 were interviewed for jobs in other departments and an offer was made to one assistant solicitor who in the end took a job as a property lawyer with another firm. According to Stephen Whybrow, the firm's managing partner, there will be no more lay-offs at McKenna. 'We took the view last summer that if the market continued to dip we were going to have too many people but if we were going to make people redundant we would do the whole thing in one go.' That strategy appears to have worked; the property department is now on budget. Not all commercial property lawyers share the same pessimistic view of the market. Earlier this month the property partners of City solicitors Birkbeck Montagu announced that they were splitting away from the firm to form their own boutique commercial property practice. This looks like a brave move, but the new firm - Stepien, Lake, Gilbert &amp; Paling - is not a start-up in the true sense of the word. It has inherited all Birkbeck Montagu's property clients and although its property work has declined by about 15 per cent over the past 18 months this nevertheless gives the new practice a solid base on which to build. The decision to split the firm was taken last September. It arose from a difference of opinion on a strategy for growth. The property lawyers felt the firm should build a corporate practice on the back of a strong commercial property practice. The corporate/ commercial lawyers felt the best way to become a corporate-led City law firm was to become bigger. 'We didn't see how Birkbeck Montagu could become bigger short of merger,' says Tim Lake. (This is the 1990s and law firms mergers are 'out'.) 'Our philosophy was that we should concentrate on the areas where the firm had expertise, which was in commercial property and where the firm's big clients were, and build on that,' he adds. Can a small specialist commercial property firm survive in the current climate? Kaz Stepien, the senior partner, says smaller firms have more room to manoeuvre than the larger ones during a recession and have much greater scope for reducing overheads. Time will tell.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vito Gnutti, Italian Northern League deputy, </F> by Massimo Arcidiacono in Milan on 1 May: "`More Work? Let Us  Begin by Having Faith in It'"]    [Text] Whether at the Labor Ministry or the Industry  Ministry, in Via Flavia or Via Molise, there seems to be no  doubt about the destiny of Vito Gnutti, businessman and founding  member of the Northern League: He will be a minister in the  Berlusconi "team."    Indeed, his name is one of the few that has never been  missing from the countless ministerial sweepstakes published by  the dailies over the last month. A sure winner, for everyone  except himself, an unorthodox conservative who only dropped two  names, Keynes and Gramsci, in the course of a 45-minute  interview: "I keep hearing this rumor reported in the papers,  and I have to thank you, but I can only deny it. I have been  told nothing official."    [Arcidiacono] Maybe, but as of today, 1 May, no one is  better  qualified than you to talk about the million jobs we have heard  so much about. But, to change the subject, is your preference  for the Labor or Industry Ministry?    [Gnutti] There you go again. There is a certain difference  between the two ministries. However, even if the eventuality  arises, I do not believe that I shall be given a choice. You  have the wrong person, I am not as important as that. Of  course, I am an industrialist, but you must draw your own  conclusions. As far as the million jobs are concerned, I have  few illusions. I am not naive enough to believe that once the  government is formed, a million jobs will pop up out of nowhere  on 2 May. I do not believe it, and Berlusconi does not believe  it either, but I know that the basic requisite for achieving  this target is optimism of the will. If we have that, then I  believe that we will achieve the target, not overnight, but by  making the right, prudent decisions. Indeed, I believe that we  shall need even more jobs: We shall have to compensate for the  unemployment rife in some public sectors, unproductive work,  false employment. I am convinced that it is possible to do  this; what I do not share is the pessimism of those who believe  that the unemployed will always be with us. I just believe that  it is the prime task of politicians, no matter whether right- or  left-wing, to create jobs.    [Arcidiacono] So it is by no mere coincidence that  Berlusconi  has opted to begin his consultations with the two sides of  industry (the unions and the employers) rather than with the  usual parties.    [Gnutti] Unlike you, I do not attach such great significance  to this decision. After all, he had to start somewhere. In a  way, he is showing that many of the things that have been said  about the marketeers, about the conquering, evil Right, can be  proved false. What is more important is the sequel to this  decision: I hope there will be talks in which listening and  discussion will be the order of the day, not interparty  compromise, as used to be the case.    [Arcidiacono] Nevertheless, once the government has been  formed, faith will not be enough. The right recipe, so to  speak, will be needed. Have you any "ingredients" to suggest?    [Gnutti] First of all, greater mobility, because this is the  only thing that creates higher employment. Then temporary work,  apprenticeships, part-time work, and fair wages for those  accessing the labor market. You see, the Left has always  considered that rendering the system more rigid constituted a  social advance, but it was wrong, as this only provided  guarantees for those who already had jobs, not those who had to  acquire one. This is not being progressive, it means conserving  the status quo; this is where the Left contradicts itself, and  it lost votes on this issue.    [Arcidiacono] Just to be clear, will you explain why it  would  be right to resort to the controversial system of wage zoning in  the south....    [Gnutti] We in the League believe that pay should be linked  to the cost of living. If the cost of living indexes show that  a worker in the south spends less than his counterpart in the  north, his earnings must reflect that ratio, in other words they  must be lower. It is not a malicious desire to "punish" the  people in the south that leads me to say these things, it is a  conviction that it can be a helpful solution. The International  Monetary Fund, the Bank of Italy, and a CNEL [National Council  for Economy and Labor] survey agree on the need to do away with  this constraint. Federalism could be another instrument, and the  true supporters of the south believe in it.    And there are many other constraints from which firms should  be freed; it is the only way to raise employment, becoming more  competitive, reducing taxes on profits so that firms can plow  them back, redeploying resources, combating subsidies, and thus  reducing the public deficit. It is not true that it cannot be  done, it is not true that computers merely eat up jobs.    [Arcidiacono] You will encounter obstacles. Which ones do  you expect?    [Gnutti] We must have faith in our ability to get there.  This is no invention of mine, it is the lesson of Keynes, it is  Gramsci's optimism of the will, as opposed to the pessimism of  intelligence. One obstacle could be preconceived opposition from  the Left, but I do not think so. After all, they are working  for people's good as well.</p>

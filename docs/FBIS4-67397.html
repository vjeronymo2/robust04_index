			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Frank Elsner: "How Much Ecological Recovery Can </F> There Be in Wismut? -- Environment Experts Say GDR [German  Democratic Republic] Uranium Mining's Legacy of Contamination  Will Cost Much More Than 15 Billion German Marks [DM]"]    [Text] In the GDR it was a country within a state with its  own police and jurisdiction, closely watched by the Soviet  secret service: the mining area of the "Soviet-German Wismut  Corporation." Over a period of 40 years the USSR [Union of  Soviet Socialist Republics] took some 220,000 tons of uranium --  the raw material for its military and civilian nuclear programs  -- from the ore deposits of southern Saxony and Thuringia. Its  legacy is Germany's biggest ecological disaster. Environment  experts fear that decontaminating it properly will cost far more  than the DM13 to DM15 billion officially estimated.    Those who gained from the wasteful exploitation of nature  and  human beings will not pay the price of it. Bonn inherited the  GDR's half of Wismut anyway, and in May 1991 the USSR handed its  half over as well--and with it all responsibility for more than  3,000 radioactive waste heaps, 300 shafts and mines and a large  number of sludge lagoons containing uranium and radioactive  decay products.    The bomb must be defused by the successor company Wismut  GmbH. The resources -- about DM700 to 800 million a year -- will  be provided by its sole shareholder, the Federal Ministry of  Trade and Industry. Chief executive, Manfred Bergmann, estimates  that the ecological repair work will take 10 to 15 years. Then  it will be possible to "build kindergardens again" on the  contaminated areas. Trade and Industry Minister Rexrodt  explains that the "Wismut project" meets "international  standards."    Environment experts think otherwise. Munich radiation  biologist Edmund Lengfelder says that the GDR's lax radiological  protection rules have been perpetuated in the Reunification  Treaty for what was once the world's third largest uranium  mining area, in particular. According to Gerhard Schmidt of the  Darmstadt-based Ecological Institute, the lack of statutory  rehabilitation targets such as are standard in the USA is  painfully obvious. "Wismut has no measuring stick for its work."    Whether Wismut has the technology to keep the environmental  hazards permanently under control is also a matter of  controversy. Lengfelder disputes in particular that the  radioactive sludge lagoons are securely sealed -- a great hazard  for the groundwater. "Perfect reclamation" could easily breach  the DM100 billion cost limit, the radiation biologist believes:  "Bonn must know what quality it wants. It is a political  matter."    Worse than that: After thoroughly plundering the uranium  stocks, in 1962 Wismut gave all the worthless mining areas back  to the respective local authorities. These are now getting not  a penny from the pot in Bonn.</p>

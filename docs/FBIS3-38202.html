			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan 28 (AFP) - Alain Lamassoure, France's  junior minister of European affairs, implicitly criticized the  U.S. rejection of a French peace initiative on Bosnia in a  speech here before the CSCE, his office said Friday [28 January].    "We sometimes have the feeling," Lamassoure told the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  Thursday, "that other senior member states of the CSCE are not  doing everything they could to encourage all parties involved to  choose peace.    "Considering the point where we're at in the Yugoslav  crisis,  it is time for each of us to clearly take on some responsibility  and choose, not only in words, but in action, the logic of  peace."    Earlier this week, the U.S. rejected a French initiative for  stiffer diplomatic and military action in Bosnia.</p>

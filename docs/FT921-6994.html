			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Hong Kong to boost spending by 16% THE Hong Kong government is planning to boost its spending by 16 per cent in nominal terms in the 1992-93 fiscal year which starts on April 1. Mr K. Y. Yeung, secretary for the treasury, said the spending plans of the government were based on an inflation assumption for the year of about 11 per cent and real economic growth of around 5 per cent. Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, will present his first budget on March 4, when he will detail the government's tax plans and its view of the colony's economic prospects in the year ahead. The spending plans show a more than doubling in capital works and investment to HKDollars 11.1bn (Pounds 806m) from HKDollars 4.8bn. A large part of the increase represents expenditures for the colony's new airport and development of its ports. Current spending in the colony, 70 per cent of which is absorbed by the wages and salaries of employees in government service, is set to rise by 15.3 per cent to HKDollars 84.6bn (Pounds 6.15bn) from an estimated outturn for 1991-92 of HKDollars 73.8bn.</p>

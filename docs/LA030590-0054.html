			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> A FAT THAT'S FAIRLY FRIENDLY  </P> <P> Heart-conscious eaters who are fed up with low-fat diets can safely add some  olive oil and other monounsaturated fats to their daily fare, but the extra  dose probably won't reduce their cholesterol, a study concludes.  </P> <P> Scientists have been searching for foods that prevent disease rather than cause  it, and monounsaturated fat has been among the possible candidates. A study  examining it was published in last week's New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Some studies have suggested that foods high in monounsaturated fat, such as  olive oil, actually might lower blood cholesterol levels. But the new work  found that while monounsaturated fats don't raise cholesterol, they don't seem  to lower it significantly.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The first day of the new equity account brought a calmer session in the derivatives sector, with reduced volume in the traded options and futures trading in a tight range, writes Joel Kibazo. Aggressive buying at the opening of the session saw the March contract on the FT-SE 100 advance strongly to 3,439. This turned out to be the day's peak for the early interest soon waned leaving the contract to drift lower by mid-morning, pulling the underlying cash market lower. March traded in a 20 point range for the next few hours before a disappointing Wall Street brought further selling of the contract. It finished at 3,415, down 10 on Friday's close and at a two-point discount to its fair value premium to cash which fell to 5 points on this account. Volume at 10,497 lots was down on recent levels. Turnover in traded options also fell back sharply closing at 42,559 contracts against 57,439 trades on Friday. That sharp decline in the total was in part brought about by reduced business in the FT-SE 100 options which saw volume of only 11,041 contracts. Friday's turnover in the FT-SE 100 options had been a healthy 23,233 lots. However active trading was seen in the Euro FT-SE 100 option in which 6,244 lots were dealt. Dealers said a single house had bought the 'call spread' in Asda accounting for the day's volume of 5,764 lots which made it the most actively traded stock option. It was followed by British Gas at 2,295 contracts. Some 2,070 lots were dealt in Hanson, and 1,321 in Argyll Group. Other active trades included Tesco, SmithKline Beecham and Commercial Union.</p>

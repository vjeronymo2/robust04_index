			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Wojciech Lamentowicz, political </F> analyst and Union of Labor activist, by correspondent Wojciech  Gielzynski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Gielzynski] The president's strategic objective  is quite clear: a second term of office, to be spent in the two  palaces [the Belweder and the Namiestnikowski Palace]. It is  more difficult to assess the president's recent vigorous moves.  Is he regaining his good form, or is he becoming nervous?    [Lamentowicz] These moves were ineffective from the  viewpoint of his objectives, and they also demonstrated that he  could be a possible factor in Poland's destabilization. The  president is throwing a monkey wrench into the works of a moving  vehicle. He is trying to interfere with the progress of forces  he can no longer control. And so he is losing. Those among the  public who understand what is going on see his behavior as  desperate attempts to halt processes that are unfavorable from  the viewpoint of Walesa's personal goals: another term in  office as president. He makes these attempts using increasingly  dramatic methods and resorting to very poor style. His image is  increasingly that of an ineffectual and tragicomic politician  because he cannot understand that he is losing and behaves as if  he were winning.    [Gielzynski] But, recently, he seems to have regained a part  of his old support force--that is, Solidarity.    [Lamentowicz] I do not think so. Walesa has distanced  himself from most of the political groups hailing originally  from Solidarity, and they are no longer able to vote for him.  To begin with, he antagonized the center groups and the  Democratic Union, and then he declared war on the right wing's  "useless duds." In turn, the Union of Labor has never felt  inclined to cultivate close relations with him. Ours is the  only political group that has never sent him birthday wishes in  any form. We decided that the president's birthday is his  private affair and pointed out that he does not send us birthday  greetings, either. Moreover, ours is the only group that did  not take part in the ceremonial signing of the concordat  agreement.    [Gielzynski] Even so, Walesa still has some fragments of  political support from such groups as the Nonparty Bloc in  Support of Reforms.    [Lamentowicz] Yes, he has such fragmentary support, but his  advisers are weakening as a group. He constructed a most  peculiar system of councils, a whole network of them, whose  advice he has always ignored and ignores even now. They are made  up of several hundred people, mostly eminent and respected  figures, who have allowed themselves to be drawn into something  that is a complete fabrication. It is most embarrassing to have  to tell those people that they are involved in a fictitious  undertaking, but, if they had any self-esteem, they would  withdraw from it themselves. As it is, they willingly accept  the status of "ignored advisers." Other people are quite  scandalized about this state of affairs. I believe that someone  who first appoints them to advisory positions and then treats  them so perfunctorily does not deserve any trust himself. The  creation of that fictitious advisory system is one of Walesa's  fundamental mistakes.    [Gielzynski] But there is also a narrow circle of Walesa's  true advisers.    [Lamentowicz] Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that it  has a rather poor reputation--deservedly poor. Walesa's real  advisers, with whom he works closely, are people who are  decidedly uninteresting and without any good ideas.    [Gielzynski] So, do the fictitious advisers have good  ideas then?    [Lamentowicz] Perhaps if Walesa had listened to their  counsel more often, he would have avoided making many mistakes.  What they suggested to him was often completely different from  what he actually did. Moreover, Walesa's further mistake is  that he introduced a method of ruling through his "personal  court." In any democracy, particularly one that has only just  been formed and is still very young, when people are highly  sensitive to the need to respect its principles, the development  of a "courtly rule" mechanism, with an emperorlike figure at its  center, is completely disgraceful. It is tantamount to sneering  at people's good judgment and common sense. What Walesa has  done with the Belweder Palace is a sin against tradition and  against democracy. Even Pilsudski did not drag the Belweder, as  a national institution, so low that it was derided as a place of  ridicule. Pilsudski may have been criticized for many valid  reasons, but he did retain the dignity of his office. No one  could ever have thought of him as a political clown.    [Gielzynski] Do you not think that now Walesa has even lost  his ability to apply his "shorthand" style in speech and his  colorful way of expressing his thoughts in brilliantly pithy  phrases such as "I am for it, and even against it," an ability  that is, after all, the quintessence of diplomacy?    [Lamentowicz] The president still has such stylistic  leanings because he is incapable of speaking in precise terms.  However, that is not his gravest offense. In 1980, he also  spoke in his characteristic style, but he was serious then.    [Gielzynski] Then he had both his charisma and his  intuition....    [Lamentowicz] Exactly--and also people who worked with him  and were not ignored or ridiculed by him for protecting and  defending him as their leader. Walesa appears to be incapable  of appreciating the truth that politics is a team game that must  be played in tandem with groups of people representing larger  sections of the public who choose to hold the same kind of  views. He seemingly no longer understands that politics is made  together with people, not above their heads. Instead, he is  still given to thinking up fanciful concepts such as giving each  citizen 100 or 300 million zlotys, "sending certain people home  in their socks," "devising a master plan," and so on. In  Walesa's mind, such concepts seem to replace the need to do some  solid thinking in terms of programs. Today, even the least  critical observers can see for themselves that these are just  empty phrases, that there is nothing behind them but an ambition  to hang on to his position at the Belweder or the  Namiestnikowski [Regent's] Palace. The latter name seems  symbolic indeed because Walesa is given to parading in office  rather than discharging a public office. However, this is not  going to last for very long now.</p>

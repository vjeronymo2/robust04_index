			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with unidentified member of </F> the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, by staff reporter  Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): "Undermining Talks by  Interfering in Internal Affairs -- How Did the British Side Drop  a Hint Foreshadowing the Breakdown of Sino-British Talks?"]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb -- This reporter interviewed a  member of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] who was attending  a meeting of the committee's political affairs group here. When  talking about the White Paper -- "Representative Government in  Hong Kong" -- he pointed out: The British side's "White Paper"  asserts that it explains the process of the Sino-British talks  on Hong Kong's institutional structure, but it actually distorts  the facts and juggles black and white. Despite all this, people  may discover from the White Paper that during the talks the  British side repeatedly and seriously interfered in China's  internal affairs, with the aim of achieving its inglorious  purpose of undermining the talks.  <H3>  It Asked for Discussions on Candidates for the Preparatory  Committee </H3>   This member cited an example by saying: The British side  said that during the first stage of the talks, it sought three  guarantees from the Chinese side. What were these three  guarantees? First, the British side asked the Chinese side to  guarantee that both sides would discuss the candidates for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [SAR]. As everyone is aware, the Preparatory Committee  is a special organization formed by the National People's  Congress [NPC] for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR in  1997. How can the formation of this organization be discussed  by the Chinese and British sides? Is this not brazenly  interfering in China's internal affairs? The British side took  the Airport Advisory Commission for comparison. These two  issues cannot be compared at all. He added: As we all know,  Hong Kong's new airport project will straddle 1997 and involve  the SAR's interests. Therefore the British side must consult  with the Chinese side on this issue. The formation of the  Airport Advisory Commission was raised by the Chinese side, the  purpose being to obtain the Hong Kong people's participation and  supervision. This member continued: If the construction of the  new airport could have been completed before 1997, the Chinese  side would not have interfered in this matter, which is Hong  Kong's internal affair. Since this project straddles 1997 and  requires the SAR to undertake responsibility, it is a matter of  course for the Chinese and British sides to consult the  candidates for the Airport Advisory Commission. The British  side asked the Chinese side for consultations on a matter that  cannot be compared with the appointment of candidates for the  Airport Advisory Commission and has absolutely nothing to do  with British internal affairs after 1997. Obviously, the  British side intentionally laid an ambush for the Sino-British  talks so that the talks finally would break down.  <H3>  It Attempted To Participate in the Appointment of the Chief  Executive </H3>   Second, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee  that it would support Hong Kong's general election in the year  2007. Obviously, this is interfering in China's internal  affairs. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, ratified by the  NPC, provides explicit stipulations on the electoral system to  be practiced by Hong Kong in the year 2007, and it also has  formulated complete procedures selected and decided on by Hong  Kong people. Obviously, this is an internal affair of the Hong  Kong SAR. Even the central government cannot interfere in it.  How could the British side ask the Chinese side to express its  stand? If the Chinese side had expressed its stand, the central  government might as well interfere in the SAR's internal affairs  in the future. The central government absolutely will not  interfere in anything within the SAR's autonomy, nor will it  allow the British side to interfere in the SAR's internal  affairs, or to determine the orientation and timetable of the  SAR's future democratic development. All these should proceed  according to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law.    Third, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee  that the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR's first chief  executive would remain the same committee for the election of  some members for the British Hong Kong Government's last  Legislative Council in 1995. This is extremely ridiculous. The  NPC already has provided a number of principled stipulations on  the formation of the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR  chief executive. The detailed provisions in this respect will  be formulated by the SAR Preparatory Committee, which will be  responsible for the formation of the electoral committee. The  electoral committee will be established by the Preparatory  Committee, and the person to be elected will be the chief  executive of the Hong Kong SAR. What has it got to do with the  British? What has it got to do with the electoral committee for  the election of some members for the last not interfering in  China's internal affairs?   <H5>    The British Side's Tricks Are Held in Contempt by the People </H5>   This member said: After Jiang Enzhu provided a briefing on  Hong Kong's 1995 electoral arrangements, many members strongly  hoped that the details of the talks could be published so that  the Hong Kong people would know the truth. In the meantime,  they greatly despised the British side for brazenly announcing  the details of the talks in the form of a white paper.    This member said that many members have understood the  following point after the British side's publication of the  White Paper: The British side had no intention at all of  reaching an agreement through negotiations. From the very  beginning, it placed obstacles and laid an ambush for the talks  so they would fail in the end, and it prepared excuses so it  could blame the Chinese side when the talks broke down. From  the several examples we have cited above, we know that the  British side even resorted to interfering in others' internal  affairs in undermining the talks -- a most despicable practice  in international relations. Is it not all too clear where lies  its sincerity on the question of maintaining Hong Kong's  prosperity, stability, and smooth transition?</p>

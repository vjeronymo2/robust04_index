			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Christies cuts dividend as profits slump CHRISTIES International, the auctioneer, slashed its final dividend after pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 43.1m to Pounds 6.4m in 1991. The shares fell 12p to 115p. The final dividend is set at 1p, down from 6p, to give a total of 3.3p (8.3p). Even so it was not covered by earnings per share of 2.12p (14.43p). Christies had to extract Pounds 2.1m from reserves (retained profit of Pounds 10.5m) to help meet the dividend cost. The group said the dividend payment 'should be the base for dividends for the future'. The dividend had risen sharply in the late 1980s when the art market saw a series of high-priced sales - such as Van Gogh's Sunflowers - and the group's pre-tax profits reached Pounds 66.9m in 1989. Mr Christopher Davidge, managing director, said that Christies planned to revert to a one third/two thirds split between the interim and final dividend. Mr Davidge said he thought the art market had now bottomed out. Pre-tax profits in the second half were Pounds 3.4m compared to Pounds 3.1m in the second half of 1990 and Pounds 3m in the first half of 1991. Christies' share of the market, which it splits with Sotheby's, had risen to 48 per cent, its highest level since the mid-1950s. Mr Davidge said that traditionally Christies did better under Labour governments than Conservative ones. He said that a sale next month, when Hans Holbein's A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling is to be auctioned with paintings by Rembrandt, Canaletto and others, was important for the first half of the current year. Sales in 1991 totalled Pounds 583m, slightly over half the Pounds 1.11bn of 1990, and group turnover fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 168.2m). Mr Davidge said that the drop was mainly the result of falling sales of impressionist and contemporary pictures. These had made up 44 per cent of sales in 1990 but only 19 per cent in 1991. Other areas, such as old masters, prints and drawings, furniture, silver and books, had shown 'healthy increases' in sales. Costs had been cut too, with auction and print costs down 27 per cent to Pounds 64m and administrative expenses down 17 per cent to Pounds 37.2m. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 4.9m, as the group's cash balances were run down, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 9.1m. The cash inflow was insufficient to cover the outflow for tax, dividends, capital expenditure and working capital. See Lex</p>

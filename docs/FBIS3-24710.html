The latest is in Bong County between Charles Taylor's  NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and yet another  anti-Taylor armed group. Once again it seems the civilian  population are getting the worst of it. From Monrovia,  Niinartey Allison telexed this report:    Hundreds of panic-stricken people are fleeing from the  renewed fighting in Lower Bong County. They are moving south  toward Kakata and Harbel. A broadcast on NPFL-controlled radio  on Sunday [23 January] confirmed the fighting. Another  broadcast this morning by Charles Taylor called on ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] to immediately deploy troops in the area. Relief  officials here said today that about 9,000 people have fled the  fighting around (Killer Bay) and Sonoya. Some residents of  Sonoya, who arrived in Harbel at the weekend, said the fighting  is still continuing. They said the fighting was between the  NPFL and the new armed group called the Bong Resistance Movement.    They explained that a good number of people are fleeing  areas  around the Salala Rubber Plantations, Jibi, German Camp, and  Bolola. One eyewitness, Martha Togber, explained how she was  forced to leave behind her 80-year-old mother as the sound of  gunfire came closer to her house.    Meanwhile, Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement  for Democracy in Liberian] movement has imposed a dusk-to-dawn  curfew on Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, as a result of the  refugee influx there.</p>

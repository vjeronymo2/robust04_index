			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In January 1991, the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) published a revision to their ``Cargo Tank Maintenance Manual'' which included a table of minimum thicknesses for U.S. steel gauges ranging from 3 through 30. The accompanying narrative stated that the basic information was ``provided by DOT.'' A table, contained in &sect;173.24(c)(2) of the 1990 edition of the HMR was cited for gauges 12 through 30 with extrapolation being used to complete the other gauges. The values presented in that table were intended for relatively severe cold-working operations such as those experienced in forming the top and bottom chimes of steel drums, not for cargo tank construction. However, since adopting 49 CFR 180 Subpart E_Qualification and Maintenance of Cargo Tanks, the values published in the NTTC manual have been used for thickness testing as required by &sect;180.407(i). In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to add a new paragraph (i)(5) containing a minimum thickness table for steel and aluminum for the sizes of sheet and plate which have been authorized for MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 heads and shells. The way in which minimum thickness has been set forth over the years has varied. For example, steel thicknesses generally have been expressed in terms of U.S. Standard Gauge (USSG), but, in the case of the MC 303 specification, both USSG values and decimal values were used. Thickness values for aluminum more often have been expressed in decimals. However, in the case of the MC 302 specification, both USSG values and decimal values were tabulated; and in the case of the MC 304 specification, the values for aluminum were required to be calculated by multiplying the USSG values listed for mild steel by a factor of 1.44.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TTMA suggested several changes to the table for clarity. TTMA also recommended that the table be divided into two separate tables: one for steel and one for aluminum. RSPA agrees with TTMA's recommendation. Therefore, in this final rule, current paragraphs (i)(5) through (1)(7) are redesignated as paragraphs (i)(6) through (i)(8), and a new paragraph (i)(5) containing two minimum thickness tables has been added. The tables include all thicknesses found in the eleven specifications cited above, plus USSG number 7 which has been used by a number of manufacturers. For steel, nominal thicknesses range from USSG number 19 to 3/8 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; plate; for aluminum, nominal thicknesses range from 0.078 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; to 0.540 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 180.413 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA proposed to revise requirements on the repair, modification, stretching or rebarrelling of cargo tanks. A commenter requested a revision to the record requirements contained in proposed paragraph (b) to require that the National Board ``R&hyph;1'' report be completed for all repairs on ASME Code stamped cargo tanks. The commenter stated that completing the document will ensure that the repair and method of repair conforms to the National Board Inspection Code and is approved by an Authorized Inspector. RSPA believes this revision is unnecessary because &sect;180.413 requires that any repair or modification involving welding on the tank head must be certified by a Registered Inspector, and that any repair or modification to an ASME Code ``U'' stamped cargo tank must be in accordance with the National Board Inspection Code. The National Board requires the use of the ``R&hyph;1'' forms for repairs and modifications. Therefore, this commenter's recommendation is not adopted in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA proposed to require that any repair, modification, stretching or rebarrelling of an ASME Code-stamped cargo tank must be performed by a repair facility holding a National Board ``R'' stamp. The National Board allows a facility other than a National Board ``R'' stamp holder to make repairs and modifications to ASME Code cargo tanks when authorized within a governmental jurisdiction. Jurisdictional authorization is only recognized within state boundaries where the repair facility is located. Therefore, because most cargo tank motor vehicles are operated in interstate commerce, RSPA has adopted the proposal requiring repairs on DOT specification cargo tanks certified to the ASME Code to be performed only by a facility holding a valid ``R'' stamp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Conception. In addition, the EA notes that Jones and Swartz (1990) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  documented gray whale occurrence around the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary during January 1986 and 1987 via aerial surveys and that most gray whales (78 percent of cow-calf pairs and 94 percent of all other whales) were within 3 nm (5.6 km) of the islands. Animals classified by researchers as ``calves of the season'' comprised nearly 12 percent of the raw counts. Ninety-four percent of the cow-calf pairs were seen east of Santa Rosa Island. It should also be noted that pregnant gray whales are in the vanguard of the south-bound migration and, because they give birth from January to mid-February in and near the lagoons in Baja California, should have migrated south through the SCB by February, the time of the proposed testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Forney, K.A. and J.

Another had similar concerns regarding the Steller sea lion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Navy made a determination not to request an incidental take authorization for Guadalupe fur seals and Steller sea lions because their population sizes in the SCB (one to five fur seals and 100 sea lions) were low and that mitigation measures would likely detect these species if an individual was there. In the event a Guadalupe fur seal or a Steller sea lion is taken, such taking would be in violation of the MMPA (and the LOA). Alternatively, if one is seen in the area prior to the test but not taken because the test is delayed until the animal leaves, then the Navy may elect to request an amendment to its LOA and the authorizing regulations for future tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Noise in the Ocean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended NMFS implement regulations to limit decibel levels from all human activity in the marine environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Such a proposal is outside the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Outer Sea Test Range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters were concerned over the choice of the OSTR because of its proximity to the Channel Islands. Many were concerned that alternative sites to the OSTR had not been adequately explored. One commenter believed the test site should be moved another 100 nm west, another that the test area should be limited to south of 33 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;27 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;N. latitude, while another was concerned that utilizing the southern and western extremities of the OSTR would put the test near the San Juan Seamount, an area of high primary and fish productivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EA listed the criteria that the Navy established for locating ship shock trials. Refer to that document for a list of these criteria. However, it should be recognized that the Pacific Missile Range is an oceanic area designated for military activities since it was established by the Department of Defense in 1946. According to the Navy, the OSTR has been used for ship shock trials since 1990. The only other West Coast site where ship shock trials of this magnitude have been conducted is within a military operations area east of San Clemente Island. However, since 1990, environmental concerns and the large number of fleet operations (greater than 200,000 per year), preclude the use of this area for ship shock trials. Thus, this alternative was eliminated from further consideration by the Navy. For a discussion on utilizing portions of the OSTR, refer to similar concerns under ``National Environmental Policy Act Concerns'' above and ``Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Concerns'' below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should also be noted that the San Juan Seamount is approximately 12 nm west of the western boundary of the OSTR. Because the 2-nm safety zone will be within the OSTR, at a minimum, the test site will be 14 nm from the eastern slope of the seamount. The Navy believes, and NMFS concurs, that there will be little or no impact on the resources of the seamount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned about the impact of duds and projectiles that sink to the bottom and either explode later or at a greater depth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the ship shock trials, the explosive is not allowed to free fall through the water column but is towed to the site, armed, buoyed at the appropriate depth (125 ft (38 m) or 200 ft (61 m) depending upon the charge weight) and detonated. Unexploded ordnance is towed to a deep-water site for safe disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

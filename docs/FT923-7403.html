			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UN backs S Africa observers THE UN Security Council last night approved unanimously a resolution to send observers to South Africa 'as a matter of urgency' to help calm the situation there. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had recommended deploying 30 observers following a report 10 days ago by Mr Cyrus Vance, his special envoy to South Africa. Several third world members felt the number was too small and called for up to 400 observers. However, states which will have to bear much of the cost rejected that number and the resolution left it to Mr Boutros Ghali to deploy the team 'in such a manner and in such numbers as he determines necessary' to do the job. Officials said 50 observers might be a reasonable compromise. International organisations - such as the Commonwealth, European Community and Organisation for African Unity - were invited to deploy their own observers in co-ordination with the UN. The exercise would be linked to the year-old National Peace Accord. The South African government, which readily accepted the Vance mission and the deployment of a small number of UN observers during recent mass demonstrations, is not expected to oppose the Council's decision.</p>

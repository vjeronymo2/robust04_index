			<p>BFN     [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has decided to call off  negotiations with the Northern League. The meeting scheduled to  take place tomorrow has been postponed.    "From today, the leader of Forza Italia said during the  course of a news conference, we will go neither to the Northern  League nor to any other side. We will await the decision of  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who is scheduled to appoint the  next prime minister, and we will be at his disposal in order to  form a new government."</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe bond prices surge - Italy and Spain out-perform market THE German rate cut yesterday was seen as a turning point for European bond prices which surged on hopes that European interest rates had peaked. The Bundesbank move, which followed Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation of the lira, appeared to have mitigated fears of a No vote in French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Italian and Spanish bond prices out-performed the rest of Europe, ending 2 percentage points higher. Prices of UK gilts and Ecu bonds gained 1 1/2 points, while 10-year French and German government bonds lost some earlier gains to end a point higher. 'The market believes that the down cycle in German interest rates has started,' said Mr George Magnus, a director of fixed-interest research at SG Warburg Securities. Although a No vote in the French referendum would test the markets severely, the apparent peaking of European interest rates, three months' ahead of most analysts' expectations, should help to underpin Europe's bond markets. 'The main problem has been to plough ahead (with European monetary union) in a climate of slow growth in Europe, with high German interest rates,' said Mr Jeremy Yeats-Edwards, a senior portfolio manager of Baring's international bond fund. With some of the interest rate pressure alleviated, a No vote 'does not have quite the same seriousness'. However, it remains to be seen how quickly hopes of further drops in European interest rates are realised. 'This may be the start of a new interest cycle, but the question is how long it will be before the next easing (in German rates),' said Mr Adam Greshin, assistant portfolio manager of Scudder's international bond fund. The German bond market may be the safest European market, in the run-up to the French referendum. With that hurdle still to be cleared, some analysts said that higher-yielding markets should still be treated with some caution. Following the latest gains, a Yes vote is substantially priced into the market, reducing the chances of a massive rally next week if the French ratify the Maastricht treaty. Furthermore, investors might decide that the potential gains in higher-yielding markets do not outweigh the greater degree of risk, such as a further devaluation of the lira. Despite a 1 1/2 point recovery yesterday, there are no signs of any return to favour for the Ecu bond market, where liquidity has dried up since the Danish referendum on June 2. 'If there is a No vote, the Ecu may never be a single European currency,' one trader said. 'There will have to be a substantial Yes vote to attract investors back.' However, a number of trading houses have been investing heavily in high-yielding bonds. Yesterday's rally encouraged expectations of a Yes vote, and, with some heavy losses to recoup since the Danish referendum, some traders are taking a 'double or quits' view of the referendum.</p>

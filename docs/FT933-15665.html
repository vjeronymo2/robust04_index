			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US guidance bemuses Italy THE ITALIAN press made a meal yesterday of the Clinton administration's spectacular ignorance of Italy's representatives at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. This followed the discovery by reporters covering the summit that the US guidance kits indicated Italy would be represented by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro - 'to be pronounced Skalfaroh.' The Italian president, who constitutionally has no executive authority, never attends such meetings. Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister and its representative at the summit, was absent from the US guidance. So was Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister and Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign minister. The guidance kit also included a curriculum vitae of Mr Franco Gallo, the finance minister, one of two junior ministers in the three-man government economic team. Mr Gallo was in Rome yesterday and had never been expected to go to Tokyo. A final curious error. The US hand-out stated that President Scalfaro was the godfather of Mr Bruno Trentin, the leader of the main trade union confederation, CGIL. About the only thing the two men have in common is the Italian language.</p>

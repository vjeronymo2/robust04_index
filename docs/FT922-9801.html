			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo sells peripheral interests Lasmo, the independent oil and gas explorer, has sold its US upstream interests and Ultramar's Australian exploration blocks for about Dollars 78m (Pounds 44m) as part of a rationalisation plan. The company acquired Ultramar in a Pounds 1.4bn takeover last year and said then that it would streamline the operations by selling its peripheral interests. Most of the US business has been sold to Torch Energy and other purchasers for Dollars 72m. The sale excluded its interest in the Bright Star Gas Gathering system in east Texas and the Willow Bayou gas discovery in Louisiana, on which two new wells will be drilled later this year. Ultramar's Australian interests, including the Katnook gas field, were sold to Sagasco Resources for ADollars 8m (Pounds 3.4m). Lasmo said it continues to explore for oil in Western Australia and in particular on the north west shelf.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: National Grid meets forecasts with 32% rise NATIONAL GRID Holding, the transmission company owned jointly by the English and Welsh regional electricity companies, yesterday fulfilled expectations to report a 32 per cent increase in profits. Current cost pre-tax profits for the year to end-March rose from Pounds 237.8m to Pounds 314.5m on turnover which increased 15 per cent to Pounds 1.32bn. The 12 regional electricity companies each own between 5.4 and 12.5 per cent of National Grid Holding, which owns the National Grid Company. They will receive total dividends of Pounds 117m, an increase of 12 per cent. Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said revenues were boosted by the recovery of a Pounds 47.6m shortfall in allocated transmission revenue in the previous year in accordance with the price control formula operated by Offer, the industry regulator. However, operating costs had risen as the result of higher depreciation charges, following the decision to replace some fixed assets before they had completed their technical lives, and additional provisions arising from reorganisation and restructuring of the business. Capital expenditure increased by almost Pounds 90m to Pounds 363.1m, and was expected to remain at a similar level over the next few years. Net interest charges were Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 79m). Gearing fell from 63 per cent to 42 per cent. Mr Jefferies said it was 'both significant and pleasing' that non-regulated businesses, including generation, accounted for almost 20 per cent of profits, up from 13 per cent the previous year. Some savings had been achieved by a net reduction of 634 in the workforce, to below 5,900. Staffing in the core transmission business was likely to fall by another 10 per cent over the next two or three years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Criminal Act Against Sovereignty of the Republic of </F> Albania and Stability in the Balkans -- Statement of the  Government of the Republic of Albania" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- On April 11, the  Government of the Republic of Albania launched the following  statement:    Regarding the April 10, 1994 incident, with a commando made  up of 6-7 Greek-speaking persons in Greek Army uniform, attacked  a training center of Albanian recruits about four kilometres  deep in the Albanian territory, killing the soldier on guard,  Arsen Gjini, age 20, and the first captain, Fatmir Shehu, age  34, opening fire against the recruits asleep wounding three of  them, Eduard Vermishi, Frederik Kalemi and Janaq Xega, and  lightly wounding many others before fleeing and pursued by the  forces of order. The traces of the commando led to the Greek  border point of Argjirohor. The government of the Republic of  Albania expresses its deep indignation against this hostile act,  which is a direct attack against the sovereignty and integrity  of our Republic.    The Albanian Government notes that the April 10, 1994  massacre is the gravest incident in the series of incidents  provoked by the Greek Armed Forces, such as the violation of the  Albanian territorial waters by Greek warships, which opened fire  on January 4 and 10, 1994, by a Greek minesweeper on March 10  1994, the killing of the Albanian citizen, Alfred Muco on March  21, 1994 by Greek Armed Forces on patrol in the vicinity of  Kosturi after detaining him, and other incidents taking place  during this year alone. All these have been doubled with an  anti-Albanian propaganda by the radio stations installed in  northern Greece, which testify to territorial claims by Greek  chauvinistic circles against Albania.    The policy of the terrorist acts and massacres conforms the  Greek new policy of defence which, as it is declared, extends  from Cyprus to the so-called "Northern Epirus", as Athens calls  southern Albania. Let us mention here the frequent statements  with territorial claims towards Albania by Greek Government  members and high politicians such as those by former Premier  Mitsotakis, who, on July 14, 1993 speaks of north Epirus'  annexation by the Albanian state in 1913, that by the government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who in October 1993 considers  Albania as the Greek Northern Epirus, the statement by the  minister of the presidency Kuvellos, who on August 10, 1992 in  the stadium of Athens publicly speaks of Himara as an  "unliberated" land, or the statement of the leader of the  current opposition Miltiadhis Evert, who goes so far as to say  in January 1994 that Northern Epirus is northern Greece.    The Balkans and Europe know well the policy and morale of  the  Greek bands. Many a time, in the first half of this century,  Greek armed units have penetrated into the Albanian territory,  committing massacres, setting fires, and carrying out  destructions and many other terrorist acts. The Albanians will  forget neither the massacres of the Greek army and pre-military  bands of General Damianos, Colonel Santos-Vardas, Sub-lieutenant  Stratos, Captain Cyprus and others in the years 1912-1914 in the  Korce-Kolonje region, nor the massacres and barbarisms of  Deljanaqi in 1913 and of Zerve in 1944 for the ethnic cleansing  of the Albanian population of Cameria. The Albanians will also  not forget the fact that even today, the Greek Government  refuses to recognise the Protocol of Florence on the southern  borders of Albania.    Following the same policy also in the present days is both  strange and shameful in this century end, especially now that  the European Union has bestowed its presidency on Athens. The  Greek authorities, instead of working for the consolidation of  bridges of friendship and cooperation with the neighbours and  stability of the tense region of the balkans, they are imposing  blockade against Macedonia, setting up and training terrorist  bands and organizing terrorism against Albania. Such a policy,  which intends to create facilities to the allies, Serbian  aggressors, is also embodied in the exchange of visits and  meetings in Athens, Belgrade and Pale, as well as in the  statements by the Serbian criminals that "only the God in heaven  and the Greeks on earth are our allies".    The statements of the Greek officials that Greece is "a  factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkan region" do  not respond the reality. Regarding the April 10, 1994 massacre,  the spokesman of the Greek Government, not only does not express  regret for the victims, but voices no commitment on the part of  his government to find out and punish the authors of this  massacre, who after committing the criminal act, left in the  direction of the Greek border point. On the contrary, he tries  to invent nonexistent contradictions in the note of the Albanian  Government.    On its part, the Albanian Government will undertake steps to  react with determination against any hostile act against  Albania, as well as reserves the right to undertake the  necessary measures in response to this policy of provocation.</p>

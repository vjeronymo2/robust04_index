In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th said the Davos  document is considered to be an integrated deal, stressing that  the Palestinian party will not commit itself to implementing its  obligations in the document unless the Israelis implement the  articles relating to them.    Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli meetings  were scheduled to continue in Cairo after the 'Arafat-Peres  meeting in Davos but the Israeli party suspended them until  after 'Arafat and Peres meet in Cairo. He noted that the  Palestinian-Israeli committee meetings are expected to resume in  Cairo directly after the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in Cairo.    Dr. Sha'th highlighted that the Palestinian party can  perform  its tasks in running the self-rule administration in the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho area immediately after the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    MENA has learned that differences occurred between Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  over the Davos document. Palestinian sources told MENA that the  main dispute within the Israeli leadership focuses mainly on who  should take the credit for achieving tangible results and  reaching an agreement with the Palestinian party.</p>

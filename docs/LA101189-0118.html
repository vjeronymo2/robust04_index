			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> A GLOBAL ANSWER TO LOCAL ISSUES  </P> <P> Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston offered a global answer to some of Orange  County's most pressing local problems Tuesday, suggesting that reforms in the  Soviet Union might translate into new highways, trauma centers and city police  officers in California.  </P> <P> In a daylong, campaign-style tour of Orange County, Cranston reminded his  audiences that the federal government can't pay for such local needs right now  because it is broke. But, he said, it could find more money in its defense  budget if it can cut back on the weaponry aimed at the Soviet Union in light of  the radical changes recently throughout the Communist world.  </P> <P> "We don't have the enemy in the Soviet Union we thought we had," he told a  group of developers and housing officials meeting in Santa Ana to discuss the  homeless crisis. "Yet we are spending $300 billion a year on the military  budget -- $200 billion of it because of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> The changes in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, China and the Soviet Union "could  free up untold tens of billions of dollars for the things you need," Cranston  told another audience of the county's top transportation experts in Irvine.  "That is my main focus in the Senate -- to bring that about primarily for the  things you need."  </P> <P> Cranston's day was billed as a education session for the senator, a chance for  him to talk with local leaders and community groups about their most difficult  problems and how the government might help. The senator made similar trips this  week through Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Cranston talked about offshore oil with city officials in  Laguna Beach, about trauma care with doctors at UCI Medical Center, and got  into a lively public session on drugs at a church hall in Anaheim packed with  more than 400 people.  </P> <P> Cranston's audiences received his suggestion about reducing the defense budget  cordially. But in Anaheim, there were raw nerves about the government's  reaction to the drug problem and catcalls over Cran aston's idea to generate  money from defense.  </P> <P> One 36-year Anaheim resident told Cranston that he feared he would have to move  because of the problem. Then he quoted from an exhibit at Disneyland in which a  robot of President Abraham Lincoln "states that America is only going to be  destroyed by itself. This drug epidemic is going to destroy it," the man said.  </P> <P> In Laguna Beach, Cranston also pledged to local officials that he will join  their effort to preserve the area's beautiful coastline.  </P> <P> At the Laguna Beach Hotel, with his back to a panoramic view of the crashing  surf, Mayor Robert F. Gentry intrigued Cranston with a suggestion that the  ocean between Orange County and Catalina be made into a national park,  protecting it from offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> Cranston, who called Laguna Beach "one of the most beautiful places in  California," said later that he will investigate the idea. He also promised to  explore the possibility of preventing the development of Laguna Canyon, the  site of Orange County's most emotional showdown between builders and  environmentalists.  </P> <P> Cranston, who authored legislation leading to the preservation of several  hundred acres in nearby Crystal Cove, said he wasn't certain the federal  government could do anything to prevent the development. But he said, "I think  it would be nice if it could be saved." DAVE LESHER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jun--Local government in cities has  slipped out of control of the SLD-PSL [Democratic Left  Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] ruling coalition. But, at the  same time, no one has gained a decisive victory, Adam Michnik  writes in GAZETA WYBORCZA, adding that almost nowhere will the  individual parties be able to manage single-handed.    Three large blocs have formed in the cities: the SLD, the  Freedom Union [UW], and right-wing coalitions. Who will enter  into which setups with whom, the GAZETA WYBORCZA editor wonders,  expressing the view that it depends only on the UW whether it  can find the best partners in the other blocs because it is only  the UW that is in the position to talk to both the SLD and the  right-wing parties.    Specific issues and pragmatism and, consequently, rational  programs and real abilities must outweigh ideological arguments,  Michnik writes in his commentary on the results of the local  government elections.</p>

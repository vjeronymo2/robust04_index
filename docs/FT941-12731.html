			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant Christmas sales at Farepak Farepak, the mail order supplier of Christmas hampers, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in sales over the festive season. The statement accompanied news of an increased deficit of Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 1.39m) pre-tax in the first half to October 31. Turnover fell marginally to Pounds 8.08m (Pounds 8.11m), primarily due to a later distribution schedule for mail order giftware, which will be booked in the second half. Farepak has a highly seasonal business, with profits coming through during the Christmas period. Mr Bob Johnson, chairman, said: 'We are confident that the full year will show good growth'. The company purchased the Littlewoods hamper business and access to its substantial mail order database, the second largest in the UK, for Pounds 8.5m in April last year. Benefits are expected to come through in the year to April 1995 as it increases marketing and secures synergies with its existing mail order hamper business. The company has expanded its manufacturing base with a new plant in Swindon and has seen increased orders for its wholesale food processing business. The interim dividend goes up 12 per cent to 1.85p (1.65p).</p>

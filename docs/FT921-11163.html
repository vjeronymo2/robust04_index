			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Croydon goes from boom to blackspot CROYDON, the south London area that reaped the rewards of the 1980s boom years, has become the national blackspot for house repossessions, according to statistics issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department this week. Croydon County Court issued 2,306 repossession orders last year, the highest figure in England and a rise of more than 1,000 on 1990. Direct comparisons with other areas are distorted because Croydon County Court has a larger area under its jurisdiction than many county courts, extending beyond the borough boundaries. Housing professionals in the area, however, acknowledge that Croydon has a particular difficulty. In the mid 1980s it was a magnet for businesses relocating outside central London and for first-time home buyers seeking affordable homes within commuting distance of the City. In 1988 a local chamber of commerce survey discovered that businesses in Croydon needed 35,000 people to fill planned or actual job vacancies. Now the borough has an unemployment rate of 8 per cent. Last year the borough council registered 1,400 homeless families as in priority need of local-authority housing. Of those families, 610 were made homeless through repossession, compared with 80 in 1988. Three main factors may explain why Croydon has been worse affected than the rest of the south-east: comparatively low property prices; local employment biased towards the depressed financial and retail sectors; and many small businesses set up with loans secured on property. Mr Dave Brown, Croydon council's assistant director of housing, said: 'I suspect it is to do with the fact that house prices are relatively low and therefore it was an area where people who were able to get into owner-occupation bought.' When mortgage payments became too much, first-time buyers were unable to sell and trade down because they had already bought the cheapest available property, he said. Mr Peter Broderick, chief executive of Croydon chamber of commerce and industry, said: 'Almost every company in Croydon has looked again at its manpower levels and has shed staff. We don't expect all the jobs which have gone to be replaced when things get better.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the  Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [KSDP]  in a statement Friday declared that the Pyongyang tour of Yi  Ki-taek, president of the South Korean opposition Democratic  Party, must be realised unconditionally and no one must block it.    "At a time when the inter-Korean relations have reached an  impasse, the visit of the president of a South Korean opposition  party to Pyongyang will be a particularly meaningful one," he  noted, and went on:    "If the visit of Yi Ki-taek to Pyongyang is realized, it  will, no doubt, be beneficial to removing the danger of a  nuclear war created on the Korean peninsula and finding the way  of peace and reunification of the country by joint efforts of  the nation. It will not be harmful either to the North or to  the South.    "Yet the traitor Kim Yong-sam is opposing and blocking his  trip to the North, arguing that it `is premature' and  `impatience is an anathema'. This is an improper act."    "Kim Yong-sam once gave vent to grievances when his visit to  Pyongyang was blocked by the former military dictatorial regime,  after he expressed the wish as an opposition man. But now,  seated in power, he is keeping the president of an opposition  party from visiting the North. It is the height of perfidy and  treachery."    The spokesman stated that the Korean Social Democratic Party  would make every sincere effort to realise bilateral and  multilateral negotiations between politicians of the North and  the South out of the desire to promote the great unity of the  nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea and social  system, and achieve reunification in the 90s.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Although revamped, given a new name, a new boss and a more traditional look,  the syndicated "USA Today on TV" has been axed by WCBS-TV in New York and will  leave the station at the end of the month. What the program didn't have was a  new time slot in New York. WCBS has always aired it at 2 a.m., and Bob Jacobs,  president of GTG Marketing, which syndicates the show, said he didn't consider  its axing by the station a major worry since "at 2 a.m. it basically was off  the air anyway." He said "only a handful" of stations have dropped the show  since its premiere last fall. It currently is aired by 153 stations, including  KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, where a spokesman said Tuesday "it is doing very well  for us" since its move from KCBS-TV Channel 2 a month ago.

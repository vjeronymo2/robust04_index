			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Spokesmen for the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] have reported  that early this morning unidentified persons dynamited two  antennas the organization was going to use for internal  communication purposes during the presidential elections  scheduled to take place Sunday.    FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal and his aid Marcos Jimenez  said during a news conference that "the destruction of the  antennas" in the central department of San Vicente, 60 km east  of San Salvador, "has put us in a difficult position" for  Sunday's elections. The two FMLN leaders also charged that  militants of the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance  [ARENA] (rightist) have been waging a "dirty war" since  Thursday, the day unidentified persons destroyed opposition  propaganda posters and distributed "counterfeit propaganda."    This Friday, unidentified persons issued death threats  against Francisco Lima, a rich businessman and attorney, who is  the vice presidential candidate of the leftist coalition to  which the FMLN belongs.    Handal reiterated that the FMLN will participate in Sunday's  elections despite these difficulties, because "it has medium-  and long-term objectives, and we do not want to give up the  contest." The leader urged all Salvadorans to go to the polls.  He noted that "it is very important to counterbalance ARENA and  defend the rights of the poor."    The FMLN forms part of the alliance that also includes the  Democratic Convergence and the National Revolutionary Movement  and supports the presidential ticket of Ruben Zamora and  Francisco Lima.</p>

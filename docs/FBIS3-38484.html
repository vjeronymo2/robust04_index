			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Unto Hamalainen: "Unabashed Candidate of the </F> West"]    [Text] "The uppermost impression from the interview with  Elisabeth Rehn is that she is the first Finnish presidential  candidate who unabashedly manifests a Western orientation. There  is nothing strange in itself regarding this. Finland has indeed  always been a Western country, but we have been influenced by  our legacy from the Cold War. We have been constrained by this,"  explained [former Foreign Minister] Max Jacobson.    In his view, Rehn is right in her understanding of the  provisions in the Paris Peace Treaty in that more than just its  military aspect has become obsolete: Finland from the very  beginning never accepted limitations contained in the treaty.  They do not conform to conditions of a democratic country.    In foreign policy, Rehn tightly follows the official line.  She has been a supporter of the European Union, and according to  Jakobson, it is natural for Rehn to say that she will be able to  influence [the conditions] of membership also before the  referendum.</p>

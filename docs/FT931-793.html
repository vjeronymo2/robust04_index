			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Travel: Charmed by Australia's sweet dreamtime - Michael J Woods joins the swagmen in the wild and mystical Flinders Ranges THE SOUTHERN Cross hung between two gum trees just above my feet and appeared so close that it looked more like part of a seafront illumination than a distant constellation of stars. The feathery tops of the gums waved darkly against the lighter sky but the skin-like bark of their trunks gleamed silvery in the moonlight. Bats fluttered overhead but there was no other sound along the dry bed of Arkaba creek bed where I was swagging - sleeping under the stars in my swag, a sleeping bag, pillow and mattress on a sheet of thick canvas. Rolled up, the swag is the bushman's suitcase, indeed his home, and all his possessions are packed inside and tightly strapped to keep out the dust. Creek beds can be dangerous places. A flash flood will bring a wall of water several feet high and carrying great logs and other debris thundering down the water course. In January and February, though, the Flinders are very hot and dry, so the danger comes from fire, not water. At this, the quiet time of year, cooking fires are forbidden. Although a camp without a fire is a featureless place the lack of other visitors more than made up for it, for even in the national parks we hardly saw a soul. The Flinders Ranges, a series of parallel rocky mountain ridges, lie to the north of Adelaide, in South Australia, starting just below Wilmington and running up to Arkaroola, becoming drier and more rugged as they go. About halfway up is Wilpena Pound, South Australia's equivalent - for stunning scenery - to Ayers Rock, in the Northern Territory, and located in the 200,000-acre Flinders Ranges National Park. The Pound is remarkable - an enormous oval bowl surrounded by a high sandstone ridge, precipitous on the outside but sloping gently down to a level floor on the inside. The wall of rock is pierced in only one place, by Wilpena Creek. When rainfall is high, the pound acts as a funnel. The amount of water that hurtles down the creek is enormous, as the tumbled heaps of great tree trunks confirmed. We walked into the bowl and climbed the side past a deserted settlement where a farmer once struggled to survive by growing wheat and raising stock. He was forced to abandon the attempt. Part way up the rocky path, at Wangara Lookout, we stopped. With the magnificent expanse of Wilpena Pound spread below us, Cliff Coulthard, our Aboriginal guide, whose tribal lands cover this area, shared with us the dreaming of his people, which explains the formation of the northern ranges and the pound. In a nutshell, two giant serpents, male and female, trapped and ate 600 of his people who were gathered to carry out initiation rites. In surrounding them, the snakes' bodies shifted the Earth's surface to form the walls of the pound, which finally came to rest with the female's head raised as the highest point, St Mary's Peak, and the male's head lowered, creating Arkaroo Rock. Sitting in the evening sunshine, with the emptiness of the bush around us, it was not difficult to imagine the two huge snakes slithering round the pound and looking over the rim at their captives. These were not the only victims claimed by the pound. In more recent years a local child was lost here and, in spite of intensive searches, only discovered two years later after fire had cleared part of the area. His bones, and the pathetic remains of his shirt tied vainly to a stick, were all that were left. Fred Teague, a man of many parts and the coroner at the time, told us the story when we stopped for a 'yack' (natter) at his Mobil garage in Hawker. In his adjoining shop Fred keeps a small but worthwhile collection of rocks, illustrating the geology of the area, and of Aboriginal artefacts and those of the white settlers who followed. At 80 Fred is a mine of information and has done much to preserve the local Aboriginal rock art, which is particularly rich. The most dramatic is in a small cave at Arkaroo Rock to which we climbed in the cool of an early morning. Cliff explained the symbols drawn by ancient fingers in charcoal and red, yellow and white ochre mixed with emu fat to preserve them. The whole of the Flinders area has a distinctively harsh beauty, dry and rocky with pale yellow grass and scattered trees, native pines and eucalypts in various shades of green. The outcropping rocks give frowns to the rounded buff hillocks while the outer ramparts of the pound appear towering and precipitous. Occasional gorges, such as Bunyeroo, contain gently running streams which are a welcome contrast to the aridity of the surrounding land. The sparkling water and the thriving gums which grow there make these gorges attractive places in which to linger. During the uncomfortably hot time of the day the wildlife sensibly remains in the shade of trees and rocks. Grey kangaroos sit in the semi-gloom and emus flounce off at a reluctant long-limbed trot if disturbed from water, their beaks partly open for the heat, the delicate feathers on their backs bouncing airily at every step. Morning and evening brought more activity - a pair of kangaroos boxing in silhouette against the falling sun; a wedge-tailed eagle perched at the top of Sliding Rock; bats hunting insects in the company of swallows as the night shift took over from the day. A fox crossed the road in front of us. Although the same size as British foxes, it looked much too small and vulnerable to survive in this uncompromising land. Cultural tours, such as Mick Irwin's Beyond Tours (1 Pony Ridge Road, Belair, South Australia 5052, tel: 08-278-1264), with whom Michael Woods travelled to the Flinders Ranges, are comparatively new and enable clients to experience Outback life and obtain a much clearer appreciation of Aboriginal lifestyles than was formerly possible.</p>

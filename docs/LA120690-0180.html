			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOREAN FIRM MAY ATTEMPT TO BUY ORION FILM STUDIO;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD: SAMSUNG GROUP REPORTEDLY HAS A PLAN FOR $300-MILLION BUYOUT,  $500-MILLION CASH INFUSION.  </P> <P> The giant Samsung Group of Korea may become Hollywood's next foreign buyer.  </P> <P> The $35-billion-a-year conglomerate, which has interests in consumer  electronics and other areas, has quietly made inquiries about purchasing Orion  Pictures Corp., according to several individuals familiar with the approach.  </P> <P> Samsung formulated a plan in recent weeks under which it would pay roughly $300  million for the studio, or some part of it, and would provide a cash infusion  of up to $500 million to beef up Orion's sagging movie and television  operations, the individuals said.  </P> <P> It wasn't immediately clear whether the Korean company was interested in  purchasing all of Orion's approximately 22 million outstanding shares or  whether it might simply seek to purchase the 70% stake owned by billionaire  investor John Kluge.  </P> <P> An Orion spokesman declined to comment, and a Samsung spokesman said he wasn't  aware of his company's interest in Orion.  </P> <P> An outright purchase of Orion would put a fifth large film company under  foreign control.  </P> <P> Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a Japanese electronics firm on which  Samsung has long modeled itself, last week agreed to acquire MCA Inc., the  parent of Universal Studios, for $6.59 billion. Columbia Pictures is owned by  Japan's Sony Corp., 20th Century Fox Film Corp. is owned by Australia's News  Corp., and MGM-Pathe Communications Co. is controlled by Italian investor  Giancarlo Parretti.  </P> <P> Orion, plagued by a losing streak at the box office, in October retained  Salomon Bros., a New York investment banking firm, to seek new funds for the  company.  </P> <P> Apparently, Samsung simultaneously began looking for a way to match its  videocassette recorders and other electronic "hardware" with a producer of  entertainment "software," much as Matsushita and Sony have done.  </P> <P> Several people said the Korean company within the last week approached Orion  through the Hollywood law firm of Bloom, Dekom &amp; Hergott, but a partner  with the firm denied any involvement with Samsung.  </P> <P> Seoul-based Samsung is one of Korea's so-called chaebol -- huge, family-run  concerns that often have interests in widely varied businesses.  </P> <P> Founded by Tokyo-educated B. C. Lee in 1938, Samsung was initially a food  export company. It eventually developed huge insurance and electronics  operations, largely through self-conscious imitation of Matsushita and other  Japanese companies.  </P> <P> Fortune magazine identified Samsung earlier this year as the world's  20th-largest industrial concern, with bigger sales than such better-known  companies as Honda, Volkswagen and Boeing. One reason for Samsung's low profile  in the United States has been its practice of supplying televisions, microwave  ovens and VCRs to be sold under brand names owned by Sears, J. C. Penney and  others.  </P> <P> Orion, with $485 million in sales last year, is much smaller than major studios  such as MCA's Universal or Time Warner's Warner Bros. But the New York-based  company has made its mark by granting unusual autonomy to directors and other  filmmakers since it was founded in 1978 by Arthur Krim, Eric Pleskow and other  executives who quit United Artists Corp. in a dispute with Transamerica Corp.,  which owned it at the time.  </P> <P> The company's main asset is its 800-title film library, which includes  "Platoon," "Amadeus," "RoboCop," "Hannah and Her Sisters," and the "Cagney  &amp; Lacey" TV series. The company does not own a studio lot.  </P> <P> "Dances With Wolves," an Orion film about American Indians directed by and  starring Kevin Costner, surprised much of Hollywood by turning into a  box-office hit despite its three-hour length and risky subject matter.  </P> <P> But the company has suffered from repeated movie disappointments and has  invested heavily in one-hour TV dramas. These traditionally require a  substantial investment by the studio when they are filmed and don't return a  profit unless they remain on the networks long enough to justify the sale of  reruns in syndication. Orion placed "WIOU," "Unequal Justice" and "Lifestories"  on the networks this year.  </P> <P> MCA's senior managers, in selling to Matsushita, struck a deal to remain in  place for at least five years. Orion's Krim might not seek the same assurances  from Samsung, however. The 80-year-old executive has reportedly tired of the  rigors of running a film company.  </P> <P> The sale could also lead to the departure of Woody Allen, Orion's most  prominent filmmaker. Allen, who is close to Krim, has been courted by Walt  Disney Co. for several years. Disney was responsible for Allen's only recent  projects outside Orion -- "New York Stories" and the upcoming "Scenes From a  Mall." Disney reportedly believes that Allen, whose films rarely draw large  audiences, would be a prestigious addition to its roster.  </P> <P> A sale for $300 million would apparently point to a per-share price in the area  of $15 -- which might leave little profit for Kluge. He has purchased his stake  since 1987 for prices that reportedly ranged between $14 and $19 a share,  though he exercised warrants to buy 4.3 million shares at $6 each only a month  ago.  </P> <P> With a total debt of about $375 million, Orion has been under pressure to find  new funding. The company recently picked up some financing by selling foreign  distribution and other rights to Columbia Pictures under a long-term contract.  Samsung would probably seek to negotiate an end to that arrangement if it were  to go ahead with a formal bid for Orion, one person familiar with the studio  said.  </P> <P> Orion's stock closed unchanged Wednesday at $13 a share in New York Stock  Exchange trading. The stock has taken a roller-coaster ride this year, trading  as low as $6.875 and as high as $23.75. It sold for $7 a share as recently as  October.  </P> <P> Securities analysts have said they expected a higher price for Orion. In a Feb.  22 report compiled by the InvesText research service, for instance, a Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst predicted that a sale might bring as  much as $30 a share.  </P> <P> Yet Matsushita's purchase of MCA for much less than expected is widely believed  to have set lower benchmarks for company sales in a period when financing for  takeovers has been tight.  </P> <P> Since the MCA sale, Hollywood has been rife with rumors that other big Japanese  electronics companies such as Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Corp. were exploring  possible entertainment investments.  </P> <P> Apparently, though, Samsung matches any of them when it comes to global  ambition. As Lee Kun-hee, the company's chief executive, told Forbes magazine  in a 1988 interview: "I have a dream to build Samsung into a world-class  company, a genuine multinational."  </P> <P> Staff writer John Lippman contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SAMSUNG GROUP AND ORION PICTURES  </P> <P>  The Samsung Group, a giant Korean electronics conglomerate, has made inquiries  about a possible acquisition of Hollywood's Orion Pictures Corp.

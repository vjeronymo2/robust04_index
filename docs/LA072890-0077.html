			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SAYS SOUTER HOLDS 'BROAD' SENATE SUPPORT;  </P> <P> JUDICIARY: ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE WITH THE NOMINEE, WHO STAYS SILENT, THE  PRESIDENT PREDICTS CONFIRMATION.  </P> <P> President Bush said Friday he believes there is "broad support" in the Senate  for his nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme Court and predicted that  the little-known New Hampshire judge would sail through the confirmation  process "with flying colors."  </P> <P> The President, who gave Souter a lift to New Hampshire aboard Air Force One,  said the reaction to the nomination, which he announced on Monday following the  resignation a week ago of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., had been "very  favorable so far." However, he said the Senate reaction was hard to read since  many in the Senate had not expressed an opinion about Souter.  </P> <P> In keeping with his public near-silence, Souter approached reporters at the  back of Air Force One and said he had "one word, maybe two -- hello, goodby."  With that, and a broad smile, he retreated to the private forward quarters.  </P> <P> Although Souter concluded his introductory meetings with Capitol Hill leaders  Friday without triggering any apparent opposition to his nomination, abortion  rights and civil rights activists said they were undecided over how strongly --  or whether -- to fight the nomination. Leaders of the activist organizations  had banded together successfully to defeat President Ronald Reagan's nomination  of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987.  </P> <P> This time, however, the groups say Souter's attitude on issues such as abortion  and affirmative action are not as apparent as were Bork's extensive legal  writings and judicial opinions, reducing the target for organized opposition.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a coalition of abortion rights groups said they are wary enough  of Souter to launch an advertising campaign within the next week or so aimed at  persuading senators to draw out Souter's views on abortion. An early draft of  the ad asks: "Is Judge Souter committed to protecting our individual liberties,  including our right to privacy and our right to choose safe and legal abortion?  We the people need to know. There is too much at stake."  </P> <P> Linda Heller Kamm, an official with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, one of the  groups helping to pay for the ad, said the abortion rights organizations are  preparing the message because there is a fear that some senators are being  lobbied by the White House to confirm Souter without questioning his views on  abortion.  </P> <P> However, civil rights groups that joined in the Bork fight are not supporting  the ads. "We're not rushing to judgment," said Ralph Neas, executive director  of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an influential coalition of  anti-discrimination groups.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One, Bush denied that Souter had  demanded, as a precondition to his visit to Washington and the pre-nomination  interviews by Bush Administration officials, that he not be asked specific  questions about the 1973 Supreme Court decision that opened the way to  legalized abortions.  </P> <P> "No, no, no," Bush replied when asked if such a precondition had been imposed  by Souter.  </P> <P> Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), a close friend of Souter who also flew with the  President, said the nominee, in expressing concern about being asked questions  about how he would decide specific cases, told him that as a sitting judge he  would be "very embarrassed" to be asked such questions because he would be  unable to answer them and would refuse to do so.  </P> <P> The senator said he relayed such concerns to White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu. "I simply said, 'David would be very uncomfortable if there was a  situation where anyone at Justice or the White House -- ,' I said, 'or the  President -- would ask him directly how he might prospectively rule on a series  of issues.' I said, 'in fact, John, on any issue.'  </P> <P> "And John's response quickly to me, without a pause, was: 'That is not our  policy. We understand that,' " Rudman said.  </P> <P> Souter rode along with Rudman and the President on Air Force One to Pease Air  Force Base, N.H. The President continued on by helicopter to Kennebunkport for  a weekend retreat.  </P> <P> In Boston, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh expressed regret Friday that Justice  Thurgood Marshall criticized Souter's nomination in a televised interview  Thursday night.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that it is a constructive type of attitude to have on the eve  of the consideration by the Senate of the nomination of a man I consider to be  possessed of extraordinary abilities of intellect and character," Thornburgh  said in a speech to the American Legislators Exchange Council, a conservative  legislators' conference.  </P> <P> Marshall, the remaining ideological liberal on the court, suggested on the ABC  News program "PrimeTime Live," that someone other than Bush is "calling his  shots" on the nomination. "I just don't understand what he (Bush) is doing," he  said, adding he had never heard of Souter before the nomination.  </P> <P> Asked about Marshall's remarks, Bush told reporters as he was about to leave  Washington that he has "great respect" for the Supreme Court and would have "no  comment at all."  </P> <P> Also on Friday, the White House elaborated on why Souter did not serve in the  military. When his student deferments expired following his graduation from  Harvard Law School in 1966, a physical examination revealed that one leg was a  half-inch shorter than the other. He was therefore classified 1-Y, meaning he  was ineligible for service except in a national emergency.  </P></p>

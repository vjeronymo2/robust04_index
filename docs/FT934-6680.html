			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Dominican Republic debt cut plan agreed The Dominican Republic's bank creditors have committed themselves to an agreement that will cut the country's bank debt in half. The accord requires approval by the country's congress. If this is forthcoming next month, the agreement could be completed by February, said Mr David Hilton of the Bank of Nova Scotia, which heads the country's bank advisory committee. Banks were offered the choice of exchanging every dollar of debt either for 25 cents in cash in a buyback, for concessional 30-year bonds carrying a 35 per cent discount to face value, or for bonds to reduce interest payments. The accord covers Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m) of debt and Dollars 265m of interest arrears. The government insisted the banks' choices should in total reduce debt 50 per cent, and that has now been achieved. Some 35 per cent of the debt will be submitted for cash, and the rest will be exchanged for discount bonds. The discount bonds, paying interest at  13/16 point over Libor, will carry collateral guaranteeing repayment of principal and 12 months of interest. Some six to 10 banks have not yet committed themselves to the agreement, but the number is not sufficient to hold up the accord, Mr Hilton said.</p>

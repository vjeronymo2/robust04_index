			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Awaiting Bundesbank SOME money market dealers yesterday moved towards the view that the Bundesbank could cut interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting this week, writes James Blitz. The D-Mark has remained soft inside the European exchange rate mechanism in recent days, adding to spec-ulation that the Bundesbank might resist lowering interest rates, a move that would allow the currency to depreciate further. But comments earlier this week from Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, have led some dealers to think that the Bundesbank might ease monetary policy tomorrow for the first time in a month. Mr Issing said that M3 money supply figures for May - due out this week - should fall inside the Bundesbank's target range, having badly overshot the parameters in April. The tone of the remarks contrasted with the hawkishness of his colleagues earlier this month. Moreover, there has been no overt hawkishness from the Bundesbank in the run-up to this council meeting. 'If the Bundesbank were going to leave rates unchanged, you might have expected them to soften up the market first,' commented a dealer. Yesterday's announcement that there will be a variable rate tender for funds over 14 days and 28 days gave no clues as to what the Bundesbank will do with the repo rate today. However, call money applied no pressure on the repo, the lowest accepted rate for which is 7.60 per cent. Call money was several basis points more expensive yesterday, at 7.85 per cent, as June tax payments started to drain funds from the market. Euromark futures were bullish for rate cuts. The September contract closed at 93.30, up 4 basis points on the day, and pricing nearly 100 basis points off three-month money in the next 12 weeks. Sterling markets were quiet in anticipation of the UK chancellor of the exchequer's Mansion House speech yesterday. The September short sterling contract declined one basis point on the day, finishing at 94.17. The June contract, which expires today, closed in line with three-month money at 94.06. The three-month cash rate ended  1/16 softer at 5 7/8 per cent, following the swift despatch of a Pounds 1bn shortage in the discount market.</p>

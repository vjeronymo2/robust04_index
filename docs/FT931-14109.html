			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Daejan slips to Pounds 8.21m Profits of Daejan Holdings, the property group, declined from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 8.21m over the half year ended September 30. The directors, however, anticipated that profits for the full year would not be dissimilar to the previous year's Pounds 16.22m pre-tax. Gross rental income improved to Pounds 7.91m (Pounds 6.94m). The improvement largely reflected additional income arising from recent purchases. The interim dividend is held at 12p and is being paid from earnings of 33.65p (34.96p).</p>

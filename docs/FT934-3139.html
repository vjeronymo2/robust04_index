			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Parking controls threat to Sundays More parking restrictions and traffic congestion could result from parliament's plan to de-regulate Sunday shopping, local authorities warned yesterday. The councils which must enforce the proposals said they would have to extend parking controls if many large stores decided to open on Sundays. They insisted the cost of employing traffic wardens for an extra day would have to be met by car park charges and by operating parking meters. The cross-party Association of District Councils and the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities said they would have to levy the new charges on motorists because the government was not providing funds for the extra costs created by Sunday opening. According to the Institute of Public Finance, Sunday trading could cost councils an extra Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. This would include higher bills for trading standards and litter collection as well as traffic control. The RAC said yesterday it could see little justification for the councils' proposals. It said parking meters were not in operation on a Saturday afternoon in central London; yet Saturday was the busiest shopping day. 'If not on Saturday, why . . . on Sunday?' It said the consequences of Sunday trading on traffic had been overlooked. 'Even in London, public transport is much poorer on Sunday than it is during the rest of the week. That means far more people will have to travel by car than if they shopped on Saturday.' Councils also warned that roadworks, normally carried out on a Sunday because of the light traffic, would have to be moved to another day. Local authorities are deferring detailed plans until legislation emerges. Wandsworth said that while costs could be maintained, it 'would have to find a different quiet day for roadworks. Maybe that would be Monday instead.' Supermarkets' plans, Page 11</p>

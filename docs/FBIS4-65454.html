			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The results of a poll conducted by the  Project Research Consulting firm in the First and Second  Districts of Athens from 8 to 16 April among a randomly chosen  group of 500 individuals were reported in the 30 April-1 May  Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Respondents were asked to  express their preference for Athens mayor in a future mayoralty  race. A majority of them chose former Eurodeputy and present  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) Deputy Vaso Papandreou.  Among PASOK voters, Papandreou obtained 52.1 percent, while 55.8  percent of New Democracy (ND) voters believe that her candidacy  would be favorable for PASOK. Papandreou's candidacy is also  viewed favorably by 50.9 percent of Communist Party (KKE)  supporters and 40.1 percent of Coalition of the Left for  Progress voters. PASOK voters also gave 26.9 percent to former  Athens Mayor Dhimitris Beis and 9.3 percent to deputy Minister  of Transportation Athanasios Tsouras. When asked who would be  the best ND candidate, respondents gave first place to former  Coalition leader Maria Dhamanaki (21.8 percent), followed by ND  luminary Dhimitris Avramopoulos (18.3 percent), Mayor Leonidhas  Kouris (11.8 percent), and ND deputy Dora Bakoyianni (8.6  percent).    Respondents in the First District, the ND's traditionally  best voting area, were also asked their voting preference for  the European Parliament elections. According to poll results,  PASOK gathered 31.7 percent; if the percentage of undecided  voters were added to this figure, the total for PASOK would be  around 35-36 percent. The ND gathered 36.9 percent, compared to  the 42.75 percent it obtained in last October's parliamentary  elections, and it is estimated it could reach 40-41 percent.  Again in the First District, Political Spring obtained 7.9  percent, compared to 6.4 percent last October, and is expected  to achieve a showing of 8.5-9 percent. The Left's percentages  remained more or less stable. Coalition gathered 5.8 percent,  compared to 6.4 percent in October, and is expected to be around  6.5 percent. The KKE obtained 4.96 percent, versus its past 4.6  percent, with the prospect of reaching 5 percent.</p>

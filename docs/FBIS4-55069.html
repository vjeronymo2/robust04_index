			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy in Bosnia, </F> by Isabelle Lasserre in Zagreb; date not given: "Akashi: The  United Nations Cannot Impose Itself in Bosnia"]    [Text] [Lasserre] Did you think when you left Cambodia that  your mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be so difficult?    [Akashi] Yes, and I had no illusions. In peace-keeping  operations, there are no easy missions and each one is unique.  It requires patience, obstinacy, and flexibility. The record  in the former Yugoslavia is fairly positive. Problems remain,  but I can see light at the end of the tunnel.    [Lasserre] You are accused of being conciliatory toward the  Bosnian Serbs. What is your answer?    [Akashi] People think that the United Nations can impose its  will on the warring sides. That is not true. Moreover, the sad  fate of negotiators is that they are not able to choose those  with whom they negotiate, or to display their preferences. We  have spent the most time with the Serbs, and we have shown an  extremely firm attitude. We can be proud of what we have done.    [Lasserre] Why did you refuse to use force in Gorazde?    [Akashi] The threat of air strikes was enough and very  useful  to the negotiations. We succeeded without having to use force.    [Lasserre] Do you not have the impression of being used by  the Serbs and serving their interests?    [Akashi] Not at all. The United Nations has its own  viewpoint. We are the bridge across which the different sides  continue to talk. It would be the end of the UN mission if it  were seen as a participant in this war.    [Lasserre] What do you think of Radovan Karadzic? Do you  regard him as a man of peace?    [Akashi] You will read that in my memoirs... The leaders  with whom I am negotiating represent their populations. I make  no difference between them. I try to be as objective and  impartial as possible.    [Lasserre] You have been strongly criticized. The Bosnian  Government has called for your resignation. Are you affected by  that?    [Akashi] Not much. I am calm and not very sensitive to  pressure. The UN secretary general has expressed his complete  confidence in me. I have enough strength not to listen to  rumors, most especially those coming from people who know  nothing of the situation. It is easy to simplify matters. But  the real situation is never black or white, but somewhere  between the two, in a gray area.    [Lasserre] So, you do not question your method, i.e.,  negotiation, and its limits?    [Akashi] No. Why always be so pessimistic and overdramatize  things? We must fight against the simplistic solutions demanded  by impatient people. Negotiations must be carried out with  everybody and must succeed in the long term. The Serbs are not  unmoved by our arguments.    [Lasserre] Will the United Nations emerge unchanged from the  former Yugoslavia?    [Akashi] If we succeed, the United Nations will emerge from  here stronger than before. If we fail, it will suffer a setback  from which it will be difficult to recover for 10 years. But  peace here cannot be built without the United Nations. Here, we  sometimes show signs of weakness, but we are indispensible. In  the final analysis, it is the aspirations of the peoples of  Bosnia which will determine our success or failure.    [Lasserre] Has your action in Cambodia and then in the  former  Yugoslavia served Japan and its ambition to join the UN Security  Council?    [Akashi] I have not served Japanese interests and I am  embarrassed by my country's timidity. I have urged my political  friends to send troops to the former Yugoslavia. I criticize  them for not having done so yet. If my work one day makes it  possible to arouse more active participation in the peacekeeping  operations, I will be happy.</p>

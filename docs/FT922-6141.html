			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - Chairman defends Hongkong Bank's management record MR WILLIAM Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, yesterday defended Hongkong Bank's record and ability to manage a global bank and told shareholders that the planned merger with Midland Bank was in Hong Kong and China's best interest as well as theirs. Speaking at the bank's annual meeting Mr Purves said the merger with Midland would create an international banking group that would be exceptionally well capitalised. Shareholders would be able to participate in a growing international group with considerable potential, he said. Hongkong Bank's planned acquisition of Midland has not found favour among Hong Kong investors. Many have criticised the plan to create a global bank, saying the experience of the 1980s has underlined the difficulties of such a strategy. But Mr Purves responded to these criticisms yesterday and said Hongkong Bank had long experience in managing operations that span the globe. What it envisages with the merger with Midland 'is materially different from other attempts to establish global banks.' 'Our approach is different because our organisation has always been built on a series of separate franchises in a variety of countries. 'What links these franchises is our commitment to international banking  - and our highly efficient technology through which we deliver competitive products.' Meanwhile, the bank said that Lloyds Bank's complaint to the US Federal Reserve over Hongkong Bank's request for a 'fast track' approval of its acquisition of Midland was 'yet another spoiling tactic'. It was the third letter on this issue that Lloyds had sent the Fed, it said. The bank would be writing to the Fed in due course pointing out that the merger did not involve the acquisition of significant banking assets in the US. It will also cite the Fed's quick approval of Deutsche Bank's purchase of Morgan Grenfell as precedent for a timely determination. In a separate announcement yesterday Hongkong Bank revealed its long-foreshadowed board restructuring. It has moved to a two-tier structure with HSBC Holdings overseeing the bank's global operations and the separate, overlapping, board for Hongkong Bank focusing on the bank's interest primarily in the colony. Among new significant appointments is Baroness Lydia Dunne's elevation to non-executive chairman of HSBC. Lady Dunne is an executive director of Swire and also on the board of Volvo. Mr Victor Li, the 27-year-old son of magnate Mr Li Ka-shing, has joined the board of Hongkong Bank following his father's recent departure.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Irish abortion ruling plunges PM into crisis: Reynolds to hold cross-party talks today to seek consensus AFTER just one week in office Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's new prime minister, has run headlong into a constitutional crisis over a High Court ruling on Monday prohibiting a 14-year-old girl, allegedly raped, from obtaining an abortion in the UK. Opposition leaders were yesterday sharply critical of Mr Reynolds' new attorney-general for having sought the High Court injunction against the girl. Mr John Bruton, leader of the Fine Gael party, said the ruling had 'created an atmosphere of trauma, fear and uncertainty and may lead both to a failure to report (rape) and a significantly greater incidence of abortion than would otherwise occur'. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the Workers' party leader, said an appalling legal precedent had been created which would haunt every Irish woman and girl. 'The attorney-general has displayed an appalling lack of sensitivity and judgment'. Mr Bobbie Molloy, a senior member of the cabinet and one of six deputies from the Progressive Democrat (PD) party on whom Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party rely for support in the coalition government, said his party favoured the abortion issue going to a referendum. Mr Reynolds, who has five daughters, is to meet opposition leaders later today in an effort to obtain cross-party agreement on the issue. He said it was a tragic and distressing case of unique constitutional and 'humanitarian importance' but went on to defend his attorney-general saying: 'I do not believe the people of this country want or deserve a situation of nods and winks in the application of the law. . . in the long run it would do great harm to our country'. Abortion is illegal under Irish law and, following a 1983 amendment to the constitution, the state is obliged to guarantee the right to life of the unborn, although it must also pay 'due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. The anti-abortion legislation, strengthened by the High Court ruling, could face a possible challenge through the European Court for its implications in limiting the free movement of Irish women within the EC  - which would contravene the Treaty of Rome - and as an issue of basic human rights. It is estimated that several thousand Irish women have abortions in the UK every year. They face prison sentences if found out.</p>

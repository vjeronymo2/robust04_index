			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many people have expressed confusion regarding the relationship between the safe harbor for discounts and the statutory exception for discounts. (See section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of the Act.) Specifically, we are asked if there are any practices involving discounts which were protected by Congress under the statutory exception which do not fit within the safe harbor for discounts. Our intention is that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the discounts or reductions in price that Congress intended to protect under the statutory exception for discounts are protected under the safe harbor for discounts. Moreover, as is illustrated by the discussion above regarding discounts to beneficiaries, we are proposing to expand the safe harbor for discounts to include additional practices that we do not consider abusive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the final regulation, we stated that when reporting a discount, one only need report the actual purchase price and note that it is a ``net discount'' (56 FR 35981). However, for purposes of submitting a claim or request for payment, what is necessary is that the value of the discount is accurately reflected in the actual purchase price. It is not necessary to distinguish whether this price is the result of a discount, or to state ``net discount.'' Consequently, buyers who were uncertain about how and where to report on a particular form the fact that the price was due to a discount need not be concerned with reporting that fact, as long as the actual purchase price accurately reflects the discount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we are proposing some minor editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the provision, but hopefully make it easier to understand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Technical Correction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A typographical error at 56 FR 35978 gave a citation to a HCFA rule on payment for intraocular lenses as ``55 FR 436.'' We would correct this citation to the HCFA rule to read as ``55 FR 4536.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We are proposing the deletion of &sect;1001.953 which calls for the completion of an OIG report on compliance with the investment interest safe harbor at &sect;1001.952(a)(2)(i) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vi) within a specified period of time after publication of the original safe harbor provisions. While the OIG is continuing its work on evaluating this safe harbor provision, we believe completion of this report to be an internal administrative process that need not be set forth in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Regulatory Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As we indicated in the original safe harbor final rule published on July 29, 1991, consistent with the intent of the statute, the original safe harbor rulemaking and these proposed clarifications are designed to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business practices and arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and economy. In doing so, the regulations impose no requirements on any party. Health care providers and others may voluntarily seek to comply with these provisions so that they have the assurance that their business practices are not subject to any enforcement action under the anti-kickback statute. We believe that the economic impact of these provisions would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, and we have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 1001 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Health facilities, Health professions, Medicaid, Medicare. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

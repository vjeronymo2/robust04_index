			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Trouble spot A welder working yesterday near London Bridge Underground station, where electricity, gas, water and tele-communications systems are being diverted so that they do not present a safety hazard, Richard Evans writes. The work follows the inquiry into the King's Cross Tube station fire, which made recommendations for safety improvements to be carried out at a number of London Underground stations. The project is likely to cause delays in Borough High Street, Southwark, until the end of the year while a temporary road is built over the existing carriageway. The safety work is expected to continue beneath the temporary road until 1994 One for the road, Page 15</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Britain suspends export credit cover for Tehran BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department has effectively suspended medium- and long-term export credit cover for Iran because of concerns over the country's shortage of foreign exchange. The move is part of a stand by leading export credit agencies unwilling to accept Bank Markazi as the Iranian government's choice as guarantor of export deals. British exporters were notified of the decision in a letter on April 19, the ECGD said yesterday. Japan's trading houses are believed to have arrears of up to Dollars 700m, according to the specialist publication International Trade Finance. About Dollars 300m of this was covered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In 1992 Britain's exports to Iran grew by about 10 per cent to Pounds 568m, giving a trade surplus of Pounds 404m. Iranian imports from Britain totalled Pounds 127m in the first quarter of this year. The country's total imports in the year ending in March 1993 were Dollars 20.8bn (Pounds 13.5bn), down from Dollars 25bn the previous year as balance of paymentsproblems grew more acute. The suspension of cover is expected to have marginal impact on British exporters. The ECGD resumed cover in December 1991 after having kept it off cover for 10 years. An unresolved dispute over repayment of debts dating back to the Shah's regime has prevented export deals being given backing since then. Other governments have had similar disputes, but some resumed medium-term credits. German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to have the greatest exposure, although none is forthcoming on the extent of exposure. Payment problems appear to have been of greatest concern in the a forfait market, where German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to be holding several billion dollars worth of Iranian letters of credit.</p>

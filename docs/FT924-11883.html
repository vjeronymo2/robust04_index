			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Network links get the radio signal - Worth Watching A low-cost alternative to digital leased lines has been introduced by UK networking specialist Layer One for companies wishing to link local area networks (Lans) in different buildings. The Digilink 60 is a radio line-of-sight link which can connect buildings up to 1km apart, and comes in 2Mb/s (megabytes per second), 8Mb/s and 10Mb/s ethernet speed versions. Unlike laser line-of sight links, it is unaffected by rain, fog or snow. The product operates in the newly derestricted 60Ghz frequency which means it can be licensed by the Department of Trade and Industry for Pounds 50 a year. The 10Mb/s version costs around Pounds 13,275 for purchase, installation and license for five years. Layer One: UK, 0942 273955</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Pedalling to the barricades: Nicholas Woodsworth got on his bike to search for French truckers I HAVE an ancient black Post Office bike with rattling mud guards and a front wheel that wobbles just slightly out of true - just the thing it was suggested, to get me from one French truckers' roadblock to another. 'Take a beret and string of onions,' they told me; 'Best way to fit in with the locals. Off you go.' So off I went. Up early, an energetic pedal through West End traffic, and a frantic search at Charing Cross for the brake van on the 7:55 to Dover Priory. An even more frantic changing of brake vans at Ashford where the train splits in two. A rattling whizz down the hill under the battlements of Dover Castle, a quick bowl along under the white cliffs, and a charge across the acres of open tarmac at the P &amp; O ferry dock. By the time the 'Pride of Calais' pulled away from the quay at 10:30 I was watching Tweetie Bird outwit Sylvester in the B Deck cinema and my bicycle was safely in the hold. There is always a difference between a distant overview of a crisis and being in the thick of it. Close up, most things are invariably confused. The woman in the tourist office Portakabin near the unloading ramp was pleasant and over-excited. This was her Sarajevo - she believed the truckers were trying to starve out Calais. Together we pored over a complimentary ink-stained photocopy of the area. Cars could get through, but Calais was surrounded and no goods could get in or out by road, she told me. 'Les blockages sont la, la, la et la', she said decisively, making heavy X marks with her pen on what I took to be auto-routes and interchanges. The map was so tiny and smudged I could not be sure. Despite all the Xs, it took me hours to find a road-block. Dressed in a leather jacket and puffing under a warm sun I toiled along the roads, through public housing estates on the edge of town and out towards the highways and autoroute ramps. I cycled a mile up the Boulogne road, got side-tracked on the road to Saint-Omer and lost myself on flyovers. Not even the beefy pastis-drinkers in the Petit Prince, a routier's cafe on the Dunkirk road knew where the roadblocks were. 'But we are strong; we shall never be crushed,' they affirmed through the smokey blue air, and ordered another round. Finally, some distance from town I ran across a large roadblock. Scores of trucks lay slewed across exits on an interchange, large knots of men stood gesticulating beside them. But the gesticulation turned out to be truckers waving cars through. Polite French lorry drivers were giving road directions to smiling holiday motorists. Where were fraying tempers, the angry mobs? Where were the tanks? 'We do not want tanks,' Olivier Ledoux told me, 'we do not want trouble at all.' Olivier, a gentle-looking soul, had long red hair and a Guns 'n Roses T-shirt. The 60-foot semi-articulated lorry which he drives sat across the road, but the militant image was spoiled by his girlfriend. She had ridden out of Calais to keep him company and, sitting on her Mobylette seat, leant Lolita-like against the side of the cab insouciantly popping bubbles with her chewing gum. Between bubbles she eyed me and my bicycle with a doubtful frown, an are-you-really-a-journalist look that I was fast getting used to. Forget berets and strings of onions; nobody, but nobody, in Calais rides a bike like mine. Anyone who cycles around here is nattily turned out like a Tour-de-France champion. From that point in the afternoon onwards my burning-tyres and flying-brickbats story, like my power to pedal, slowly grew weaker and weaker. Olivier and I sat around talking about music and listening to his CB radio. Nothing was happening. When a CB report came through that a lone, frustrated Belgian driver was blocking a street in the centre of Calais I pedalled off into town at top speed. Half an hour later I arrived red-faced and dripping to find the incident over. At the city police commissariat I asked for a briefing, and was told Divisional Inspector Verdin was out at the Victor Hugo roadblock. I raced back there to find him gone. Olivier told me there were four British lorries and drivers stranded some way up the A-26. Off I pedaled again. Was this my story at last? After listening for 15 minutes to Arthur from Huddersfield debating with Reg from Cowley whether the bloody Frogs were in bloody NATO or not, I decided it probably was not. Back I raced into town to meet Henri Ravisse, president of the Chamber of Commerce. Perhaps there was an economic angle that was escaping me. M. Ravisse was out. And so the day went - the last time I wobbled out to the roadblock I was feeling distinctly cheesed off with the miracle of bicycle communication. What made it worse was that I kept on passing all those roadside things that make France such a wonderful summertime place - seafood restaurants displaying mouthwatering menus, delightful patisserie windows, sunny sidewalk cafes full of smiling girls. I longed for a flat tire. By 6.30pm it was all over - the unions had called off the roadblock around Calais and across the country the protest was winding down. Olivier was upset. Once again, he said, the worker's bosses been bought off by the state. But he was not half as upset as I. Against a stiff wind I pedalled like crazy to catch the ferry and the last train back to London. I hadn't even the time to pick up a beret.</p>

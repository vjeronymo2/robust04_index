			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Acquittal: Debt-laden group with questions to answer Brent Walker's struggles against its mountain of debt have been dominant since Mr George Walker's departure. Lord Kindersley, appointed chairman in January 1991, expected a brief but arduous tenure while the group was refinanced. But untangling Pounds 1.65bn of debt owed to more than 50 banks occupied him seven days a week until March 31 1992 - the last day agreed for a solution. For more than a year the group was perilously poised between rescue and receivership. The rescue was the biggest in UK corporate history, clocking up fees of Pounds 53.8m. To reach a settlement the group had to find a way around a Pounds 50m payment due to Grand Metropolitan, the leisure group, which is the final instalment of the Pounds 685m purchase price of bookmaker William Hill. That matter has not been settled, with Brent Walker claiming a Pounds 200m refund on the purchase price. The group was left with two core businesses, its Pubmaster chain and William Hill. With masterly understatement Lord Kindersley, announcing losses of Pounds 411m for 1991, described the year as 'by any standard a most trying year for the group'. He left in July 1992 but it was not until January last year that a new chairman was found - Sir Keith Bright. The summer of 1993 saw the group breaching some of the terms of its refinancing. It also faced the problem of refinancing the Pounds 350m ringfenced loan on William Hill, which became the subject of a bid battle between a consortium led by merchant bank SG Warburg and another led by CinVEN and Legal and General. Last December the banks agreed refinancing for William Hill. The deal left borrowings at Pounds 1.4bn. The 1993 loss, announced in May, was Pounds 319.1m. Mr John Leach, the finance director, said the two core businesses were at last able to cover interest. Sir Keith quit as chairman in September, warning that turnover in the core operations had shown 'little sign of an upturn'. He has been replaced by Sir Brian Goswell, a non-executive director and a senior partner in Healey &amp; Baker, estate agents and surveyors. Meanwhile William Hill has become the main engine of the group, with operating profits for the first half of Pounds 30.8m. But questions remain over the bookmaker. Mr Leach said in September that flotation was still an option, 'but not necessarily the only one'.</p>

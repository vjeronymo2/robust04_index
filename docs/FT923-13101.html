			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / ITV's choice for top job turns it down THE ITV network last night again began the search for a chief executive after the candidate who was offered the job turned it down. The offer of the most important job in commercial television, managing a Pounds 500m-a-year budget, went to Mr David Arculus, group managing director of Emap, the fast-growing magazine, newspaper and exhibitions group. Mr Arculus, who is 46 and earns about Pounds 160,000 a year, has been in discussions with ITV for the past few weeks and was formally offered the job on Friday. He considered the possible move over the weekend and then told ITV on Monday that he had decided not to leave Emap. ITV executives believed Mr Arculus was about to accept. Mr Arculus worked briefly for the BBC World Service but has been at Emap for the past 20 years and has been a key figure in taking it from being a small family-owned regional newspaper group to its present capitalisation of more than Pounds 460m. The ITV job was worth about Pounds 230,000 not including fringe benefits, but would also have been one of the highest-profile jobs in British television. Mr Arculus was chosen by ITV after more than 70 names had been produced by head-hunters. He was not offered any more money to stay but decided he could not bear to leave. ITV's failure to attract its man is a serious blow. The new commercial television franchises begin in January with four new broadcasters and negotiations are already under way with the Office of Fair Trading on the shape of the future ITV network. ITV urgently needs a chief executive to run what will be a new centralised system of commissioning programmes for the ITV network from both ITV companies and independent producers. Immediately beneath the chief executive will be a senior commissioner-scheduler who will have considerable influence on what is shown on ITV.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JONATHAN BLOCH IN BIDDING FOR NBA ROCKETS  </P> <P> Jonathan Bloch, son of the former owner of the Phoenix Suns, has confirmed he  is negotiating to purchase the NBA Houston Rockets.  </P> <P> "You are talking to somebody who conceivably could do the deal," Bloch told the  Houston Chronicle.  </P> <P> "I'm the one who is having conversations with the Rockets, not my father."  </P> <P> Bloch's father Richard Bloch sold the Suns in 1987.  </P> <P> Rockets owner Charlie Thomas' secretary said Thomas declined comment. Thomas  said before the season started that he was not actively seeking a sale but he  would listen to attractive offers, reportedly of $90 million to $100 million.  </P> <P> Thomas purchased the Rockets in 1982 for $10 million.  </P> <P> Jonathan Bloch, an officer for the Suns when his father owned the team, told  KTRK-TV, Houston on Thursday night that Bloch was negotiating the sale.  </P> <P> "I would be the managing partner and my father would be involved on a limited  basis," Bloch told the Houston Post. "I've been talking with Charlie but there  is no firm deal at this moment.  </P> <P> "I can't say how close or how far apart we are. We're talking about a very  large transaction in a very difficult business. It's obviously very  complicated."  </P> <P> Thomas is the seventh owner of the Rockets. He bought the team June 15, 1982,  and the Rockets reached the National Basketball Assn. finals in 1986,  accompanied by a long string of sellout crowds in the 16,016-seat Summit.  </P> <P> The Rockets had 16 sellouts in 41 home dates last season and they've had two in  14 games this season. Unless the Rockets get more seating they are projected to  be in the bottom third of the league in attendance capacity in the next two to  three years.  </P> <P> Any franchise sale would have to be approved by the NBA Board of Governors.  </P></p>

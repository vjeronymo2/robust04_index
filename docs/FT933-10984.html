			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities The ERM's travails doubtless provoke smug satisfaction within UK government circles. Yet while ministers are struggling desperately with the urge to yell 'I told you so', they might also have an eye to sterling's appreciation. As the CBI warned this week, a rising currency will damp down export prospects - particularly if the ERM finally disintegrates and some currencies fall sharply. The equity market, however, has been buoyed by the notion that UK interest rates are on the way down regardless. Should Germany change tack and cut rates to save the ERM, Britain would follow to slow sterling's rise. If France leaves the system and cuts rates substantially, so would the UK. Lower rates might tempt more cash out of deposits and into equities, yet the demanding rating of the market will make upward progress difficult. Besides, any fall in rates would only offset an effective monetary tightening from the exchange rate. Overall, the pace of economic growth might not be much affected, though its composition would be tilted away from exports towards domestic consumption. If the shift became pronounced, enthusiasm for overseas earners and export manufacturers would wane, while dowdy domestic sectors like stores might once again find a place in the sun.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Short of a TV channel Sir, Michael Grade (Letters, November 27) may be right to say that the concentration of power in too few ITV hands threatens the free market designs of the 1990 Broadcasting Act. But he mentions only two of the three radical proposals on which the Act's intentions rested. In addition to the Channel 3 licence tenders and the separation of Channel 4 as an advertising competitor, the Act instructed the Independent Television Commission 'to do all they can to secure the provision' of a Channel 5 for the UK. It is not evident that the ITC has carried out parliament's wishes, and now is surely the time to ensure that they do so. Advertisers, viewers and independent producers would be the beneficiaries.

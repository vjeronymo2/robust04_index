Rounding up his eastern Transvaal tour on  Saturday with a media conference, he said he had only been given  a sketchy framework by telephone of the newly released manifesto.    "As I understand it, one idea is that the ANC promises  vastly  increased government spending and reduced taxes. This is  evidence of a typical manifesto drawn up by people with no  experience in government or don't care what they promise."    He said the manifesto simply could not be implemented. By  removing tax for those earning under R[rand]4,000 a month and  exempting a large range of products from value added tax meant  the tax burden would increase on those earning over R4,000 and  companies, which would inhibit economic growth.    Although the NP [National Party] also stood for an ambitious  programme to build houses and create jobs, this could only be  done in an affordable way and required dynamic economic growth.  The ANC proposal stifled any chances of economic growth, he  said.    Mr De Klerk said he would study the manifesto further and he  or his party would make further comments.</p>

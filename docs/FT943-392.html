			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Erith doubled to Pounds 1.23m midway Erith, the southern building materials group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 523,000 to Pounds 1.23m for the first six months of the year. Mr Bryan Castledine, chairman and chief executive, said the recovery in the new housing market had helped profits growth. However, activity in the home improvements market remained flat. There was also a first contribution from eight branches acquired last year. They contributed Pounds 1.3m to total turnover, which advanced 17 per cent to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 33.5m). Earnings per share improved to 1.88p (0.75p) and the interim dividend was increased from 0.35p to 0.75p.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor urges limited demands - Public Expenditure MR Norman Lamont yesterday warned his Cabinet colleagues that he is determined to keep a tight grip on public spending as senior Whitehall officials confirmed a drastic run-down in the Treasury's contingency reserve. The Chancellor was joined by Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, in what those present regarded as a ritual exhortation to spending departments to keep down their bids for extra cash both this year and next year. His difficulties in holding the line against new spending demands, however, was underlined by the publication by the Treasury of the latest independent economic forecasts. The forecasts suggest that unemployment is likely to average around 2.4m in the current financial year against the 1.75m assumed by the Treasury when the public spending targets were set. If the higher figures prove accurate - and ministers are not disputing them in private conversations - then the additional cost in benefits will be over Pounds 2bn. A further Pounds 700m of the Treasury's Pounds 3.5bn reserve for the current 1991/91 financial year has already been committed to pay for higher-than-expected public sector pay awards, the decision to uprate child benefit, and additional training measures. That has led senior Whitehall officials to predict that on current trends the Government will overshoot both its Pounds 205bn public spending target and its Pounds 8bn borrowing target. It has also raised serious doubts about the credibility of the Pounds 220bn figure pencilled in by the Treasury for 1992/93, despite the existance of a much larger reserve of Pounds 7bn for that year. Downing Street indicated yesterday that the plans for next year could benefit from lower-than-expected inflation. In the short term at least, the Treasury will actually benefit from the Gulf War. A sizeable proportion of the contributions from Britain's coalition allies - to replace capital equipment like Tornado fighter planes - will not actually be spent for some years. Against that, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, was said at Westminster to be joining his colleagues at health, education and environment in preparing substantial bids for next year. Back-of-the-envelope calculations in Whitehall suggest that demands for next year will total upwards of Pounds 10bn and perhaps as much as Pounds 15bn. Mr John Cunningham, shadow leader of the House, accused the Government in the Commons yesterday of seeking to avoid a debate on its public expenditure plans. He recalled that the opposition had been pressing for such a debate for three months,and claimed that ministers were embarrassed over the deepening recession and reports that it might have to cut investment programmes. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, told him the government would be happy to defend its position.</p>

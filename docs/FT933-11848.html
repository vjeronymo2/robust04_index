			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Kuwait set to make Dollars 1bn claim Kuwait is preparing a Dollars 1bn claim against Baghdad for cleaning up the oil well fires that swept the country at the end of the 1991 Gulf War, Reuter reports from Geneva. Mr Abdulrahman al-Houty, chairman of the Kuwait government body assessing damage caused by Iraq's seven-month occupation of the emirate, said the claim would be presented to a special United Nations body in the next few days. 'This will be the first of the big claims against Iraq. It has symbolic importance for us, and we believe it should be given priority attention,' Mr al-Houty added. The Geneva-based Compensation Commission has been meeting regularly since the summer of 1991 and officials say it has already received some 700,000 claims with an expected 500,000 more in the pipeline from individuals, firms and states. The total value of all claims is expected to be between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 200bn, according to experts at the Commission. Mr al-Houty was speaking in an interview before a three-day meeting of the governing council of the Compensation Commission.</p>

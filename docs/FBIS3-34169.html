This enhanced the image of Pakistan in  the international community. She was addressing a news  conference in Islamabad this afternoon on her return after a  week-long visit abroad. [passage omitted]    The prime minister said she raised the Kashmir issue at the  Human Rights Commission as she had promised to the people of  Pakistan and Kashmir. It is Pakistan's basic policy to  repeatedly shake the world conscience about the Indian  repression in Kashmir. She told the world assembly that India's  allegations about Pakistan's interference in occupied Kashmir  are totally baseless and wrong because about 700 Indian soldiers  are deployed at every one km distance along the line of control.  India has, thus, raised an iron wall on the border.    When asked about threats coming from across the border, the  prime minister said we are not afraid of them as Pakistan is  capable of defending itself. She pointed out that these threats  show that the Indian case on Kashmir is weak and it does not  wants a political solution. She said the Jammu and Kashmir  dispute is an international dispute and both India and Pakistan  are committed to a plebiscite there. To a question, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said while agreeing to talks with India, Pakistan sent a  clear signal to India that Pakistan believes in talks and there  is a government in Pakistan which can settle the Kashmir issue,  but these talks will be successful only if the human rights  situation in occupied Kashmir is improved. The prime minister  said India failed to respond positively to repeated Pakistani  proposals for ending atrocities in Kashmir. That is why we had  to go to international forums. She said she told the Indian  foreign secretary during his visit to Pakistan that India should  take visible steps in the valley, including the release of  Kashmiri leaders, reduction of the Indian forces, and stopping  the killings. The prime minister said Pakistan even now is  ready for talks with India on the Kashmir issue, but first India  should end repression in Kashmir. [passage omitted]</p>

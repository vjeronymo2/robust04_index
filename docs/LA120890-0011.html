			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS : COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;  </P> <P> GROWTH OUTPACES STATE FUNDING  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Community College District, with only one campus -- College  of the Canyons in Valencia -- is the fastest-growing community college district  in the state for the third consecutive year, according to the state Department  of Finance.  </P> <P> And, like many other community colleges in fast-growing areas, College of the  Canyons does not have enough funding to keep pace with its growth.  </P> <P> The college's average daily attendance (ADA) is up more than 10% from last  year, said Dianne Van Hook, district superintendent-president, but the district  is unlikely to receive state funds to cover the increase.  </P> <P> The average daily attendance funding the college receives from the state is  based on growth projections, in this year's case, 8.5%. This predetermined  amount, however, isn't adequate for the college's actual student attendance,  which means the college is losing funding, Van Hook said.  </P> <P> The total loss in ADA funding to the college from the 1987-88 school year  through 1990-91 has been more than $6.3 million, Van Hook said. Unfunded ADA  rose from zero in the 1986-87 school year to 14% in 1987-88 and continues to  increase, she said.  </P> <P> In 1987-88, enrollment grew by about 16%. The 1988-89 growth rate was  approximately 12%.  </P> <P> The college's Master Facility Plan predicts the growth rate will continue at  well above 10%. District enrollment projections range from 16,500 to 39,000 by  2020. Fall enrollment was 5,668 in 1989 and 6,104 in 1990, Van Hook said. JACI  D. ANTRAM  </P></p>

They're probably waiting so  they can confirm my replacement. And there is somebody available in the  organization: Bud Harrelson, who's popular in New York."  </P> <P> The newspaper said Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball  operations, denied that a decision had been made and that one is not expected  to be reached until the end of the week or later.  </P></p>

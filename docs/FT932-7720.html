			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains wiped out at the close FIRMNESS in sterling foll-owing good UK unemployment figures proved a somewhat negative factor yesterday in a UK stock market no longer confident that domestic interest rates can be reduced again in the near future. Having been buoyed for much of the session by Wall Street's surge to a new peak overnight, the London blue chips turned off towards the close. The FT-SE 100 Index ended a shade easier, contrasting with a sharp rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which broke through to a new closing high of 3,160.1. London's response to Wall Street's rebound in the previous session was somewhat disappointing. Although the Footsie gained 13 points in early trading, dealers said there was little support behind it. The big institutions were unwilling to buy stock at these levels, in fact a fairly high level of Seaq volume suggested that some were selective sellers. However, the market held on to its initial gains until early afternoon when the combination of a firm pound and a dull Wall Street brought a sharp reaction. The Dow Average was a couple of points off in UK trading hours amid general nervousness ahead of today's Triple Witching Hour when a batch of important futures contracts expire. By the close, the FT-SE 100 was a net 2.9 down at 2,816.8. The contrast with the FT-SE Mid 250, which gained 11.1 points, raised the perennial question of whether the smaller stocks favoured by private investors lead, or merely follow, the blue chip market. Some traders commented that the smaller stocks which are included in the Mid 250 index were 'not always easy to sell' in a market which has become increasingly nervous regarding economic prospects on both domestic and international fronts. Seaq volume increased sharply yesterday, totalling 700.8m shares compared with 647.8m in the previous session. But non-Footsie business remained at the slightly reduced levels of recent sessions, constituting only about 56 per cent of the day's total, against averages of around 62 per cent over the past few months. The market was undermined by the weakness in consumer issues which has followed the disclosure of a fall in domestic retail sales last month. This cloud over the progress of the recovery in the domestic economy has been pressed home by disappointing results from the brewery sector and a lukewarm reception in the stock market to the latest trading figures from Marks and Spencer, the monarch of the high street retailers. Renewed falls among consumer shares were accompanied by fresh hints that a large takeover bid was in the air, and would perhaps bring the sizeable rights issue of which the stock market is in fear. At the same time, the London market lacked the lead from the big blue chip sectors yesterday. Oil shares made no response to Wall Street's advance and the pharmaceuticals sector also stayed in the shadows. Several leading UK houses appeared to be avoiding taking on any big trading positions in the international blue chips. The London market has become nervous of the near-term outlook for the continental European economies in the wake of this week's indications of inflationary pressures in Germany.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Management: Score card for the suppliers - A recent convert to vendor appraisal You do not need to be a 'total quality management' fanatic to recognise that most companies would benefit considerably from making regular and detailed assessments of the performance of their suppliers. Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, has done so for decades. Yet, except in retailing, 'vendor appraisal' - the American term for the approach - still seems stuck on the starting block. US computer company Sun Microsystems, a relatively recent convert, says that its experiences with the practice bear out two claims made for it: that it raises suppliers' performance, and that they in turn benefit from, and appreciate receiving, performance tracking. Supplier effectiveness is crucial to the survival of the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) company, explains Mel Friedman, vice-president of corporate supplier management. Sun has used its expertise with the 'Sparc' chip behind its range of high-powered minicomputers to create an impressive global customer base, but has fought shy of a heavy manufacturing involvement. 'Fifty five per cent of every revenue dollar goes to suppliers,' says Friedman. It is unique among the group of companies with which it competes, he points out, for operating without any chip fabrication facilities of its own. In part, the strategy has paid off. Sun's steady revenue growth has outstripped the more vertically-integrated IBM, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard by several orders of magnitude. But earnings per share have been more erratic, and four years ago prompted the company to seek an improved - and more consistent - performance from its suppliers. Given its high level of dependence on suppliers, the company was also determined to monitor their effectiveness over a broader spectrum than price, quality and delivery reliability. In order to assess the total cost of dealing with a supplier, suppliers' ongoing technological development and back-up support mattered too, Friedman argues. Each supplier's performance against the company's 'score card' is reviewed quarterly with members of the supplier's senior management. The long-term objective is to dispense with periodic measurement and have the data online. Several things make the Sun scheme stand out. One is the way it has been extended beyond the core of suppliers who produce parts to go inside computers; airlines and car rental companies have also been assessed. Another is striving to avoid fuzzy measurements, even in areas such as technical capability. The company looks at suppliers' investment levels and what Friedman describes as their 'technological road map' with precisely formulated expectations. With printed circuit boards, for example, particular levels of expertise are set as minimum standards. Targets are constantly made tougher: three years ago 'on time delivery' meant delivery within a time band stretching from three days early to one day late. Now it means two days early and zero days late. Moving the goalposts has disguised progress: although suppliers' score card performance has only improved from 1.33 to 1.23 (1 is a 'perfect' score, 2 is failure) since the scheme's inception, this is misleading. On a constant measurement criteria basis, claims Friedman, suppliers' performance has shot from 1.33 to 1.00 - in other words, to a level that Sun regarded as perfection three years ago. Suppliers' attitudes have been very positive, says Friedman. 'It's a symbiotic relationship,' he argues. 'The attributes we measure help the supplier.' Alastair Kelly, managing director of Design to Distribution, the newly autonomous subcontract manufacturing operation of UK computer supplier ICL, agrees. The volume of Sun business which he undertakes has grown tenfold to Dollars 34m since 1990, and he has now imposed the Sun vendor assessment approach on his own suppliers. 'It's the best bit of free benchmarking I get,' he says.</p>

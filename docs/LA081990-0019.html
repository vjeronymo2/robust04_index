			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORDS, ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> "THE MANY MOODS OF THE GUITAR." Lynn Harting-Ware, guitar. Acoma GXD 5732  (compact disc).  </P> <P> The Canadian guitarist enlarges the instrument's neo-classical repertory -- not  an urgent task -- with this disc of mostly fresh material, led by Richard  Smoot's Brouweresque "Music for the Waiting Angel," Kathy Henkel's deftly  shaped "River Sky" mysteries and Peter Ware's pungent, poignant "Nakina" suite.  Her essentially lyric way with the music leaves its tensions understated, but  revels in the easier intimacies of color and liquid tone. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

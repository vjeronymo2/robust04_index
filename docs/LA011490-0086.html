			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OHIO;  </P> <P> FIRM PLANS BIGGEST CIVILIAN JET ENGINE  </P> <P> General Electric Co. will detail next week in Cincinnati plans to develop what  is billed as the world's biggest and most powerful civilian jet engine,  designed to power the new generation of jumbo jets in the next century, a  company spokesman said. The engine will permit the proposed Boeing 777 super  jumbo jet and other planes to handle increased weight with only two engines  rather than the three or four on today's jets, saving fuel costs and providing  greater operating efficiency, the spokesman said. Sources said the impetus for  the new engine was the recent announcement by Boeing Co. that it would go ahead  with plans to build its 777.  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / RTZ remains steady and completes move into mining RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, demonstrated its resilience to low commodity prices with a steady performance in 1993 when its plans to focus the group wholly on mining were completed. Mr Robert Wilson described the year as a landmark for the company, concluding the restructuring started in 1988. Since then, average dollar non-ferrous metal prices fell 44 per cent, with a 15 per cent decline last year. In total 'the dismally low prices for many of our products', including coal and iron ore, reduced 1993 earnings by Pounds 122m, said Mr Wilson. However this was more than offset by a Pounds 78m contribution from volume growth and a Pounds 103m gain from exchange rate movements. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 521m to Pounds 435m. But the figure contains Pounds 217m of exceptional items, including Pounds 165m related to the disposal of its Pillar industrial division. Group turnover increased from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.8bn. Net attributable earnings were up 20 per cent to Pounds 287m. Earnings per share rose from 22.5p to 27p. However, adjusted earnings, which reflect the underlying performance by excluding exceptional items, rose by a more modest 10 per cent, from Pounds 338m to Pounds 373m. Sir Derek Birkin, presenting his last results as executive chairman, said the prices of most metals appeared to have stopped falling. 'However, they are likely to be volatile for some time because of a combination of renewed investor interest, possibly erratic supplies, and high inventories.' A final dividend of 7p is proposed, bringing the total to 20.5p compared with 19.5p. Sir Derek said the increase 'should be taken as an indicator not of the outlook for 1994 but of our confidence in the company's potential once recovery is soundly established'. During the year the group moved into the US coal industry for a total outlay of Pounds 320m, and disposed of Pillar, which should realise Pounds 900m. The sale helped to cut net debt from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 384m, reducing gearing from 36 per cent to 12 per cent. Mr Christopher Bull, finance director, said it was 'not a bad time to have a very strong balance sheet' as the company expected to double capital expenditure this year from 1993's Pounds 265m.

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / FT Cable and Satellite Conference: BBC intends global 24-hour television news by next year THE BBC is planning to have a round-the-clock worldwide television news service operating by next year. Mr Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, said yesterday that the corporation was in advanced negotiations to take the 24-hour World Service Television, launched in Asia last year, to Africa, Australia and Japan. 'We aim to be worldwide by next year, and we will examine closely the ways in which this service can be linked into a UK service,' Mr Checkland told the Financial Times Cable and Satellite Conference in London. He envisaged the 24-hours-a-day television news channel being broadcast by satellite in the UK, funded by subscription and competing with Sky News, the satellite channel. The move is part of a BBC initiative to develop sources of funding in addition to the licence fee. The corporation believes subscription income will reach as much as Pounds 2bn in the UK by the end of the decade. 'The BBC must be inventive in sharing in that growth to support its future broadcasting role,' said Mr Checkland. He emphasised, however, that he was opposed to either BBC1 or BBC2 becoming subscription channels. BBC projections suggested that average household expenditure on television-related activities in the UK would rise from Pounds 279 a year now to more than Pounds 400 in 1997. Television's proportion of leisure spending would rise from 8 per cent to 11 per cent. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television, in his first public statement since Thames lost its ITV franchise, expressed some bitterness yesterday about the process. 'A fine company is being put through the shredder after one fax and little thanks,' Mr Dunn said. As a result 1,200 people were losing their livelihoods and experienced programme-making teams were being broken up for ever. As an independent producer Thames would concentrate on entertainment, drama, children's and factual programmes. Mr Leslie Hill, chief executive of Central Independent Television, renewed his campaign for the rationalisation of ITV and a move towards fewer companies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] on Thursday [21 April] approved a series of  measures to increase the number of people eligible to vote in  next week's elections. The council resolved that people who came  to South Africa before June 13, 1986 but who under old  legislation were denied the right to permanent reidence and the  right to vote, would be allowed to vote.    The National Union of Mineworkers had pointed out to the  council that many of its members had been working in South  Africa for decades but were not allowed to claim permanent  residence.    Now, if they have been in the country for five years and if  they arrived before June 13, 1986 they will be allowed to vote.    South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said the  amendment put black migrant workers on a par with European  migrants.    A second resolution amended the Electoral Act to allow  homeland residents who are in possession of travel documents to  vote. This amendment affects about one million people.    The Executive Council also passed amendments to allow the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the elections.    The substance of the amendments was agreed in trilateral  talks involving the IFP, the African National Congress and the  government earlier this week.    The Executive Council agreed to the amendment that will  allow  the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to attach IFP  stickers to ballot papers.    Joint executive secretary Mac Maharaj said the IEC was  subjecting the sticker glue to stringent laboratory tests.    These tests would ensure the stickers did not come loose and  fall off or cover the names of other parties in which case the  ballot would be regarded as a spoilt vote.    The amendments will be proclaimed by President F W de Klerk  and do not need to come before Parliament when it convenes on  Monday.</p>

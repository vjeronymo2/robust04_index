			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: RED ALL OVER  </P> <P> Talking screenplay credits: Is Phil Alden Robinson -- writer-director of the  weepy, uplifting "Field of Dreams" -- embarrassed by his script for  "Relentless"? The potboiler, starring Judd Nelson as a deranged police academy  reject-turned-serial killer, opened to mixed reviews Sept. 1, managing $3.2  million in ticket sales its first weekend.  </P> <P> But the name Phil Alden Robinson wasn't in the credits.  </P> <P> A source tells us that Robinson -- who wrote the script several years ago,  "before his career took another turn" -- won't allow the producing CineTel  Films or the distributing New Line Cinema to connect his name to the movie.  </P> <P> The credited screenwriter is "Jack T.D. Robinson." Sources tell us that's "Jack  the Dog" -- Robinson's pooch.  </P> <P> Calls to Robinson weren't returned. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

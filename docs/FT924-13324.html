			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Canadians address deepening divisions: A look at the jitters over an imminent referendum on proposed constitutional reform WHEN Canada signed its landmark free-trade agreement with the US four years ago, the country's business leaders were among the deal's loudest cheerleaders. Many distributed pro-free trade literature to their employees, urging them to back prime minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government in the 1988 general election. Four years later, Canadian business is again in the forefront of a political campaign - this time urging a Yes vote in the October 26 referendum on the most far-reaching package of constitutional reforms since the country was formed in 1867. However, in contrast to their enthusiasm for the free-trade pact, most captains of industry are lukewarm about the contents of the constitutional deal, known as the Charlottetown Agreement. The main thrust of their arguments is to warn of the dire economic consequences if voters reject the agreement. The prospect of a No victory has already unsettled investors. It is widely blamed for the slump in the Canadian dollar over the past month, from 83 US cents to less than 80 cents, and the consequent two percentage-point jump in banks' prime lending rate. The gap between short-term Canadian and US rates has widened in the past month from 1.5 to about five percentage points. Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency, cited political jitters as one reason for downgrading Canada's foreign currency debt this week. But, with only two weeks before the referendum and opinion polls putting the No side well ahead in several provinces, business leaders are also anxious not to paint too bleak a picture of Canada's future if the agreement is rejected at the polls. Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief executives of Canada's biggest companies, says: 'At the very least, we expect there will be a period of uncertainty which may be quite long.' More than a quarter of small businesses polled by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said it will cut investment or make other changes in their planning if the No side prevails. But Mr D'Aquino's message to foreign investors in the event of a No vote is: 'Put everything in context and don't panic.' He raises the possibility that 'constitutional fatigue' could put Canada's perennial identity crisis out of people's minds, as it did after Quebec's sovereignty referendum 12 years ago. Mr Guy Saint-Pierre, chairman of SNC, Canada's biggest project management group, and a leading campaigner for the agreement in Quebec, says that his concern arises less from the immediate fall-out from the referendum than from Canada's long-term future. 'It won't be heaven or hell the next day,' Mr Saint-Pierre says. But he predicts that a No vote would embolden Quebec separatists to demand an early election in the francophone province. If they win, and remain true to their principles, Mr Saint-Pierre fears that Quebec could find itself on an inexorable road to sovereignty. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, concluded in a lengthy analysis last month that a break-up of Canada would push the average growth rate down from 3 per cent to 1 per cent a year over the next decade and raise unemployment. In the event of a break-up, the bank said, 'a significant widening in the income gap between Canada and the US could turn the current flow of emigrants into a flood.' The business community remains optimistic that the Yes forces, which were slow to get their campaign into gear, can make up lost ground over the next two weeks. Most polls point to a large pool of undecided voters. Backers of the pact are hoping these will be swayed by warnings of lower growth, falling living standards and a broken country. They are hammering home the point that opponents of the deal - who include such uneasy bedfellows as Quebec separatists, western Canadian regional groups, women's activists and former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau, an arch-federalist - would never be able to strike a deal themselves. But supporters of the constitutional reforms, and especially the business community, have yet to muster the fervour of the critics. Because the agreement is a compromise, which gives no region or interest group everything it wants, it has been easy for opponents to pick apart. Quebec separatists have plenty of ammunition to show that the francophone province got less at the bargaining table than it had wanted. The business community is genuinely troubled by some provisions of the Charlottetown Agreement. Sections recognising the 'inherent right' of Canada's 700,000 aboriginal people to self-government could prove a headache for fishing, mining and forestry companies. They face the prospect of dealing with another level of government, able to pass laws without necessarily using normal democratic processes. Business is also disappointed that the federal government backed down in the closing stages of negotiations from earlier demands that the ten provinces make a firm commitment to lower their myriad non-tariff trade barriers. Mr Jim Matkin, the president of the Business Council of British Columbia, says that such concerns mean that business lobby groups cannot push the Charlottetown Agreement as hard as free trade without risking the displeasure of their members. Mr Matkin says his reservations about the agreement are outweighed by his concern at Quebec's reaction to a No vote. Echoing a line of Mr Mulroney, in rallying support for the Yes side, Mr Matkin calls the Charlottetown deal 'as good as we can expect - and we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGHLIGHTS OF CANADA'S NEW CONSTITUTION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- An elected Senate, with six senators from each province, plus one each from two Arctic territories. The Senate can reject bills on natural resource taxation by a simple majority. Defeat of other bills triggers a joint sitting with the House of Commons. Key appointments, including governor of the Bank of Canada, to be ratified by the Senate. The House of Commons to be expanded from 295 to 337 seats, with extra seats for Ontario and Quebec (18 each), British Columbia (4) and Alberta (2). Quebec to gain the right 'to preserve and promote' its distinct identity. Provinces to acquire exclusive jurisdiction in forestry, mining, tourism and housing; and wider powers over immigration, labour, training and culture. Aboriginal people to gain an 'inherent right' to self-government, enforceable by the courts after five years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

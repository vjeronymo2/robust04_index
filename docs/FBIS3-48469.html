			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Gomako] </F>   [Text] With Japan reeling from political upheaval, the  prospect of "fruitful agreements" in Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks has become slim, and this development has led  the U.S. Government to get tough with Japan. As measures to deal  with Japan in case the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end  in failure, the U.S. Government has begun to study the  possibility of using a presidential order to revive the Super  301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act and of setting its  own criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The  U.S. Government is believed to be employing the tactic to wring  trade concessions from Japan for the time being. "Five schemes"  are now under study by the U.S. Government and a NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN correspondent has examined how realistic these schemes  are.    The rejection of a package of political reform bills in the  House of Councilors disappointed the U.S. Government beyond  imagination. A White House official said, "Prime Minister  Hosokawa did not specifically explain to Treasury Secretary  Bentsen about the income tax reduction" and expressed his  disappointment at the lack of prospects for Japan's stimulus  measures which have been viewed as a trump card to make the  February Japan-U.S. summit talks a success.    At a plenary session of the vice ministerial economic  framework talks that began on 24 January, the U.S. side took a  "tough attitude again" for setting an objective criteria, about  which the U.S. side has recently taken a flexible attitude,  (says a Japanese Government source). Treasury Secretary Bentsen  has publicly spoken of the need to "reexamine the bilateral  economic framework talks," and his statement has been regarded  as an expression of toughness in the U.S. attitude. One of the  schemes under study by the U.S. Government is to revive the  Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. It is highly  possible the U.S. Government will decide to revive it if and  when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to produce any  results or are broken off. The second scheme is for the United  States to "set its own criteria to monitor the openness of the  Japanese market." These two schemes would create a mechanism  whereby the United States monitors and declares sanctions as it  likes.    A plan is under study by the U.S. Government to send U.S.  Trade Representative Kantor to Japan in early February with the  mission of presenting Japan with the two schemes and feeling out  Japan's attitude toward them. The third scheme is an  ultra-hard-line one whereby the United States expresses its  unhappiness with the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks by notifying Japan of its decision to postpone  the planned Japan-U.S. summit talks. The White House, however,  is cautious about the third scheme.    The remaining two schemes are long-term in nature. One of  the  two schemes is to trigger again the "yen's appreciation" as  occurred in the first half of 1993 with the aim of forcing Japan  to take measures to stimulate its economy. Some officials in the  Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Treasury Department are  opposed to this scheme and the possibility of its actually being  put into effect is slim. The last scheme is for the United  States to "keep Japan in check by bypassing it in strengthening  its relations with South Korea, the Southeast Asian nations, and  China." It is highly possible that the Untied States will adopt  this scheme.    Needless to say, the United States will only use these  schemes as a bargaining tool to wring trade concessions from  Japan for the time being. However, it is true that the patience  of the United States, which has decided to "refrain from taking  tough steps against Japan until after the prime minister carries  out the political reform," is wearing thin.</p>

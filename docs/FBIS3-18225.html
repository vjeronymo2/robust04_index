The precise location of their camp has not yet been decided,  added a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.    Around 100 Belgian troops are already based in Vitez. They  belong to a transport company (comprising 102 men) entrusted  with getting humanitarian aid through to the civilian  population. This company is part of the Belgian-Netherlands  battalion. The troops have dubbed the present operation "Moving  Star."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Individual-run and privately owned enterprises have  become important network centers of economic development in  Liaoning. The province of Liaoning is noted for its large  number of large and medium-sized enterprises and also for its  rich actual strength of publicly owned enterprises. In line  with the demand of developing the socialist market economy, the  province has formulated policies and measures for developing  individual-run and privately owned enterprises over the past  few years and created a relaxed environment to encourage the  rapid development of such enterprises. By the end of 1993, the  province's number of individual-run and privately owned  enterprises reached 745,000. The industrial output value  scored by these enterprises reached 11.8 billion yuan and  accounted for 4.22 percent in the province's total industrial  output value. The volume of retail sales scored by these  enterprises reached 22.2 billion yuan and accounted for (?40.2)  percent in the province's total volume of retail sales. They  provided 1.62 billion yuan of taxes for the province, which  accounted for 6.7 percent in the province's financial and tax  revenues.</p>

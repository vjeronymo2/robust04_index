			<p>BFN     [Text] Tourist trips to the truce village of Panmunjom  have been suspended this week because of repair work at a  briefing room for tourists at the truce village, a UN Command  (UNC) spokesman said yesterday. The spokesman said the  suspension of trips has nothing to do with the tension fueled by  the North Korean nuclear program.    "The briefing room for tourists who come to see Panmunjom  and  nearby underground tunnels dug by North Koreans is very old and  we need to repair it," said Kim Yong-kyu of the UNC. "That's  why tours to Panmunjom have been temporarily suspended. They  will resume Monday," said Kim. He denied a news report that the  suspension of the trips was related to the existing tensions.</p>

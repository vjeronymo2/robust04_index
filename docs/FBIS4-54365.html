			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  Thursday [26 May] decided to create a committee to study the  public works cost differential between Japan and other  countries, such as the United States, and ways of narrowing the  gap.    The committee, led by vice minister Shigeo Mochizuki, will  hold its first meeting on Friday.    The 12-member committee will draw up an action program by  October or November on how to narrow differences in such areas  as costs, personnel, materials and machinery.    The ministry last year compared the cost of Japanese  materials, machinery and other areas in flood control projects  with U.S. costs.    It found that costs in Japan were on average 30 percent  higher than those in the U.S.</p>

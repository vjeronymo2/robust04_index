			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Oil Saddam Hussein may be backing down from a Gulf confrontation, but that is not necessarily bearish for crude prices. Since the US has gone to the expense of mobilisation, it is unlikely to reward Saddam by swiftly lifting the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. There should also be less pressure on the administration to soften its line from Russia, China and France. If the embargo is not lifted next year, it could last beyond 1996. President Bill Clinton will not wish to give the appearance of caving in to Saddam in an election year. As important as what happens in Iraq is the picture of world demand and supply. This year demand outside the former Soviet Union, where economic activity has collapsed, looks set to grow by nearly 3 per cent. Much of the growth has come from the US. That growth in US demand could slow down as its economy responds to higher interest rates, but this is likely to be more than offset by growth in continental Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, supply remains tight. Opec shows every sign of maintaining production discipline. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran have all indicated that this year's quotas should be rolled over when the cartel next meets in November. A combination of growing demand and tight supply would have predictable effects. Any dip in crude prices if the Iraqi crisis is indeed resolved is likely to be temporary.</p>

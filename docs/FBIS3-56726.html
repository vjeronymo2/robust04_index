It was pointed out at  a press conference that the decision was not related to the  executive branch representatives' unwillingness to cooperate  with the new chief of administration, nor was it a protest  against his appointment. The government did so proceeding from  generally applied standards: Once a chief is gone, his cabinet  goes, too. The new governor has asked all members of the oblast  administration to stay on until February, when a new Sverdlovsk  Oblast government will be formed.</p>

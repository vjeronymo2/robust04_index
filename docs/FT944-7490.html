			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Margins slip at Courtaulds - Grimsby chosen ahead of Munich for Pounds 90m Tencel production plant Courtaulds has chosen Grimsby, Humberside, as the site for its European production plant for Tencel, its new man-made fibre. The plant, which will initially create 120 jobs, will cost Pounds 90m, of which Pounds 10m has been provided as a grant by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said it was 'a very close run thing' between Grimsby and a site near Munich, where greater financial assistance was offered. The decision was announced as Courtaulds reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 80.7m (Pounds 96.1m) for the half year to September 30. The result last time, however, was boosted by profits of Pounds 24.4m from the sale or closure of discontinued operations, partly offset by Pounds 4.1m restructuring charges. Operating profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 86.4m reflecting Courtaulds' inability to pass on sharp increases in raw materials costs, particularly for viscose and acrylic fibres. Mr Huismans warned that the effects would be more marked in the second half although it planned to increase its fibre prices by between 5 and 15 per cent from January 1. 'I am very confident that all will be recovered. Nothing goes up as rapidly as this without a rapid reversal.' Although demand was generally firm, operating margins in all three division slipped. But excluding the new European fibres joint venture with Hoechst the group figure was steady at 8.9 per cent. Turnover was flat at Pounds 1.03bn. Earnings per share were 15p (14.8p) excluding exceptionals and the dividend is 4.15p (4p). Profits from fibres and chemicals were little changed at Pounds 42m (Pounds 41m) held back by stiff competition, particularly in the US, and increased marketing and development costs on Tencel. As expected, these outweighed Tencel's trading profits but it is now making a positive contribution. Courtaulds announced a joint venture with Akzo Nobel to develop a filament yarn version of Tencel. Polymer products profits dropped to Pounds 14m (Pounds 18m), reflecting the end of the light armoured vehicle contract, but coatings and sealants were unchanged at Pounds 36m. Interest charges fell from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8m, thanks partly to the elimination of unwanted swaps. Capital expenditure rose to Pounds 69m (Pounds 55m). COMMENT Courtaulds' shares have had a bad run over the last few months as the City has watched its raw materials costs soar. So the solid figures provided some reassurance. Although the impact will be greater in the second half, costs appear to have peaked and the other main fibre producers seem determined to push up prices. Courtaulds tends to outperform late in the cycle and as investors tire of the early risers its shares should make up lost ground. On a multiple of about 14.5, assuming full-year profits of Pounds 170m, they take little account of Tencel's potential.</p>

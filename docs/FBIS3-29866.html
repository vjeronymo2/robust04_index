Sales by wholesalers totaled 537.08 trillion yen, down 4.1  percent, while those by retail stores came to 136,376 billion  yen, down 3.8 percent.    Wholesalers and retailers both incurred a drop for the  second  year running for the first time since statistics were taken in  1953, MITI said.    A MITI official attributed the poor performance by  wholesalers to falling fuel and materials prices due to the  strong yen, as well as sluggish personal spending and slack  corporate capital spending, particularly by manufacturers.    Retailers were affected by an increasing consumer tendency  for buying bargain-priced products and a drop in import prices  amid the strong yen, the official said.    On a quarterly basis, sales by wholesalers dropped 3.1  percent in the October-December quarter from a year before,  which was also attributable to the strong yen.    The fourth-quarter sales by retailers fell 3.5 percent,  affected by an unusually warm winter, MITI said.    Business performance among both wholesalers and retailers is  expected to remain stagnant in the near future, the official  said.</p>

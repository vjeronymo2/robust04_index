			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy profit-taking hits share prices THE NEW found confidence of the UK stock market was tested yesterday as uncertainties surrounding Britain's future relationship with the ERM combined with caution over the outlook for Wall Street. A heavy brokerage downgrade of ICI, still a core stock of the London market and of most institutional funds, struck a blow at an international blue chip sector already unsettled by a weaker US dollar. Strategists noted uneasily that defensive sectors, such as the utilities, had returned to fashion and that some sizeable lines of stock had come on offer, although failure to attract buyers kept these potential deals from featuring on the Seaq trading screens. The FT-SE Index, in retreat throughout the session, closed virtually at the day's low, with the fall of 41 points giving a final reading of 2,560. London was discouraged by a lacklustre opening to the new session on Wall Street, itself seen as overshadowed by President Bush's election campaign. The deeper damage came on the domestic front, however, and reflected developments last weekend which indicated that both the UK Conservative government and the Labour opposition are in disarray over policies towards Maastricht and the ERM. Also, suggestions that Britain might be sidelined to a mini-ERM system unsettled City confidence in further cuts in UK base rates; such confidence was not helped by yesterday's rise in Irish interest rates. These uncertainties were sufficient reason for some investors to take profits without waiting for the end of the equity trading account on Friday. The account will also ring down the curtain on the third quarter of the year for fund managers' portfolios. The one point cut in base rates which followed Britain's temporary withdrawal from the ERM generated substantial profits among the retail and consumer-orientated stocks. Many fund managers have evidently decided to take such profits now and put the money into cash for the final two days of the third quarter. Trading volume eased off somewhat yesterday, and the day's Seaq-recorded total of 487.6m shares compared with 693.3m on Friday, when retail of customer business remained high at a worth of Pounds 1.3bn. The value of retail-based equity business has now exceeded the Pounds 1bn daily benchmark level for the past eight trading sessions for a total of Pounds 14.4bn. The strongly bearish review of ICI hurt the market and inspired a general review of the bullish economic view expressed in the City since sterling was effectively devalued. The consumer sectors were challenged by a strong warning from the chairman of Kingfisher, the leading store group, that the fall in sterling could mean higher retail prices. However, share traders stressed that most of the damage to prices yesterday reflected an unwillingness by investors to buy any more stock at the moment. On the wider questions of strategy, fund managers appeared inclined to wait for clarification of the UK government's new economic policies.</p>

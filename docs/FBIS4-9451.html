			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- Various political parties  have recently stepped up their activities in the security  sphere, obviously in connection with the (forthcoming) local  elections, Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml said at a press  conference today.    "I think it would be rather unfortunate for the security  sphere to become a political battlefield. The theme is too  serious. On the other hand, of course, we welcome suggestions  from various political parties, and deal with them with all  earnestness," Ruml said.    Many measures have been taken to regulate mainly common and  economic crime. Certain positive trends can already be  registered, Ruml said.    The Interior Ministry has been dealing with organized crime  within a long-term program. "We have no experience of our own  with the broad organized crime, and we are only beginning to  register some displays of it. We must be seeking our own  solution to this sort of problems...," Ruml said, adding that it  was not possible to copy the legislation of other countries  automatically.    Ruml said experts were considering whether it would be  expedient to pass a separate bill on fighting organized crime,  or merely to amend some provisions of the Penal Code and the Law  on the Czech Police. He gave examples of possible security  measures to be taken, such as the checking of suspect shipments,  confiscation of property originating from organized crime and  its possible use in fighting crime, as well as the detention of  a thing for a certain time if there exists suspicion that the  thing was stolen.    Police experts have been carefully considering the  establishment of institutions of "latent investigators" and the  possibility of a legal provocation of crime, Ruml said.    The protection of personal documents against counterfeiting  is to be an important measure to prevent car thefts. The  ministry has been preparing a new type of certificate on the  technical condition of a vehicle, and evaluating proposals for  the production of personal documents that cannot be  counterfeited, Ruml said. He pointed out that the main problem  in car thefts is that false documents are procured immediately  and the cars are smuggled abroad.    Ruml dismissed the Czech Army's possible assistance in the  struggle against organized crime. The Army is being built for  another purpose, he noted.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (1): Quietly flows the workload - In most European countries activity is declining as the recession bites. The outlook is likely to remain depressed, with little improvement next year. But one glimmer of light is that infrastructure spending is holding up THE GOOD times have ended for European construction. The heavy earth movers, tower cranes and mobile generators, which in the late 1980s gave some of Europe's biggest cities the appearance of one vast building site, are being switched off or dismantled. Construction output is flagging in many countries as economic recession and high interest rates have taken their toll on private investment in new offices, shops and industrial plant. Earnings of contractors and building material companies, as a result, are under pressure as order books and profit margins have declined and competition for a diminishing workload has increased. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Britain where a steady flow of developers, contractors and building material suppliers, including several publicly quoted companies, have been forced into the hands of receivers. Other companies which had embarked on speculative development have had to make large provisions as the value of residential and commercial property has fallen sharply. British construction groups may have come off worse in the recession, but other markets are also suffering. French contractors and building material companies which had expanded aggressively into other European countries, making expensive cross-border acquisitions, have been hit as these markets have gone into recession leaving the former predators themselves weak and vulnerable to takeover. The struggling Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises was snapped up earlier this year by rival French construction group Fougerolle in a deal worth FFr4.6bn (Pounds 468m). Italcementi, Italy's largest cement company, recently bought control of Ciments Francais, France's second biggest cement for FFr6bn (Pounds 611m). Ciments Francais, in particular, had been very active in making cross-border acquisitions, leaving its balance sheet badly stretched as building output across Europe, including France, moved into reverse. French cement sales are forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year with domestic construction activity, particularly in the private sector, expected to stagnate after rising sharply in 1989 and 1990. Construction output in most northern European markets is likely to stand still or decline this year. Growth in Spain - until recently Europe's fastest rising construction market - is expected to slow markedly as a result of economic pressures and as big building programmes for the Barcelona Olympics and the World Trade Fair at Seville come to an end. Delegates attending today's conference in Helsinki held by Euro Construct, which represents European construction research agencies and economic forecasting bodies, will be told that the outlook for most European contractors and building material companies is likely to remain depressed with most countries expecting only a slight improvement in 1993. Even Germany, Europe's strongest construction market, expects growth to slow this year. The cost of integrating the former east German republic is placing an increasing burden on the domestic economy. As a result, building investment opportunities are being restricted in other parts of the country. In some European cities, over-development of offices has left too many empty buildings chasing too few tenants as companies have been shedding labour and closing unwanted premises. Financial services, which had expanded rapidly during the 1980s, has been particularly hit by the recession which has curtailed the activity of industrial and commercial clients. This is most apparent in London, one of Europe's biggest commercial property markets which, at its height in the late 1980s, attracted developers from all over the world, notably from Japan, Sweden and north America. Many of these companies are now regretting their enthusiasm for the British market as the value of their investments has plummeted. Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian-based property developers owned by the Reichmann family, has been brought to its knees by the failure of its ill-fated Canary Wharf office development to attract sufficient tenants in London's former Docklands. The decision to place the development into administrative receivership threatens to cause further hardship to already beleaguered sub-contractors which have been working on the development. According to a report by the British National Economic Development Office (NEDO), about 33m sq ft of office space was either empty or available for occupation in London at the end of last year. This represented 16 per cent of the total office space of the capital and NEDO said it would take six years to occupy at normal letting rates of take-up. As a result, commercial construction in the UK is expected to fall by about a fifth this year and total construction by about 5 per cent. Forecasts to be published at the Euro Construct conference are expected to show falls in output, mostly of around 3 per cent, in the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Output in France, Italy and Belgium is likely to show little or no growth. In Germany and Spain growth rates are expected to dip sharply. There are some glimmers of light. Spending on infrastructure, particularly on transport, is holding up much better than private investment in residential and commercial property. The need for central and local government to make economies has curtailed some of the more ambitious proposals. Nonetheless, infrastructure spending is still rising in some countries although at a slower rate than previously. In the advanced economies of northern Europe there are plans to upgrade many motorways and to reduce congestion and speed the flow of goods and services by constructing high-speed rail links between main cities. If these plans go ahead, the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France will be a crucial link in a revitalised European rail network. In southern Europe the demand is for new construction to provide the roads and services which will allow rising economies to flourish. European construction companies and building material companies seeking to take advantage of new opportunities for work have been busy making acquisitions, taking stakes and forging strategic alliances with local companies mostly in Spain, but also in Greece and Portugal. The decision to remove barriers to free trade between European Community countries at the end of this year has also prompted a spate of cross-border mergers and stakes between between European contractors. French and German companies have been among the biggest spenders among contractors while British building material companies have built up commanding positions in the European roof tile, plasterboard, ready-mix concrete and glass industries. But not every acquisition has been a success. Some German and French companies have had a lean time of it since they bought into British groups at the height of the UK construction market in the late 1980s as the value of their investments has fallen sharply. Hochtief, the West German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp; Tompkins only to see the British construction and property company go into receivership in 1990. Companies such as Ciments Francais in France and Steetley, the British building materials group which made expensive cross-border acquisitions in the 1980s, have themselves been taken over. Steetley, which had become France's biggest aggregates producer earlier this year, fell prey to Redland, a rival British materials group and Europe's biggest roof tile manufacturer, after a bitterly contested fight . Latterly, European contractors and building materials companies have focused on making acquisitions and stake building in the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe. These have a big need for new construction if their fledgling market-driven economies are to thrive. The problem is not in identifying a need for new construction but in finding the money to pay for it.</p>

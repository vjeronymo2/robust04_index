			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / US leading indicators dip 0.1% A small dip in the US Commerce Department's main economic forecasting index in February has helped quench fears of overheating in the economy, but forecasters predict a rebound in March's index as a result of warmer weather. The index of leading economic indicators dropped by 0.1 per cent after rising for six months in a row, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The largest factors in the index's fall, however, were a shortening of the average working week and a decrease in building permits. Both elements were affected by February's severe winter storms, and both rebounded strongly in March. Higher prices for sensitive materials and lower claims for unemployment benefits were among the offsetting factors tending to take the index higher. Private sector economists had generally expected a small drop in the February leading index, which is thought to predict the approximate level of economic activity several months in advance. The Commerce Department said its index of coincident indicators, which is intended to move up and down in line with current economic activity, rose by 0.5 per cent after dropping 0.1 per cent in January. The index of lagging indicators, which provides a trailing signal of economic activity, fell by 0.1 per cent after staying flat in January.</p>

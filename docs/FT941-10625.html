			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World News in Brief: German doll fetches record price A German collector paid a world record Pounds 188,500 for a porcelain doll at London auctioneer Sotheby's. The doll (left), made in 1909 by the German company Kammer and Reinhardt, is thought to have been cast from an experimental mould which was later destroyed and never used in production. The collector has all other dolls in the series made from the mould. Sotheby's sold a similar Kammer and Reinhardt doll in 1989 for Pounds 90,200.</p>

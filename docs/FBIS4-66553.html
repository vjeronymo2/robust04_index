Government's Future is </F> in Question due to the Split Between SP-BSP"]    [Text] Lucknow, 11 March. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and  the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] are drifting  apart. The BSP leaders are openly criticizing the state  government and their relationship is turning sour. The fate of  the government could be in jeopardy because of the difference  between the political cultures of the two parties.    The increasing bitterness between the SP and BSP ministers  and legislators is evident in the U.P. Vidhan Sabha. The  problems of the three-months-old government have increased  because of the tension between BSP leaders Kanshi Ram and SP  leader Mulayam Singh Yadav. Every few minutes, either Kanshi Ram  or Mayavati is taking the government to task. Chief Minister  Mulayam Singh, contrary to his nature, is forced to accept these  insults quietly.    Kanshi Ram's threat that he "will not hesitate in dismissing  this government if it does not work according to [his]  conditions," has angered the SP leadership. The fact is that the  main problem for the SP-BSP coalition has been that there never  was any atmosphere of cooperation among the SP and BSP ministers  and legislators, although the leaders of the two parties may had  some understanding. The statement issued by Mayavati, the BSP  general secretary, proves this. Even SP leaders believe that  Kanshi Ram's saying that the ministers from his party are  treated like peons and Mayavati's argument that their  legislators are not listened to are not considered to be  sentiments that will go away. Kanshi Ram had aggravated this  tension between the parties by telling his legislators and  workers to agitate against the officials and ministers who do  not listen to them. He told them to make public statements to  this effect and bring the issue to the people.    This tension between the two parties has made the government  look pitiable in the Vidhan Sabha and the Vidhan Parishad. On 1  March, when Balram Yadav, a SP cabinet member, announced in the  Vidhan Sabha that there was plenty of sugar and kerosene oil  available in the state and that their prices were under control,  it was Rajbali Yadav, a BSP member, and not the opposition, that  screamed, "The minister is lying. Kerosene oil is being sold at  18 rupees a liter in the state."    This attitude of the BSP legislators and cabinet members is  lessening the feeling of joint responsibility. On 4 March, the  state education minister, Dr. Massaud Ahmed (BSP), and  Shardanand Anchal, the deputy minister in his own department  (SP), continued to contradict each other. Similar situations  took place several times during the current session. When Babu  Ram Verma (BSP) made an objectionable statement against Pandit  Govind Ballabh Pant in the vidhan sabha, Chief Minister Mulayam  Singh apologized immediately and insisted to the chair to remove  that comment from the vidhan sabha proceedings. The BSP did not  like it. The BSP leader Mayavati condemned the chief minister's  action. She told the reporters, "Our legislator was correct. He  was subjected to unnecessary pressure to apologize. Our  legislators will not apologize in the future."    The BSP is acting like an opposition party because it is not  being heard and is deprived of power despite its being in the  government. To protest against the beating of its members while  they were returning from Calcutta after participating in a rally  there, the party legislators stopped several trains bound for  West Bengal. After the caste-related confrontation in Jaunpur,  the BSP took the city under its control for three days.    The BSP leaders and workers also complain that only the SP  leaders have the privileges associated with being in government.  A SP worker was wounded in an attack in Gonda, and he was  transported to a hospital in a helicopter. However, when  Ramanchal Rajbhar, a BSP legislator, was beaten by the police in  Akbarpur, the government did not take any action. He was  transported from Akbarpur to Lucknow in a car. He was in very  serious condition.    The problem for the SP is that Mayavati of the BSP visits  Lucknow every other week and, under the pretext of looking at  the working of the government, makes some statements to put the  government in a difficult position. The problems of the  government increase and the discipline within the party and the  government is adversely affected. Mayavati made major problems  for the government by spewing poison against Mahatma Gandhi. The  Congress (I) has decided to make this an issue. Mulayam Singh is  neither owning up to nor giving up this issue. The comments made  on Mahatma Gandhi and Pant have put the whole government on  trial.    Kanshi Ram and Mayavati's belligerent attitude towards  Mulayam Singh started because of the daily complaints made by  BSP ministers and legislators. The BSP ministers, Education  Minister Dr. Massaud Ahmed, Social Welfare Minister Raj Bahadur,  and Revenue Minister Vishwambhar Prasad Nishad, told their boss  (Kanshi Ram) about their helplessness before the BSP-SP rally in  Allahabad on 5 March. they said that they have to face a lot of  embarrassment in their ministries because of their inability to  do any work at government level. These ministers also raised the  issue of one of their party leader's assassination in Karbi.  They said that the district administration was apathetic in  apprehending the criminals. They said that they had sent a  written complain to the chief minister, but he had not taken any  action. Kansi Ram became angry. He took the government to task  in the very first SP-BSP rally. He Said, "My ministers are  treated like peons. Mr. Chief Minister, this just will not work."    Sone Lal Patel, the general secretary of the BSP, said that  the government officials did not follow up on even the written  orders of the BSP ministers. If pressured, they say that the  chief minister had told them not to do that. If the government  officials do not obey the ministers, what will happen to the  common workers? A fuming Kanshi Ram said, "If Mulayam Singh has  the command over the government, I have the command over Mulayam  Singh. if someone does not listen to you, let me know." The  warning by Kanshi Ram to uproot this government given in this  rally was also the result of this anger.    The tension between the SP and the BSP is also caused by  their social bases. The caste-related confrontations that took  place in Kanpur and Varanasi had resulted from the differences  between the SP and the BSP. In most cases, Yadavs and Kurmis  were agitating against the Harijans. In such a situation, the  government acts to help the party in power [SP]. This is the  reason why officials do not obey and the government has become  helplessness. The tensions have risen from the village and  community level to enter the government.</p>

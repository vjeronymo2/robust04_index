			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil buys 15% of Norwegian Frigg field licence STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday improved its position for future gas exports to Britain by buying 15 per cent of the Norwegian part of the Frigg field licence from Elf Aquitaine Norge, the Norwegian unit of France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine. However, British Gas has broken off negotiations over buying Norwegian gas from the mid-1990s because the price was too high. The Frigg deal, the value of which has not been disclosed, lifts Statoil's stake in the field's licence to 20 per cent, while reducing Elf's Frigg shareholding from 41.42 per cent to 26.42 per cent. It covers only the Frigg field infrastructure and not the few remaining gas reserves. The Frigg field, one of the oldest producing Norwegian gas fields, began production in 1977. Last year's production is estimated at 2.4bn cubic metres, down from a peak of 21.5bn cu m a year in the 1980s. The gas is forecast to run out between 1993 and 1997. Statoil said its stake in the field installations would now match more closely its stake in the Frigg-St Fergus pipeline, the only Norwegian gas pipeline to Britain, in which it has a 24 per cent share. From 1996 Statoil's stake in the pipeline will rise to 29 per cent under an existing swap agreement with Elf. Mr Einar Berg, a Statoil spokesman, said that even when the Frigg field ran out of gas its installations would continue to serve as an important transit centre for future Norwegian gas exports to Britain. Separately, Mr Berg confirmed that British Gas had broken off negotiations with Gasforhandlingsutvalg (GFU), a three-company consortium headed by Statoil, which sells gas on Norway's behalf. British Gas had been negotiating with GFU to purchase 5bn cu m of gas, worth an estimated NKr4bn (Pounds 355m), annually from 1995. The gas, equivalent to just under 10 per cent of current UK demand, would have entered Britain through the Frigg-St Fergus pipeline. The company was negotiating with Norway to buy gas to replace the Frigg field's diminishing supplies. The field used to supply 25 per cent of UK demand, but now only manages eight per cent. British authorities have yet to ratify a deal agreed last April in which National Power would buy 2.2bn cu m of Norwegian gas annually for 15 years from the mid-1990s. The deal - thought to be worth Pounds 150m - is viewed as a test case for the UK government's policy towards Norwegian gas imports following its last minute veto of the giant Sleipner deal in 1985. British authorities maintain that the 1977 Frigg gas treaty will have to be amended to allow more gas to flow through the Frigg-St Fergus pipeline. Amendments to the treaty would have to cover issues such as jurisdiction and approval for gas from new fields to use the pipeline. Mr Berg said: 'We do not view amendments to the treaty as an obstacle to approval of the National Power deal or future new exports to Britain. We see it more as a formality then anything else.'</p>

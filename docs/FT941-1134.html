			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff to raise Pounds 25m Pittencrieff, which in January announced plans to split its oil and gas interests from the rapidly growing US mobile communications operation, is planning to raise Pounds 25m, net of expenses, through a placing and open offer. The proceeds will be used to help fund the cash purchase of a 50 per cent working interest in three oil and gas fields in south Texas for Dollars 38m (Pounds 26m). After the demerger, Pittencrieff's oil and gas business will be renamed Pittencrieff Resources and will apply for a London listing. The Texan acquisition, which is conditional on the demerger, will be made by Pittencrieff America, which will be a subsidiary of Pittencrieff Resources. Pittencrieff Communications, Pittencrieff's 54 per cent owned subsidiary, which is traded on Nasdaq, will also apply for a London listing. Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the proposals should maximise value for shareholders of both Pittencrieff and Pittencrieff Communications. 'The group reorganisation should produce significant commercial benefits for the two business groups, which have distinct operating, financial and investment characteristics.' An extraordinary meeting to approve both the demerger proposals and the acquisition is scheduled for May 16. A second EGM on May 23 would complete the demerger. Pittencrieff shareholders will be offered 1 share in Pittencrieff Resources for every Pittencrieff share held and 5 shares in Pittencrieff Communications for every 24 Pittencrieff shares held. They will also be offered a cash alternative to the Resources shares.</p>

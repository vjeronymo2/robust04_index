Vorobyev, Institute of High Temperatures at </F> Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow]    [Abstract] Research done during the 1969-1991 period  concerning the physical mechanisms of laser-induced plasma  formation above solid targets is reviewed, formation of  low-temperature surface plasma by interaction of laser radiation  and solid targets covering the 10[.sup]5[/]-10[.sup]10[/]  range of radiation intensity being essentially considered here  along with negative and positive technological aspects of the  process. The results of experiments with pulsed  CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers indicate that formation of a plasma above  metal surfaces in air requires a radiation of only about 10  MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in pulses of about 1 s duration  and of only 0.1-1 MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in millisecond  pulses, while breaking down air in the absence of metal surfaces  requires as much as 1-10 GW/cm[.sup]2[/]. Two characteristic  target temperatures have been defined as parameters of the  initial thermal interaction: temperature T* of complete  vaporization and temperature T[.sub]b[/] of boiling or  sublimation under a given pressure of the ambient gas. The  energy relations during thermal stage of target heating to  vaporization and the subsequent stage of vapor ionization are  examined theoretically with the support of experimental data,  for the purpose of determining the threshold laser radiation  intensity and the threshold energy density at the target  surface. Inasmuch as both threshold depend on the mode of  surface plasma formation, the following ones are considered  here: S- by heating of the entire target surface, MD- by heating  of thermally insulated microdefects, A- by heating and  vaporization of aerosol, VGM- by ionization of the target vapor  mixed with ambient gas in the diffusion mode, EF-  hydrodynamically in the presence of an erosion flare. The review  covers plasma formation in these modes above ideally smooth  surfaces of many metals ranging from fusible ones (Zn,Pb) to  refractory ones (W,Ta) including brass, also of carbon and  several oxides (alumina, silica), above surfaces of  nonhomogeneous materials such as aluminum alloys with solid  inclusions of intermetallic compounds, above microdefective  surfaces, and above rough surfaces. Analysis of surface plasma  formation in vapor-gas mixtures in the diffusion mode after  heating of the entire target surface (S-VGM) are considered two  models: quasi-steady vapor distribution within a cloud of finite  dimensions and nonsteady vapor distribution within a cloud in  statu nascendi, atomic and molecular ambient gases being  considered. Analysis of surface plasma in the hydrodynamic mode  in the presence of an erosion flare is based on the model of  vapor breakdown by a ``heat absorption spike'' or the model of  ``avalanche ionization'' in gas layers at the target surface.  Despite the subjectivity of researchers and not always  consistent research data, the thresholds of surface plasma  formation by laser radiation pulses have been in many cases  correctly estimated.

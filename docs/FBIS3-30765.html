Only someone who is crazy could want these air strikes, Owen  said adding however that the present situation in which so many  people were being killed, like in Sarajevo on Saturday, could no  longer be tolerated. He made this statement after his meeting  with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Monday.    The mortar shell, fired Saturday from positions still  undetermined by UNPROFOR, killed 68 and injured almost 200  persons.    Owen described as extremely important his meeting with  Milosevic which was also attended by the second co-chairman on  the conference of the former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg and  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.    One of the main topics discussed was the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and ways of ending it, as well as ways of  preventing tragedies like the one that happened in Sarajevo on  Saturday, Lord Owen said.    In answer to questions about air strikes Owen said he  favoured negotiations and expressed hope that through  negotiations steps would be adopted to prevent tragedies like  the one in Sarajevo.    Concerning his talks Sunday evening with the president of  the  Bosnian Serb Republic Radovan Karadzic Owen said that Karadzic  accepted the proposal to negotiate about the demilitarization of  Sarajevo and its placement under a two-year UN administration.    Lord Owen announced that the talks on Sarajevo set for  Thursday would discuss confidence-building measures and not the  global peace settlement for the Bosnian crisis.</p>

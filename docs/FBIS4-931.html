			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jono Waters] </F>   [Excerpts] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- At least five  people were killed and more than 40 were injured in running  battles between hostel dwellers and Thokoza township residents  on Tuesday [19 April]. But by mid-afternoon calm had returned  to the strife-torn East Rand township as the SA [South African]  Defence Force [SADF] helped the National Peacekeeping Force  [NPKF] restore order.    In the morning, groups of African National Congress  supporters, some armed and others waving party posters, led  several charges on the hostel but were rebuffed by handgun and  automatic fire. SAPA reporters on the scene saw at least five  vehicles ferry wounded victims to Natalspruit Hospital.    Hospital officials told SAPA that by 6PM five people had  died. Police said four people had been killed and reported on  Tuesday morning they had found the bodies of two people in East  Rand townships.    Wits Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said the army was  lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the NPKF's  request. At least a dozen SADF troop carriers rolled down lower  Khumalo Street -- the centre of Tuesday's fighting near the  "Angola" Hostel -- around lunchtime. [passage omitted]    Referring to the IFP's decision to participate in the  election, Mr [Tokyo] Sexwale [ANC official] said it was  regrettable that only after all the deaths in East Rand  townships, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had  finally "capitulated". Mr Sexwale said he did not think  violence would end instantly. "He (Mr Buthelezi) started  something that will take a long time to control."    He also accused Mr Buthelezi of misleading the Zulu people  by  telling them they could now participate in the elections after  maintaining the opposite for so long. Hostel dwellers should  take note of that.    Mr Sexwale vowed to turn the hostels into family units.  "There is seven days left and then we will come to power and  turn them into places where human beings can live."    After his address late on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Sexwale went  to the NPKF headquarters in Thokoza to put forward the ANC's  demands. After more than two hours of negotiations with NPKF  officials he addressed about 300 residents, calling on them to  support the peacekeeping force in the township.    The IFP -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- had  called for the NPKF's withdrawal from the East Rand townships by  5PM on Tuesday. [passage omitted]</p>

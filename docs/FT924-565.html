			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: A&amp;P slides to pre-tax deficit GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, one of the largest US supermarket groups and an investor in Britain's Isosceles group, has reported a pre-tax loss of Dollars 4.38m for the three months to December 5. At the net level, after a Dollars 4.8m tax credit, there was a small surplus of Dollars 422,000. The company has seen steadily declining figures for the past two years, but this is the first time it has dipped into the red at the pre-tax level. The third-quarter loss compares with a profit of Dollars 6.82m in the same period of 1991, and brings the net loss for the first nine months of the year to Dollars 149.4m. This includes the Dollars 89m write-off of the company's investment in Isosceles, taken in the first quarter, and Dollars 91m of non-cash charges related to accounting changes. Sales during the third quarter fell from Dollars 2.61bn to Dollars 2.37bn, and A&amp;P's chairman, Mr James Wood, blamed the 'negative sales comparisons' for the loss. 'Approximately 25 per cent of that reported sales shortfall was due to the Canadian dollar exchange rate softening from last year,' he said. However, Mr Wood added that sales trends in Ontario had finally 'turned around' after two poor years, although sales in key US markets continued to be soft. The company has been badly hit by the relatively weak local economies in Michigan, the mid-West, New England, Canada and the mid-Atlantic states - where about 80 per cent of its stores are based. Yesterday, Moody's, one of the large US rating agencies, said that it was reviewing the long-term debt ratings of A&amp;P with a view to a possible downgrade.</p>

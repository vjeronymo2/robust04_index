			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Japan's Big Four bounce back Japan's Big Four securities companies - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities - have reversed the sharp profits decline of the early 1990s. Earnings for the year to March recovered on the back of increasing volumes on the Tokyo stock market, the domestic bond market rally and aggressive cost cutting. Nomura, the industry leader, saw its pre-tax profits multiply 22 times, while Nikko's increased by 14 times. Daiwa returned to the black, while Yamaichi posted profits for the first time in three years. Earnings were supported by a fourth-quarter jump in stock purchases by overseas investors. Average daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 59 per cent from the previous year to Y396.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn), while lower interest rates supported income from bond trading. Investor interest in south-east Asia boosted investment trust sales. However, activity on the stock market remains much more sluggish than in the late 1980s, and earnings figures are still well below the 1989-90 peak. Nomura made Y50.7bn pre-tax on a 15.7 per cent rise in revenues to Y398.7bn, and an after-tax profit of Y24.9bn. Revenue from stock brokerage commissions rose 50 per cent to Y111.8bn, while the company underwrote Y210bn of issues, up 223 per cent. Bond trading gains rose 6 per cent to Y32.4bn, and it underwrote and distributed Y1,500bn in bonds, up 26 per cent. Daiwa posted pre-tax profits of Y52bn on a 20.2 per cent rise in revenue to Y296.9bn. Commission income rose 45.4 per cent to Y209.4bn and trading income increased 15.4 per cent to Y42.1bn. Nikko reported a pre-tax profit of Y35bn on a 21.1 per cent rise in revenue to Y279.4bn. Stock brokerage commission rose 45 per cent and earnings from bond dealings rose 8 per cent to Y30.4bn. Bond underwriting rose 2 per cent to Y2,845.4bn. Yamaichi posted a pre-tax profit of Y17.9bn and a 25.3 per cent increase in revenue to Y236.2bn. Stock brokerage commission rose 36 per cent to Y78.6bn, while stock underwriting nearly doubled to Y67bn. Bond underwriting rose 25 per cent.</p>

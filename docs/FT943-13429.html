			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Composites rise Composite insurance stocks bounced sharply as some investors sought a leveraged entrance to a rising market and traders marked some issues higher in anticipation of continuing demand. Royal Insurance, up 11 at 257p, experienced the sector's biggest percentage gain as Credit Lyonnais Laing featured the stock as its principal buy in the sector. Analyst Mr David Hudson said that with Pounds 7.2bn of assets in equities and bonds and only Pounds 1.74bn invested by shareholders, the group was the most highly geared to any market rises or falls. 'There is a more confident tone to equities and bonds, and if they rise by 10 per cent the value of shareholder funds rises by 30 per cent,' said Mr Hudson. Commercial Union advanced 19 to 570p and General Accident rose 15 to 585p. Second-quarter figures above analysts' forecasts sent SmithKline Beecham 'A' up 8 to 402p. Hoare Govett pinpointed the 81 per cent growth of new products in the second quarter compared to 61 per cent in the first. And Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs said: 'This was a very good set of results. Clearly, the decline of Tagamet (SmithKline's anti-ulcer treatment which came off patent in the US in May) was much less than forecast.' Shares in rival Glaxo took some heart from the figures, rising 14 1/2 to 582p. They were further boosted by a buy programme covering several leading internationally traded stocks and carried out by a US brokerage. Merrill Lynch was the house named and was also said to have been buying Hanson, up a penny at 255 3/4 p, BP, 5 ahead at 407 1/2 p, and Cable and Wireless, 4 1/2 higher at 432p. Legal &amp; General firmed 3 to 450p ahead of a statement after the market closed which gave details of the new business figures for the first half of the year. Analysts said that although the worldwide new business was down to Pounds 146.3m from Pounds 156.1m, it was far higher than most had expected. Shares in Barclays, the high street bank, slipped a penny to 554p after its life and pensions arm was censured for shortcomings in the training of its sales staff. Airports operator BAA shed 2 to 952p in profit-taking that brought volume of 1.5m. However, the stock is favoured by Strauss Turnbull, which reiterated its buy recommendation. Mr Marshall Whiting at the broker said: 'We like the stock on fundamentals and I think some outperformance is due.' He expects the company to report first-quarter profits of Pounds 110m at the end of this month. Chemicals group Courtaulds lost 2 at 509p following its annual meeting. The shares shed some of the gain notched up as a result of an analysts' visit to Courtaulds sites in Germany last week, but chemicals observers were quietly encouraged by an agm statement, which is traditionally cautious. Recent market arrival Inspec, the speciality chemicals group, was squeezed 16 higher to 222p ahead of its first set of public interim results on August 8. Industrial conglomerate BTR gave up 6 1/2 to 370p in heavy trading of 8.6m after UBS said it was cautious on the stock. Engineering company BM Group firmed 1 1/2 to 35 1/2 p after announcing that Credit Lyonnais Laing was to be its new broker in place of Kleinwort Benson. Vickers moved ahead 6 to 182p after Henderson Crosthwaite recommended the shares. There was a two-way pull in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce which brought turnover of 3.3m as the shares closed unchanged at 194p. A weighty recommendation from investment bank Lehman Brothers is due to land on investors' desks, while US rival United Technologies is expected to report positive news on civil spares later today. A sparkling debut from Yates Brothers Wine Lodges saw the shares come to the market at 140p and close 25 ahead at 165p. Granada shares were said to be upset by a director's stake sale and slid 9 to 530p. Mr Charles Allen sold 145,000 shares at 537p apiece, reducing his holding in the company to 43,239 shares. The perky retail sales report from the CBI helped several stores stocks. Great Universal Stores added 11 at 591p and Marks and Spencer 7 at 435 1/2 p. There were some good performances among the electricity utilities as the sector responded to a variety of different pressures, including interest rate optimism, regulatory issues and broker recommendations. Among the recs, Southern climbed 21 to 614p, Yorkshire 26 to 596p, Norweb 24 to 658p and East Midlands 17 to 604p. Bumper profits from office equipment company Nobo Group saw the shares appreciate 2 to 249p.</p>

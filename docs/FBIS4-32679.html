			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 29 Jun (TANJUG) -- Russian presidential  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin has changed his plans at the last  minute and has decided not to travel to Belgrade today. This  has been learned from Russian sources.    According to the same sources, Aleksey Nikiforov, a  high-ranking official of the Russian Foreign Ministry, will  arrive in Belgrade instead of Churkin late this afternoon.    Nikiforov will arrive from Paris, where he participated in  the work of the contact group. He is expected to brief Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic about the work tomorrow.

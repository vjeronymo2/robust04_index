			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- South Korea lagged behind  the "three Chinas" -- China, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- in terms of  exports so far this year.    According to the trend of exports by South Korea's major  rival countries disclosed by the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. on  Wednesday, South Korea's exports totaled 33.5 billion dollars in  the first five months of this year whereas the amount was 37.5  billion dollars for China and 36.1 billion dollars for Taiwan.    Hong Kong exported 43.1 billion dollars already in the first  four months.    The rate of exports growth was 12 percent for South Korea,  much more than Taiwan's 3.3 percent. But, it was just about  half as high as China's, 24.1 percent.    In the January-May period, South Korean imports reached  39.05  billion dollars, slightly less than China's 39.28 billion  dollars.</p>

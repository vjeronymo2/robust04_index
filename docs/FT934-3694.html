			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Cathay in Airbus contract Cathay Pacific is to buy six long-haul Airbus A340-300 aircraft, costing USDollars 800m, Louise Lucas writes in Hong Kong. Cathay said the aircraft - which can carry 233 or 260 passengers - will enable it to increase profits on traditionally less profitable long-haul routes, such as those between Hong Kong and Amsterdam, Paris, Rome and Zurich. The decision to buy Airbus, rather than Boeing, was based on product suitability. The new aircraft will come on line in 1996-1997. Meanwhile, Cathay is to lease four A340-200s.</p>

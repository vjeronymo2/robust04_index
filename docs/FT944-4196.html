			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prey to the Hong Kong mini-trap Sir, In the article '1000 days of uncertainty' (December 3-4), Simon Holberton and Peter Montagnon state: 'The transfer of sovereignty is full of seemingly innocuous details that turn out to be traps for the unwary.' Indeed so, for they describe the Basic Law as a 'mini-constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong'. While you can have mini-skirts, mini-buses and mini-cars, you cannot have mini-constitutions because sovereignty cannot be parcelled out in mini-portions. Sovereignty is, or is not. Failure to understand this implies a failure to understand anything about the Hong Kong conundrum. PB Harris, emeritus professor of political science, University of Hong Kong</p>

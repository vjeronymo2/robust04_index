			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Russia said on Friday [20  May] that it has approved a new partnership deal with NATO that  would take into account Russia's special status.    The ITAR-TASS News Agency quoted Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev as saying that Russia would join the "Partnership  for Peace" program NATO has offered former Soviet Republics only  if NATO approves Russia's proposals.    The approval came after the 16-member NATO offered a  "special  partnership" to Russia on Wednesday to encourage the country to  join its "partnership for peace" program.    "Russia is interested in a more serious and substantive form  of relations with NATO than envisaged by the Partnership for  Peace program," said Grachev, who is due to visit NATO next week.    Russia has insisted that the "Partnership for Peace" does  not  offer Russia the status it deserves as a big nuclear power.    Reports quoted President Boris Yeltsin as saying NATO may  acknowledge Russia's special status in a protocol within the  framework of the "partnership for peace" or in a separate  bilateral document.    Grachev said he intends to submit Russia's new vision of  European security at next Tuesday's meeting of NATO and former  Warsaw Pact defense ministers in Brussels.    According to ITAR-TASS, Grachev will also make a report on  provisions of Russia's military doctrine, which was approved in  November 1993.</p>

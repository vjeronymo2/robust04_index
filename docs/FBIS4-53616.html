			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Calm Reaction Needed To Foreign Apple Imports"] </F>   [Text] Foreign apples -- on which an import ban had long  been placed because of quarantine problems -- have been put on  the Japanese market for the first time. It is expected that  following New Zealand-grown apples, which had been banned for a  long time, the government will also lift a ban on American  apples. Although there is strong opposition by domestic apple  growers, there will be no reason for the Japanese Government to  reject foreign nations' requests to import when the quarantine  problems are settled technically.    Although Japan's apple market was liberalized in 1971,  almost  no foreign apples have been imported to Japan so far. In fact,  import of foreign apples was prohibited by the Pest Control Law  based on the International Pest Control Treaty.    To clear the problem hampering export of its apples, the New  Zealand Government has made great efforts to establish a  pest-control system. After inspecting New Zealand apples, the  Japanese Government judged that New Zealand-grown apples are  safe to eat, thus lifting the ban last year on New Zealand-grown  apples. This year, the first shipment of New Zealand apples  arrived in Japan. At the same time, it has also become possible  for Japanese apple growers to export their apples to New  Zealand, and a small amount of apples was exported last autumn.    The United States for its part, since 1986, has been calling  on Japan to import American apples. In response, the Japanese  has repeatedly rejected the U.S. demand on the grounds that  quarantine requirements were not met. The United States then  said that Japan is intentionally delaying its granting of  quarantine approval to American apples, repeatedly saying that  the apple trade has become a political problem as one of unfair  trade areas.    Every time the United States applies pressure on Japan, we  have stressed that the quarantine issue should be settled  technically and criticized the U.S. attitude. At the same time,  we have called on the Japanese Government to take fair action.  Last April, the Japanese inspection team made an on-site  inspection of U.S. pest-control methods and systems.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]  recently announced its decision to lift the ban as early as this  autumn on imports of American apples, saying American apples now  meet quarantine requirements. It is a matter of course for MAFF  to decide on imports because the quarantine problems were solved.    Imports of foreign apples give consumers a variety of  options. However, we are concerned about how it will affect  domestic apple growers. Since production costs for American  apples, which are harvested during Japan's off-season, are lower  than Japan's, domestic growers are concerned that imports of  American apples will have a great impact on their jobs.  Meanwhile, some say it is questionable whether American apples  suit Japanese consumers' tastes because American apples are  smaller than Japanese ones and most of them, in general, belong  to the "delicious" type. Production of this type of apple has  sharply decreased in Japan.    Past liberalization of other fruit markets, such as  grapefruit, cherries, and oranges, had less impact on domestic  ones than expected. As for apples, there is no guarantee that  domestic apples will not be affected by foreign apples. But  domestic apples have the advantage of being produced to suit the  Japanese people's tastes. In addition, they are fresher than  foreign apples.    Domestic apple growers should not become unnecessarily  confused. We hope that they will make further efforts to cut  production costs and improve the quality of their apples so that  their competitive power will increase. Producing a higher grade  of apple is one way to attract consumers. In addition,  consumers will probably welcome cheaper and more uncontaminated  apples even if they are not well-shaped or well-colored.    Furthermore, we suggest the domestic apple growers, taking  advantage of this opportunity, seriously consider exporting  their apples. It is said that people in Taiwan and Hong Kong  prefer Japanese apples as gifts. Although the United States  also bans the import of Japanese apples for quarantine reasons,  it is expected to allow Japanese apples to come into the U.S.  market when the Japanese Government lifts the ban on American  apples. We think that Japanese apples are favorably compared  with those grown in other nations. We hope that the domestic  growers will demonstrate the quality of their apples in the U.S.  market.</p>

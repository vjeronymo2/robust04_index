			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TERROR WITHIN' GROWS FROM A MUTANT RAPE  </P> <P> Pro-choicers chagrined by the weight afforded the anti-abortion arguments in  the current movie "Listen to Me" can take heart that a new film has opened  presenting an opposing viewpoint: "The Terror Within" (citywide) comes out  emphatically in support of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, if not in  all instances, at least in cases of rape by a gooey 9-foot-tall mutant.  </P> <P> A plague has wiped out almost all of civilization, save a few scientific types  holed up beneath the Mojave Desert who are overjoyed when pretty Sue (Starr  Andreef) is found pregnant. They assume that the proud papa must be her  blow-dryed biff (Andrew Stevens) and dismiss her contention that it's the  slobbering, toothy "gargoyle" that violated and almost killed her scant days  earlier. Denied the right to an abortion, with neither coat hangers nor the  Supreme Court around, knife-wielding Sue kills herself and her unborn beastie.  </P> <P> Actually, reading "The Terror Within" as an abortion rights parable is giving  the film makers a whopping benefit of the doubt. In fact, it owes less to Jane  Roe than to Joseph Campbell, retelling as it does a familiar, ancient myth --  if, that is, you consider the year 1979, when "Alien" was released, ancient --  with slavish faithfulness. Instead of that movie's "chest-burster," here we get  a couple of womb-bursters. Just the movie for Mother's Day weekend.  </P> <P> The only way to enjoy this "Terror" (MPAA-rated R) is to savor star George  Kennedy's badly synced post-production dialogue and think back to his role in  the sci-fi cheapie movie-within-the-movie in Albert Brooks' "Modern Romance,"  which was full of hilarious bits about the perils of film dubbing. Nine years  later, thanks to producer Roger Corman, Kennedy really is in that movie.  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Observer: Lamentable Small companies welcomed Norman Lamont's Budget measures to encourage big companies to pay their bills on time. So why, ask the approved managers in last November's BT sale, has the government still not paid them? According to government officials, the approved managers, mainly small stockbrokers, submitted inaccurate bills - now they have been sorted out the brokers should get paid next month. Not so, according to the said managers who had been led to believe it could take a year to pay them. Whatever happens, it does not seem likely that the government will pass the Lamont bill-paying test.</p>

On 21 March, 100 guerrillas of the self-styled Liberation  Front of Suriname seized the Afobaka Dam, located 100 km south  of Paramaribo, and mined its main access roads.    The rebel group is holding 30 workers of the Suralco mining  company hostage and threatening to blow up the dam at 1400 today  Dutch time (1300 GMT), leaving Paramaribo without electricity,  if the government does not resign.    In addition to President Venetiaan's resignation, the Front  demands a broad program to improve "the critical economic  situation" as well as health and education services for the  population.    The group is also asking for the withdrawal of a Canadian  company that extracts gold in various concessions in the  interior of the country and that the mining rights be granted to  Surinamers.    In an appeal to the population, Venetiaan asked for a  dialogue with the rebels to reach a peaceful solution to the  conflict, ANP revealed from the former Dutch colony in northern  South America.    The president added, however, that violence does not solve  anything and that "terrorism will never force me to resign."</p>

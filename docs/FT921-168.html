			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Better ways to judge schools effectiveness Sir, a central feature of the present government's education policy is its commitment to publishing average test and examination results school by school, leading to the production of 'league tables'. The education secretary, Kenneth Clarke, argues that such information is of value to parents and others for assessing the effectiveness of any particular school. He also maintains that adjustments to results in order to take account of 'intake' achievement obscures the reality of the figures. We find it difficult to understand how Mr Clarke can persistently ignore the evidence from research around the world, including some funded by the Department of Education and Science itself, which demonstrates the inequity and the misleading nature of such league tables. Because schools differ in terms of the intake achievements of their children, it is quite possible for an extremely effective school to have relatively low test results simply because it has a low achieving intake. Conversely, another school might achieve good results but in reality be quite ineffective in promoting the learning of its children who happen to have a high intake achievement. In this way true excellence may be missed and complacency rewarded. It seems to us that the present policy is in nobody's real interest, least of all that of parents. Furthermore, as the DES has recently acknowledged, there are better ways of attempting to judge the effectiveness of schools, using so-called 'value added' approaches. These approaches are by no means definitive and need to be handled with care, especially in terms of any public comparisons, but they are certainly a great improvement on the crude league tables currently proposed. Whoever forms the next government should re-examine carefully this whole issue.

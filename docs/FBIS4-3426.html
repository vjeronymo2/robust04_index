			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Kyrgyz President Askar  Akayev today expressed the hope that the forthcoming official  visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng to the Central Asian country  will promote ties between the two countries.    Akayev, who is on a visit to Moscow, told XINHUA in an  interview that he viewed Li's visit as a historic event in  Kyrgyzstan's relations with China. He expected it to boost  bilateral cooperation in economy and trade and technological and  cultural exchanges.    Premier Li Peng, who is on a visit to Turkmenistan after a  three- day stay in Uzbekistan, is scheduled to visit Kyrgyzstan  from April 22 to 25, on the third leg of his current five-nation  Asia nation tour.    Li began his 12-day Asia trip on Monday and will travel to  Kazakhstan and Mongolia after visiting Kyrgyzstan.    "China is the only socialist country that succeeds in  economic reforms...and (Kyrgyzstan) can borrow the experience it  has gained in carrying out reforms in stages, especially that in  overhauling agriculture," the Kyrgyz president said in the  50-minute interview.    Akayev, while praising China's peaceful foreign policy, said  that remarkable economic achievements will lead China to a  larger role in maintaining world peace.    The president also expressed satisfaction over the progress  in Sino-Kyrgyz relations since his 1992 visit to Beijing, saying  China is of increasing importance to Kyrgyzstan's foreign trade.    Taking the cooperation in earthquake forecast as an example,  Akayev pointed out that technological cooperation between the  two countries has also been improving over the past two years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at a news </F> conference in Bucharest on 5 April -- recorded]    [Text] In brief, our mutual relations could be described  as very good, I would even say excellent, but we still expect  them to continually and constantly improve. There are many  mutual interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few  minutes ago President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are  our joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing  our cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we  cannot realize much of that and improve the standard of living  and our economies, because of the administrative measures and  sanctions that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th  century, and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries  that consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized.    However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down  such  an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to  the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and  uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other  words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have  to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope,  will do so very quickly.    In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and  friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this.  There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded  today, that good mutual relations between our two countries  represent an important factor of stability in this region. We  rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly  the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the  problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every  reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and  increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries.    We are very satisfied with everything we heard and saw and  we  are convinced in the success of our mutual cooperation.</p>

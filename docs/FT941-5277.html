			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Moldovans reject Romania tie Moldovans overwhelmingly rejected a 50-year-old nationalist aspiration to reunite with Romania in a national plebiscite on Sunday. Moldovans were asked whether they supported 'an independent Moldova within its 1990 borders, which maintains neutrality, establishes ties with other nations and provides equal rights for all citizens.' Of the two-thirds of the electorate who voted, 90 per cent voted Yes to the question. President Mircea Snegur hopes to use the result to lure back the breakaway republic of Trans-Dnestr, which believes that Moldova, 60 per cent populated by ethnic Romanians, is intent on reuniting with Romania.</p>

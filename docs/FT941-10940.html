			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Fortunes of the German bund market are closely tied to those of US markets and the Federal Reserve's move to tighten interest rates on Friday will have repercussions for German government securities. In addition to digesting the US move, the bund market will be looking for domestic signs that the Bundesbank will be able to resume cutting interest rates at the next meeting of its policy-making council on February 17. Positive developments on the wage front - particularly in respect of engineering workers who are today resuming talks for a settlement in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia - will encourage hopes that the Bundesbank will cut rates. Equally important will be the nature of the German central bank's security repurchase operations tomorrow. After months in which the Bundesbank has fixed the repo rate at 6 per cent, a move to a variable tender auction - allowing banks to determine money market rates via their bidding - is likely to be interpreted as a signal that the Bundesbank is preparing itself for a cut in the discount rate. If there is a cut there should be a reversal of some of the downwards price pressure which has afflicted government bunds since December's poor money supply data were released last Thursday.</p>

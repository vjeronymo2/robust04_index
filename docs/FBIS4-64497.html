			<p>BFN     [Text] The Northern League has said that if its own man is  not appointed to the post of interior minister, it will pull out  of the government. The statement was made by Roberto Maroni  from the Northern League a few hours before a scheduled meeting  of the Freedom Alliance.    The League considers the Interior Ministry as its "bottom  line." "We do not have to show why we want this particular  ministry, our demand is a legitimate one. It is up to the  others to explain to us why our demand is not legitimate,"  Maroni said. "If the others cannot give us an adequate  explanation, then I do not think there is much point in talking,  because it means they do not trust us in government. If this is  the case, I do not see why we should be part of the government."</p>

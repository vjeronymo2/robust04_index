The KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, an English-language newspaper,  said  a "solution may be found to the animosity" between Iran and the  United States if Washington could prove it was "sincere" about  improving ties.    "As a first step, Washington should release" billions of  dollars in Iranian assets frozen in the United States since  1979, when Iranian students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran  and held U.S. nationals hostage, it said.    The call by KAYHAN was the first since Tehran ruled out  negotiations with Washington in November, on the anniversary of  the embassy siege, and appeared to put to rest speculation about  attempts to improve ties.    Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties  since  1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the  pro-American shah.    The paper also urged compensation for the relatives of the  passengers of an Iranian civilian airliner downed by the U.S.  Navy over the Gulf.    The Iran Air Airbus was shot down by two missiles fired from  the cruiser USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988, shortly after taking  off from Bandar-e 'Abbas to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.    The United States has maintained that the shooting was an  accident, the plane being mistaken for a military aircraft.    The daily however voiced doubt that Washington would "ever  be  able" to come to terms with the Iranian revolution, or  understand that Iran "could never be forced to yield" under  pressure.</p>

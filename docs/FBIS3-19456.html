A sign of an  "economic revival" is a "reversal of the trend" in the labor  market. At the moment 13,000 more persons are employed than in  mid-March 1993.    As Vranitzky said yesterday at a press conference after the  Cabinet meeting, unemployment went down by 25,000 persons over  the past two weeks. For men, who had been particularly affected  by job cuts in industry, unemployment is 8.5 percent below the  value of March 1993, Vranitzky said. A total of 32,000  foreigners currently are unemployed, compared with 38,000 at the  end of February. Vranitzky stated that the more favorable  development is due to the fact that construction work began  earlier this year. He expects the latest development to have a  positive effect on the referendum for membership in the European  Union.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 17 (AFP) -- Pakistan Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto has yielded to Moslem militants and agreed to  introduce Islamic Sharia law in part of northern Pakistan  following clashes with security forces Monday [16 May] in which  10 people were killed.    The government issued a decree late Monday following the  disturbances in Malakand region announcing the immediate  introduction of the Sharia to replace the existing civil code.    Bhutto, 40, who favours a modern and liberal interpretation  of Islam, ceded to a small clerical party, Tehrik-e-Nifaz Sharia  (Movement for the Introduction of Sharia), which had mobilised  tens of thousands of people behind its militant religious stand.    Malakand, in the northwest, is a rural and mountainous  region  of Pakistan, populated by Pashtuns, a heavily armed ethnic  group, fiercely proud of its traditions and autonomy.</p>

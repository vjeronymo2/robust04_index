			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Retailers warned of rise in consumer cynicism RETAILERS will confront a changed world once the recession is over, with consumers being more sophisticated, more cynical and more cost-conscious than ever before, Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher group, told the first day of the Financial Times conference on retailing yesterday. He warned retailers that in the run-up to the year 2000 retailers would have to take note of such changes if they were to survive, and predicted that there would be no repetition of the consumer-credit boom of the 1980s. Between 1982 and 1990 total consumer credit expanded from Pounds 15.5bn to Pounds 52bn, but Mr Mulcahy said he anticipated much slower growth, to perhaps Pounds 70bn, by the end of the decade. Changes in lifestyles and attitudes would make customers far more demanding, imposing additional costs on retailers. Mr Mulcahy said that, for example, a higher percentage of women would be employed full-time and would thus have far less time to shop, which would add to pressures for stores to have longer opening hours. By 1996 the number of people aged between 35 and 59 in the UK will outnumber those in the 16-24 age range. This ageing of the population would lead to a shift in demand for certain categories of products. He also predicted that the growth of 'green' consumerism would increase pressure on retailers to scrutinise the environmental impact of their products and practices. Mr Mulcahy said successful companies would have to lift levels of productivity to increase profitability by increasing sales volumes without increasing the amount of floorspace they used. Mr Andrew Wileman, a partner with OC&amp;C strategy consultants, part of the accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, defined two types of retailer - 'proximity retailers', which operated near where consumers lived, and 'destination retailers', which relied on persuading consumers to travel to them. Mr Wileman predicted a considerable growth in both categories. He said successful companies in destination retailing - such as Toys R Us - were those that were 'geared to deliver high volume at low gross margins'. Mr Malcolm MacLachlan, executive director and retail analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London investment banking arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, said that among the main European economies Germany and France were going to have the best economic prospects in the 1990s, and therefore the best outlook for retail consumer spending. He added that the worst prospects were in Sweden and the UK.</p>

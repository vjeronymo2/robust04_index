			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A meeting of the advisory board of the  North-South Forum on African continent is being held in Harare,  Zimbabwe. On one side are the African leaders; on the other are  the donor countries, and between them a climate of  Afro-pessimism reigns. The international powers are becoming  increasingly tired of the conflicts on the African continent and  the aid is changing direction, namely it is being directed  toward east European countries. This was confirmed by Briosa e  Gala, Portuguese secretary of state for foreign affairs, who is  representing our government at the meeting.    [Begin Briosa e Gala recording] Today, an Afro-pessimism is  gradually growing about the state of Africa's development on the  part of many European countries and of the United States.  Unfortunately, Africa now represents only 1 percent of world  trade, it continues to be affected by violent and cruel wars,  and all this creates a certain fatigue in the international  community, which in many cases prefers to support other areas,  for example eastern Europe.

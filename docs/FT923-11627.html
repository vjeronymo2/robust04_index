			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pacific Horizon puts new proposals THE TWO month-old battle for control of Pacific Horizon Investment Trust yesterday took a new turn when its directors despatched a circular to shareholders offering new proposals for its future and notifying them of two rival extraordinary meetings next month. The circular calls on them to vote against proposals from Jupiter Tyndall Merlin, the fund management group which manages Pacific Horizon, to restructure the trust. Instead, the board recommends the appointment of Baillie Gifford, the Scottish fund management group, as investment manager. It also wants to widen the trust's investment policy to include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, and to bring its final year forward by 12 months to 1996. The move comes less than a week after Jupiter Tyndall said it was in discussions with another investment trust for a possible offer for Pacific. In June, Jupiter Tyndall blocked an agreed bid for Pacific Horizon by Martin Currie Pacific and requisitioned an EGM to appoint new directors and restructure the trust. Jupiter Tyndall later turned down a request from the board to withdraw its requisition until after it had published details of a new offer. The two EGMs, one convened by the board and the other requisitioned by Jupiter Tyndall are both scheduled for August 18.</p>

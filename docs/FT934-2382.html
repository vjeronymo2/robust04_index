			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: London Electricity jumps 34% London Electricity's airport distribution network, bought from BAA in March, helped the company lift pre-tax profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 69.9m in the six months to end-September. The airports arm made an operating profit of Pounds 5.3m in the half and the company expects a contribution of about double that for the full year. Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said the business was a long term investment which would make increasing contributions to earnings London Electricity was also helped in the half year by its decision to withdraw from retailing. Losses in the operation were eliminated, whereas in first half of last year they were Pounds 4.6m. The company's aim of reducing its payroll by 2 to 3 per cent a year was exceeded in the first half when staffing fell by 452 to 5,212, with the help of the retail disposals. Reductions in the core business amounted to 151. The company has cut 1,500 jobs since privatisation, 1,000 of them in the core businesses. COMMENT The 32 per cent dividend increase is rather more spectacular than it may seem. Assuming the company sticks to its line of paying two thirds of the full year payment in the second half then the total of 22.2p will be only fractionally higher than the market was already expecting. Nonetheless, there was enough in yesterday's results to justify the recent rise in the share price. They demonstrate the value of getting out of retailing at a time when some other regional companies are struggling to justify persevering in it. The move into the airports company, the most significant acquisition by any rec, also looks astute as it will provide growing earnings in a safe, if dull, business which London is well qualified to run. At group level, yesterday's managerial appointments also represent a significant strengthening of the board. The shares are trading on a prospective yield of about 4.3 per cent. That seems about right this side of the regulator's review of the recs' distribution businesses. The market remains nervous about London's relatively high cost base and its task is to persuade the regulator that the costs are entirely a result of operating in the capital.</p>

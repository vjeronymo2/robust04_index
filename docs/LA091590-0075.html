			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIREWORKS ISSUE TO BE PUT BEFORE VOTERS IN CARSON  </P> <P> Voters in Carson will be asked in November whether the city should ban a  traditional Fourth of July feature: fireworks.  </P> <P> The advisory question, placed on the Nov. 6 ballot by the City Council this  summer, asks whether the sale of so-called safe and sane fireworks should  continue.  </P> <P> Safe and sane fireworks refer to those permitted under state law unless cities  or counties ban them. They include sparklers, smoke "snakes," cone-shaped  fountains that spout multicolored sparks and "party poppers" which emit paper  streamers with a satisfying pop. Nonprofit charitable organizations, which  market the fireworks to raise money, are allowed to sell the items from June 28  to July 6.  </P> <P> Proposition F pits the fireworks industry and charity organizations against  opponents, especially public safety officials, who are concerned about the  potential for fireworks-related fires.  </P> <P> Hawthorne, Inglewood and Lawndale are the other South Bay cities that allow  safe and sane fireworks. Most recently, the Lomita City Council prohibited  sales and use in 1986 after voters endorsed a similar advisory measure against  fireworks.  </P> <P> This past summer, 28 charitable organizations in Carson sold fireworks to raise  money for their various programs, netting an average of $4,000 to $5,000 each,  according to city officials. Business license and application fees connected  with the sales earned the city $4,200.  </P></p>

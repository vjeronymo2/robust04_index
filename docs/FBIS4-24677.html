			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The agriculture-based  county towns of Ninghai and Beiyuan, in east China's Shandong  Province, last year recorded a total industrial and service  output value of over five billion yuan (about 577 million U.S.  dollars).    With the advent of the reform and open policies some 15  years  ago the local farmers turned to industry and the service sector.  Most of the farmers become industrial workers, service  attendants or managers. Their average per capita income  multiplied.    In the past ten years the township economy has developed  rapidly in Shandong. The towns are now mostly equipped with  water, electricity and program-controlled telecommunications as  well as with department stores, schools and post offices.    Last year Shandong's total industrial and agricultural  output  value reached 696 billion yuan, a great increase over the  previous year. The gross domestic product (GDP) was 270.09  billion yuan, 4.3 times the figure for 1980.    The provincial government is developing small towns to  absorb  the surplus labor from the countryside. It is planned to  transfer 10 million rural laborers from agriculture to the  industrial and service sectors within six years.    In the construction of small towns the local government  takes  into account of their locations, natural resources and economic  foundations, in order to build each town into a regional center  for politics, economy, culture and communications.</p>

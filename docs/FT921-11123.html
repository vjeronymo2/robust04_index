			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Democrats start worrying about Clinton's chances DOUBTS about Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner for the Democratic party's nomination for the US presidency, are surfacing among party leaders in Congress. In the wake of adultery allegations against Mr Clinton, Mr Dick Gephardt, majority leader in the House of Representatives, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the party's vice-presidential candidate in 1988, are reported to be considering entering the campaign if further allegations are made against Mr Clinton. Mr George Mitchell, majority leader in the Senate, said on television yesterday a 'substantial' number of senators had urged him to run. But he added: 'I do not intend to be a candidate.' Senator Mitchell said Mr Clinton's chances of winning the Democratic nomination had been 'hurt' by the charges of marital infidelity which first surfaced three weeks ago in a supermarket magazine. The tabloid paid the woman who made the charges, a former Arkansas state employee and cabaret singer, and the story was repeated in the national press. Mr Clinton admitted he had been unfaithful to his wife Hillary, a fellow Yale law graduate, during their 16-year marriage. But he denied the specific allegations in a nationwide television interview a week ago and called on the press to show restraint. Reporters covering the campaign have since been exhorted to 'stick to the issues' - a tactic supposedly aimed at avoiding a repeat of the trivia-laden 1988 campaign, but one which in fact helps Mr Clinton, who spews out statistics and five-point plans without missing a beat. Congressional Democrats, having watched the party lose five of the last six presidential elections, have been unnerved by the charges. They believe that, even if Mr Clinton survives the present fracas in the primaries, he would face a torrid contest against President George Bush's Republicans in November's presidential elections. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, the latest CNN/Time magazine poll shows Mr Bush's popularity slipping nationwide as well as in the state of New Hampshire, site of the first important primary election for both parties. The president's approval rating stands at 44 per cent, half the level after the Gulf war. In New Hampshire, he stands at 52 per cent, with the number of undecided Republican voters rising.</p>

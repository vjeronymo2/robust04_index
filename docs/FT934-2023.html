			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: The deal is done ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UP TO NOW  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial Tariffs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The backbone of previous Gatt rounds. Tariffs on manufactures average 5 per cent in rich countries, down from 40 per cent in the late 1940s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High farm subsidies and protected markets in Europe and US lead to overproduction and dumping of cut-price surpluses, squeezing exports of more efficient producers. Farm supports by OECD countries amount to Dollars 354bn in 1992.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- No international trade rules cover services such as banking and insurance, transport, tourism, consultancy, telecommunications, construction, accountancy, films and television, and labour services. Countries protect industries from foreign competition.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Intellectual Property  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Standards of protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks vary widely. Ineffective enforcement of national laws a growing source of trade friction. Trade in counterfeit goods reaches alarming levels.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Textiles and Clothing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rich countries restrict since 1974 imports of textiles and clothing through bilateral quotas under Multi-Fibre Arrangement. Countries maintain high textile import tariffs. Protection raises prices but fails to protect jobs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Countries allowed to combat dumping (exports priced below domestic prices) with anti-dumping duties. Anti-dumping actions proliferate and increasingly seen as disguised form of protectionism.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidised exports can be countered with countervailing duties but, like anti-dumping duties, are cause of growing trade tension and increased disputes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguards  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguard actions protect domestic industry from sudden import surges which threaten serious injury. EU and US especially bypass non-discrimination obligation by pressuring countries to concede 'voluntary' export restraints and other measures of doubtful legality.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt Rules  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt remains much the same as when drafted in 1940s even though many more countries have since entered world trading system. Trade patterns have shifted, and new forms of protection have sprung up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Barriers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Product regulations and standards extensively used by governments to ensure products are safe for consumers and the environment. Varying standards can be disguised trade barriers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Government Procurement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Procurement covered by Tokyo Round agreement which opened many areas to international competition: 12 signatories (EU counting as one).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World Trade Organisation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt originally envisaged as part of the International Trade Organisation (third pillar of Bretton Woods institutions alongside World Bank and IMF). ITO not ratified and Gatt still applied provisionally.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dispute Settlement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt increasingly deals with intractable disputes. Procedures do not cover some important areas such as intellectual property and services, and countries increasingly ignore recommendations.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT'S TO COME  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial Tariffs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tariffs on industrial goods cut by rich countries by more than a third. Over 40 per cent of imports enter duty-free. Key traders scrap duties for pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer, furniture, farm equipment, spirits, wood, paper and toys.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade-distorting subsidies and import barriers cut over six years. Domestic farm supports reduced 20 per cent. Subsidised exports sliced 36 per cent in value and 21 per cent in volume. All import barriers converted to tariffs and cut 36 per cent. Japan's and South Korea's closed rice markets gradually open. Tariffs on tropical products cut by over 40 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rules framework for basic fair-trade principles such as non-discrimination. Special provisions for financial services, telecommunications, air transport and labour movement. Individual countries pledge market opening in wide range of sectors. Further talks on telecommunications and financial services.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Intellectual Property  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Extensive agreement on patents, copyright, performers' rights, trademarks, geographical indications (wine, cheese, etc), industrial designs, microchip layout designs, trade secrets. International standards of protection, and requirements for effective enforcement. Extra time for developing countries to put rules in place.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Textiles and Clothing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MFA quotas progressively dismantled over 10 years and tariffs reduced. Developing countries reduce trade barriers. Normal Gatt rules apply at end of 10 years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clearer rules for conduct of investigations and criteria for determining dumping and injury to industry. Duties lapse after five years. Rules covering circumvention of anti-dumping duties by relocating production.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Definition of which subsidies are legal or not: some prohibited, some non-actionable (eg research or regional development). Others actionable if they harm competitors. More leeway for developing countries. Further talks on civil aircraft subsidies.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguards  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rules for conduct of investigations laid down. Measures not to exceed four years and progressively liberalised over their lifetime. Grey-area measures phased out and future use prohibited.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt Rules  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Many revised, improved, updated. They include codes on customs valuation and import licensing, and provisions on state-trading enterprises, customs unions and free-trade areas, waivers from Gatt rules, and measures allowing countries to raise trade barriers for balance-of-payments reasons. Rules covering pre-shipment inspection, rules of origin and trade restrictions on foreign companies.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Barriers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Better rules to ensure technical norms, testing and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade and to encourage harmonisation around international standards but not preclude governments opting for higher standards. Rules dealing with animal and plant health and safety measures.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Government Procurement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Enlarged coverage in separate accord to include services, public works, procurement by regional and local governments and public utilities. Separate telecommunications negotiations next year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World Trade Organisation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt becomes permanent world trade body covering goods, services and intellectual property rights with a common disputes procedure. World Trade Organisation implements results of Uruguay Round.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dispute Settlement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rules increasing automaticity and reduce delays in adoption and implementation of reports. Provision for binding arbitration and appeals. Single disputes procedure for all trade areas.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN IMPACT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial Tariffs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Easier access to world markets for exporters of industrial goods. Lower prices for consumers. Higher-paying jobs through promotion of competitive industries.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Restraint of farm subsidies war. Lower food prices for consumers in currently protected countries. Better market opportunities for efficient producers. Special treatment for developing countries, though higher world prices could hurt poor food-importers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Boost for trade in services, currently worth Dollars 900bn a year in crossborder trade and another Dollars 3,000bn in business of foreign subsidiaries. Further liberalisation to be negotiated.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Intellectual Property  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Boost for foreign investment and technology transfer, though poor countries with weak patent protection fear higher prices for drugs and seeds.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Textiles and Clothing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Developing countries able to sell more textiles and clothing abroad. Reduced prices for consumers worldwide because of fairer textiles and clothing trade (worth Dollars 248bn in 1992).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- More difficult to use anti-dumping actions for trade harassment. Harder to dodge duties by relocating.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tighter curbs on subsidy use, especially for exports. More difficult to use anti-subsidy actions for trade harassment.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguards  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower prices for consumers and importers. Better access to markets for efficient producers. Increased pressure on inefficient producers to come up to scratch.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt Rules  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Greater transparency, predictability and security in trading policies to promote respect for fair-trade disciplines.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Barriers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reduction in costs of complying with different standards and regulations. Environmental and consumer groups fear higher standards than international norms may be discouraged.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Government Procurement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value of procurement contracts subjected to open international bidding could rise from Dollars 32bn in 1990 to over Dollars 1,000bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World Trade Organisation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Boost to the status of international trading rules, and more effective advocacy and policing of the open trading system.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dispute Settlement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Harder to block panel judgements. Speedier and more automatic procedures to enhance WTO's authority in settling disputes. Restraint of US unilateral action by inclusion of virtually all trade in the multilateral system.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

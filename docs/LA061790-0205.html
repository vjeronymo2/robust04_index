			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ATHLETICS LEAVE NO DOUBT IN CHICAGO, 12-3  </P> <P> After nearly falling into second place Friday night, the Oakland Athletics  wasted no time in dispensing with the White Sox Saturday night at Chicago.  </P> <P> The Athletics scored seven times in the first inning and, after a one-hour rain  delay in the sixth inning, romped to a 12-3 victory to build their lead in the  American League West to three games.  </P> <P> Another sellout crowd of 44,176 at Comiskey Park had little to cheer.  </P> <P> A two-run double by Doug Jennings was the first big hit off Melido Perez (6-5),  who gave up five hits and seven runs in two-thirds of an inning, his shortest  stint of the season.  </P> <P> "We were well aware of the way Perez had been pitching," Manager Tony La Russa  of the Athletics said. "But something like this can happen to anyone. We just  got to him before he could establish himself. It was just one of those days."  </P> <P> Terry Steinbach, who singled in a run in the first inning, hit a two-run home  run and Rickey Henderson also homered.  </P> <P> Scott Sanderson (8-3) went eight easy innings and improved his road record to  6-1.  </P> <P> The White Sox won the first game of the four-game series Thursday to pull  within a game of the lead in the American League West. Then, they were five  outs away from taking over first place Friday when the Athletics rallied in the  eighth inning.  </P> <P> With Saturday's game out of hand, Manager Jeff Torborg rested his bullpen and  brought in utilityman Steve Lyons to pitch. Lyons gave up a run and two hits in  two innings.  </P> <P> He struck out newcomer Steve Howard, who was making his first appearance after  the Athletics traded away designated hitter Ken Phelps to Cleveland.  </P> <P> The crowd was the biggest for the White Sox, playing their last season in  Comiskey Park, since the 1983 League Championship Series.  </P> <P> Boston 6, Baltimore 3 -- Winner Mike Boddicker (8-3) struck out seven and gave  up seven hits -- four by Phil Bradley -- in eight innings at Baltimore.  </P> <P> "I've been using my fastball and getting a lot of outs with it, " Boddicker  said. "I'm getting after it. If I could have handled Bradley, it would have  been an easy outing. I hit some pretty decent spots."  </P> <P> Wade Boggs, hitless in 13 previous at-bats, had three hits, including his  fourth home run, for Boston.  </P> <P> The Red Sox, battling for first place in the East, have won 10 of their last 14  games. The Orioles have lost four in a row, all at home.  </P> <P> Cleveland 10, Milwaukee 9 -- The Brewers had a 7-2 lead in the eighth inning at  Cleveland, blew the lead, came back to tie, then lost it when first baseman  Greg Brock argued a call instead of throwing home.  </P> <P> The Indians scored seven runs in the eighth inning, three on rookie Carlos  Baerga's three-run double, to take a 9-7 lead.  </P> <P> It was 9-9 when Jerry Browne led off the bottom of the ninth with a walk. With  runners on first and second and one out, Brook Jacoby hit what appeared to be  an inning-ending double play ball to pitcher Bob Sebra. Sebra threw to second  but Bill Spiers' throw to first pulled Brock off base. While Brock turned to  argue, Browne raced home with the winning run.  </P> <P> "I gambled and I won," Browne said. "I don't think he (Brock) was expecting me  to go. He was arguing, and by the time he turned around, I was already  breaking. I was going all the way."  </P> <P> Brock said he tagged Jacoby on the foot. "When I caught his foot and tagged him  -- between trying to hold onto the ball and thinking he was out -- I hesitated.  It was just enough."  </P> <P> Paul Molitor had three hits, including two doubles, scored three runs and drove  in two for the Brewers.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Minnesota 3 -- The Royals' Danny Tartabull hit a two-run home  run at Kansas City to extend his hitting streak to nine games.  </P> <P> Tartabull has four home runs and eight runs batted in during his streak. The  Royals have won three in a row and extended the Twins' losing streak to nine  games.  </P> <P> Toronto 2, New York 1 -- Pat Borders singled in the winning run in the 11th  inning at New York for the Blue Jays' fifth consecutive victory and ninth in  their last 10 games.  </P> <P> Borders hit a line drive to left-center field with two outs to score Rance  Mulliniks from second base.  </P> <P> Frank Wills (5-2) won in relief as the Yankees lost for the 11th time in the  last 14 games.

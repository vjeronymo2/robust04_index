			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenyang, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Liaoning Province, a major heavy industrial base, has abolished  its 40-year-old practice of imposing mandatory production  targets on industrial enterprises, according to an announcement  here today.    In the early years of the founding of the People's Republic  of China the government designated 156 key construction  projects, 24 of them in Liaoning.    At one time 80 percent of the province's industrial  production was decided by state mandatory plans.    But since 1985 the province has gradually cut the portion of  mandatory industrial production, along with the rapid progress  of the reform and opening drive nationwide, especially the  adoption of a market economy.    The industrial production based on mandatory plan was cut to  36 percent in 1992, and further down to 12 percent last year.    With the abolition of the mandatory plan for industrial  production, the provincial government has to adjust its function  from issuing orders to providing services for industrial  enterprises.    By studying industrial policies and market changes, the  government has strengthened macroeconomic control over  industrial enterprises.    This measure is aimed at pushing enterprises onto the  market.    This may bring about some difficulties for some of them, but  the majority welcome the new move, according to officials with  the provincial planning committee.</p>

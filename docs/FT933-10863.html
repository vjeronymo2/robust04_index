			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Insurer launches NHS trust scheme A NEW medical insurance plan that provides treatment in National Health Service trust hospitals rather than the private sector is to be launched today. Norwich Union Healthcare estimates that insurance under its Trust Care scheme will be 25 per cent to 30 per cent cheaper than its full-cover policies. Trust Care offers many of the regular benefits of health insurance policies but excludes the use of private hospitals. Patients will instead receive treatment in private wings of NHS trusts. The development is likely to alarm the private hospital sector, which is already concerned that since the 1991 NHS reforms some trust managers have started encouraging consultants to carry out private practice on NHS premises rather than in independent hospitals. Norwich Union's marketing material for the new plan describes it as an affordable medical insurance policy that has been developed 'in conjunction with NHS hospitals'. Mr David Cavers, managing director of Norwich Union Healthcare, said the scheme would bring 'high-quality medical cover within the reach of individuals and families who may not have previously considered it', while generating income for the NHS. Norwich Union has compiled a list of 'preferred' trust hospitals that have agreed to provide treatment - normally with single room accommodation - and settle bills direct with the insurer. The list contains many of the NHS's best-known hospitals including Guy's-St Thomas', University College-Middlesex, St Mary's, Royal Brompton, King's College, Charing Cross, the Royal London and the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London; Papworth in Cambridge; Leeds General Infirmary; and the Queen Elizabeth, Birmingham. Private wings and pay beds have always been a feature of the NHS and since the introduction of market-based reforms hospital managers have been trying to increase income by revamping these facilities. But low bed occupancy is a feature shared by some NHS private wings and independent hospitals. Norwich Union estimates that bed occupancy in NHS private facilities nationally averages about 30 per cent. Mr Ian Robertson, business manager of the Lindo private wing at St Mary's, Paddington, said that involvement in Trust Care would help to ensure that the hospital's private facilities were used efficiently while not affecting the provision of public beds. The scheme would be 'providing care and comfort comparable with the private sector while channelling funds back into the hospital'. The new scheme from Norwich Union, one of the most forceful recent entrants to the health insurance market, would cost Pounds 19.64 per month for a 27-year-old in Oxford, Pounds 30.65 for a 29-year-old in inner London and Pounds 64.92 for a typical family. An NOP Omnibus survey for Norwich Union showed that eight out of 10 people believed the NHS should be able to generate income from its private facilities.</p>

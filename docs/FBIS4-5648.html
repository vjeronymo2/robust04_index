			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist  Ichiro Ozawa urged the ruling coalition partners on Wednesday to  reconcile their differences on four key policy fields, including  Japan's policy toward the suspected North Korean nuclear arms  program.    Ozawa told a news conference that the coalition parties, in  launching a new administration, need to narrow their difference  over the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's tax system reform,  basic defense and foreign policies, as well as administrative  reform combined with deregulation.    Ozawa made the remarks a day after Shinseito head and  Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata emerged as the most probable successor to  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation  last Friday. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is regarded  as the de facto top leader of the party.    Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is  tipped to become chief cabinet secretary under Hata.    Ozawa has been advocating a tougher stand over North Korea's  refusal to let international monitors fully inspect its nuclear  facilities.    The SDP, the biggest party in the ruling coalition, has  called for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through  dialogue, rather than slapping economic sanctions on Pyongyang.    The SDP has maintained friendly ties with North Korea and  has  sent goodwill delegations of its legislators there in the past.</p>

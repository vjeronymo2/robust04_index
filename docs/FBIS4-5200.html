			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Caoimhin O. Bearain: "P. Penh's smoking photos </F> turn out to be hot air"]    [Text] Even by the usual shaky standards of Phnom  Penh-Bangkok relations, Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince  Norodom Ranariddh dropped a diplomatic hydrogen bomb when he  said that the notorious Khmer Rouge [KR] boss, Pol Pot, had  escaped the government's recent offensive on Pailin by driving  into Thailand.    When faced with accusations of support or assistance to the  Khmer Rouge, Bangkok's indignant response has always been to  dismiss them as groundless and to challenge the accuser to  provide proof.    Prince Ranariddh, speaking to reporters during a break in  Tuesday's first meeting of the second session of the country's  parliament, didn't brandish any proof on the spot but said he  had photos that Thailand would not be too happy about.    The prince's photos allegedly show Pol Pot fleeing Pailin in  a convoy of cars and trucks.    While this did not immediately seem like damning and  conclusive evidence of Thai collusion, the Prince said it was  the escape route that was the giveaway -- a smooth tarmac road.    "Cambodia does not have such roads," he said.    Later on Tuesday, the prince denied he had photos on  state-run television and jokingly tried to down-play the whole  affair.    The prince said that if he had such photos, he would have  sold them. "The Japanese press said they would give a million  dollars for photos of Pol Pot."    In Thailand, meanwhile, the allegations were creating  predictable fallout, but given their high-level origin, the Thai  response was tempered.    "Groundless," and potentially destructive to Thailand's  image, said army spokesman Lieutenant General Anuson  Kritsana-seni.    The prince's cabinet issued a clarification stating the  prince had said that he had photos of "Pol Pot's men travelling  on a road that we do not have."    But three of the Cambodian reporters who were present when  the prince spoke told THE NATION they stood by the original  translation of the prince's remarks although they added the  prince was speaking quickly and digressing a lot.    Listening to a tape-recording of the comments, a senior  Cambodian news editor expressed his surprise: "Oh my God, he  really did say it."    One of the prince's advisors, however, said he used the `Pol  Pot' in a commonly used generic manner.    Prince Ranariddh's reference to the photos did not come in  an  isolated outburst.    The prince strongly criticized Thailand for its repatriating  Khmer Rouge refugees, who had fled into Thailand from Pailin,  back into guerrilla-controlled zones.    The move had already drawn angry words from Foreign Minister  Prince Norodom Sirivut.    Despite the joint communique signed by the prince, fellow  co-premier Hun Sen, and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai which  reaffirms Thailand's recognition of the royal government, the  prince once again called on Thailand to clarify whether Bangkok  supported the guerrillas or the government.    Referring to the photos, a government official said it may  have been a genuine slip of the tongue or the prince may have  been using the advance-retreat style of verbal politics, which  his father King Norodom Sihanouk is famous for.    The prince made the comments to perhaps put the limelight on  Thai-Khmer Rouge connections and then denied the comments for  diplomatic damage control, the officials said.    If that was the intention it was rather poorly or  strategically co-ordinated because once Prince Ranariddh backed  off, Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut entered the fray.    Speaking in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday, Prince Sirivut accused  the Thais of playing a double game".    Diplomats here said the Thai government is probably sincere  in recognizing Phnom Penh and wishing to cut off links with the  recalcitrant Khmer Rouge faction but he questions whether  Bangkok's sway extends all the way along the border, large  tracts of which are under martial law.    The foreign minister reflected this attitude when he asked  whether the Thai government and Thai army were "speaking the  same language."    One Western diplomat said he thought the Thais were not  getting fair deal as the Cambodian government portrays the Khmer  Rouge as outlaws and expects others to act in a similar way but  at the same time the government allows the radical faction to  maintain a legitimate presence in Phnom Penh -- the Khmer Rouge  have an office in the grounds of the city's royal palace where  officials pour through the local media looking for tales of  corruption in high places which they then fax to their jungle  colleagues who use the information in anti-government diatribes  on the guerrillas' clandestine radio.    They noted that this latest diplomatic tempest blew up just  after the Thais brought the Phnom Penh press corps on a  three-day all-expenses-paid visit to border areas in an attempt  to lay to rest rumours and allegations of Thai support for the  Khmer Rouge. The trip, however, got off to an ominous start  when the army chief of the psychological operations [psy-ops]  division pointed to a map to show the various posts and  checkpoints on the itenerary.    The Map, which was just a sketch had Thailand written on one  side of the frontier and Democratic Kampuchea on the other.  Democratic Kampuchea was the name given to Cambodia by the  Khmer Rouge during their 1975-79 reign of terror and is still  the faction's official title.    Since the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese  invasion, the country has been called the People's Republic of  Kampuchea, the State of Cambodia and now the Kingdom of Cambodia.    When a reporter queried the blunder on the map the officer  looked puzzled.    An official from the embassy in Phnom Penh was seen to  cringe  as the psy-ops officer was updated by his colleagues.    The border trip itself proved inconclusive as, in keeping  with a frontier, there were two sides to most of the stories  told.</p>

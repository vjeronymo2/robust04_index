			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Call To Prevent the Liquidation of Slovak </F> Radio"]    [Text] Bratislava -- The Slovak Syndicate of Journalists  and the primary organization of the Trade Union of Mass Media  Employees at Slovak Radio have issued a statement on the present  situation at Slovak Radio. It states that shortcomings in  legislation pertaining to Slovak Radio, particularly the lack of  clarity regarding its financing and economic management;  relations with the state and the term "public corporation";  violations of the Law on the State Budget; the suspension of  financing of Slovak Radio in 1993; as well as internal problems  are driving Slovak Radio toward collapse in terms of economy,  personnel, and programming. Despite the limitation of Slovak  Radio broadcasts from three to two stations, the institution is  short of 8 million korunas a month to meet the obligations that  Law No. 255 of 1991 imposes on Slovak Radio. Owing to economic  pressures, Slovak Radio abolished in 1993 125 permanent  editorial posts and other creative workers. The other employees  are working with feelings of hopelessness and apathy because  their pay for the work that they do is inadequate.    "As these problems are so bad as to be a threat to media  freedom in Slovak Radio, we are asking the National Council of  the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Slovak Republic to  take effective measures to establish the conditions for calm,  good, and competent work for the benefit of the listener."</p>

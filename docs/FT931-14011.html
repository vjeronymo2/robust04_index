			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Government retreats on rail competition THE GOVERNMENT has climbed down over one of the principal aspects of its rail privatisation plans - the requirement that there should be open competition on the tracks between rival train operators. Instead it has decided that private-sector companies will be granted exclusive franchises for all passenger services in many areas, as with commercial television franchises. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has reluctantly conceded the need for exclusive franchises in the face of the private sector's reluctance to become involved in any form of privatisation that would involve open competition on the tracks. Companies feared that, once granted a franchise, they might see their most profitable services attacked by others. That might undermine potential profitability and leaving companies unclear about whether, or how much, to bid for a franchise. Speaking to the Freight On Rail group of private-sector rail freight operators in London yesterday, Mr MacGregor said the government's interest lay in ensuring that rail services were improved by extending the role of the private sector to the maximum extent possible. 'If some individual franchises have to be exclusive in whole or in part, then they will be made so,' he said. 'This will not be necessary in all cases. But to the extent that it is necessary, it will be done.' The government is understood to be planning a two-tier system of franchises: investment franchises, which could last up to 30 years because companies would expect them to cover the life of their investment, and management-only franchises which could come up for renewal in as little as five years. Details of the proposals are due to emerge with the publication of the Railways Bill on Friday. Meanwhile Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the Commons transport committee, will today publish a low-key interim report on his committee's study of the government's privatisation plans. Mr Adley, a Conservative backbencher, is believed to have toned down his strongly expressed personal criticisms of the plans in order to preserve the unanimity of the cross-party committee. Mr MacGregor yesterday adopted a conciliatory tone towards Mr Adley, saying he was struck by the amount of common ground between them. Where they differed, he said, was in Mr Adley's view that operation of the tracks should not be split from operation of the trains. Mr Mac-Gregor said that some franchises would extend to the operation of the tracks as well as the trains. But this would only apply to relatively self-contained parts of the railway, and the government remained committed to the principle of a separate track-owning authority.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minister sparks row over Zambian copper finances A FURIOUS row has been sparked by Mr Mathias Mphande, Zambia's deputy minister of mines, who has suggested that Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, which accounts for about 5 per cent of western world copper mine output, is in a perilous financial position. The company, the world's second-largest quoted copper producer after Phelps Dodge of the US, is preparing to refute Mr Mphande's remarks and in the meantime the London-based Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services group yesterday rushed out a note to clients about ZCCM's finances. This included a statement that, after seven months of the present financial year, the company's attributable earnings of Dollars 89m were 400 per cent ahead of those for the same months in 1991-92 and it had enjoyed a cash inflow of about Dollars 60m. CLL has a vested interest in the affair because its clients own about 8.5 per cent of ZCCM's shares. Another 27 per cent is owned by Zambia Copper Investments, in which Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, has a substantial interest, and 60 per cent is owned by the Zambian government. In remarks quoted by Zambia's Weekly Post, Mr Mphande called for the rapid privatisation of ZCCM to free it, he said, from the political interference that contributed to its troubles. He was quoted as saying ZCCM could face closure if it failed to raise Dollars 2bn. 'ZCCM has no money and, since it is not making money, it is unable to service its loans,' the newspaper quoted him as saying. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at CLL, pointed out yesterday that, under the new regime in Zambia, ZCCM operated independently and the government exercised influence only through its three board directors. He said he had contacted ZCCM and had been told that copper production after seven months was running 10 per cent ahead of last year's level. (In the year to March 31 ZCCM produced about 387,000 tonnes of copper.) Mr Coulson said ZCCM's pre-tax profits, at about Dollars 168m after seven months, were 100 per cent ahead of budget. He added: 'Additionally, virtually all the company's financial ratios are comfortably within internationally accepted norms'.</p>

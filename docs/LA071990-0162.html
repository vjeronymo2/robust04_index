			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Dennis Gilbert, a Beverly Hills sports agent, has denied, in a letter to The  Times in response to a recent story, that he is under investigation by the  Major League Baseball Players Assn.  </P> <P> His letter states: "The allegations in the article about me were from an  'unnamed source,' they were made over a year ago, and they were untrue."  </P> <P> A story that appeared in The Times on July 11 reported that Gilbert was the  subject of an investigation, according to a source close to the union and that  the main allegations center on Gilbert's alleged violations of agent  regulations by soliciting clients and retaining them with inducements. Gilbert  declined interview requests before the story appeared.  </P> <P> Gene Orza, associate general council for the union who also oversees the agent  regulation program, said Wednesday: "It is the Association's policy not to  comment on whether an agent is being investigated or not, and I'm not going to  confirm or deny whether Mr. Gilbert or any other agent is under investigation.  I will just repeat what I said previously that Dennis Gilbert is a certified  agent and therefore as a certified agent obviously has not been found to have  committed any improprieties that would justify altering his status."

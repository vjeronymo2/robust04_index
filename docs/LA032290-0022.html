			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ASKS THAT VALLEY RAIL LINE BE TOP PRIORITY;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: BUT THE ACTION MAY BE AN EMPTY SYMBOL BECAUSE THE COMMISSION  FAVORS BUILDING LAX AND PASADENA ROUTES FIRST.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to request that the  San Fernando Valley get priority over two competing areas for construction of  the next mass transit rail line, but the vote may have been an empty symbol.  </P> <P> The 12-3 vote may have little effect because the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission appears bent on approving a plan by its staff under  which the Valley line -- an extension to Van Nuys of the downtown-to-North  Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- would be built after the other two lines.  </P> <P> The first to be constructed under the county commission's plan would be a  2.5-mile spur from the western terminus of the Century Freeway light-rail line  to Los Angeles International Airport, and second would be a 13.5-mile  light-rail line from downtown to Pasadena.  </P> <P> The plan assumes that California voters on June 5 will approve ballot  propositions raising the gasoline tax by 9 cents per gallon and allowing the  sale of billions of dollars in rail construction bonds to pay for mass transit.  </P> <P> Councilman Richard Alatorre, the only City Council member on the county  commission -- which will make the final decision -- minimized the importance of  Wednesday's council vote, saying, "I don't think there are three votes" on the  11-member commission for placing the Valley ahead of the Pasadena and LAX  lines.  </P> <P> Alatorre, whose northeast Los Angeles district would be served by the Pasadena  line, said he would not be bound by the council vote when the commission takes  up the plan next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Actually, even some of the most passionate proponents of the Valley rail line  seem resigned to the commission staff's $2.2-billion plan for staggering  construction of the three projects over the next 11 years.  </P> <P> Councilman Marvin Braude, one of the earliest proponents of a Valley Metro Rail  extension, conceded that it might not be possible to build the Valley line  first. But Braude nonetheless urged the council to make a "symbolic gesture" on  behalf of the proposed Valley line by approving a motion requesting that the  commission make building the Valley line "the No. 1 priority."  </P> <P> Braude and state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) last year put together a  coalition of business, civic and homeowner group leaders in support of the  Metro Rail extension from North Hollywood to the San Diego Freeway along the  Southern Pacific railroad right of way that parallels Chandler and Victory  boulevards.  </P> <P> A key to getting support from homeowners, who had been worried about noise from  a ground-level system, was an agreement to place the line underground through a  four-mile residential area of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Braude and other proponents of the Valley line did not directly respond in  Wednesday's debate to the repeated assertion by Neil Peterson, the county  commission's executive director, that it would make no sense to build a Valley  extension of Metro Rail until the subway reaches North Hollywood from downtown,  which is not scheduled to occur until 2001.  </P> <P> Peterson said that because half the cost of the the $4-billion  downtown-to-North Hollywood portion of Metro Rail will be paid by federal  funds, the commission is unable to speed up the construction timetable.  </P> <P> Despite Peterson's claim that completion of the downtown-to-North Hollywood  Metro Rail segment is all but assured, council members Joel Wachs and Joy Picus  expressed doubts that federal funds to complete the line to the Valley would be  available, citing recent statements by the Bush Administration suggesting that  local governments should pay a larger share of transportation costs.  </P> <P> Wachs warned that the commission staff's plan "dooms the Valley to failure."  Under the 11-year construction plan, work on the Valley extension would begin  in 1996 and be completed in 2001.  </P> <P> Construction on the LAX line would begin next year and be completed in 1994 at  the same time the Century Freeway line is completed. The plan envisions work  starting on the Pasadena line in 1994, with completion in 1998.  </P> <P> The commission's Transit Committee on Monday voted 3 to 1 to approve the plan's  construction schedule, with the lone dissenter suggesting that the Pasadena  line ought to be built before the LAX spur.  </P> <P> Commissioners have warned that if voters reject the June 5 transportation  spending propositions, there probably will be only enough money for one new  rail line in this century.  </P></p>

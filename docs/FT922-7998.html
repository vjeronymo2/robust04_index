			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: N America boosts Hartstone EXPANSION into the fragmented North American leather market helped Hartstone, the hosiery and leathergoods supplier, reveal profits almost trebled at Pounds 22.1m last year on sales which increased more than three times to Pounds 237.8m. Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the company had increased market share in both divisions during the 12 months to March 31. Hartstone claims the world's number one position for leathergoods distribution and is Europe's second largest hosiery manufacturing and distribution group. The acquisition of Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner last year contributed most of the rise in the leathergoods division, which increased from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 19.8m at the operating level. Mr Trevor Brentnall, head of the North American leathergoods operation, said the two US businesses had shown significant like-for-like growth. Sales at Michael Stevens were ahead 84 per cent, while Etienne Aigner improved turnover by 14 per cent. Both businesses had increased margins by improving sourcing and were also benefiting from a strengthened management team. Hosiery rose on the inclusion for three months of the Spanish and French companies, Aznar and Cogetex, which contributed Pounds 1.5m. Operating profits for the whole division advanced by Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 5.8m. Mr Barker said margins in the UK hosiery business had suffered from overstocking by retailers. However, the relaunch of Bear Brand in the autumn had resulted in significant increases in volume. Hartstone was also making good progress on tapping the growing European hypermarket sector. The French Well brand of tights had already been introduced into Spanish, Dutch and Belgian supermarkets. Capital expenditure came to Pounds 6.5m, compared with a depreciation charge of Pounds 3.8m. Most of the spending had been devoted to increasing warehousing space at Michael Stevens and opening 18 Etienne Aigner stores in the US for a total of 30. Depreciation would rise sharply to Pounds 7.6m next year, compared with capital spending of Pounds 6.5m, due to Aznar and Cogetex. Mr Barker said it was likely that the group would exercise its option to buy Aznar Industrial, the lingerie arm of Aznar, in January. Hartstone ended the year with gearing of about 50 per cent and interest cover of 7.4 times. Interest charges rose sharply from Pounds 648,000 to Pounds 3.4m. Earnings per share advanced from 15.1p to 21.1p. The proposed final dividend is raised from 2p to 3p, for a total of 4.875p (3.25p).</p>

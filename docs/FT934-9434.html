			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (10): A helping hand for equities - The stock market reformers have moved fast FEW STOCK markets have given investors as rocky a ride as Austria's in recent years. A sparkling bull run in 1989 and early 1990 was followed by three years of slump, with the all-share index losing over half its value in the period from January 1990 to January 1993. This year, the market has bounced back, but many investors remain suspicious of the uptrend, given the still weak economic outlook for the country. In part, the Austrian market's high volatility reflects its small capitalisation and the relatively small proportion of most companies' shares that are freely available for trading. It suffices for a couple of big UK or US institutions to adjust their overall weightings for Austria by a point or two to move the whole market. But there have also been many structural problems - a lack of active domestic institutional investors, a tax system that discriminates against equity securities and inadequate investor protection provisions. In mid-1991, when the market was showing no signs of emerging from its long decline, Austrian leaders decided that enough was enough. Within a short time, a strategy committee was formed under the personal leadership of Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, and containing representatives from all interested groups. 'This was deliberate. We wanted to break up the old bankers' club image,' one official, working on the committee, says. By any measure, the committee has moved with remarkable speed on several fronts. Among the more important measures taken to date: An amendment to the Stock Exchange Act was passed in the spring, making insider trading a criminal offence. This came into effect on October 1. Mr Lacina has since said that he will outlaw the use of anonymous bank accounts for securities transactions by the end of this year. This move is a prerequisite to the effective investigation of suspected insider dealings. Meanwhile, leading banks and brokers have drawn up and adopted a standard compliance code for handling price-sensitive information. This is a particularly important measure, because trading in securities in Austria is dominated by the same three large universal banks that dominate the new-issue and corporate-lending businesses. For their part, quoted companies are being pressed to adopt fair and timely procedures for disclosing their accounts and other information likely to have an impact on their share prices. A series of capital market-friendly tax reforms was agreed in May, and will come into force at the beginning of next year. A wealth tax, which discouraged entrepreneurs from taking their companies public, is to be abolished, as is an irritating trade tax. The stock exchange turnover tax will be abolished with respect to securities lending. Individuals are given special incentives to invest, the most important being an annual tax-free allowance of Sch10,000 invested in equities. Taxation on income from securities and bank savings accounts will be equalised at 22 per cent. Previously, income from securities was more highly taxed. The Vienna Borse itself has taken a number of steps to make trading more efficient and transparent, and more are on the way. In July, daily trading hours were extended by one hour, and a computerised analytical data base has been set up to promote the equal dissemination of information. A screen-based trading system is scheduled for installation late next year, and the exchange is encouraging companies to simplify their equity structures so that the market in their shares is more liquid. The exchange is eager to improve, because of the danger of more trading activity leaking out to the SEAQ market in London. Already five of the largest Austrian quoted companies - Creditanstalt, EVN, OMV, Wienerberger and Verbund - are quoted on SEAQ, and analysts estimate that nearly a fifth of trading of their shares is done in London. The two big outstanding issues for the committee are the establishment of an overall market supervisory body and the stimulation of institutional participation. The government tried to promote institutional participation four years ago, by raising the proportion of their funds that insurance companies could put into equities to 30 per cent. But these companies have remained extremely cautious about exercising their new freedom, and so far have only about 6 per cent of their funds in equities. Analysts agree that they are unlikely to change until the cozy Austrian insurance market becomes part of the European Community market, forcing them to try to get better performance from their funds. Pension funds are virtually non-existent in Austria, because the government's (unfunded) universal pension scheme covers about 80 per cent of requirements. As for an Austrian securities and exchange commission, everyone agrees that there is a need for such a body, but Mr Lacina, for one, is worried about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. 'We do not want an over-bureaucratic system,' he said in a recent interview. The reform process suffered a serious blow last spring with the death of Mr Helmut Haschek, chief executive of the Austrian Control Bank (OeKB), the clearing house for the Borse. However, Mr Johannes Attems, another OeKB director, says anxieties about the loss of Mr Haschek's drive and influence on the process are misplaced. 'Once you get a critical mass of things moving, then the whole process gains momentum and cannot be reversed,' Mr Attems says. He adds that government leaders understand the urgency of reform. 'We are going to have some Dollars 100bn - Dollars 150bn in privatisation projects in the next five years in Europe. Private capital has to be attracted. 'We in Austria are competing with other capital markets. If we want the large Anglo-Saxon institutional investors in our market, then we have to adopt their rules, make it easier for them and provide better opportunities for them than elsewhere in Europe. 'We also have to tell the Austrian investor that he should invest more in equities, and not just Austrian equities.'</p>

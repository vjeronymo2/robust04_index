			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: CGIP raises FFr338m CGIP, the French holding company which recently increased its investment in the CarnaudMetalBox packaging group, has raised FFr338.55m (Dollars 62.5m) by selling part of its stake in Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services concern. Proceeds of the sale, announced last month on publication of 1992 results, will be used to finance the FFr1bn deal in which CGIP raised its holding in CarnaudMetalBox to 32.3 per cent from 25.3 per cent by buying shares from MB-Caradon, the UK building products group. CGIP has sold half its shares in Cap Gemini, representing 4.41 per cent of the latter's equity. It sold 1.85m shares, reportedly to Merrill Lynch, at FFr183 each. The Cap Gemini stake was valued in CGIP's accounts at FFr192m.</p>

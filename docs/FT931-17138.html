			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Japan turns face towards Asia MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, has said the country must concentrate on developing its political role in Asia, signalling that Tokyo will increasingly pursue policies independent of the US. In a New Year statement, Mr Miyazawa said Asia would be 'the world's brightest spot over the next century', and Japan must cultivate its own policies to take advantage of the changes in the region. His comments follow the delivery of reports by two senior advisory panels recommending that the relationship with the US be redefined and that 'a new way of thinking' be employed in dealing with Asian countries. The New Year comments and the publication of the panel reports are part of the build-up to a South-East Asian tour by Mr Miyazawa beginning on January 11. While careful to show deference to US influence in Asia, Japan is trying to convince other Asian governments that Tokyo will not necessarily fall in line behind Washington in the future. At the same time, most Japanese apparently sense that there are troubles ahead with the US. A poll published yesterday by the Mainichi Shimbun found that only 6 per cent of questioned Japanese consider ties with the US will improve in the future. In addition, Mr Miyazawa presided over a 'round table on Japan and the Asia-Pacific region', which has just reported that 'it is indefensible to adopt the attitude that a nation can curl up comfortably into its own cocoon' in the face of international change. But the conference also suggested Japan must make changes at home to ensure that it can be taken seriously abroad. Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa said Japan's reluctance to open the rice market to imports was not a cause of the delay in settling the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Japan should 'defend' the rice market, though, recognising that a market opening appears inevitable, he also suggested that farmers be compensated if their earnings are affected by trade liberalisation.</p>

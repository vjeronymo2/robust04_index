			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- The draft bill on  industrial property -- correctly called invention and utility  models patents [patentes de invencion y modelos de utilidad] --  that the PEN [national executive branch] submitted to Congress  remains virtually paralyzed, in view of the reticence of  legislators, who do not believe the U.S. threat to sanction  Argentina by denying it entry to NAFTA if the draft bill is not  approved before 30 April.    This was stated yesterday by legislative sources, who  explained that there is no concrete information on the positions  of the members of the Health, Science and Technology, Commerce,  Industry, Penal Affairs, or Prison System Commissions in the  Senate, who are the ones who have to discuss the draft bill.    Carlos Menem's initiative responds directly to the  requirements of the government of Bill Clinton, according to the  sources, which on the other hand stated that when the issue is  formally debated by these commissions "there will be some who  will point out at least five points of the draft bill that are  harmful to Argentine interests."    More than one of the legislative branch sources noted that  between the U.S. position and GATT requirements there is a broad  range of possibilities for reaching an "adequate" Argentine  patents law that would satisfy all sectors, and would even  settle the "infighting" within the national government over  precisely this subject.    According to speculation within the legislative branch, if  the draft bill has the approval of almost all the senators --  although amended -- it might then meet serious obstacles in the  Chamber of Deputies.    In view of the strong pressure exerted by the United States  regarding this future law, the senators wonder what joining  NAFTA will mean to Argentina and "what benefits and difficulties  it will hold for the country."    Although it is true that Argentina has a "good relationship  with the United States," it is also believed that "there is no  need to join NAFTA" to maintain this relationship, as "it is not  very clear what the benefits would be" if Argentina is chosen to  become a member of this commercial bloc other than to "encourage  confidence and the flow of capital."    While these doubts exist, the Justicialist Party bloc of  national senators has still not explained its stance regarding  the government's draft bill, and it is believed it will not do  so until after 10 April, because the great majority have decided  to remain in their respective provinces to carry out their  electoral campaign for the election of members of the  Constituent Assembly.    The senators' greatest specific objections to the PEN draft  bill concern the shortening of the duration of 20 year patents,  as it creates monopolies and because the speed of innovations  today makes it inadvisable, according to the models of other  countries that are influencing several legislators.    Some senators are studying the possibility of "shortening  the  transition period for pharmaceutical products" or of  establishing an extension for the patents for a period that  could be three years, "under the condition that national  laboratories be granted a license."    They also propose "restricting the exploitation concept to  local production, as is established in Spanish law," and  allowing importation only in exceptional cases. This is a  confusion that exists in the production of and trading in  products from foreign laboratories.    Another point under discussion is that referring to the  possibility of allowing importation with the requirement of  paying "royalties" in order to encourage competition and avoid  the establishment of monopolies.    Some legislators want to "avoid a retroactive patent and  eliminate what is labeled `priority,' and only grant patents for  new products."    Finally they point out the need to establish "explicit  mechanisms to encourage investigation and development."    Several consulted senators agreed that Argentine industry is  ready to investigate, market, and pull out of its isolation, and  "begin to compete based on a technological plan and the  country's industrial know-how, as well as defend the consumer."</p>

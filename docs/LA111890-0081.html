			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> TROPICAL PLANT FINDS WELCOME IN SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> PLUMERIA: IT CAN BE GROWN AS TREE OR BUSH AND PRODUCES LOVELY COLORS. IT HAS TO  BE PROTECTED FROM FROST.  </P> <P> Earle and Margaret Deeble not only fell in love with the Hawaiian Islands  during their annual trips, they also fell in love with the island's tropical  plants -- particularly the plumeria.  </P> <P> Indeed, it is almost impossible to visit Hawaii and not be impressed with the  beauty and the incredibly exotic fragrance of plumeria blooms. A lei of  plumeria flowers is often the first item greeting island visitors.  </P> <P> The Deebles, who live in Fullerton, wondered if they could experience the  marvelous aroma and beauty of the plumeria in their own yard. They made  inquiries on the source of plumeria plants and discovered that a friend had  them growing in a greenhouse.  </P> <P> The friend was glad to give the Deebles a cutting, but he also doubted that the  Deebles would have much luck growing plumeria plants in the outdoor environment  of their yard.  </P> <P> That was 15 years ago. The Deebles now have these beautiful, fragrant plants  growing in front, back and side yards. They have eight different varieties with  lovely blooms in shades of white, pink, red, white with yellow centers, orange  (very rare) and bicolors.  </P> <P> The plants have thick branches with tropical-looking dark-green leaves, which  are large and pointed. The leaves range in size from 10 to 14 inches. Most of  their varieties are deciduous and drop their leaves in mid-winter; foliage  growth resumes in early spring and blooms occur from late spring until cold  weather sets in.  </P> <P> According to Earle Deeble, even though it is considered exotic, plumeria is  easy to grow in much of Southern California if it is sheltered from frosts and  planted in a soil that drains well.  </P> <P> The plants will absolutely not tolerate a wet, soggy soil. The soil must be  loose and drain quickly. The only plumeria plant the Deebles have ever lost was  planted in a lower area of their yard where the drainage was poor.  </P> <P> Plumeria can be grown as a shrub or a small tree. In either case, the plants  make a stunning addition to a landscape. They will thrive in full sun in the  milder coastal areas; however, in the hotter inland valleys the plants should  receive half-day sun. Earle Deeble recommends that, in the hotter areas, the  plants receive morning sun, but be protected from the hotter afternoon sun.  </P> <P> In colder areas of the Southland, the plants need protection from temperatures  that drop below 28 degrees Fahrenheit. The Deebles live on a Fullerton hillside  where freezing temperatures seldom occur. The few times their plants sustained  frost damage, they simply removed the damaged portions, and the plants  continued to thrive.  </P> <P> If you don't have a frost-protected planting site, some protections will be  realized by tenting the plants with plastic covers on nights that frost is  expected. Ground cloths used for painting are fine, but the plastic requires  some type of frame so it doesn't come into contact wit the foliage.  </P> <P> Always remove the covering promptly after danger of frost has passed. A flood  light at the base of the plant will also give some protection from frost.  </P> <P> Although plumeria plants are becoming more available in local nurseries, the  Deebles have grown most of their plants from cuttings. According to Bill  Nelson, a tropical plant expert at Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista, the  plants are easy to propagate from cuttings.  </P> <P> If you have a friend who has a plumeria plant simply select a branch during the  plant's dormant period, make a cutting (any size branch), lay the branch in a  shady area for four days to one week to harden it off.  </P> <P> Then plant the cutting vertically in a container of moist growing mix. The  cutting should be immersed in the container soil to about one-half of its  length. In about three weeks to a month, the cuttings will root and be ready  for transplanting.  </P> <P> If you can't obtain cuttings, the plants are sold in 1-, 5- or 15-gallon  containers in various Southland nurseries. Nelson feels that the best buy is  the 5-gallon size as it will produce blooms quickly and is more reasonably  priced.  </P> <P> If you don't have a yard, plumeria plants will do well in a large container.  The Deebles have beautiful specimens in containers.  </P> <P> I have a 7-year-old plumeria on my patio that has thrived in a half whiskey  barrel container. It produces hundreds of fragrant blooms which lend a tropical  scent to my patio area and the blooms keep well in water for up to 10 days in  an aromatic indoor bouquet. The container my plant resides in is set on casters  and I roll it into the garage when I expect the temperature to drop below 28  degrees Fahrenheit on a given winter night.  </P> <P> As to proper care, the Deebles water the plumeria in their yard once a week.  They water the plants in containers whenever the soil starts to dry out. They  feed their plants with a 15-30-15 liquid fertilizer applied to the base of the  plants at the start of the bloom period in the spring, and repeat the feeding  several more time during the bloom period. I feed my plumeria with time-release  fertilizer tablets in the spring.  </P> <P> If allowed to grow in the yard unchecked, most plumeria varieties will reach a  height of 10 to 15 feet. Plant size may be easily controlled by pruning during  the dormant season; use cuttings to propagate new plants.  </P> <P> The Deebles have not only beautified their own yard with plumeria plants, they  have given cuttings to friends, and friends of friends. Many plumeria plants  from original Deeble cuttings now thrive in Fullerton yards. And although you  won't confuse Fullerton with Honolulu, the flora is definitely becoming more  tropical.  </P></p>

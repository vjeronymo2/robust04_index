			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal by A. Shakhnazarov: "A Suggestion to All: National </F> Support for the National Newspaper"]    [Text] I received the last issue of the newspaper  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on Tuesday, 29 March 1994. As I learned, the  newspaper is not being published because of the indebtedness of  the editorial office for printing services and paper. But  perhaps we readers can help. Let us calculate.    The newspaper's circulation is reaching 470,000 copies  and in all probability a good half of these are direct  subscribers--that is 235,000 people.    I am firmly convinced that if the editorial office were  to appeal through the mass media to the subscribers at this  critical point IF ONLY FOR R1,000 EACH, this would amount to:  235,000 X R1,000 = R235 million. It would already be possible to  retire some of the debts.    ...Because if I do not receive my SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA it  is tantamount to cutting off my oxygen supply.    On 12 APRIL 1994, at such a critical time for the  newspaper I decided to go directly to the editorial offices and  contribute R5,000 to the fund to help the newspaper.    [Signed] A. Shakhnazarov    Odintsovskiy Rayon    p/o  Staryy Gorodok    Moscow Oblast    We invite every subscriber and every reader of  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA to contribute no less than R1,000-R2,000 to  the fund to aid the newspaper. This will help it to come out  regularly.    Thank you for your help, friends!

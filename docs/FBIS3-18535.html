			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso  is visiting South Africa, but is thinking about Angola. The  foreign minister told us that the Lusaka agreement is  technically ready, but it has not been signed yet because there  is no political will:    [Begin recording] [Durao Barroso] From a technical point of  view, the documents are at a rather advanced stage. I met  moments ago with a representative of the negotiating team who  confirmed that news. The fundamental problem is whether there  is the will on either side for a true national reconciliation  agreement to be signed.    [Correspondent Carlos Pacheco] But does this [the will]  exist  or not?    [Barroso] So far it has not existed.    [Pacheco] And, according to what you have just said, what  will be the logical outcome of the Lusaka negotiations?    [Barroso] Well, a logical outcome would be a positive  conclusion, but that will obviously be subject to a political  rectification, at the highest level, from both sides. I cannot  foresee it at the moment.    [Pacheco] Do the conditions exist for that to happen?    [Barroso] At the same time as there has been progress at the  Lusaka talks, the fact is that the situation has been worsening  on the ground. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs  Durao Barroso talking to our correspondent.</p>

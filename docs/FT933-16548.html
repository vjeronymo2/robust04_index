			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo volume declines to four month low FUTURES-LINKED buying pushed up share prices at the end of the session, but activity remained subdued and volume was at its the thinnest in four months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 334.61, or 1.7 per cent to 19,924.61, the highest point of the day. The index opened at the day's low of 19,638.79 and remained marginally higher throughout the day. A sharp rise in the futures market towards the close of the session sparked arbitrage buying. Volume fell to 220m shares against 233m. Gainers led losers by 693 to 292 with 175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 17.78 to 1,598.03 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.62 to 1,210.32. Traders expect the Nikkei to fluctuate within a narrow range until the July 18 general elections. 'The downside is firm around the 18,000 level thanks to the government's public support, but valuation problems prevent the Nikkei from rising above the 20,000 level,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. He added that with bond yields at some 4 per cent, the fair value of the Nikkei was around 14,300. Investors focused on Rohm, the integrated circuit maker, due to the lack of fresh news. The company's US subsidiary won a patent in the US for the next generation of flash memory chips and is planning to charge companies using the technology, including Intel of the US, Toshiba and Hitachi. Rohm failed to trade due to the lack of sellers and closed at a bid price of Y2,890. Sumitomo Bakelit, which provides synthetic resins for Rohm's chips, rose Y64 to Y584. Non-bank financial institutions gained ground on the ministry of finance's decision to allow the companies to issue commercial paper. Orix rose Y200 to Y3,330. Chori, a textile trader, fell Y100 to Y434 on reports of its lending exposure to Hanix, the over-the-counter construction machinery maker which filed for court protection last month. Nikkatsu, the film maker, was suspended after reports of dishonoured bills. After the market closed, the company announced that it had filed for court protection due to funding problems. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 238.73 to 21,919.12 in volume of 14.5m shares. The index rose for the first time in three days, on buying triggered by the popularity of Rohm. Roundup MANY of the region's markets continued their strong runs. Taiwan, Bangkok, Pakistan and India were closed for holidays. HONG KONG rose sharply on hopes that the UK might be ready to compromise with China over the colony's political future. The Hang Seng index closed up 106.10, or 1.5 per cent, at 7,205.38, its high for the day. Turnover was HKDollars 3.67bn against Wednesday's HKDollars 4bn. Among the actives, HSBC was HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 74.50 and Swire Pacific up HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 41.00. SEOUL rose for the third consecutive session with interest particularly concentrated in companies with low p/e ratios. The composite index gained 4.39 to 753.26, off the day's low of 747.73. MANILA closed higher as local investors sustained a technical rally which began on Monday. The composite index rose 9.51 to 1,586.98. Secondary commercial issues led the rise with a new listing, Bacnotan Cement, climbing 75 centavos to 14.50 pesos. Combined turnover slipped to 530.03m pesos from 687.10m. AUSTRALIA moved higher on the first day of the new financial year, the All Ordinaries index closing 17.2 higher at 1,755.3. NEW ZEALAND was quiet ahead of yesterday's budget which was announced after the close. The NZSE-40 index gained 5.82 to 1,686.49 in turnover of NZDollars 26.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Former Ambassador Leandro I. Verceles Sr.,  yesterday branded as "thoroughly gratuitous and inappropriate"  the stand taken by Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo  concerning the United States' insistence on international  inspection of the nuclear facilities of North Korea.    Verceles, a recognized United Nations expert in economic  diplomacy and international law, pointed out that Romulo's  criticism of the United States on the nuclear inspection issue  could be misconstrued that the Philippines is siding with North  Korea.    "As a former diplomat, I find the statement, twice now, of  Secretary Romulo criticizing the United States for its stand  vis-a-vis North Korea as thoroughly gratuitous and  inappropriate," he said. "(Romulo's statements) might create the  impression that the Philippines stands by the side of North  Korea which certainly should not be the case. Indeed, such  statements would tend to exacerbate the already sensitive  situation in the (Korean) peninsula."    Verceles, who had participated in more than 100 major U.N.  and bilateral conferences as chairman and/or member of the  Philippine delegation, said that it was the refusal of North  Korea to allow the international inspection of its nuclear  facilities, in accordance with treaties of the United Nations,  that has spawned the controversy.    The U.N. Security Council has already called on North Korea  to adhere to its commitment to permit inspection of the seven  declared nuclear sites in the country.    According to Verceles, the Security Council has the primary  responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and  security under the U.N. Charter. "Clearly," he said "it is the  better part of wisdom and prudence for us to await action of the  Security Council.    Verceles said that instead of pointing an accusatory finger  at the United States, Romulo should join the call of the  civilized community of nations for inspection of North Korea's  nuclear facilities.    "We must realize that the Philippines is a piddling power in  the arena of international politics" he said. "We should not  pretend to be otherwise. We should always bear in mind that  when elephants quarrel or make love it is the grass that gets  trampled underfoot."</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cominco slides deeper into the red Cominco, the Canadian base metals group, suffered another large loss last year, but reported improvements in production and cost controls in the fourth quarter. The net loss, including gains on disposals, was CDollars 113.2m (USDollars 85.7m), or CDollars 1.46 a share, compared with CDollars 30.2m, or 42 cents, in 1992. Revenues dipped to CDollars 982m from CDollars 1.47bn, due largely to the spin-off of the fertiliser division. While the operating loss for the year widened to CDollars 129m from CDollars 62.5m, it narrowed in the fourth quarter to CDollars 4.4m from CDollars 43.7m. The last figure included a CDollars 30m inventory write-down, but metal prices last year were below 1992. Cominco said output of its Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska climbed by 63 per cent in the fourth quarter to 126,000 tonnes of concentrate. Two mills came on stream in mid-January, and improvements in production and ore yields were expected this year. The troubled Trail smelter in British Columbia broke even on an operating basis in the final three months, in spite of the slide in metal prices. The smelter's lead and zinc output last year was about 95 per cent of 1993 levels. The Quebrada Blanca project in Chile is to produce cathode copper in the second quarter of 1994.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Capital market reforms given go-ahead THE EMERGENCY package endorsed further deregulation of Japan's capital market, including the introduction of new products, such as bonds with shorter maturities and floating rate notes. The proposals reinforce government pledges made in March last year. Deregulation of the capital markets is already slowly under way, and will not have an immediate impact on the economy. However, in the medium term, a larger and more liquid corporate bond market presents an alternative funding tool for companies at a time when bank lending remains tight and the stock market has yet to see full-fledged recovery. Until now, short-term corporate paper has been banned by the ministry of finance in order to protect the long-term credit banks, which finance themselves with bank debentures. Earlier this year, the finance ministry eased restrictions on companies which are able to issue bonds, allowing a wider range of companies to fund themselves through the bond market. Legislative changes allowing new products is expected to accelerate the pace of reform in the bond market. The ministry is also set to allow variable interest rate deposits and interest bearing liquid deposits. A wider range of products will give investors more incentive to place their funds at the banks, which are losing depositers to postal savings, which offer higher rates. Banks will also be allowed to accept medium and long term deposits, which have previously been restricted in order to protect the market for 10-year government bonds. The government also pledged to reform the insurance industry, one of the most tightly regulated in the financial sector. The sharp fall in the stock market from 1990 has eroded the portfolios of the small life assurers, with many of them in need for financial aid. Liberalisation of the insurance industry, where barriers between life assurers and non-life insurers will be eased, is expected to trigger consolidation.</p>

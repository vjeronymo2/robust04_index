			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD CONSIDERS ELIMINATING 1,300  JOBS  </P> <P> Facing its biggest financial crisis in a decade, the Los Angeles school board  is considering eliminating 1,300 positions -- including more than 600 teaching  jobs -- as it tries to trim $220 million from next year's budget.  </P> <P> The board already has approved $119 million in cuts, including eliminating 635  clerical and administrative jobs.  </P> <P> But the district's chief financial officer, Robert Booker, said another $101  million in cuts are needed to meet state requirements. Booker blamed the  shortfall on lower-than-expected revenue from the state, sharply rising program  costs and the 8% salary increase the board gave to nearly every employee.  </P> <P> The board will hold public hearings on the proposed cuts next week and vote on  the cuts in two weeks.  </P></p>

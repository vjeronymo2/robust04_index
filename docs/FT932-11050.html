			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs set to attack unified Budget MPs will this month criticise details of the move to a unified Budget, saying the government has wasted an opportunity to ensure that the annual Finance Bill is more accurately drafted, David Owen writes. The Treasury and Civil Service select committee will also express concern that the new arrangements will reduce parliamentary time devoted to Treasury matters. But it is expected to welcome the principle of switching to a unified tax and spending format commencing this November. The committee is expected to publish a report before the end of this month. The committee will argue that by moving the deadline for parliament's discussion of the Finance Bill forward from August 5 to May 5, the government has spurned a chance to extend the period when it can take outside advice. By allowing longer gaps between the different stages of parliamentary debate, the government could have helped to ensure the measure better reflected its intentions.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Anti-establishment mood hits Democrats: Off-year US elections THERE are usually thin, but interesting, political pickings in off-year US elections. Typically the incumbent in the White House, new or old, suffers setbacks, but local rather than national personalities and circumstances tend to predominate. But even this caveat cannot disguise the fact this year's returns are already proving worrying to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic party, as they contemplate defence of their House and Senate majorities next year. From California to New Jersey the anti-establishment mood of the country seems as strong as ever and the Democrats, under a president whose own popularity has been sinking alarmingly, now constitute the larger part of that establishment. In Los Angeles, the new mayor is Richard Riordan, a Republican in the Ross Perot image, victor over Michael Woo, the Democrat embraced by Mr Clinton. There is a new Republican senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and a strong Republican challenger, Christine Whitman, for Governor Jim Florio's hold on New Jersey. Two solid Democratic House seats - those formerly occupied in Wisconsin by Les Aspin, now defence secretary, and in California by Leon Panetta, budget director - have been retained but with sharply reduced majorities. In Virginia, a very conservative Republican gubernatorial candidate is making waves, as is one-time Colonel Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, who is eyeing a senate run next year. The Democratic defence lies mostly in local explanations, which certainly have some validity in Los Angeles and Texas. There is both interest and concern in whether Mr Riordan, a political novice, can apply business techniques successfully to make his troubled city feel and work better than decades of political management have. If he does, then the broader anti-establishment cause represented by Mr Perot may take further flight. In Texas, it hurts the Democrats to have their state establishment, under Governor Ann Richards, so rebuffed and for their US senate majority to have dropped by one to 54-46. But at least they take consolation in the fact that Bob Krueger, the interim senator filling in for Lloyd Bensten, now treasury secretary, was not only a terrible candidate but also almost always voted against the president in any case and was rewarded with no presidential assistance. The more representative contests to come this year are the governor races in New Jersey and Virginia. The campaigns of both Ms Whitman, who nearly upset Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, and Governor Florio are being managed by two heavyweight strategists, with Ed Rollins, the Republican guru who briefly worked for Mr Perot last year, in the Whitman corner, and James Carville, the Clinton electoral mastermind, advising Mr Florio. The governor has recovered remarkably from the pits of unpopularity brought on by his introduction of sharp tax increases, while Ms Whitman had a tougher than expected primary this week. Mr Rollins wants to make the contest a referendum on the Clinton administration, of which he considers Mr Florio a precursor. Polls show the two running evenly. More surprising, one survey showed a similar result in Virginia where George Allen, a conservative Republican, and Mary Sue Terry, a moderate Democrat, are bidding to succeed Governor Doug Wilder, who cannot run for another term. George Allen is a revered name in Washington and its populous Virginia suburbs, because 20-plus years ago the candidate's eponymous father was the coach who turned the hapless Redskins into a winning football team. But even this illustrious association had seemed less important than the fact that Virginian politics, no longer the fiefdom of reactionary Democratic families and reflecting suburban values, have become much more moderate, as witnessed by the election of Governor Wilder, who is black. Virginia's national importance is that it is the next big electoral test of the power of the religious right, which last weekend dominated the Republican convention in Richmond that nominated Mr Allen. It rapturously welcomed Mr North, especially his endorsement of the long-standing ultra-conservative demand that English be made the only official language in the US. Most local pundits still think that Ms Terry, a former state attorney general, should beat Mr Allen in the autumn if the fractious Democrats get out the vote. But it is conceivable that next year Mr North could profit from the bitter personal hostility between Mr Wilder, a likely senate candidate, and Mr Chuck Robb, the sitting Democratic senator. The worst blow for the Democrats and Mr Clinton would be victories for Mr Allen and Ms Whitman. They would instantly be compared with the stunning Democratic triumph by Mr Harris Wofford in the Pennsylvania senate special election in 1991, a result that marked the beginning of the end for President George Bush. Mr Clinton has troubles enough already.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Blockade threat as fish talks fail FISHERMEN'S leaders yesterday threatened further blockades of UK ports in protest at the European Community's fisheries policy. The fresh warning came after talks between the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and Mr David Curry, the fisheries minister, ended in apparent deadlock. Mr Curry rejected calls for import controls, particularly on cheap Russian fish. He said recent falls in prices had been caused by oversupply from British boats and not by cheap imports, and UK prices were now rising.</p>

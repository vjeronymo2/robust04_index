			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / SIB may trigger investment industry shake-up A SHAKE-UP of investor-protection organisations and of investment intermediaries may result from a review of investment-product retailing initiated by the Securities and Investments Board, writes Barry Riley. SIB, the chief investment watchdog, yesterday announced that it would work with the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers' Regulatory Association (Fimbra), the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) and other organisations to produce a formal consultative document by the autumn. The investigation of the working of existing rules - which split intermediaries rigidly into independent financial advisers (IFAs) on the one hand and company salesmen or tied agents on the other - has been triggered partly by the mass switch by almost all leading banks and building societies from independent to tied status within the past three years. SIB has been disappointed by results of public opinion surveys that suggest that the public does not understand or care about the differences between IFAs and company salesmen. Also, serious difficulties have been encountered by Fimbra, which oversees IFAs. Membership has been falling sharply, leading to financial problems that have been worsened by the burden of the investors' compensation scheme. SIB has already been requested by the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate disclosure of commissions and other details to investors, following a report by the Office of Fair Trading. IFAs complain that they must disclose much more than company salesmen. As part of its formal review of retail regulation, SIB is inviting submissions from interested parties such as investors' representatives, although it says it wants to discuss the overall framework rather than address individual points of grievance.</p>

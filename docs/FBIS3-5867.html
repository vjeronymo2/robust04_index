			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HANOI, March 10 (AFP) -- Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC]  authorities are urging reforms of trade regulations to boost  exports, weed out unscrupulous firms and gain a bigger market  share in the countries of the former Soviet Union, a report said  Thursday.    The city's directorate of commerce has presented proposals  to  the government in Hanoi to issue separate licences for imports  and exports rather than the current combined licences so as to  encourage exports and cut back on the amount of imported goods,  the LAO DONG newspaper reported.    Vietnam's cumbersome trade licensing procedures have come  under attack from foreign businesses here, who would like to see  the thicket of bureaucracy thinned out, but officials have  maintained what a Western consultant here called "an informal  quota system." Authorities in the southern city also called for  low-interest loans for such businesses as rice production to  bolster vital export sectors, the labour newspaper said. The  measures would help the city meet its target of boosting exports  by 29 percent this year to 760 million US dollars while keeping  the rise in imports down to five percent, the newspaper said.    HCMC is trying to eradicate a 271-million-dollar trade  deficit that built up last year, when it failed to meet a target  of a 10-percent rise in exports, it said. City officials are  urging an increase in the minimum capital of a trading company  from 200,000 dollars to one million dollars to eliminate  "adventurous" or vulnerable companies, the report said.    Other proposals currently being considered by the Ministry  of  Commerce include a further clampdown on smuggling from Cambodia  and China and efforts to boost counter-trade with the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Tax breaks should be  given to companies trading the nations of the former Soviet  Union "in order to win a large market with which trade has been  shrinking." Before its breakup in 1991, the Soviet Union was  Vietnam's largest trading partner and aid donor but in 1993  Russia fell to 11th place on the list of investors here while  trade with the CIS has slumped because of a shortage of hard  currency in the countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wei Jianxing (1414 0256 5887): "It Is Necessary To </F> Wholeheartedly Rely on the Working Class in Reform, Development,  and Stability"]    [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress has put forward the  goal of reform to build the system of a socialist market economy  and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress  has adopted the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee on Some  Questions Concerning the Building of the System of a Socialist  Market Economy," symbolizing that China's economic structural  reform has entered a stage of storming fortifications and in  which all-out advance and major breakthroughs are integrated.  This year is a crucial year for China to accelerate building  the new economic system and carry out comprehensive and in-depth  reform. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line as guidance, the whole country is implementing the spirit  of the 14th CPC Congress and its Third Plenary Session in an  overall manner and various jobs are vigorously developing  closely around the center of the basic principles of the party  and the state for the work this year, they are also  conscientiously obeying and serving the overall situation of  "grasping the opportune moment, carrying out in-depth reform,  expanding opening-up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability." As the leading class in the state, and the  representative of advanced productive forces and relations of  production, the working class takes an extremely important  position in reform, development, and stability. It is of  extremely important significance at present and in the future to  rely wholeheartedly on the working class and handle well the  relations of reform, development, and stability.  <H8>  I. </H8>   At present, China enjoys economic development, political  stability, national unity, and social progress. Various  undertakings are full of vitality and the situation is  favorable. The international situation as a whole is favorable  to China's development. The better the situation, the more we  should grasp the opportune moment, make good use of it, keep  sober-minded, and fully see the challenges we face and the  existing problems. We should be prepared for danger in times of  peace, work more conscientiously, strive to develop ourselves,  and promote the overall development of the building of two  civilizations. More than 10 years of practice in China's reform  and construction have told us that reform is the motive force,  development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee. We  must rely wholeheartedly on the working class to handle well the  relations between reform, development, and stability, enabling  them to promote each other and develop in a coordinated way. If  we give up relying on the working class, we cannot talk about  achieving anything.    Reform is the cause of the working class and the masses of  the people themselves. The Chinese working class has displayed  extremely great political enthusiasm in reform and has always  stood in the forefront of reform, the road to a powerful nation,  with a high sense of responsibility of being the master of its  own affairs. It has the cardinal principles in mind and takes  the overall situation into account, actively supporting the  introduction of various reform measures. It takes part in and  promotes various reforms of its own accord and the brilliant  achievements it has made has gone down in history forever.  According to an investigation by the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions on the situation regarding the working class  contingent, the broad masses of staff and workers have made fine  appraisals of the achievements in reform for more than 10 years  in China, positively supporting and favoring further in-depth  reform and expansion of opening-up. When their interests become  involved in some reforms, the broad masses of staff and workers  say that as long as it is favorable to the overall situation of  reforms, and as long as they can bear it economically, they will  support the reforms resolutely. The correct understanding and  treatment of various new things and new issues which emerge in  reform displayed by the broad masses of staff and workers, the  spirit of being the master of one's own affairs and of daring to  meet difficulties head-on, and the style and features of the  times of being bold in dedication and creation, have effectively  ensured the smooth progress of reform. The working class has  proved by its own practical actions that it is the master and  the subject of reform and that it is worthy of its powerful  motivational force. Today, as we are carrying out in-depth  reform, it is an extremely important task for the whole party  and the whole society to bring into better play this powerful  motivational force.    The working class is the main force that promotes China's  economic development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out:  Grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and the crux is  to develop the economy. Development is a tough argument, is the  overall situation, and the crux. During various periods of the  Chinese revolution and construction, the working class have made  huge contributions to national emancipation and to making China  prosperous and strong. Under the new situation of reform and  opening-up and modernization, the working class has again  performed immortal deeds promoting the building of the socialist  material civilization and spiritual civilization. Labor  creation by staff and workers trhoughout China accounts for  about 70 percent of the GNP and over 90 percent of state  revenue. Facing the market and basing themselves on their own  jobs, the broad masses of staff and workers have made remarkable  achievements in developing new products, raising product  quality, concentrating their efforts on constant improvement of  labor productivity and economic performance, and pushing to the  market sphere the socialist labor emulation drive,  rationalization proposals, invention and creation, technological  innovation, technological coordination, and other activities.  The huge achievements made in China's economic development are  an embodiment of the industriousness, wisdom, and sweat of the  working class whose main force role in the socialist  modernization program has been fully displayed. The working  class uses its own advanced ideas to influence and nurture the  whole society and promotes the building of the socialist  spiritual civilization. Its extensive impact and leading force  is self-evident. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy all the more calls for the  protection, guidance, and mobilization of the main and leading  force.    The working class is the mainstay in safeguarding social  stability. The importance of social political stability lies in  the stability of the working class contingent, which is the  premise and basis of social stability. The working class in  China greatly treasures the political situation of stability and  unity. Whether in the face of complex social contradictions, or  under a changeable international situation, it always rallies  closely round the party Central Committee. It not only  maintains the stability of its contingent but also makes huge  efforts to maintain social political stability, thus vigorously  safeguarding social political stability. In-depth reform,  expansion of opening-up, and promotion of development must be  carried out in a stable social political environment. "The  working class can be relied upon." Consolidate and develop the  political situation of stability and unity by relying on the  working class, try to accomplish promotion of reform and  development amidst stability and ensure long-term social  stability by reform and development. These are the requirements  of the times and also the historical responsibilities of the  working class.    The nature of our party and the state, and the historical  task of reform, development, and stability, determine that we  must at all times and under any circumstances uphold,  unswervingly and with a clear-cut stand, the party's fundamental  guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the working  class. The nature of a country depends on what position the  people of that country take and what kind of relationship exists  between man and man. Our party is the vanguard of the working  class and the working class is the class basis of our party;  ours is a socialist country of a people's democratic  dictatorship, led by the working class and with worker-peasant  alliance as the basis, and the working class is the leading  class of the state. Only under the party's leadership can the  working class achieve its historical mission and only by closely  relying on the working class can the party consolidate and  strengthen its leading position and lead the people of the whole  country in striving to achieve the great cause of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. The difficulty in  developing a socialist market economy lies in how to link and  integrate closely the market economy with the basic system of  socialism. This is an unprecedented great cause, without  existing experience, which can be utilized. It is required to be  daring in exploration, bold in practice, and constant in  innovation under the leadership of the party Central Committee  by relying wholeheartedly on the working class and the masses of  the people. In this historical process, the inevitable trend is  that socialist public ownership occupies a leading position,  with joint development of diversified economic sectors. To  each, according to his labor, will be the major form and  multiple forms of distribution to co-exist over a long period of  time with some areas; some people will be allowed to become rich  first and finally achieve common prosperity. The state controls  the power to carry out effective macroeconomic regulation and  control over the national economy as a whole. Therefore, in the  course of developing a socialist market economy, China's  socialist system remains unchanged, the nature of the state  remains unchanged, the working class being the leading class of  the state remains unchanged, the working class being the class  basis of the party remains unchanged, and the working class, as  the master of its own affairs, remains unchanged. The subjects  of a socialist market economy are enterprises and the subjects  of enterprises are staff and workers. Market is the external  motive force for enterprise development and the initiatives,  wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers are sources of  enterprise vitality. That is to say, the extent to which the  initiatives of the working class are given play directly affects  the success or failure of reform and opening-up and the extent  to which productive forces are emancipated and developed, having  a bearing on the fate of a socialist market economy. Therefore,  to develop a socialist market economy, we must attach great  importance to relying on the masses of staff and workers and  fully mobilize their initiatives, with which to push forward  reform, promote development, and safeguard stability. This is  both the requirement by the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability, as well as the essence and  superiority of the socialist system.  <H8>  II. </H8>   In the overall situation of reform, development, and  stability, how to rely wholeheartedly on the working class is a  question which is highly theoretical and practical, with a  strong policy nature. It is also a hot issue about which the  broad masses of staff and workers are concerned. In this  respect, we have many laws, legal regulations, and policies to  serve as a basis, and also many successful practices and  experiences which we may use for reference and study. At  present, we should lay special emphasis on the issues in the  following aspects:    First, we must start by grasping understanding, and  further heighten understanding, of the importance of relying  wholeheartedly on the working class. Whom to rely on is a  matter of the first importance for the revolution and  construction and is also a matter of the first importance for  reform, development, and stability. Not everyone understands  this clearly. Needless to say, with the development of the  situation, many new circumstances and new problems have appeared  which merit our attention concerning whom to rely on to carry  out in-depth reform, promote development, and maintain  stability. Therefore, on this matter, we must first overcome  the problem of understanding, especially the problem of  understanding on the part of the party and government leading  cadres. We should understand the extreme importance of relying  wholeheartedly on the working class from the height of  safeguarding the nature of the party, safeguarding China's state  system and government system, and implementing the party's  fundamental guiding principles. It is necessary to propagate  extensively, through multiple forms and channels, the advanced  ideas of the working class, its fine quality, and the great  achievements and huge contributions it has made, and strive to  build up in the whole society a powerful public opinion and  strong atmosphere of respecting and relying on the working  class.       In view of the fact that many comrades among leading cadres  have taken up new leading posts,ng leading cadres have taken up  new leading posts, and that they are not adequately familiar  with the party's mass work and mass line, it is required that  party organizations at various levels carry out re-education on  relying on the working class and the mass line among party  cadres, especially among young leading cadres. In party  schools, administrative cadre schools, and in the teaching of  cadre training, we should add courses about the working class,  the workers' movement, and the party's mass work according to  the requirements by the CPC Central Committee "Circular on  Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over the Work of  Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's  Federation," to lay a favorable ideological foundation for  ensuring the implementation of this fundamental guiding  principle.    Second, we must fully embody and safeguard the status  of staff and workers of being the masters of their own affairs  in labor legislation and reform measures. The party's  fundamental guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the  working class must be fully embodied in labor legislation,  economic laws and regulations, and reform measures. Otherwise,  relying on the working class would be an empty phrase. China's  labor laws and regulations are unsound and are far from meeting  the requirements for regulating the ever complicated labor  relations in the transformation to a socialist market economy.  We should work out as soon as possible the "Labor Law," "Social  Insurance Law," "Labor Protection law," "Labor Contract Law,"  "Work Hours Law," and a number of other important laws and  regulation. Before the introduction of these important laws and  regulation, policies, and measures involving the vital interests  of staff and workers, we should fully listen to the opinions and  proposals of the broad masses of staff and workers through  various channels and forms, so that laws and regulations,  policies, and measures are built on a profound mass basis. It  is necessary to ensure, through labor regulations and reform  measures, that the broad masses of staff and workers constantly  raise, with economic development, their material and cultural  levels and living standards, constantly improve labor conditions  and working environments, constantly create opportunities for  occupational training, enter decisionmaking bodies more  effectively, and participate in the management of the affairs of  the state, and also social and economic affairs. At present, it  is especially necessary to strengthen mass supervision over law  enforcement and to build a mechanism for effective mass  supervision. Party and government departments at various levels  should accept of their own accord the supervision by staff and  workers and the broad masses of the people, thus placing various  jobs under supervision by the masses. Leading cadres should  constantly go deep among the masses, go down to the grass-roots  units, care for the suffering of staff and workers, listen to  the voice of the masses, and take the "first signal" from the  masses of staff and workers as a major basis for decisionmaking.  In various reforms involving the vital interests of staff and  workers, it is necessary to uphold the principles that  decisionmaking is scientific and democratic, that staff and  workers as a whole are benefited, that the overall bearing  capacity of staff and workers should be taken into full account,  and that the basic living standards of staff and workers is  ensured. This is both the requirement that "reform is for the  people" and also the specific embodiment of relying  wholeheartedly on the working class.    Third, we must rely on staff and workers to transform  state-owned enterprise operational mechanisms and promote the  building of a modern enterprise system, so that the status and  the right of staff and workers to be the masters of their own  affairs will be conscientiously implemented in enterprises.  The transformation of state-owned enterprise operational  mechanisms, in particular the building of a modern enterprise  system, is an innovation of the socialist enterprise system and  is an inevitable requirement for big socialized production and  the development of a socialist market economy. One of the  important features of a modern enterprise system with Chinese  characteristics is to build a scientific enterprise leadership  system and organizational and management system. State-owned  enterprise mechanism transformation and system building did not,  and will not, change the status of staff and workers of being  the masters of their own affairs in enterprises. When staff and  workers lose their status of being the masters of their own  affairs in enterprises, enterprises lose their socialist nature.  To uphold and improve the democratic management system with  staff and workers representative conferences as the basic form,  and to constantly explore new forms of realizing staff and  workers democratic management and democratic supervision, are  important contents of relying on staff and workers for mechanism  transformation and system building and are the essential  property of socialist enterprises.    This year, departments concerned in the State Council will  organize a number of large and medium state-owned enterprises to  make experiments on building a modern enterprise system  according to the requirements of the "Corporations Law" to  explore the effective ways of integrating public ownership with  market economy to further emancipate and develop the productive  forces. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress  clearly pointed out: "Trade unions and staff and workers  representative conferences should organize staff and workers to  take part in enterprise democratic management and safeguard  their legitimate rights and interests. Therefore, state-owned  and collective enterprises, whether they practise a  contract-based system or a shareholding system, or enterprise  groups carrying out corporation transformation and development,  must carry out staff and workers democratic management.  According to the stipulations in the `Corporations Law,'  limited liability companies set up by state-owned sole  proprietorship enterprises, by more than two state-owned  enterprises, or by more than two state-owned investment  subjects, carry out democratic management through staff and  workers representative conferences and other forms according to  the Constitution and regulations in relevant laws." Regarding  the functions and powers of staff and workers representative  conferences, the regulations of the "Enterprises Law" should be  carried out in principle and we should study and solve new  problems in adapting to the requirements of the corporation  system.    When boards of directors, supervisory boards, and  shareholders general meetings are set up in these types of  enterprises, a certain number of staff and workers  representatives should be elected by the whole staff and workers  or by staff and workers representative conferences of  enterprises, to take part in these bodies. In public ownership  and nonpublic ownership enterprises, especially in foreign  business-invested enterprises and private enterprises, it is  necessary to set up a system of consultations and negotiations  and of signing collective contracts. Trade unions should carry  out on behalf of staff and workers and enterprises equal  consultations and negotiations on labor remuneration, working  hours, holidays and vacations, labor protection, insurance  welfare, women's special protection, and other labor rights and  interests, and sign collective contracts which standardize the  relations of both parties, promote cooperation between both  parties, and build up stable and coordinated labor relations,  thus implementing the principle of relying on the working class  in enterprises.    Fourth, we should conscientiously ensure and safeguard  the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers and do  practical jobs and good things for them. While continuing  to safeguard the political and democratic rights of staff and  workers, it is a major issue that cannot be neglected to attach  importance to safeguarding the material interests and the right  to work of staff and workers. This has a direct function and  impact on getting hold of the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability. The "Decision" by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Congress pointed out that it was  necessary to respect the pioneering spirit of the masses and  safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. The task of  reform and development this year is extremely heavy and many  reform measures of great strength and involving a wide range of  subjects have been, or will be, introduced. It is really not an  easy job to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development  of the national economy and to maintain social stability in the  course of speeding up transformation of the system. Thus, in  promoting various reforms, developing various jobs, and handling  various contradiction relations, we are required to pay much  attention to understanding the ideological sentiments of staff  and workers and help them solve practical problems of our own  accord while conscientiously safeguarding their rights and  interests. At present, there are some problems with the bearing  capacity of staff in the various localities in the course of  turning losses into increased profits for loss-making  enterprises, of placement of enterprise surplus staff and  workers and bankrupt enterprise staff and workers, occupational  recommendations, relief and basic livelihood guarantees for  staff and workers who are badly off, social insurance system,  housing system, and pricing system, as well as problems that  have appeared in delayed payment of wages and pensions for staff  and workers in some organizations, government departments  concerned and enterprises should solve the above problems  properly and strictly in accordance with relevant state  regulations. We should give priority to efficiency and  consideration to fair play, reform the distribution system, and  accomplish the combination of responsibility, power, and  interests, the unity of state, collective, and individual  interests, and the linkage of the labor of staff and workers  with their labor results, thereby truly embodying the principle  of to each according to his labor. We should quicken the pace  of reform of the social insurance system and build a mechanism  to safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of staff and  workers. We should work out standards of guarantees for staff  and workers basic livelihoods and build the lowest wage system  and a mechanism for normal wage growth.    Fifth, to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, we  must bring the role of trade union organizations into full  play. As a mass organization for the working class, trade  unions are bridges and ties of the party which link with the  masses of staff and workers. They are also social pillars of  state powers. With the development of a socialist market  economy, the pattern of interests of the three sides; that is,  the state, the collective, and individuals, will gradually take  shape. Trade unions are the outcome of labor relations and  economic contradictions. Their status as representatives  safeguarding the interests of staff and workers has become more  obvious and their role of democratic channels and social  regulation has become more outstanding. They will shoulder more  arduous tasks and play a more important role. Therefore, party  committees at various levels should strengthen and improve their  leadership over trade union work according to the spirit of the  central authorities, place it in an important position on the  agenda, attach importance to and strengthen the building of  trade union leading bodies, and help them further open up the  channels for participating in the government and discussing  political affairs. In the course of experimenting on the reform  of building a modern enterprise system, government departments  concerned should, according to laws and regulation and the  spirit of directives by the central authorities, absorb trade  unions into taking part in relevant experimental work in the  whole process and in all directions, including participation in  working bodies, drafting documents, and making experiments and  carrying out follow-up investigations together. Government and  trade unions should strengthen communications and contacts  through informal discussions and joint meetings. It is  necessary to clarify the status and position of trade unions in  representing the interests of staff and workers in the face of  the government and enterprises, support them in safeguarding the  legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers according  to law, regulate labor relations, and to organize staff and  workers to develop activities. It is necessary to promote  various localities to work out detailed rules and regulations  for the implementation of the "Trade Unions law" and further  clarify the rights and duties of trade unions. It is necessary  to support and help trade union organizations to strengthen  reform and building themselves, carry out positive explorations  in the organizational system, operational mechanism, and methods  of activities, accelerate the democratization process and  carrying out the mass line, and bring the role of trade union  organizations into full play.   <H8>    III. </H8>   To develop a socialist market economy is the great creative  cause of the Chinese working class and the people of various  nationalities in China. All staff and workers in China should  fully understand the historical importance of the task they  shoulder; they should continue to develop the glorious  traditions of the working class in the overall situation of  reform, development, and stability; and they should further give  play to the spirit of being the masters of their own affairs and  the role of the main force; and make new and greater  contributions.    --The working class should continue to develop the spirit of  building an enterprise through arduous effort, regard  emancipating and developing the productive forces as its own  responsibility, and make greater efforts to speed up economic  development. With a high sense of responsibility of being the  master of its own affairs, it should bring its enthusiasm,  initiatives, and creativity into full play; base itself on its  own jobs; learn and catch up with the advanced; and strive to  make first-rate achievements. It is necessary to try to improve  product quality, provide best quality services, heighten labor  productivity and economic performance, promote loss-making  enterprises to turn losses into increased profits, and perform  meritorious deeds for the national economy to enter a new stage  by developing on an extensive basis a labor emulation drive,  rationalization proposals, technological innovation,  technological coordination, and invention and creation  activities.    --The working class should actively support reform,  conscientiously stand in its forefront, and constantly push  forward the socialist cause of reform. The reform we are  carrying out is the most brilliant cause in the history of  mankind. The working class should perform its glorious duty as  the master and the subject of reform, actively plunge itself  into it, and suggest ways and means for its smooth progress; it  should support the party and the government in introducing a  number of important reform policies and measures, and take the  initiative in participating in various reform practices; and it  should correctly understand the gain and loss of interests in  reform, handle well the relations between personal and  collective interests, partial and overall interests, and  immediate and long-term interests. It should soberly understand  that the deeper the economic structural reform, the more the  interest pattern is readjusted and the more expanded the role of  market; the more we working class should stress ideals,  discipline, unity, and the overall situation, the more we should  develop the fine tradition of the working class and the spirit  of "people in the same boat helping each other" and of taking  the situation as a whole into consideration; and the more we  should uphold the road of common development and common  prosperity.    --The working class should be the model of stability, and  give full play to its role in safeguarding social political  stability. For a country like China with a large population and  a relatively undeveloped economy, nothing can be done without a  stable political situation. The working class should establish  the idea of the legal system, treasure and safeguard the  political situation of stability and unity, and consolidate and  strengthen the unity and unification of the working class  contingent. It is necessary further to make clear that we  should rely wholeheartedly on the working class, on the working  class as a whole, relying mainly on industrial workers,  intellectuals, and administrators. Their fundamental interests  coincide. Industrial workers are required to have culture,  knowledge, and technique; intellectuals are required to have  practical experiences and to be integrated with workers;  administrators are required to have culture, knowledge, and  technique, required to have practical experiences, and also  required to have management ability and a sense of the masses.  Therefore, industrial workers, intellectuals, and  administrators should strengthen unity and coordination among  themselves and should especially handle well the relations  between the leaders and those who are led. It is necessary to  resolutely oppose various activities of splitting the working  class contingent, to actively participate in comprehensive  control of social security, and to resolutely struggle against  various illegal and criminal activities and negative and corrupt  phenomena.    --The working class should further strengthen the building  of  spiritual civilization and strive to improve the quality of its  own. The development of a socialist market economy puts forward  higher requirements on the overall quality of staff and workers.  We must uphold the principle of dual tactics and both tactics  should be tough. The broad masses of staff and workers should  seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the knowledge of  the market economy and scientific and cultural knowledge,  strengthen education on social morality and occupational  morality, constantly improve the cultural and technological  quality and ideological and political quality of staff and  workers contingent, and enhance their competitive power. They  should actively initiate upholding a correct world outlook and a  civilized and healthy way of life in the course of developing a  socialist market economy, influence and bring along the whole  society by the advanced ideas and model actions of the working  class, push forward the building of the socialist spiritual  civilization, and promote overall social progress.</p>

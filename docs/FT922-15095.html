			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cypriot bank offensive in PPI row THE TURKISH Cypriot Central Bank has taken the offensive in a legal battle with the administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit, leisure, and electronics group, and is to contest the High Court's decision to serve a worldwide order against it last year. News of the move, which if successful might result in the award of damages to the bank, came within hours of a decision in the House of Lords refusing the administrators permission to appeal against an Appeal Court decision last month lifting the freezing order against the bank on Pounds 38.9m of its assets. 'We strongly object to the way the administrators pitched their argument against the bank in terms of fraud and money laundering. Their evidence did not justify a Mareva injunction. That has now been vindicated by the Appeals Court and the House of Lords,' said Mr David Janney of Theodore Goddard, the solicitors acting for the Turkish Cypriot Central Bank, which itself acts on behalf of the internationally unrecognised Turkish Cypriot government. The bank has already won costs in the case, believed to run into several hundred thousand pounds, from the Polly Peck administration. The original High Court order was one of five world-wide orders granted last November to the administrators who are seeking to recover about Pounds 500m of funds allegedly improperly removed from the company. Last month the Central Bank won a Court of Appeal ruling lifting the freezing order on its assets. Likely interference of a Mareva injunction with the normal working of the bank and the weakness of the administrators' evidence were given as reasons for the Appeal court ruling. The Turkish Cypriot Central Bank still faces a less stringent temporary injunction requiring it to keep Pounds 10.7m in a special account until tracing claims on funds have been resolved.</p>

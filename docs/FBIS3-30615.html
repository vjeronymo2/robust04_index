			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["DUMA PRESS" report] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov described as a  complete fabrication the reports issued by the Balkan Agency on  31 January alleging that foreign intelligence services were  eavesdropping on closed sessions of the National Assembly and  some of the parliamentary commissions.    Last night the agency disseminated a report that the  Russians  had warned our special services that this was happening. The  Russians allegedly hinted that the Americans had eavesdropped on  the secrets of the Bulgarian legislators. According to the  report, a commission had already been formed to investigate the  tip-off, with members from the NSO [National Protection  Service], the VKR [Military Counterintelligence], the Higher  Institute of the Interior Ministry, and other bodies. It was  claimed that it was easy to wiretap the proceedings of  parliament from a telephone cable junction box nearby.    Last night DUMA reporters were unable to find any junction  box outside the National Assembly. Viktor Mikhaylov said that  the Interior Ministry Institute cannot take part in such a  commission because it has no consultative powers.    Specialists point out that the National Protection Service  provides bodyguards, and does not perform operational functions.  Even former spies, who had suffered bitter experiences when the  former military counterintelligence was destroyed, discounted  the possibility of Military Counterintelligence being involved  in such matters.</p>

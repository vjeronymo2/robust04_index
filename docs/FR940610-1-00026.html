On November 13, 1992, the WVOAQ also submitted a maintenance plan for the Parkersburg area as a revision to the West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP). On February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal. The EPA is proposing to redesignate the Parkersburg ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and proposing to approve the maintenance plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because the relevant requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This proposal to approve the redesignation is contingent upon West Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions for implementation of contingency measures.These actions are being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Parkersburg area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on July 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be sent to Thomas J.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. (1977 Act, sections 110(a)(1) and 172.) The Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS on September 12, 1978. (40 CFR 81.347) In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, West Virginia submitted a part D ozone SIP on November 15, 1979 which EPA approved as meeting the requirements of section 110 and part D of the 1977 Act. In its SIP, the State of West Virginia projected that the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area would attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. The area failed to attain the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (hereafter the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The nonattainment designation of the Parkersburg, West Virginia area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, furthermore, it was classified by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area more recently has attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air quality data from 1989 through 1991. In an effort to comply with the Act and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 13, 1992 the WVOAQ submitted an ozone maintenance plan for the Parkersburg West Virginia area as a revision to the West Virginia SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

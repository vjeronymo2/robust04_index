			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- These days words are  abroad in the high-placed quarters of the South Korean  "Democratic Liberal Party" (DLP) complaining at the call of U.S.  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard for the abolition  of the "National Security Law" (NSL), according to a radio  report from Seoul.    The traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the "DLP", voiced  opposition to the call, grumbling that the speech of Hubbard was  problematic. The "chief of the DLP's Policymaking Committee"  expressed "apprehensions" over the official position of the  United States calling for the abolition of the "NSL", terming it  "an interference in the internal affairs".    Such outbursts of the South Korean puppet clique ignoring  the  unbiased public opinion are an open challenge to all the fellow  countrymen who want to see the notorious "NSL" scrapped, bring  the North-South dialogue to a success at an early date and thus  to achieve the reunification of the country. It is a graphic  manifestation of the puppets' anti-national, anti-reunification  stand.    What must not be overlooked is that the puppets let loose  such preposterous remarks as "the North's line of reunification  through the communization of the South" and "human rights  situation of the North", connecting the question of the  maintenance of the "NSL" with the North.    Their malicious abuses and slander against the North are  nothing but despicable attempts to conceal their grisly human  rights problem and, all the same time, to suppress the South  Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy and  reunification and block the North-South dialogue and  reunification of the country at any cost by preserving the "NSL".    For peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceful  reunification of the country the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must  be removed and such fascist laws as the "NSL" be scrapped in  South Korea without delay.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Text] For the first time ever, Israel is prepared to  allow the deployment of forces under international supervision  in Gaza and Jericho. This emerged this evening in consultations  held by the prime minister and the foreign minister. A check  conducted by our correspondent reveals that a majority is  emerging in the cabinet in favor of evacuating the settlers from  the heart of Hebron. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el  Rosen reports:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] Shim'on Peres set the tone in  yesterday's cabinet session, when he called on his fellow  ministers to comply with the new demands of the Palestinians.  Today he reiterated as much it in public.    [Peres] To the extent that their demands are sensible, they  will be examined. For example, if the Palestinians say the size  of the police force must be increased, I believe it is a  legitimate demand which requires pointed discussion.    [Rosen] It is now clear that the cabinet's decisions are not  enough, and that the PLO will have to be given more. Some  ministers, including hawks such as Ya'aqov Tzur, argue that much  more than 30 settlers must be disarmed and their movements must  be restricted.    More radical proposals have been floated in the cabinet. For  example, there apparently is a majority in favor of evacuating  the settlers from Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and Tall al-Rumaythah  in Hebron. Half the cabinet ministers are unequivocally in  favor of such a move: The four ministers of Meretz -- Shulamit  Aloni, Ya'ir Tzaban, Yosi Sarid, and Amnon Rubinstein -- as well  as Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, Yisra'el Qeysar, 'Uzi Bar'am, and  Mikha Harish, who makes his consent conditional on such a demand  coming from the defense establishment.    Three ministers oppose it: Shim'on Shetrit, Ya'aqov Tzur,  and Ora Namir. The latter favors such a move, but does not  believe it is feasible.    Two other ministers, Moshe Shahal and Shim'on Peres, refused  to answer. One minister, David Liba'i, said he is not  knowledgeable on the matter. Nevertheless, it is hard to see  any of them voting against such a proposal if it is raised.    We could not obtain the answer of Minister Avraham Shohat.  Yitzhaq Rabin is opposed to reopening the Declaration of  Principles, but it is not certain that he perceives the  evacuation of Hebron as falling in that category. When we asked  him about it today, he replied: I am not prepared to elaborate.  [end recording]    [Later in the broadcast, the announcer adds: "The Council of  Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is furious at  our report that most ministers are in favor of removing the  settlers from the heart of Hebron." In a recorded passage,  local settlement leader Elyaqim Ha'etzni states: "If they touch  any settlement, including the Jewish settlement in Hebron, all  of us to the last man will prevent it. Nobody will stay alone  here. Not even one brick will be removed from this edifice.  Let this much be clear. We will be followed in our footsteps  by every Jewish patriot in Eretz Yisra'el. Indeed, all of us  here will not allow them to tear us apart one by one. They will  not start with Hebron, which may very well be the most precious  of all our settlements."]</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE TO ADD SUBSTATION, MORE PATROLS IN PALISADES  </P> <P> In response to a series of tragedies involving Pacific Palisades youths during  the last two years, community leaders have persuaded Los Angeles police to open  a substation this month and to add an extra patrol in the affluent area.  </P> <P> After meetings with police officials from the West Los Angeles Division, the  Palisades Chamber of Commerce agreed to donate its office space for the  substation, which will allow officers to file criminal reports in the area  rather than returning to headquarters several miles away.  </P> <P> In the last 19 months, 10 young residents of the community, including seven  students at Palisades High School, have suffered violent deaths, most involving  alcohol or drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attractive to Criminals  </P> <P> Palisades business leaders fear that publicity surrounding the deaths could  make the community more attractive to criminals, and residents have been  grappling recently with ways to increase police enforcement in the area.  </P> <P> Arnie Wishnick, Chamber of Commerce president, said residents will continue to  meet with police to see if they can find a way to staff the substation full  time.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the substation, which will be open for use 24 hours, will only  be used by officers who want to cut down on their travel time to division  headquarters by filing their reports in the chamber office.  </P> <P> Police officials have balked at a full-time substation, saying it would be  beneficial to have more officers patrolling the streets.  </P> <P> "At the very least, it will keep them in the Palisades that much longer," said  Ann Pritchard, executive director of the chamber. "A lot of people have been  expressing concern about our vulnerability. This should help."  </P> <P> Police emphasized that Palisades residents should continue to report crimes to  West Los Angeles Division headquarters.  </P> <P> Pritchard said the opening has been delayed two weeks because the chamber's  landlord has asked for an insurance liability release for the substation. She  said she expects it to open in about two weeks.  </P> <P> In addition to the substation and the added patrol, the foot patrol officer now  assigned to the Palisades will no longer be reassigned to other areas in West  Los Angeles when the need arises, according to police officials. The Palisades  patrol area extends from Mandeville Canyon to the beach.  </P> <P> The community's concern about crime in the area peaked late last October after  four youths were killed in a fiery crash when their auto veered out of control  and struck a light pole on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica. Three of the  youths were students at Palisades High School. Toxicology reports showed that  three of them, including the driver, had been drinking.  </P> <P> The incident followed the highly publicized murder of an 18-year-old Palisades  High senior. Teak Dyer was found beaten and shot to death in a Pacific  Palisades office building, not far from the Chamber of Commerce, in late June.  </P> <P> "The community wanted police protection to be a higher priority," Wishnick  said. "The more police visibility we have, the better off we'll be."  </P></p>

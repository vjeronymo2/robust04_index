			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- "Ukrainian border guards  were overexcited with patriotism," Head of the Black Sea Fleet  Press Center Andrey Grachev told ITAR-TASS here today,  commenting on the Odessa conflict of Russian seamen with  Ukrainian border guards.    In his words, the Russian Cheleken military vessel arrived  in  Odessa to load hydrographic equipment and carry it to  Sevastopol. However, last night Ukrainian border guards tried to  prevent this and even placed armed guards near the ship. Their  actions almost provoked a serious conflict.    In the opinion of Grachev, Ukrainian military are  responsible  for the attempt to hamper the planned transportation of Russian  property for repairs. He stressed that the Russian hydrographic  vessel which has a military crew shall not be liable for customs  and border inspection. There are no documents to prohibit such  actions in the Black Sea Fleet's operational zone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Union of Banks, Insurance, and  Financial Institutions Employees, at a news conference in Lagos,  dissociated itself from any plans to engage in confrontation  with the present administration. In a statement by its general  secretary, Dr. Shaibu Ibrahim, the union described as  mischievous a report to that effect by international newspapers.  The union said it has never supported any group, individuals,  or NADECO [National Democratic Coalition] in any plan to foment  political unrest, and asserts that it would not be a party to  any activities that could undermine the peace and stability of  the nation.

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown's mixture lacks cohesion MR Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday said his party's manifesto was 'a combination Britain has not seen before'. To him it is an earthly embodiment of a 1990s Zeitgeist. More prosaically, it is an assortment of policies, some old, some new and some requiring far higher public borrowing and higher taxes. The manifesto has evolved over the past five years largely under the direction of Lord Holme, the urbane former Liberal party president. It mirrors Mr Ashdown's impulsive and sometimes contradictory political convictions. He wants to be a radical, to be set apart from both Labour and the Tories, but he covets common-sense policies and hard-nosed pragmatism. It is not a cohesive ideology. Instead, bright wheezes have been costed and reworked to fit into a framework that has common strands but cannot be defined in conventional terms or in a single phrase. A Keynesian package of investment and education spending to kick-start the economy, at a cost of Pounds 6bn, is ring-fenced from measures to promote competition and efficiency by the application of free-market economics. Private monopolies such as BT and British Gas would be broken up; a restrictive practices court established and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission combined with the Office of Fair Trading. The Bank of England would win independence, and sterling would move to the narrow bands of the European exchange rate mechanism. Tactically, Mr Ashdown can sell the Liberal Democrats as stronger on public investment than Labour and more pro-market than the Tories. But in practice a Liberal Democrat government would find itself simultaneously raising taxes and public borrowing for its government-directed investment programme, creating 600,000 jobs over two years, while supposedly recognising 'that the free market is the best guarantee of responsiveness to choice and change'. Parts of the manifesto will be familiar from the Alliance parties' 1987 campaign - particularly the commitment to constitutional reform. Pledges to Scottish and Welsh home rule, a local income tax, profit-related pay schemes, help for small businesses, and an integrated tax and benefits system have also survived. But under Mr Ashdown and Lord Holme the 1950s internationalist Liberal tradition has been revived and reinserted. European union is embraced almost without qualification; defence spending cuts will be halted pending an assesment of Britain's role in a rapid reaction force or a United Nations peacekeeping project. Grassroots liberalism has returned, reflected in policies for increasing local control over schools, hospitals and local taxation. There is also Mr Ashdown's version of the Tory Citizen's Charter, which includes a state-guaranteed basic income for all. The only acknowledgement of a possible hung parliament is in the manifesto's conclusion, where the party pledges itself to 'neither support nor participate in a government which turns its back on reform'. Mr Ashdown almost relishes the potential vote-losing appeal of his manifesto. He wears a hair shirt in proposing an extra 1p on income tax to fund an extra Pounds 2bn on education and in raising petrol tax by 10p a year for five years to help cut pollution. This is tempered by a promise not to introduce rises until compensation schemes are ready for rural areas and the disadvantaged. Mr Ashdown's overall promise is a varied one: tough policies for voters who dislike tax bribes or unsubstantiated spending promises; free-market economics for disgruntled Tories; job-creation schemes for the unemployed. The intellectual consistency may be brash, but it is a manifesto that can be sold to many different audiences.</p>

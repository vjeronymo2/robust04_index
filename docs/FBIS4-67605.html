			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 15 (BTA) -- Associate Professor  Khristo Tsvetanski, a cancer specialist working with the  National Oncology Centre since 1970, gave BTA an interview on  the incidence of cancer in Bulgaria.    Q: How does the cancer incidence in Bulgaria  compare to European rates?    A: Bulgaria ranks in the medium range of cancer  incidence, according to figures released by the Epidemiology  Unit of the National Oncology Centre, which are also reported to  the World Health Organization.    Q: Where does cancer stand among the major causes  of early death and disability?    A: It ranks second after heart disease.    Q: Is cancer incidence in Bulgaria on the  increase?    A: There is an upward trend worldwide and  Bulgaria is no exception. I will quote again figures provided  by our (epidemiology) unit. In 1985, 20,881 developed cancer,  bringing the total number of cancer patients to 132,374. The  1990 figures are 22,021 and 153,651, respectively. In 1992,  22,956 Bulgarians developed cancer, bringing the total to  139,243.    Q: Which types of cancer are the most widespread  in Bulgaria?    A: According to statistics, lung cancer ranks  first, followed by breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer.  Men are mostly affected by lung cancer. Other widespread types  of cancer in men are stomach, rectal, prostatic and colon  cancer. Women suffer most often from breast cancer, as well as  from cervical and ovarian cancer.    Q: Is cancer diagnosed early in Bulgaria?    A: Comparing Bulgaria to the developed countries,  there is a lot to be desired in this respect. It is alarming  that in recent years we have witnessed a retreat. In 1990,  52.99 percent of patients were diagnosed early. In 1992 their  proportion was 48.58 percent.    Q: Is cancer screening done now?    A: There used to be two mass screening programmes  for a long time. Fluorography, that is, screening for growths  in the chest and mainly in the lungs, is no longer done as the  method was rejected. Starting from 1956, all sexually active  women were invited to be screened for cervical cancer. In 1971  the smear (Pap) test was introduced. Over 1.5 million women  used to be tested every year, as a result of which many were  treated for conditions that might otherwise have developed into  cancer, or cancer was diagnosed early and treatment was much  easier and more effective. It is a pity that screening has not  been done since 1990.</p>

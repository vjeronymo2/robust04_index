Talking to a gathering in Kamalia  today, the minister said the people's government has  internationalized the Kashmir issue and tabled the resolution at  two international forums. If India will not honor its words,  Pakistan will agitate the issue again at international forums  with more vigor and force. Commenting on the press statement of  Indian authorities in which they contradicted their earlier  statement about the visit of the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization] ambassadors to the held valley, the minister said  Pakistan deferred voting on the resolution at Geneva at the  request and assurance of Iran which should now take up this  issue with India.    Mr. Khalid Ahmad Kharal regretted that the opposition is  ignoring the national interests by criticizing the government on  vitally important national issues like Kashmir. He said despite  the opposition's disinformation cell activities and propaganda,  the present government would complete its five-year term and  continue to serve the masses. He said the People's Party  government will implement a series of development projects to  improve the socioeconomic status of farmers and bring the  backward rural areas at par with the developed ones.</p>

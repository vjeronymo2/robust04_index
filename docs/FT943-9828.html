			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Personal View: Capitalism must seize the high ground Few would dispute that events in the past few years have demonstrated the practical desirability of markets over socialism. Yet there is good reason to doubt that capitalism's victory is total. Despite the efforts of many great economists, political philosophers, and historians, economic liberty has not captured the moral or high ground in public debate. Thus its security as a system of economic organisation is not guaranteed anywhere in the world. If economic liberty is valued today, it is rarely because it is considered more just or more proper than any alternative. It is valued primarily on managerial and technical grounds. We feel free to argue about how many 'jobs' this or that piece of legislation creates; but we remain squeamish about asking whose property will be used to create these jobs. An argument over whether there ought to be ceilings on corporate remuneration centres on whether high salaries are economically justifiable, but not on whether government ought to have say over such matters. We might dispute a proposal to force another function on private business on grounds of cost, but not on grounds of the right and wrong uses of private enterprise. Consider the opinions of men and women whose work affords opportunity for philosophical reflection on morality - the two most prominent being academics and ecclesiastics. How many among them would be willing to attempt a moral defence of private property and free markets? How can the institutions of liberty survive and flourish so long as the moral opinion makers are so overwhelmingly sympathetic to only one side of the debate? A secure liberty must be based on a firm moral foundation, and yet the moral terminology of contemporary political debate is often secretly at war with liberty. This represents more than linguistic confusion; it represents a danger to the proper exercise of virtue. Advocates of capitalism and economic liberty can and must assume the moral high ground. So long as economic liberty - and its requisite institutions of private property, free exchange, capital accumulation, contract enforcement - is not backed by a generally held set of norms by which it can be defended, it cannot be sustained long-term. Into the moral vacuum left by capitalism's defenders rush notions hostile to economic liberty, notions drawn largely from the values and vocabularies of interventionism and socialism. The link between economic liberty and public morality is more than suggestive; it is direct. A historian would be hard pressed to identify a society with a deep and unyielding respect for the sanctity of private property that did not also have a relatively intact culture. Similarly, cultural decline, family collapse, and widespread secularisation have historically corresponded with statism and socialism. The moral defence of liberty must make a series of distinctions: between rights and privileges, between society and government, between community and the collective. Rights, society, and community are all part of the natural order of liberty. Privileges, government, and the collective are not entirely separate, but they are essentially different in that they rest on pre-emptive coercion. In the terminology of the public philosopher Albert Jay Nock, what is done by political means should not be confused with what is done by social means. A moral argument for economic liberty should not shrink from its own logical implications, however politically unfashionable. An imperative against theft and in favour of the security of private property must also suggest caution about taxes above the minimum necessary for the rule of law. Freedom of contract must include the freedom not to contract. Toleration of individual differences must include tolerance for the inequality in wealth that will be the unavoidable result. It is sometimes said that no one dreams of capitalism. This too must change. Rightly understood, capitalism is the name for the economic component of the natural order of liberty. It means wide ownership of property, fair and equal rules for all, economic security through prosperity, strict adherence to the boundaries of ownership, opportunity for charity, wise use of resources, creativity, growth, development, prosperity, abundance, and, most of all, the economic application of the principle that every human person has dignity and should have that dignity respected. It is a dream worthy of our spiritual imaginations. Father Sirico is president of the Acton Institute for the study of Religion and Liberty in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US. This article is drawn from his larger monograph 'The Moral Foundations of Liberty' (Institute for Economic Affairs, 1994).</p>

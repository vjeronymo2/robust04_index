			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hutchison raises loan for UK unit Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, has raised a Pounds 700m loan for its tele-communications subsidiary in the UK. There was strong demand for the loan, which has a term of three years and pays 55 basis points above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor). Hutchison originally came to the market for Pounds 500m. The deal also marked an unusual display of co-operation among the UK's two leading clearing banks, Barclays and National Westminster, which arranged the loan together with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Mr Ashley Wilkins, director of capital markets at NatWest Markets, said: 'To get the two biggest UK banks in the market together means there's a lot of credibility behind the deal.' The proceeds of the loan will be used by Hutchison Telecommunications Holdings (UK) to finance Hutchison's investment in the company. Hutchison has a 65 per cent interest while Barclays owns 5 per cent and British Aerospace the remaining 30 per cent. The UK subsidiary recently launched a digital personal communications network in the UK under the name of 'Orange'. The loan was underwritten by a group of six arrangers; Barclays Bank, Chase Manhattan Asia, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, NatWest Markets, and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.</p>

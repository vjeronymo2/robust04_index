			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Protection of privacy Anyone who read one of Britain's tabloids yesterday would feel the need to wash his or her hands; if you read them all only a hot bath in mild acid would suffice. There is no need to repeat what they said. That would be to fall into the trap of protesting against muck while disseminating it oneself. Let us just say that the popular press was at its most vile. Yet at breakfast I still doubted the need for a privacy law. The old argument seemed paramount. There is too much secrecy in Britain as it is. Any further obstacle to the free expression of opinion, or the absolute right to publish, would be the thin end of a dangerous wedge. The treatment of Mr Paddy Ashdown was outrageous, but it did not quite justify a new legal constraint. Then the news came through that the secretary with whom Mr Ashdown had had a brief relationship five years ago had succumbed to hounding by the tabloids. She allowed herself to be photographed, in the hope that the persecution would stop. I believe that there is no legitimate public interest in the Liberal Democrat leader's long-past private behaviour, but others may disagree. When it comes to the woman in the case there is no room for argument or doubt. She is a private person who, in the words of her statement, has been subjected to 'intolerable pressures and intrusions' by hirelings of the popular press. This is something against which there ought to be a law. Nothing will be done this side of an election, after which everyone may have cooled down. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, is disposed to give the present system of self-regulation by the Press Complaints Commission another year in which to prove itself. He does not believe that it has yet done so. A Labour government would probably take the same view, although it would have as much reason to be ill-disposed towards the tabloids (the Mirror excepted) as a victorious Conservative government would have to be grateful to them. Either way, the chairman of the complaints commission, Lord McGregor, has time in which to persuade editors and proprietors that the penalty for publishing intrusive tripe is likely to be irresistible back-bench pressure for new legislation. The back benches will count for something if, as is likely, there is a hung parliament or the next government rests on a slim majority. Lord McGregor argues that a law of privacy would enable public personages or governments to conceal important truths, while the absence of such a law would mean that a small number of individuals would have to suffer horrors of the sort we saw yesterday. Reluctantly, he concludes that we have to accept the latter in the interests of a free press in a democracy. This has been the majority view since the Calcutt committee on privacy reported in Nothing will be done this side of an election, after which everyone may have cooled down June 1990. The committee sought to balance article 8 of the European convention on human rights ('everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence . . . ') against article 10 ('everyone has the right to freedom of expression . . . '). It chose to be guided by the principle that while freedom of expression is pre-eminent, certain exceptions protecting individual privacy may be necessary. It recommended that media intrusion into private property without consent, and for the purpose of obtaining personal information, should become a criminal offence. The law should provide for injunctions against the publication of stories or photographs so acquired; alternatively the victim could sue. The efficacy of injunctions has once again been thrown into doubt this week but, as to the rest, it must be said that Calcutt had a point. The committee also rejected a privacy law, partly on principle and partly because there were 'more appropriate remedies', presumably including the new Press Complaints Commission. That sounded OK at the time. It sounds less so today. Our own Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who was chairman of the Press Council until the commission replaced it, favours a new tort of 'unwarranted invasion of privacy,' subject to a 'public interest' defence, which would leave it to the courts to fill in the details. There would be no prior restraint, but the media could be sued by aggrieved individuals. Considering what the judges have done with the law of defamation, I am not too sure about this generalised approach. Our crusty courts would be likely to build up huge defences against reasonable disclosures. The remaining option is debated in Calcutt, and preferred by Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, a media expert. This is to specify what is protected, such as hospital records or stolen documents containing intimate personal details; as to doorstep loiterers armed with notebooks and cameras you could sue against 'watching and besetting' your domain. This is the US approach, which did not help Governor Bill Clinton - but there is no protection against an unscrupulous teller of tales. The case for a privacy law based on specified disclosures of personal information is now hard to rebut. It may not have stopped publication of all of this week's tabloid articles, but editors would have had to weigh the likely cost of a lawsuit, and the strength of a public interest defence. Yet if the papers are to be discouraged from prying into the personal lives of anyone they please, they should also be better enabled to gather real news. A freedom of information bill, promised by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, should precede a privacy law. We also need to subject the activities of our spies to proper scrutiny. The present security service and official secrets acts would cover up illicit break-ins. This is particularly worrisome in a week in which many people once again suspect the secret services of being up to dirty tricks.</p>

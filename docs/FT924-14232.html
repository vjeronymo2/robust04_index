			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Penman's tour in London LONDON: A LITERARY COMPANION edited by Peter Vansittart John Murray Pounds 16.95, 311 pages ONLY ONE other city approaches London's richness in literary associations, and that is Paris. But London wins the comparison. It is the greatest of Europe's cities and until lately the capital of the largest empire the world has seen. For centuries the talented and ambitious flocked to it. One has only to read Henry James's account of his excited arrival in London to appreciate the city's attractive power. From Chaucer and Shakespeare to Shaw and James, aspirants were drawn to it as moths to a flame. Because of this London's very stones are soaked with historical and literary associations, so that to walk the great city is to go among a throng of magnificent ghosts, quickened and prompted in one's perceptions by the bodies of work they left behind: poetry and prose. To explore such treasures of literary association one needs a good guide. In this book we get the best possible. Fans of Peter Vansittart's work will know his genius for choosing apt quotations and the exact and exquisite economy of his introductions to them. Here we get his masterwork in this genre. It is as if he had commissioned the best writers of the last several centuries to provide him with paragraphs for this book, so exactly does each selection fit. The result is a cornucopia of good things. Vansittart begins by introducing us to the multiplicity of London. There are Londons of myth, history and literature; Londons in fog and heat; Londons for the rich, the poor and strangers; Londons in turmoil and Londons asleep. After giving us a bird's-eye view Vansittart takes us down the river and along the streets of these Londons, river and streets winding through time as through space, crowded at every turn with ghosts. Almost all the journeys begin at Piccadilly Circus. London is too vast to have a centre, Vansittart remarks, but something must serve as a starting-point. So from Eros we go south-west to Victoria, meeting Phineas in Parliament and the shades in Poet's Corner. From Eros again we pass through Covent Garden to Ludgate Hill, St Paul's, the City, and beyond, seeing Moll Flanders in Smithfield and Boswell marvelling at the Monument. Again from Eros we go to the Southwark of Shakespeare and Dickens and points south; from Eros again up Regent Street to Marble Arch and - calling on West London's literary hostesses for refreshment en route - thence to Notting Hill, whence Wyndham Lewis issued his Blasts. And finally we go from Eros to Bloomsbury and the northern lights of Highgate and Hampstead, where today's scribblers dwell. Every page bursts with delights; in them London pulses into life and one feels that Johnson's remark about what it means if one is tired of London applies equally to this book. It is in the truest sense a companion. The literary pilgrim will find it invaluable, the browser will find it a treasury. Anthologies and guides come and go, but this will prove a classic of its kind.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's President  Zhelyu Zhelev is on an informal visit to London. He told a news  conference there that early parliamentary elections will  probably be held in Bulgaria before the end of this year. This  morning the [Bulgarian] national radio aired the president's  comments on home policy issues at the press conference in London.    In connection with a commentary in THE FINANCIAL TIMES that  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's state of health (after a heart  failure in early March he underwent surgery) might provoke a  political crisis and early elections, thus delaying the reform  process, the President said: "The problem is not the PM's state  of health. He will recover and I am sure that a month from now  he will be even more efficient than before. The problem is that  the government itself is flawed, and so is the formula of its  formation." The present cabinet was formed at the end of 1992  as a government of experts, not affiliated to any party.    President Zhelev blamed the cabinet for counting too much on  the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (the former  communists) and pointed out that it ought to pursue its reform  programme, taking the risk of losing parliament's support.  According to the president, there are two possible solutions:  "Either this parliament will have to appoint a non-communist  government, backed by the Union of Democratic Forces, the New  Union for Democracy, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, and  the independent MP's, that would pursue the reforms  consistently, or we are heading for elections." It seems that  elections will be held before the end of this year, he said.    When asked whether a possible new cabinet, dominated by the  BSP (ranking first in opinion polls), would not make matters  even worse in regard to the reform, President Zhelev was  positive that the BSP is unable to form a cabinet. "In my  opinion, the BSP will find it hard to dominate the future  parliament. The problem it faces is not how to win the  elections; that will not be very difficult. The hard part of it  will come after the elections, when its victory will be of no  use, as it will be unable to form a cabinet," he said.    As to the steep rise of the key currencies against the  Bulgarian lev in the past few weeks, President Zhelev believes  it to be the result of speculation. Certain circles in Bulgaria  will benefit from that, as enterprises put up for privatization  will be twice cheaper, he explained. According to the  president, the central bank and the government can take measures  to stabilize the national currency, but the important point is  to step up privatization and restitution.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The deputy leader of COPEI's parliamentary group,  Nelson Chitty La Roche, said that Article 250 of the National  Constitution states that the Constitution may not be subjected  to pressures, and "certainly not to mechanisms different from  those provided for its amendment and reform," thereby rejecting  the statement by radical Deputy Pablo Medina, who has called for  the dissolution of Congress as the starting point for the debate  on a new Constitution.    According to Chitty La Roche, acting in contradiction to  what  is prescribed by the present Constitution would be the same as  carrying out a coup d'etat. For that reason, he disagrees with  Medina's statements.    In the opinion of the Social Christian parliamentarian,  Congress should concern itself with "legislating for the  people"; he argues that "the National Constitution is an  esoteric concept for people who live in slums."    Despite that statement, Chitty La Roche does not oppose  reforming the present Constitution, although he advocates doing  so in a more gradual way than what Deputy Medina has proposed.    Chitty La Roche also reiterated the need to legislate for  the  people's interests, mentioning in this regard the need to amend  the Mortgage Debtor Law, among others.    Finally, the Social Christian deputy said: "The procedures  for constitutional revision, amendment, and reform are set forth  in the Constitution, and we can offer our support only for those  procedures, unless we are to begin the French revolutionary  process and call for the abolition of all institutions, with  liberty to begin by prohibiting everything. And especially by  prohibiting prohibitions."</p>

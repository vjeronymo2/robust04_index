			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republic of Croatia is deeply concerned over the  developments in eastern Bosnia, particularly around Gorazde and  other safety zones in that part of our neighboring country, Mate  Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs, has told HINA.    The developments in eastern Bosnia, i.e., the looming  humanitarian catastrophe in Gorazde, undoubtedly represent a  violation of all UN Security Council resolutions regarding the  status of that area and require a very clear, unequivocal, and  effective response by the international community as its  credibility is at stake, Minister Granic says.    Apart from witnessing the tragedy of Gorazde, we are also  witnessing several very worrying developments clearly directed  against the attainment of peace in the republics of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina: In Baranja, repeated cases of seizure of  heavy weapons which had been placed under UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] control in accordance with the so-called Zagreb  agreement; threats by Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic that  units of Karadzic's army of the Srpska republic will attack  targets on the territory of the Republic of Croatia by all  available means, including missiles; the continuation of ethnic  cleansing in Prijedor and Banja Luka; the continuation of the  Serb offensives against Brcko, Orasje, Usora, Bihac, and Tuzla;  the arrest of a dozen UNPROFOR members; and the closure of  humanitarian corridors in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It is therefore necessary, Minister Granic said, that at  this  moment the international community should not only continue and  persist in relaunching negotiations in good faith and in  searching for a generally acceptable and permanent political  solution, but also in every separate case, it should use all  legal means, including all the forms of the use of force, as  laid down by the UN Security Council, to express its consistent  resolve not to allow the violation of international norms and UN  resolutions and also of the defined principles and the framework  for the resolution of the crisis in this part of Europe.</p>

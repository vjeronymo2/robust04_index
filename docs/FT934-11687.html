			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mediobanca SHAREHOLDERS in Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, yesterday approved a L1,020bn (Dollars 625m) capital increase to provide for the forthcoming wave of privatisations in Italy and to cover portfolio write-downs as a result of recession and the Ferruzzi-Montedison collapse, writes Robert Graham in Rome. There had been speculation that the three banks controlled by Iri, the state holding company - Credito Italiano, Banca Commerciale Italiano (BCI) and Banca di Roma - would use their combined 25 per cent stake to delay the move.</p>

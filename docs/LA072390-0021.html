			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> WEATHER POSTPONES ATLAS ROCKET LIFTOFF  </P> <P> The threat of severe thunderstorms at Cape Canaveral, Fla., forced another  postponement of the launch of a newly repaired Atlas rocket with a government  satellite aboard.  </P> <P> The first launch attempt, on Friday, was called off because of a helium leak,  but the part that caused the problem has been replaced, officials said. The  launch was rescheduled for 3:26 p.m. EDT today, but hopes were not high for a  blastoff because the weather outlook appeared to be about the same. The Atlas 1  rocket, making its commercial debut, was to boost the Combined Release and  Radiation Effects Satellite into an elliptical orbit.  </P></p>

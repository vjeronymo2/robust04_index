			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cheap imports blamed for Youngs fall Young &amp; Co's Brewery yesterday blamed cheap cross-Channel imports for a 13 per cent decline in interim profits. The south London-based company, which has a tied estate of about 180 pubs in the south-east, complained that illegal sales of continental beers had accelerated the trend away from pub drinking. Mr John Young, chairman, called on the government to lower beer duty to the levels in other EU countries. 'This is supposed to be a truly Common Market but British brewers - and therefore their customers - have to pay duty seven times higher than in France.' Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 fell to Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.58m) on flat turnover of Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 36.1m). Beer volumes are thought to have dropped by 5 per cent in the first half. Sales to non-Young outlets remained static, despite a 30 per cent rise in the number of free houses taking Young's beers. Supermarkets and off- licence sales represent less than 1 per cent of turnover. Operating margins slipped from 10.8 to 9.3 per cent as Young's lagers lost sales to other brands over the summer. The brewer said it would be training staff to encourage drinkers to try its lager. Exports, which represent 2.5 per cent of turnover, rose 35 per cent in North America. The company said it was making good progress with a new export drive to Hong Kong and China. Profits were depressed by refurbishment costs, which rose 67 per cent to more than Pounds 700,000, but are expected to revert to about Pounds 400,000 next year. Interest costs remained at Pounds 1.35m, and gearing stayed at about 30 per cent. Earnings per ordinary share fell to 11.34p (12.52p); the interim dividend is maintained at 7.25p.</p>

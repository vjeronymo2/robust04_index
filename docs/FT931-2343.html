			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Before the horse has bolted: The Budget has given racehorse owners a boost Drive into Newmarket and there is no doubt that this is a town built for horses. Signs point to the National Stud, the National Horseracing Museum and the equine virology unit. They also warn: 'Racehorses for five miles.' The warning may seem odd as visitors take in the beauty of hundreds of the finest horses streaming up Warren Hill early on a spring morning. Then a horse shies and leaps, and the hazards become apparent. A more appropriate warning sign before Tuesday's Budget might have read: 'VAT 17.5 per cent.' Since Tuesday, however, the shadow has been lifted; horse owners can now register for value-added tax and claim back the payments. The measure applies specifically to racing and no other area of horse ownership. The benefits will be considerable: for every Pounds 10,000 spent on a yearling, nearly Pounds 2,000 more is paid in tax; every Pounds 1,000 monthly training bill includes about Pounds 150 in VAT; every Pounds 300 vet's bill has more than Pounds 50 added for taxes. Besides the VAT burden Newmarket has suffered from recession and the UK's relatively low prize money, which provides insufficient compensation to cover high costs. About 400 of the town's 3,000 stables are empty, about a dozen yards are for sale, staff have been laid off. On top of all this, Tattersalls, the leading bloodstock auction house, had decided to move its most highly regarded yearling sale to the Republic of Ireland, where VAT is only 2.5 per cent. In France, VAT is 5.5 per cent. After the Budget measures, Tattersalls is likely to reverse its decision. One reason behind its thinking was that its principal buyers, the Maktoum brothers of Dubai's ruling family, did not buy at last autumn's sale. Instead, they bought in Ireland and in France, and VAT was one reason for the switch. Another ominous development was that Darley Stud Management, which looks after two of the Maktoum brothers' interests, allocated 24 per cent fewer yearlings to UK trainers than it had at the end of 1991. France and the US were the main beneficiaries. About half Darley Stud's 750 horses in training internationally are based at Newmarket. The implications were bad for every aspect of British racing. Thoroughbred breeders were losing custom and bloodstock prices were falling. Trainers froze or cut their fees to try to keep the smaller owners as the big ones switched horses overseas. Service providers, such as vets, blacksmiths and horse transporters, were suffering too. And the knock-on effects in a place such as Newmarket extended to hotels, restaurants and even the gentlemen's outfitters, which thrive on the 50 days a year of racing and sales. Many in the racing lobby believed that 30,000 jobs were at risk. But now, the same people would have you believe that the chancellor has saved British racing. Mr Geoffrey Wragg, one of the 65 trainers based in Newmarket, said the VAT relief meant that 'for every six horses you have in training you can get one trained free'. Mr Pip Payne, said: 'It's a great time to be a racehorse owner. The horses are cheaper, the training is cheaper, there is more racing and more prize money. The industry now has to market itself and generate more owners.' At Mr Alex Scott's yard, where the modern brick buildings have double-glazed windows and the equine pool is heated, more than half the 75 horses belong to Sheikh Maktoum Al Maktoum, who has yet to reduce his UK string significantly. It is now less likely that he will. But the Americans have gone, partly because 'there was nearly 20 per cent extra on the costs in England from VAT'. VAT was not the only reason. Lack of big prizes loomed just as large. As Mr Michael Goodbody, who manages the Sheikh's Gainsborough Stud, says: 'First prize in a maiden race in the UK might be Pounds 4,000, in Paris Pounds 8,000 and in the US Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 21,000). The VAT concession tackles the high cost of UK racing, saving perhaps Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m of the Pounds 150m estimated losses incurred yearly by owners. But it does nothing to tackle the low income side of the equation represented by low prizes. Complaints about the small proportion of betting income that is diverted into racing are just as loud as the erstwhile clamour over VAT. But although the cheering was loud on the VAT victory, a few questions are being raised. The main one is: will all owners benefit? The answer is that they can all register for VAT. But there are hurdles. According to the memorandum of understanding agreed between Customs and Excise and the industry, owners must 'seek' sponsorship, appearance money and prize money. Owners obviously seek the latter - although race courses will now pay VAT on the Pounds 40m total prize money involved, which they in turn will claim back. The other two requirements will change racing's traditions, bringing in a degree of commercialism that might raise a few eyebrows among the old guard. However, the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, says concessions must be made. Mr David Pipe, director of public affairs, said the ban on advertising in the parade ring would be lifted. Horses will soon sport logos on their rugs and saddle cloths. Jockeys will probably carry them on their boots and breeches, not on their silks. Appearance money is also a new development. But who will pay for it? Most of the UK's 59 race courses are not profitable. That leaves the race sponsors or, perhaps, the betting industry. For Customs and Excise, sponsorship and appearance money will attract VAT, offsetting the tax claimed back by racehorse owners on their expenses. An indication that the new VAT scheme is not supposed to be a one-way traffic of tax rebates for the industry with no offsetting receipts comes in the following extract from the memorandum: 'Customs will review the operation of the scheme . . . during its fourth year to assess whether the levels of income available to the industry . . . warrant the scheme's continuing operation.' The message is that if owners want to keep the VAT concession they will have to start treating their hobby as a business. More broadly, the industry has to help itself in finding a solution to its 'under-funding' by competing with other leisure activities for sponsorship, participants and spectators. A lot can change in four years in racing. One of those welcoming the VAT change was the head lad of Mr Michael Stoute's stable. He was sitting on a four-year-old that cost Pounds 760,000 as a yearling. But the horse didn't make the grade on the racecourse and has recently been gelded. That is exactly what could happen to the VAT scheme if owners sit back and neglect the commercial requirements imposed by Customs and Excise.</p>

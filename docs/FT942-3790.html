			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: End of the bloodletting in emerging markets - Capital and Credit The bloodletting in emerging bond markets has finally stopped, but it may take some time before investors regain some of the confidence that pushed prices to dizzying heights last year. Although cautious investor buying in recent weeks has bolstered prices and helped yield spreads over US Treasuries tighten, observers warn that the markets remain vulnerable to further upward lurches in US interest rates and political surprises. This may keep a lid on activity, both in the new issues sector and the secondary market. 'Given the political uncertainties, and the unfavourable recent capital market developments, I would not be surprised to see a slowdown in investments in the region this year,' Mr Onno van den Broek, general manager at ING Bank, said at an emerging markets conference in London last week. After a raging bull-run pushed emerging market bonds sharply higher in 1993, a dramatic turnround, triggered by the Federal Reserve's tightening and political and economic shocks in Latin America, sent prices into free-fall. JP Morgan's emerging markets bond index posted a total return of 44.17 per cent in 1993, before falling by as much as 22 per cent to its low on April 4. Since then it has recovered slightly, but is still down 13.3 per cent in the year to date. Since the correction, 'people have become more risk-averse - investors are gaining a bit of confidence, but the market will be slow to regain its composure,' says Mr Brian Lazell of JP Morgan in London. However, he and others say they have seen new investors entering the market. 'All the large customers who were in the market in the third quarter of 1993 are still invested, and there have been new investors coming in.' says Mr Stephen Dizard of Salomon Brothers in New York. 'We've seen new people enter the market who felt it was oversold and saw this as a buying opportunity,' echoes Mr Lawrence Brainard of Chase Securities in New York. However, 'the threat of higher US interest rates is still overhanging the market,' warns Mr Peter West of West Merchant Bank in London, although he says 'there may be room for further recovery' if the yield on the US long bond continues trading in a 7.2 to 7.5 per cent range. Latin American elections will also keep investors on their toes. While Mexico's PRI party is expected to remain in government after the August elections, the outcome of Brazil's elections in October is less clear-cut, with leftist opposition candidate Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva currently leading in the opinion polls. 'Emerging markets are macro-driven, which makes them very sensitive to politics,' says Salomon's Mr Dizard. 'You can expect to see a lot of volatility out of Latin America this year.' But this should not daunt fund managers, he says. 'They just have to manage their portfolios actively and may want to avoid exposure to certain markets at certain times. There is enough value in fundamentally sound countries such as Argentina and Mexico - you don't have to make dicey calls. But having some exposure to markets like Brazil and Venezuela can help boost performance.' Amid this uncertainty, new issuance in the eurobond market has slowed to a trickle, leaving an estimated Dollars 2bn - Dollars 3bn of new issue mandates piling up in underwriters' desk drawers as borrowers await more favourable conditions. In the year to date, Latin American borrowers have raised the equivalent of Dollars 7.6bn in eurobonds, compared with last year's Dollars 25.3bn total, according to IFR Securities Data. , Eurobond yield spreads over the underlying government bonds widened sharply during the sell-off, making emerging market borrowers more reluctant to tap the market. 'For any size, deals will have to err on the generous side, and that's holding issuers back,' said a syndicate official in London. Still, several Argentinian borrowers are expected to emerge soon, including the Province of Buenos Aires, Sodigas and Banco del Sud. The Republic of Argentina is expected to raise between DM400m and DM500m in short-dated bonds this week. Elsewhere, the government-owned Industrial Development Bank of India is poised to issue the first straight eurobond by an Indian borrower in four years. Market talk is of Dollars 100m of five-year floating-rate notes with a put option after three years, rumoured to be led by JP Morgan. One syndicate manager says he hopes eurobond investors 'learnt an important lesson' from the recent carnage, namely that they should pay more attention to credit considerations and fundamental factors, and less to the high returns some bonds may offer. Moreover, he says, they should ensure that the lead managers of new issues are committed to making a liquid secondary market in the paper. Lastly, he said 'issuers and underwriters need to have a responsible attitude to ensure issues are appropriately priced, get placed and don't weigh on the market'.</p>

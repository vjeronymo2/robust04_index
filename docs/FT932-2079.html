			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Barclays breaks ranks on data BARCLAYS, the largest UK bank, is to break with tradition among high-street banks by obtaining data from credit reference agencies about the financial transactions of applicants for its Barclaycard credit card. Barclaycard has agreed to supply full information about how some customers use credit cards to three agencies in exchange for access to data covering 100m accounts. It will use the data to assess customers' and applicants' creditworthiness. Barclaycard wants to use information held by the CCN, Equifax and Infolink agencies to assess applications for credit cards more accurately. It is particularly interested in seeing the other forms of credit a customer holds. The Barclays subsidiary hopes to be able to approve more applications for cards by using 'white data' on individuals' transactions, in addition to 'black data' on individuals heavily in arrears to which it now has access. In order to gain access to 'white data' from June next year the bank has agreed to supply its own similar data about Barclaycard accounts from customers who have given permission. It has altered application forms for Barclaycards so that new applicants have to give permission for data relating to their card use to be forwarded to credit agencies. This is to comply with the banking code of practice. The decision to supply and receive 'white data' is the first such move among large high street banks, which have refused to supply this information to credit agencies before, citing a duty of confidentiality to their customers. However, the banks have also lacked the technology to use bulk 'white data' to score creditworthiness properly. Barclaycard believes it will have the appropriate technology in place within a year. Barclaycard is rejecting 46 per cent of the 2,000 applications it receives every day, a figure that has risen about 10 percentage points in three years as the company has tried to curtail the amount of bad debt generated on its cards. It believes it can reduce its rejection rate by using more data on new applicants. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays' central retail services division, said the additional information would allow Barclaycard to avoid 'turning down a number of people who would be good customers if we knew more'. Although high-street banks have not contributed or received 'white data' from credit agencies, smaller banks including the Co-operative Bank and Girobank already supply such data on their credit-card customers in order to assess risk.</p>

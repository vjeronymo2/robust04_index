			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: Farmers from outer space / A look at the role satellites can play in predicting crop yields John Fenton, an arable farmer in north Humberside, can pinpoint which parts of his 400-hectare holding make him the most money. He could be accurate in his predictions of crop yields down to a metre but mostly he measures the amount of grain harvested every rsix metres. He can achieve this precision by using US navigational satellites in orbit 12,000 miles above the earth, which beam down to mark his exact location in a particular field. From the data collected on his fields, Fenton can build up a yield map of his entire farm. 'We've all known there are variations in crop yields across the field in the past, but this allows you to be much more specific about what you're doing,' he says. The satellite technology used by Fenton is not new, but its application to agriculture is being pioneered by Massey Ferguson, the agriculture machinery makers. 'It's a massive breakthrough to apply this to farming because it means you can manage different parts of the field differently and adapt your inputs of chemicals, seed and fertilisers accordingly,' says Chris Dawson, a consultant who has worked with farmers applying the technique. Massey Ferguson is combining its yield meter in a combine harvester, which measures the amount of grain harvested in each part of the field, with a Global Positioning System which uses satellites to tell the machine exactly where it is. Data collected in this way over several years can highlight vast differences in productivity between areas in the same field. Dawson says that yields may vary by 50 per cent above or below the average across a field. This means farmers could see a yield of 3 1/2 tonnes of grain per hectare in one section of the field and as much as 10 tonnes in another part. By pinpointing areas of the field with low yields, producers can take a closer look at them, for example analysing soil samples to see if the pH needs adjusting. They can also vary applications of chemicals and fertilisers. 'Some of the variability in yield will be attributable to factors such as acidity or poor drainage over which we have control,' says Dawson. 'But some of it might relate to depth of the soil or just the nature of the soil itself.' At this point, the farmer has to take a management decision about whether the poorer parts of his land will respond to increased use of fertilisers or chemicals or whether they just have intrinsically lower potential. 'There are parts of our fields that will never ever yield as much as 10 tonnes per hectare - our target yield. If you cut back on applications to those parts of the field, you can save a lot of money,' Fenton explains. Fenton is farming on extremely fertile soil which makes his target yield a lot higher than average. Using computer programs, a farmer can draw up a map for applying chemicals or seeds. That map can be fed on disk or smart card into a control unit on a conventional tractor or sprayer so that the machine automatically applies more or less seed or spray depending on where it is in the field. Brian Welti, farm manager at Shuttleworth College Farm in Bedfordshire, planted Britain's first field of winter wheat earlier this month using a seed map developed from the yield mapping system. The navigational satellites told the machine exactly where the more productive areas in the field were and it automatically varied seed applications depending on its location. By applying fewer seeds, chemicals or fertilisers to poor parts of the land, the farmer can make considerable savings as well as farm in a more environmentally friendly way. 'The environmental benefits are very very substantial. Before, we applied everything in a blanket fashion, and now we can target applications,' says Fenton. He has reduced the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil by 30 per cent and managed to cut the amount of nitrogen leaching from the soil by 60 per cent without losing yield. He targets the positioning of phosphate and potash fertilisers in direct proportion to the higher-yielding parts of the land. In some respects, this technology is enabling farmers to produce in the same way as they did 30 years ago when their land was divided into much smaller fields. All of the fields had different characteristics and were dealt with individually. But the drive for more efficient, large-scale farming, led to many farmers ripping out hedges in the 1970s and creating fields covering tens of hectares which would then be treated as one unit. Fenton and Welti are two of 30 farmers currently using Massey Ferguson's equipment in the UK, but trials are also under way in Germany and Denmark as well as the US. Fenton believes the technology could be suitable for any arable farmer who wants to manage his business in a more precise way but, at the moment, the cost of the equipment could put off some producers. The Global Positioning System, which can be moved into any piece of machinery, costs Pounds 11,500, but farmers need to have yield meters in their combine harvesters and computers for producing the maps. Fenton believes that the savings offered by using the equipment can quickly repay its cost. For example, he has changed the way he cultivates oilseed rape as a result of the yield map and has subsequently reduced his costs from Pounds 26 a tonne to Pounds 9 a tonne. 'It has given me a wealth of information I wouldn't otherwise have had and has totally changed my farming technique,' he says.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fuji Heavy posts first profit in three years FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese carmaker, reported pre-tax profits of Y224m (Dollars 1.8m) for the first half, its first profit in three years and a sign that a restructuring overseen by Nissan Motor has increased profitability. In the year-earlier period the company reported taxable losses of Y2.4bn. First-half sales rose by only 1.3 per cent to Y399.86bn from Y394.76bn, though the company still reported after-tax losses of Y274m against losses of Y2.4bn. However, Fuji Heavy, which makes Subaru cars, said profitability had improved because of a cost-cutting programme. The company remains under pressure because of the weakness of the domestic car market, a problem also afflicting Nissan Motor, which has a 4.2 per cent stake in Fuji and has consigned production to the company. The volume of Fuji Heavy sales fell 9 per cent to 235,000 units during the period, reflecting the difficult market conditions, in particular the weakness in demand for mini-cars, which has been affected by stricter Japanese parking regulations. For the full year to end-March, Fuji Heavy is forecasting a 9 per cent increase in sales to Y900bn, and pre-tax and after-tax profits of Y1bn, revised down from a previous estimate of Y2bn. Last year, the company reported pre-tax losses of Y4bn.</p>

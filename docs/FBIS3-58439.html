			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Basaran Duzgun] </F>   [Text] The Republican Turkish Party and Democrat Party  coalition government is working intensively to determine the  policy to be followed on the Cyprus problem.    The Council of Ministers will meet under President Rauf  Denktas on Thursday [13 January] to determine the policy course  to be followed on the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriot  side's views will be clarified on the eve of the Ankara summit  in February.  <H5>  New Image </H5>   A source close to the presidential office told our paper  that  the new government is thinking of approaching the Cyprus problem  by displaying a new image and that this idea has been endorsed  by President Denktas. Our source said that the new image is  being conceived in the form of "We are ready for an agreement if  the Greek side is ready too."  <H5>  New Mandate for Denktas </H5>   It is expected that during its Thursday meeting the Council  of Ministers will decided to reappoint President Denktas as  negotiator. As will be remembered, President Denktas had  resigned as negotiator over differences of opinion with the  Eroglu government.  <H5>  Fundamental Guidelines Will Be Determined </H5>   The Council of Ministers meeting to be chaired by President  Denktas will also determine the fundamental guidelines that the  Turkish side will insist upon during the talks. Sources close to  the government summed up these guidelines as follows: "To exert  efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable solution to the Cyprus  problem. To continue with the talks within the framework of the  UN goodwill mission. To defend the submission of the solution to  be achieved to a referendum without fail. Not to reject  territorial adjustments, but to approach them within the  framework of the criteria set down in the 1977 Denktas-Makarios  high-level meeting. To defend partnership in sovereignty, and in  that context the Swiss model."</p>

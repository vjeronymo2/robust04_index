			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, </F> Andrey Krasnoshchyokov and Andrey Shtorkh]    [Text] Paris May 26 TASS -- The collective initiative of  the European Union to hold a conference on the "Pact on  Stability in Europe" is in tune with Russia's care about the  strengthening of stability on the European continent, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated speaking at the  international forum which opened at the UNESCO headquarters in  Paris today.    The present conference, the top Russian diplomat noted, is  yet another attempt to "tackle seriously the extremely dangerous  manifestations of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, ethnic and  religious intolerance".    Russian foreign minister reiterated that the initiative to  organize this conference concerned nine states of Central and  Eastern Europe which agreed to it. They are preparing to become  members of the European Union and wish to discuss the problems  connected with the condition of national minorities and fraught  with possible complications.    It is quite natural, Andrey Kozyrev said, to seek to link  this work to the context of the Conference for Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and rely on support from the  countries participating in the all-European process.    "Certainly, within this framework Russia is prepared to make  its own contribution in such a form which will be considered  expedient," the Russian foreign minister elaborated.    He believes that the main thing is that the chosen  negotiating model -- the organizing of regional tables -- should  not lead to duplication, to weakening of the existing  international institutions and negotiating mechanisms but  concentrate on concrete steps for the establishment of  inter-ethnic relations and the guarantees of the rights of  national minorities.    "This is particularly necessary for the three Baltic states  -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," Andrey Kozyrev stressed.    The problem of national minorities is inseparable from the  general establishment of goodneighborly relations, the Russian  minister said, and the work on the "Pact on Stability in Europe"  is to become yet another contribution to the formation of  unified Europe of partnership and prosperity which must succeed  not only Cold War but also uncertainty of the post-confrontation  period. In this context, he noted, discussing of issues related  to state borders just as national minorities, should be held  exclusively within the framework established by the Conference  for Security and Cooperation in Europe.    "The enhancement of the effectiveness of the CSCE and its  transformation into a supreme political organization on the  European continent is a key element of the concept of the  all-European partnership put forward by Russia," Andrey Kozyrev  stressed.    The head of the Russian foreign office expressed hope that  the forthcoming summit meeting will strengthen a special role of  the CSCE and its responsibility for the general development of  European affairs. In the near future, he said, Russia will  submit comprehensive and concrete proposals on these issues.    The merit of the present Paris conference, the minister  emphasised, is that this forum is considering the problems of  stability "from the angle of democracy and human rights but not  in the military context". At the same time, he noted, military  and political aspects must find its place in the course of wider  efforts.    In this connection Andrey Kozyrev dwelt on mutual relations  between Russia and NATO. Russia, he said, will join "the  Partnership for Peace" program and sign a corresponding  framework document with NATO along with a substantial program of  cooperation which certainly will reflect a special role of  Russia as a nuclear power".    "We stand for the deepening of equal partnership between  Russia and NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," the  foreign minister accentuated.    Andrey Kozyrev expressed confidence that the Conference on  Stability in Europe would be an important link in the process of  forming the all-European future which may become a reality only  with the help of joint efforts by all states.</p>

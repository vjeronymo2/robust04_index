			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ORDERS $2.6 MILLION IN MEDICAL AID  </P> <P> President Bush will invoke emergency authority to send $2.6 million in medical  aid to Nicaragua in time for today's inauguration of Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro as president, congressional and Administration aides said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The move is timed to give Vice President Dan Quayle the chance to deliver good  news when he represents Bush at the swearing-in ceremony in Managua, sources  said.  </P> <P> Bush's request for $300 million to begin economic recovery in Nicaragua had  been stalled on Capitol Hill by a dispute over unrelated legislation. That  snarl was resolved late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The stopgap medical aid is being provided under a little-used section of the  foreign assistance law that permits the President to use up to $10 million a  year for "any emergency purposes."  </P></p>

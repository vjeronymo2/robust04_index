			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Japanese equities lead the world lower Japanese equities led the world lower last week, a 4.1 per cent drop in Tokyo leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index 1.5 per cent down in local currency terms. The fall was worse in terms of the dollar, at 7.0 per cent, as political and economic worries mounted and the yen, too, reversed its recent strength. However, this decline still left the market with a gain of 36.8 per cent in dollar terms this year, compared with a 19.8 per cent rise via the yen. Last week's mounting political crisis in Japan culminated after hours on Friday when Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was forced to dissolve the lower house of the Japanese parliament and call a snap general election after his humiliation in a no-confidence vote. Yesterday's further falls, however, also reflected more broadly based bearishness. On Thursday, Mr Nicholas Knight and his strategy team at Nomura in London, who called the upturn in the market last year, reduced the Tokyo market to underweight. The Nomura team are increasingly concerned that Tokyo has already entered its second consolidation phase. 'This,' they say, 'could last the remainder of the year and see the Nikkei back below 18,000.' The Nikkei's high this year was 21,076.00, less than three weeks ago. Mr Knight says that the yen has been much stronger than his team originally anticipated, hitting exports, and with no offsetting cut in the discount rate; long bond yields have risen substantially; and, finally, he has been converted to the cause of the US equity market, forecasting that the Dow will break significantly above 4,000 later this year, compared with last Friday's 3,494.77. In Europe, Spain performed well. In decline a week earlier, following the Socialist election victory, Madrid took heart at the prospect of stable government and at last Friday's hints of another cut in interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change     % change            % change in local currency ??        sterling ??     in US                                                              dollars ??           -------------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1993      1993        1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +1.06    +4.80  -10.12    +7.57     +5.22       +3.97 Belgium        +2.48    +1.29   +8.37   +11.74     +8.99       +7.69 Denmark        +2.40    +0.35   -2.25   +18.06    +16.60      +15.22 Finland        -0.71   -10.78  +51.30   +35.34    +27.36      +25.86 France         -0.42    +3.28   +1.50    +4.97     +3.98       +2.73 Germany        +0.08    +3.83   -5.73    +9.53     +6.86       +5.59 Ireland        +0.28    +3.21  +17.97   +30.79    +18.71      +17.30 Italy          +0.03    -4.51  +22.83   +25.99    +23.28      +21.82 Netherlands    +1.29    +4.38  +10.43   +13.48    +10.93       +9.62 Norway         +2.85    -0.72   -1.12   +13.16    +11.82      +10.49 Spain          +2.75    +4.09   +9.69   +24.46    +12.51      +11.17 Sweden         +0.52    -1.51  +19.24   +10.57     +5.00       +3.74 Switzerland    +0.39    +4.01  +23.03   +13.36    +12.05      +10.72 UK             +0.53    +2.34  +13.86    +2.77     +2.77       +1.55 EUROPE         +0.52    +2.36   +9.41    +8.19     +6.58       +5.32  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      +0.82    +2.42   +2.50    +9.24     +8.75       +7.45 Hong Kong      -1.13    +0.77  +19.44   +31.95    +33.64      +32.05 Japan          -4.11    -1.69  +29.08   +19.80    +38.49      +36.85 Malaysia       -2.39    +0.39  +44.66   +27.36    +31.18      +29.62 New Zealand    +0.40    +0.69   +7.10    +8.60    +15.86      +14.48 Singapore      -1.41    +0.47  +12.41   +17.27    +20.10      +18.68  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada         +1.22    +0.90   +9.97   +11.82    +12.85      +11.51 USA            -0.79    -0.59  +10.94    +1.73     +2.96       +1.73 Mexico         +3.15    -1.52   +5.49    -9.55     -8.34       -9.43  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa   +0.77    -0.99   +7.76   +26.44    +33.89      +32.29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX    -1.49    -0.19  +14.86    +9.20    +13.97      +12.62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

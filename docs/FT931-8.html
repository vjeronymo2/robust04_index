			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Alcatel's Spanish arm in Polish purchase ALCATEL SESA, the Spanish arm of the French telecommunications group, has agreed to pay Dollars 37.3m for Poland's PZT Telekom factory in Warsaw and the Teletra plant in Poznan. Alcatel will also invest Dollars 60m in the plants. The purchase opens the way into Poland's domestic market for Alcatel as government regulations say suppliers of telecommunications equipment have to produce at least half of the value of any contracts. The number of foreign bidders for contracts to supply telecommunications equipment has been limited to three and each will have to have purchased Polish plants. Next week the government is to chose between two rival bids from Siemens and Northern Telecom for two further electronics plants, Elwro in Wroclaw and Zwut in Warsaw. This decision will in effect determine the identity of Poland's suppliers in this sector for the foreseeable future as AT&amp;T has already bought the Telfa plant in Bydgoszcz.</p>

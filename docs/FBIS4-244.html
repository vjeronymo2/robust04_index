			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] SHOULD be more realistic and prove with facts and  not maneuvers that it is really interested in national  reconciliation that guarantees the continuation of the  democratic process. That is the view of Ambassador Afonso van  Dunem Mbinda. Speaking during a news conference at the UN  headquarters in New York yesterday, the Angolan envoy to the  United Nations accused UNITA of having stepped up its military  offensive throughout the country while negotiating in Lusaka.  In doing so, UNITA has sowed death and destruction. As an  example, Ambassador Mbinda mentioned the destruction of the  Luanda power lines and the killing of civilians in every corner  of Angola.    Ambassador Mbinda said that UNITA, although it has not won  the elections arrogantly demands ministerial posts and the  administration of provinces in central Angola, alleging its  concern about the safety of residents who have coincidently been  the most affected by the armed attacks. Mbinda says UNITA's  demands are designed to facilitate the political control that  the organization and its leader have always longed for and to  fulfill UNITA's goal of dividing the country. The Angolan envoy  said the government has rejected UNITA's proposals because they  are illegitimate and contrary to the rules of democratic  coexistence. Ambassador Mbinda said the government will  continue to strive for the fulfillment of what has so far been  agreed at the peace talks.    Afonso van Dunem Mbinda says it is imperative that UNITA  should continue to be pressured by all possible means so that it  abides by democratic rules and abandons the warmongering stance  that the organization has tried to conceal by claiming to be  willing to negotiate politically. He said the unilateral  cease-fire declaration was in fact designed to deceive world  opinion and prevent the application of the second package of  sanctions by the Security Council in line with Resolution  874/93. The Angolan diplomat said the government favors the  adoption of a declaration by the UN Security Council.    [Begin Mbinda recording] The government would like the  declaration to state that in view of UNITA's unwavering  attitude, and because it has not abided by the UN Security  Council recommendations, conditions have been created to adopt  new measures against UNITA.

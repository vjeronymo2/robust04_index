			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Shephard snubs selective education Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday refused permission for the Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth to select half of the entrants to one of its comprehensive schools on the basis of academic ability. Her move was taken as a decisive signal that the government was not looking to reintroduce widespread academic selection. Mr John Patten, her predecessor, had given strong encouragement to selective schools. Two other opted-out schools were asked to reconsider proposals to introduce selection in the light of the decision. Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, described the decision as 'very disappointing'. He said: 'By proposing to select a proportion of their pupils each year the three schools were aiming to increase the range of educational opportunities they provide.' A shake-up in the funding of Training and Enterprise Councils, the business-led bodies responsible for vocational training in England and Wales, is expected in the Budget today. It is understood that output-related funding will be introduced for Training for Work, the scheme for training unemployed adults which the Tecs help deliver. About 75 per cent of the funding Tecs receive will depend on candidates' getting a job, a qualification or entering full-time higher education. At present about 70 per cent of funding is received regardless of how the trainee fares. Tecs are allowed to make a profit of only 7.5 per cent on their revenues. Under the new scheme they would not make a profit unless they put enough people into jobs or further education. The Treasury spends Pounds 762m a year on the scheme but only 22 per cent of the 120,000 who completed six-month training courses in England and Wales in 1993-94 found work or moved into further education.</p>

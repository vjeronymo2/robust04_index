			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AFFORDABILITY SLIPS FOR HOME BUYERS  </P> <P> Increases in home prices and mortgage interest rates cut into home buyers'  purchasing power in January, the National Assn. of Realtors said today.  </P> <P> The realtors' housing affordability index for January was 108, down from 111.2  in December. At 108, the index means a family earning the January median income  of $32,207 had 108% of the income needed to qualify for a conventional loan  covering 80% of a home priced at $91,500, the median price the association  recorded for existing single-family homes in January.  </P></p>

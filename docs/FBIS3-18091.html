			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  is leaning towards making final take-it-or-leave-it offers to  Norway and Austria in last-minute negotiations on enlarging the  Union, Spain said here Sunday [27 February].    Spanish Secretary of State for European Affairs Carlos  Westendorp said most EU countries were impatient with the  hardline stance of the two countries, which are negotiating to  join the Union with Sweden and Finland.    "Many (EU) members think the moment has arrived to find out  who is ready to join the EU and who is not. The impression is  there are some candidates which are not interested in closing  the negotiations," he told journalists.    Westendorp was speaking during intense talks to wrap up  year-long talks with the four countries by a deadline of Monday  midnight. But diplomats said Denmark and Germany were resisting  attempts to hive Norway and Austria out of the negotiations  unless the two applicants softened their entry demands.    The talks were continuing late into Sunday night. Diplomats  said Sweden was closest to agreeing on entry terms to join the  Union, followed by Finland which was still insisting on more aid  for its farmers. But the EU was still far from overcoming  Norway's flat refusal either to allow more access to its  fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports to  other countries of the Union.    Norway's Minister of the Sea, Greta Knudsen, repeated her  country's battle-cry in the negotiations late Sunday: "Not a  single extra fish" (for EU and particularly Spanish vessels in  Norwegian waters).    Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said there was no  agreement in sight on the other major obstacle -- Austria's  insistence on maintaining strict controls on polluting truck  traffic across the Austrian Alps until end-2004.    Austria has hardened its refusal to compromise on  trans-Alpine truck pollution since the Swiss public voted a week  ago to take foreign trucks off Swiss roads within 10 years and  make them cross the Alps by rail.    The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers,  Theodoros Pangalos, warned that the enlargement talks could also  collapse over a dispute over how enlargement of the Union would  affect the balance of power within it.    Britain is trying to modify the EU's system of majority  voting so that the entry of new members will not increase the  number of votes needed for blocking minorities in ministerial  councils.    Spain wants the system changed so that the newcomers, all  from northern Europe and all relatively wealthy, do not dilute  the influence of the poorer southern members, particularly in  decisions on monetary union.    Pangalos warned that the European Parliament might also  block  any enlargement agreement because of balance-of-power concerns.  He called for an urgent study so that the Parliament could be  enlightened on the issue before its vote on enlargement, which  must be held by May.    The negotiations are supposed to be wrapped up by Monday  midnight so that the successful applicants can join the EU on  target on January 1 next year.</p>

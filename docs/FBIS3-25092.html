Ransome-Kuti was reelected at a convention on Sunday in Ibadan,  some 140 kilometres (85 miles) north of Lagos.    A group within the CD, led by Chima Ubani, the former CD  secretary-general, last month accused Dr. Ransome-Kuti of  "collaborating" with the regime of military ruler General Sani  Abacha, thereby "compromising" the association. Ransome-Kuti  has denied the charges.    An attempt by the dissenters to pass a vote of no confidence  in Ransome-Kuti's leadership was defeated by majority of  participants, sparking a walkout by a number of prominent  opponents of Ransome-Kuti before the leadership vote, conference  sources said. Some activists said they would not rule out the  formation of another human rights group by the opponents of  Ransome-Kuti's leadership.</p>

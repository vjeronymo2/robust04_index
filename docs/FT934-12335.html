			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Thames Water Thames's concern for speedy disclosure of provisions at its PWT contracting arm rings a little hollow. True, its interim results were bought forward by a week, but it has taken four years to uncover the extent of the problem. The last annual report contained a passing reference to a contract which remained in dispute. Before that, investors were offered assurances that difficult contracts acquired with PWT in 1989 had been sorted out. The acquisition looked of doubtful merit even before yesterday's provisions. With contract losses added back, Thames has paid more than Pounds 40m for a business with sales of Pounds 150m, peak margins of under 5 per cent and considerable risks. Red ink on a lesser scale in Thames' other unregulated businesses does not inspire confidence in management's ability to turn the contracting side around. The comfort is that Thames' regulated water business is performing well. Demand for water from industry remains depressed by recession, but costs look well under control. In theory, losses outside the core water business should not worry Ofwat, the water industry regulator, so long as capital to finance building sewerage works is ring-fenced. Yet losses anywhere in the group will increase the cost of equity capital - as yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Thames' shares underlines. The long-run impact is difficult to measure, but one wonders whether the episode will encourage Ofwat to look again at the handsome payments made by the regulated utility businesses to the quoted parent companies which help finance such diversification.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Two trusts consider placings to raise funds TWO INVESTMENT trusts have announced their intention to raise new capital. Templeton Emerging Markets, the specialist trust which invests in developing economies in areas such as Latin America and south east Asia, said it was considering a placing of new shares, of which 25 per cent would be available to existing share and warrant holders under an open offer. Trusts can normally only offer new shares if they are trading at a premium to their asset values; County NatWest figures show Templeton Emerging shares trading at about a 10.6 per cent premium. Roughly speaking, when a trust's shares are trading at a premium this indicates an excess of demand over supply of the shares. Templeton said the placing would enable the trust to make further investments and to widen its shareholder base. Meanwhile, Moorgate Smaller Companies Income said it was considering a placing and offer to increase its size by a maximum of Pounds 25m; that compares with net assets at the end of January 1993 of Pounds 56m. Any offer will be made available to all shareholders; the trust's shares trade at a near 7 per cent premium.</p>

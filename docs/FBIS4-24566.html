			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (CNS) -- With the approval of the  Ministry of Civil Affairs, a non-government commercial body,  namely the China-Southeast Asia Commercial Committee, will be  set up in China in a bid to develop economic and trade relations  between the country and Southeast Asian countries. Following  preparations for over one year, the committee is about to be  formally established in Haikou on June 5.    Being neighbours of China, some countries like Singapore and  Thailand in Southeast Asia have set up commercial groups to  specialize in economic cooperation and trade with China which,  however, has no corresponding non-government bodies to deal with  commercial relations with these countries. Adverse impacts on  economic cooperation and trade between China and the Southeast  Asian countries have been seen to a certain extent.    The Executive Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the  China Pacific Economic Cooperation, Mr. Chen Luzhi, will be the  director of the new group while the Chairman of Board of  Directors of the China Import and Export Bank, Mr. Tong  Zhiquang, and the Vice Governor of Hainan Province, Mr. Mao  Zhijun, will be honorary directors.    As Hainan is the province in China to see the shortest  distance from the country to the Southeast Asia region and is  the largest special economic zone, it can act as a bridge  between China and Southeast Asian countries in order to promote  economic cooperation and trade between them.    A seminar on re-export trade with Southeast Asia and on  border trade will be held following an inaugural meeting of the  commercial body.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Companies win big share of civil service work The private sector has won more than three-quarters of the Pounds 1.1bn of civil service work put out to tender so far, according to figures given to a committee of MPs by Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister. Private companies have won contracts worth Pounds 850m to provide a wide range of services to the government, including estates and facilities management, financial support and computer services. Savings on contracting-out are running at about 23 per cent of the value of work tested, Mr Waldegrave said. The programme is expected to have covered Pounds 2.3bn of civil service activities by the end of September. The figures have been submitted to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee which will question Mr Waldegrave today. The committee is investigating concerns over the impact of civil service reforms on the quality of public services and probity in handling public money. Market testing has so far put the jobs of 25,000 civil servants up for competition. The contracts so far completed will reduce civil service numbers by 14,500, with just over 12,000 civil servants transferring to the private sector. More than 7,000 of these transfers will be covered by the Tupe regulations which preserve the pay and conditions of staff in transfers of employment. The Cabinet Office estimates that the total cost of the market-testing programme so far has been less than Pounds 20m. This is much lower than the Pounds 100m the civil service unions allege has been spent. More than 400 activities have so far been reviewed under the programme launched with the Competing for Quality white paper. Three have been privatised, 25 abolished and another 20 withdrawn after restructuring or unsolvable problems were encountered. More than 230 activities were market tested, with the staff currently doing the job competing against outside bidders. In-house teams won 150 of these, with the rest going to contractors. The remaining 113 cases were put out to tender without a bid from the staff currently doing the work. Ministers believe that departments and agencies are increasingly following business in making strategic decisions to withdraw from non-core activities. Savings total Pounds 136m on the Pounds 590m of work in the programme where firm figures are available. The figures for two large contracts - the Inland Revenue's information technology services and the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston - cannot be quantified until negotiations with contractors have been completed. Information technology services are the largest group of activities contracted out under the programme, affecting more than Pounds 300m of business. These include the partnership agreement under which the Inland Revenue will transfer its IT work to EDS-Scicon, the US contracted-services group, in a deal worth almost Pounds 2bn over 10 years.</p>

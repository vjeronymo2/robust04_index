			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE DIGS DEEP FOR QUARTERBACK;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: INJURIES GIVE BRATTEN HIS FIRST START AFTER A WAIT OF FOUR  YEARS.  </P> <P> The announcement came from the coaching staff at the conclusion of practice  Wednesday night. It wasn't anything that Greg Bratten didn't already know.  </P> <P> After four seasons on the lower rungs of the Cal State Northridge quarterback  ladder, Bratten would be the starter in tonight's home opener against Eastern  New Mexico.  </P> <P> What Coach Bob Burt was saying with the team huddled around him, Bratten had  learned during that evening's practice. Marty Fisher, trying to play with a  slightly separated right (throwing) shoulder, had been hit on a practice play.  Fisher stopped in his tracks, turned to quarterbacks coach Pat Degnan and said,  "There's just no way."  </P> <P> With that sentence, Bratten, who a week ago failed to make the traveling squad  for CSUN's opener at Northern Arizona, became the team's No. 1 quarterback.  </P> <P> Fisher, a sophomore, had taken over at Northern Arizona when Sherdrick Bonner,  the Matadors' senior starter, severely sprained his right ankle early in the  second quarter. Fisher also suffered a shoulder injury in the game. Bonner  isn't expected to see action until Sept. 22 at Central (Okla.) State.  </P> <P> Northridge has three quarterbacks left: Albert Razo, the team's second-string  punter; Coley Kyman, best-known as one of the nation's top young volleyball  players; and Bratten, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound fifth-year senior who, Burt  estimates, "has taken about five snaps," in his collegiate career.  </P> <P> Six, actually. "I was in for two series as a sophomore," Bratten said.  </P> <P> Bratten is Northridge's most experienced quarterback in terms of practice time.  Problem is, he usually is running the opponent's plays against the Matador  defense. "I can tell you everything about UC Davis," Bratten quipped.  </P> <P> A walk-on who pays his own way through school, Bratten said he never dreamed  he'd become the starting quarterback. "Getting two quarterbacks hurt in one  game? You don't hear about that happening too often," he said. "It's  unfortunate, but as a backup you have to be ready."  </P> <P> His confidence was boosted when several teammates approached him with  encouraging words. "They know I can do it," Bratten said. "I've just been in  the position where I had two really good quarterbacks ahead of me."  </P> <P> A love for the game is all that kept him coming back. "It's always been fun,"  Bratten said. "That's the attitude I've taken. That as long as it was still  fun, I'd be out there."  </P> <P> Eastern New Mexico is playing its opener after going 7-3 and finishing in a  second-place tie last season in the strong Long Star Conference.  </P> <P> "If we lose, it's not going to be because of our quarterbacks," Burt said. "I  go with the theory, and I tell the kids this all the time, it's 'Who's next?'  We can't worry about who can't go. I mean, what difference is it going to make?  . . . Every guy has to be ready when his chance comes."  </P> <P> Burt said that Kyman, previously No. 4 on the depth chart, would also  "undoubtedly" see action. This from a coach who used to roll his eyes when  asked abut Kyman's chances of ever playing quarterback for the Matadors. That  was before he finally saw Kyman play.  </P> <P> Kyman is 6-6, 210 pounds, agile, strong and a fiery leader.  </P> <P> "He has a lot of ability," Burt said a few weeks ago. "He could play here  someday."  </P> <P> The day wasn't supposed to come this soon.  </P> <P> Kyman sat out last football season, but played volleyball and was among only  two freshmen selected to the All-Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. team.  He played in his second Olympic Festival this summer, then faced the decision  of trying out for football or for the U.S. "B" volleyball team that would  compete internationally.  </P> <P> He chose football. "The volleyball opportunity will be there again," Kyman  said.  </P> <P> Bonner, CSUN's starter last season, was the only Matador quarterback with  considerable game experience before last week.  </P> <P> Fisher completed 17 of 31 passes for 180 yards against Northern Arizona in his  first extended action and, despite the 37-3 loss, drew rave reviews from Burt.  </P> <P> However, there was little reason to revel in the praise. Shortly after the  game, Fisher was searching for the team trainer.  </P> <P> On his first pass play after replacing Bonner, Fisher was hit hard by a  blitzing Northern Arizona linebacker. He finished the game in extreme pain,  explaining later, "When you're playing, the heat of battle kind of keeps you  going."  </P> <P> Early this week, Burt expressed hope that such competitive spirit would allow  Fisher to play against Eastern New Mexico.  </P> <P> "Watching the films and seeing the stuff Marty can do should give our kids a  sense of security," Burt said. "They know they've got two guys they can win  with. Who knows, maybe this week we'll find out we can win with three."  </P></p>

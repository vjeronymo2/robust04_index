			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Nikkei ends higher after late rebound in futures THE NIKKEI ended higher as a rebound in stock index futures pulled the market up in the final half hour of trading. Earlier in the session, buying by investment trusts in a thin market helped to support share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index advanced 284.46 to close at the day's high of 17,628.49, after small-lot selling had taken it to a morning low of 17,309.83. Volume fell to 180m shares from 253m, with arbitrageurs and investment trusts the only notable participants of the day. Advances led declines by 529 to 404 with 163 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.75 to 1,326.65 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.55 to 1066.98. Most investors continued to stay away from the market ahead of the corporate results season in November. Early indications have come from leading retailers, which have started to report interim figures to August; these have been sluggish, due to the downturn in consumer spending. Traders said that hopes of an imminent discount rate cut had receded. Reports that the German Bundesbank would not hold a press conference after its policy-making meeting yesterday were seen as an indication that it would not make any important announcements, disappointing some investors. Issues continued to be bought on the 'Interferon theme'. Inabata, the trading company, which holds stake in the unlisted Sumitomo Pharmaceutical, a leading manufacturer of Interferon, rose Y20 to Y1,160 on active trading. Sumitomo Chemical, Sumitomo Pharmaceutical's parent company, advanced Y2 to Y480. Buying by public pension funds supported steel issues. Nippon Steel rose Y1 to Y296, while Kawasaki Steel also advanced Y1 to Y296. Department stores were lower on an 8.7 per cent fall in September department store sales in Tokyo. Tokyu Department Store fell Y3 to Y555 and Takashimaya lost Y4 to Y838. Banks lost ground with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to Y2,520 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank falling Y30 to Y1,580. Investors were discouraged by comments from a finance ministry official ruling out preferential tax treatment for the real estate purchasing body which will be set up by the banks to buy up land collateral held by financial institutions. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 35.82 to 19,150.16 in volume of 18m shares. Small-lot profit taking overwhelmed buying orders, with heavy falls in the construction and pharmaceutical sectors. Roundup ALTHOUGH the region gave a mixed performance, there were indications in Hong Kong and Taiwan that buyers were prepared to chase rising markets. HONG KONG weighed the Sino-US trade talks success against China's latest rejection of British proposals on financing of the planned new airport. After a volatile day, strong overseas buying interest brushed aside local profit-taking, and the Hang Seng index ended 106.87 higher at 5,913.64. Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.41bn to HKDollars 3.88bn. Blue chips dominated the day, with HSBC gaining another Dollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57.50 and China Light rising 75 cents to HKDollars 35.70. TAIWAN rose 2.6 per cent on newspaper reports that the stock transaction tax might be lowered. The weighted index closed 95.80 higher at 3,729.02 in turnover up from TDollars 9.2bn to TDollars 23.4bn. Food, electronic, and construction shares led the gains. KUALA LUMPUR stayed busy, volume holding up at 110.5m shares against 117.0m on Wednesday, but further selective buying alternated with bouts of profit-taking, and the KLSE composite index closed just 0.82 higher at 607.38. The newly-listed TH Loy topped the active list with 8.7m shares traded, and closed at MDollars 2.70 for a premium of 50 cents over its offer price. BANGKOK took profits on finance, securities and other smaller stocks bought a day ago, and the SET index dropped 7.99 to 871.66 in moderate turnover of Bt9.89bn. Declines led advances 161 to 73 with 45 shares unchanged. MANILA sagged under Wall Street's overnight losses, the composite index falling 18.47 to 1,368.34, largely on the New York fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone which lost 10 pesos to 935.00 at home. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index closed 14.7 down at 1439.0, driven down by a combination of poor metal prices, a number of companies going ex-dividend, and pressure from the futures markets. News Corp was the highlight of the day, rising 2 cents to ADollars 24.12 after it successfully introduced 40m shares priced at Wednesday's close of ADollars 24.10.</p>

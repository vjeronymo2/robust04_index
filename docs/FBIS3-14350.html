			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League Council held a  closed session this afternoon, following the end of its opening  session.    MENA has learned that the Arab League Council will discuss a  number of political, economic, legal, and financial matters at  the closed session. Four committees have been formed for that  purpose: A political committee, an economic committee, a  financial and administrative committee, and a legal committee.    The political committee will discuss the Arab boycott of  Israel in the second and third degrees--in other words, an  indirect boycott. It will listen to a briefing from the  secretary of the Arab Boycott Bureau in Damascus on the boycott  and its implications for the peace process. The committee will  examine the U.S. request that the boycott be lifted on U.S.  companies that participate in developing and rehabilitating the  Palestinian self-rule areas following the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles. The political committee will also  debate a report on Arab national security at a time of  fast-breaking international changes.    MENA has learned that the economic committee will discuss  the  formulation of a unified Arab position vis-a-vis GATT, which  will be signed in April in Morocco. The economic committee will  also discuss the economic repercussions of peace, particularly  with regard to the possible establishment of a Middle East  market. The committee will also review various agreements  concluded by the Arab League and its institutions and assess  their effectiveness.    The financial and administrative committee will discuss the  contributions by member states to the League's 1994 budget,  estimated at $28 million. It is expected to urge the members to  pay their contributions on time so as to help the Arab League  institutions perform their duties.    The legal committee will discuss a number of important  topics, including the status of Palestinian refugees in a number  of countries and the care they receive, the performance of the  United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and a number of legal  matters pertaining to the Arab League.</p>

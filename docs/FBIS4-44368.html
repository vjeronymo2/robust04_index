			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephen Bates and Larry Elliott: "Clarke Tries </F> To Clear Path to Tax Cuts"]    [Text] Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, offered the Cabinet  a "very tough remit" on government spending in the coming year  as ministers met in Downing Street yesterday to launch  discussion on the targets to be agreed for announcement in  November's Budget.    Treasury ministers are anxious to limit spending rises below  the ceiling of 263 billion pounds -- excluding government debt  interest payments and social security payments affected by the  level of unemployment -- announced by Mr Clarke in last autumn's  Budget. That would allow room for the tax cuts the right is  clamouring for before the next general election, with defence  and social security identified as early targets for restraints  on increases.    Downing Street officials described the figure as a cash  control ceiling rather than a target prompting speculation at  Westminster that the Treasury will seek to bring in public  spending below that level. Even so, 263 billion pounds was  described as extremely challenging.    Privately, ministers believe tax cuts will be possible from  next year, with increased contingency reserves to draw on,  unemployment dropping, inflation steady and the deficit be low  worst predictions.    Ministerial sources have suggested there may not be the need  for the second stage next year of introducing VAT [Value Added  Tax] on fuel, taking it from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.    Options for cuts look limited, with Tory backbench defence  specialists already limbering up to fight off a further squeeze.  Decommissioning the 41-year-old royal yacht Britannia -- a cut  announced yesterday -- was already prompting protests on the  backbenches.    Cuts in social security, the Tory right's loudly-preferred  option, may also prove difficult ministers fear, without  incurring fierce public criticism for attacking the most  vulnerable.    Ministers will argue their departmental case for spending  increases before Mr Clarke's seven-strong ministerial committee  into the autumn. The economics and the politics of the spending  cuts/tax cuts equation, however, may prove complicated. The  legacy of the bust-boom-bust cycle of the past 15 years means  the economy cannot afford another consumer spree driven by tax  cuts. Nor is it obvious that tax cuts accompanied by reductions  in public expenditure will do down well with voters.    But there are at least five reasons why the Treasury should  be able to shave a few billions off its planning totals:    A. Inflation has come in below the Treasury's November  forecasts, allowing departments to provide the same level of  service for less money.    B. Growth looks like being a touch stronger this year than  the 2.5 per cent forecast in the Budget. Although the reduction  in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit has not  been accompanied by a rise in employment, lower dole payments  could save the Chancellor around 1 billion pounds next year  according to Simon Briscoe economist with S.G. Warburg.    C. The Chancellor's Red Book calculations contain a very low  figure of 1 billion pounds from privatisation receipts for  1995/96. The Government still has a 40 per cent stake in the  two electricity generating companies, worth an estimated 4  billion pounds, and around 5 billion pounds of other sale able  assets.    D. Messrs Clarke and Portillo will be hoping to see the  fundamental reviews of public spending bearing fruit, although  the early favourites for deep cuts defence and social security  spending, may not prove to be easy pickings.    E. The Chancellor could indulge in some financial sleight of  hand and chop a few billions off the contingency reserve that  the Government earmarks each year for unforeseen emergencies.  Mr Clarke has 7 billion pounds stashed away for 1995/96 and  10.5 billion pounds to play with in 1996/97.    Mr Briscoe believes that as a result of all these factors it  should not prove too difficult to shave 5 billion pounds off the  spending totals for this year and next. Of this, he believes  the Chancellor will hand out 2 billion pounds in tax cuts and  use the rest to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector Borrowing  Requirement] by 3 billion pound.    Labour suggested cuts would not reduce the tax burden below  the increases already imposed. Harriet Harman, the shadow  Treasury spokeswoman, said: "Having hit people with the biggest  tax increases in history, the Government is now intent On  further damaging spending cuts which will cost jobs, undermine  public services and seriously weaken Britain's long-term  economic prospects."    Alan Beith, Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: "The  Conservatives' search for short-term popularity is in danger of  preventing prudent judgment about the level of taxation needed  to secure investment and reduce the borrowing requirement  without placing the burden on the most vulnerable groups in  society."</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Agency chief's dual role rapped MPs yesterday admonished ministers for the way they handled a potential conflict of interest over the government agency which regulates food imports, James Blitz writes. The Commons agriculture committee expressed concern in a report that a conflict of interest could have arisen over the role of Mr John Ellis, the chief executive of Fyffes, the banana importer, who is also chairman of the Intervention Board Executive Agency. Mr Ellis has chaired the intervention board for the past eight years. The board, which is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, administers the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK and issues licences for food export and import. The potential conflict of interest over his role arose last year when the board was required to license banana imports following a European Union directive. The committee said that this appeared to place Mr Ellis in an 'awkward position', as the Fyffes group is one of the largest importers of bananas. The committee said yesterday that it did not allege 'any impropriety whatsoever' against Mr Ellis. It also noted that his job 'does not involve him in day to-day operations of the agency', which has also ensured that Mr Ellis does not see confidential papers relating to regulation of the banana sector. However, the committee said it was 'absolutely unacceptable' that a chairman of the intervention board should be in a position where he was excluded from the operations of the organisation in an important sector. The MPs added: 'We recommend that (the ministry) take steps to ensure that the problem is swiftly rectified and that no such potential conflict of interest occur in senior positions in the future.'</p>

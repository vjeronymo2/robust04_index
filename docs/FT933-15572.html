			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Low redundancy pay 'widespread' MORE THAN half of all employers have no redundancy arrangements, a survey of more than 1,000 employers in the government's Employment Gazette indicates. It says 60 per cent of employees provide redundant workers with only the statutory minimum redundancy payment - one week's pay for every year of employment up to 20 weeks. Twenty per cent of the sampled employers have made redundancies in the past year, with financial services and engineering being the hardest-hit sectors. Of those made redundant, 22 per cent were in managerial grades, 27 per cent were white-collar staff, 26 per cent skilled manual workers and 16 per cent other manual workers while 85 per cent were full-time workers. Unions seem to make a big difference in whether employees are paid above the statutory minimum. In workplaces where unions are recognised, only 35 per cent of employees received the statutory minimum compared with 71 per cent in non-union workplaces. However, the survey says this may be related to size of establishment. Unions are involved in formulation of redundancy arrangements at only 22 per cent of workplaces where unions are recognised. When making voluntary redundancies, employers are more likely to make extra payments. In 60 per cent of cases of voluntary redundancies employers said they paid extra to at least some employees. Employees who receive more tend to be either long-service employees (49 per cent) or managers (32 per cent). About half of employers in small companies employing fewer than 50 people, said they would make no payments at all if the statutory scheme did not exist.</p>

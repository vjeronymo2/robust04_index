			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bond Negotiating to Acquire Stroh: Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. Chairman Alan Bond  said his Australian brewing conglomerate is negotiating to buy at least part of  Detroit-based Stroh Brewing, a privately held company that is the No. 3 U.S.  beer producer. But a stumbling block remains because Bond is seeking a  controlling interest of Stroh and the Stroh family has said it wants to sell  only a minority interest. Bond, a yachtsman whose debt-laden Bond Holdings has  been attempting to weather a recent credit-rating cut and poor results, said he  would merge his Lacrosse, Wis.-based G. Heileman Brewing Co. with Stroh if the  negotiations succeed. Bond acquired the No. 5 U.S. brewer, Heileman, in a  $1.28-billion takeover two years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Smith calls Major 'opt-out' PM: Labour leader's address to conference targets Tory disarray MR JOHN SMITH rallied the Labour party behind his leadership yesterday with a sharp attack on the competence of Mr John Major as 'an opt-out prime minister leading a do-nothing government off the European stage'. In his first leader's address to the party conference, he targeted Conservative disarray after the UK's abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism, promoted the idea of 'active government' and consolidated Labour as the party of Europe. His 50-minute speech, given a three-minute ovation by delegates in Blackpool, was also clearly aimed at raising morale after four election defeats by tacitly drawing attention to his own image of confident authority. By contrast, he accused Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as the joint authors of the sterling crisis, mocking them as 'the Laurel and Hardy of British politics'. The public had witnessed 'a government gripped by indecision, paralysed by fear and a prime minister plodding to disaster', he said, charging Mr Major with humiliating Britain and betraying the trust of the people. The Labour leader added that the humiliation was complete on Monday when Mr Lamont apologised for criticising the Germans. Delegates welcomed Mr Smith's debut as a demonstration of his qualities of pragmatism and reliability. But many conceded that its low volume delivery and abrupt conclusion had come as a stark contrast to the oratorical fireworks of Mr Neil Kinnock. Mr Tony Banks, the leftwing MP for Newham North West, described it as a 'sensible shoes' style that stressed the leader's credentials as a safe pair of hands. 'In a situation when the country is in a deep mess, it underlined the competence of John Smith,' he said. After his attack on the government, Mr Smith set out his own creed in language that reflected his christian socialist upbringing. Claiming that Conservatives believed people were driven purely by greed and self-interest, he said Britons wanted to be citizens of a community that 'does not pass by on the other side'. A key theme to the speech was the need for active government, not one that 'abdicates in favour of the market'. He said: 'The market must serve our needs, not we the needs of the market. And if the market system becomes an agent of speculation and stagnation instead of an engine for prosperity, then it is time for governments to act.' Mr Smith said Labour's goal was to promote 'active government' with a responsibility to shape society, offer opportunities and provide for need. He added that Labour would put the real economy at the heart of its economic policy, making growth and jobs the benchmark of success. In a passage on Europe, Mr Smith reaffirmed his belief in the Maastricht treaty by insisting that 'Europe cannot stand still'. But in a gesture to Labour's doubters, he went on to stress the need for the UK to take up the social chapter of workplace rights and the importance of decisions being made at the closest practical level to the people.

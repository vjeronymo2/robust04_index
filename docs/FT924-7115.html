			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Arts: Die Frau ohne Schattten - Opera Die Frau ohne Schatten can seem a masterpiece, or a grossly overblown piece of musico-dramatic manufacture, the last word in (and gasp of) late-Romanticism, with means and ends troublingly out of balance. It was the most ambitious and most time-consuming act of operatic collaboration between Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The composer himself, towards the end of the its gestation, had begun to entertain serious doubts about its grandiose scale and substance: he was already yearning (in the words of Michael Kennedy's admirable Royal Opera programme note) 'to strip off his Wagnerian armour'. The new Covent Garden production realises both the music and the libretto with glowing colour, lightness of touch and texture, a picturesqueness of conception that avoids both triviality and strenuous late-20th-century relevance-seeking. It seems to frame a touchingly simple, heartfelt statement of belief in the opera as a unified masterpiece; and its conviction proves contagious. Indeed, for the first time I derived reward from almost an entire performance, not just particular sections and paragraphs. For this the team of Bernard Haitink (conductor), John Cox (producer) and David Hockney (designer) deserves praise individually and corporately; but it is, as it should be, the conductor who stamps the whole performance with its peculiar radiance of style. The characteristic of Georg Solti's Frau - he was the first conductor (in 1967) of the previous Covent Garden production - was its lightning-flash brilliance of sound and thunder-peal ferocity of rhythmic drive, which suited some portions of the score far better than others. Here, a tender, unforced musicality seems to draw out the genuineness of inspiration in the moments of solemnity and repose, reflecting the candour as well as the richness of Strauss's melodic and harmonic language. The Wagnerian armour is not stripped off, but neither does it prove overburdeningly heavy. There is Brucknerian innocence in the chorale-elements of the first-act close, Mahlerian clarity of line in the accompaniments to the arias of the Emperor and Empress, and an approach to the darker, wilder sounds and episodes that, though lacking nothing in muscle-power, wholly avoids melodramatic inflation. Even the carolling sweetnesses of the many-voiced Happy End, usually the sticking point in any account of the opera, flow out with redeeming freshness. This Frau, expertly played, finely prepared and balanced (and a good deal less cut than previously in this theatre), is Haitink's first; it counts as one of his most resplendent London achievements. Hockney, working with the costume designer Ian Falconer (serendipitous Frau surname]), concentrates on fairy-tale fantasy, on South Sea Isles opulence; exquisite distinctness of line and quirky vividness of detail provide the disciplining force. The succession of cloths and cutouts rising and falling, with backdrop colours warming to hues of oriental gorgeousness, seems to show creative kinship with the best of Disney, and with such flights of exotic studio fancy as The Thief of Baghdad. The most spirit-lifting episodes are those of the 'upper world'; on Monday the effect down below was sometimes bold but less exactly judged. The candy-stripe patterns of the dyer's hut look brighter in photograph than on stage - altogether, the lighting, which often gives the Woman a visible Shadow, needs refining. Much of the transformation-magic is disappointing (visible wires, tame flood, unimposing stone-Emperor); Act 3 has a surprisingly rumpled look. Cox's staging works efficiently within these limitations. Apart from the suggestion of intriguing troubled warmth between Barak and his wife early on, he manages relatively little in the way of character-focussing, or what the Germans call Personenregie: the cast, made up of mainly experienced international Straussians, is not a unified ensemble. One feels that the show as a whole is not yet quite tuned (it is shared with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, and will doubtless be re-worked there). But already its airy, warming beauties draw the sting of detailed criticism. Two of the leading quintet reach the grandest Straussian level. In the title role Anna Tomowa-Sintow has only one fault: it is hard to believe this fine figure of a mature and womanly soprano lacks anything at all, least of all a shadow. Her voice, in prime condition, fills out the lines with a natural amplitude that betokens a wonderful directness of stage personality; I love her uncloying tenderness in the little scene with Barak, and the unmannered nobility of her demeanour in the Trial - the climactic spoken outburst, usually cut, is superbly handled. Her partner is the American mezzo Jane Henschel (house debut) as a Nurse of tireless, vibrant delivery, verbal wit, and deftly insinuating character: a wonderful account of a formidable role. Franz Grundheber's Barak is unfailingly sympathetic, and firmly voiced, though with less than ideal breadth and depth of tone. Paul Frey (Emperor) sings with true musicianship - a blessing in any Strauss tenor - but somewhat palely and passionlessly. Of Gwyneth Jones's Dyer's Wife I find it difficult to write justly, especially since she has given such long, honourable service in the role. How does one convey the generosity, the almost heedless abandon with which she throws herself into it? And on the other hand, how does one fairly - and politely - describe the vagaries of her current vocal condition? in repertory at the Royal Opera House until November 28</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mayflower launches Pounds 35m rights to fund expansion MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK engineering company, is raising Pounds 34.6m through a 1-for-1 rights issue to finance its ambitious expansion programme in the UK and US. The issue, which has been fully underwritten by Smith New Court, will be priced at 36p per share compared with a closing price on Monday of 49p. The shares gained 3p yesterday to close at 52p. Mayflower, which chiefly comprises Motor Panels, the automotive engineering company which was acquired out of the receivership of CH Industrials in 1991, lifted pre-tax profits by 60 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.07m). The result was after an exceptional Pounds 1.7m largely relating to Motor Panels' exposure to the collapse last month of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker. Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of Daf, owed Pounds 1.8m to Motor Panels, which supplies it with cabs. It has resumed supplies to Leyland Daf against orders placed by the receiver, and said yesterday that deliveries were running at about half of the level of a year ago or 100-120 cabs a week. The Motor Panels business in the UK and US is being expanded rapidly thanks to several large contracts won recently or which are currently at an advanced stage of negotiations: Earlier this month Mayflower announced that it had won a contract to take part in the development and manufacture of cabs for a new series of trucks for Ford in the US which could be worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) over a 15-year period. In the UK it has won the contract to supply more than 600 bodies a year for the new Aston Martin DB7 sports car, which was unveiled at the Geneva motor show earlier this month. The DB7 will go into production at Aston Martin Oxford in April next year. It is at an advanced stage of negotiations for a contract for the design, development and supply of the body shell for a new specialist vehicle for European markets. This project is understood to concern collaboration with Rover in the development of a new MG sports car. Mayflower said that it expected capital investment to jump from Pounds 3m in 1992 to about Pounds 23m this year, chiefly for the development of plants and equipment in the UK and US. In February it bought its first stamping plant in the US for Dollars 7.5m to supply pressings to Motor Panels' US operat-ions, and said yesterday that a further Dollars 12.5m would be spent to modernise the plant during the next three years. Mayflower turnover more than doubled last year to Pounds 67.8m (Pounds 27.4m). Earnings per share came through at 1.41p (1.91p) and a final dividend of 0.85p is proposed for a 1.25p total.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hideo Otake, professor of Kyoto University] </F>   [Text] Two tendencies among the new conservatives have  united to give birth to the Hosokawa administration. They are  the tendency toward "small government" and the tendency toward a  "cultural age." However, neither has a strong political support  base. What is called for is political participation by the  citizens and residents.  <H3>  Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform and the "Cultural  Age" </H3>   Within the coalition administration, the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] is divided by internal confrontation and  on the brink of oblivion. Komeito is also headed toward merging  with the conservative new parties. Japan's political party  structure already appears to be shifting toward a conservative  two-party or three-party system.    The outlook is the result of the advent of two new  conservative forces--Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the  Japan New Party/Sakigake [Harbinger] Party--in addition to the  LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] which is the old conservative  force. Forming the backdrop are the two political tendencies  since the late 1970's. One is the trend that progressed from  administrative reform to political reform. The other is what may  be called the tendency toward a "cultural age." In this article,  we intend to examine the two eral tendencies that gave rise to  the Hosokawa administration, and to use our findings as material  to consider the future outlook.    First, let us look at the transition from administrative  reform to political reform. The administrative reform based on  the Second Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform [hereafter  referred to as the "Ad Hoc Council"] has various aspects, and  the most characteristic is the fact that it was a challenge  against the money politics of the LDP (more than it was an  attack against leftwing forces). In other words, it was an  attempt to dismantle the "iron triangle" which is formed by the  government agencies, the industrial sector, and the "zoku"  [special interest group] Diet members. The Kankoro [National  Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions], including the  Kokuro [National Railway Workers' Union], which is seen as  having united with these forces to protect its own vested  interests, was also a target of attack.    Viewed from this aspect, administrative reform was actually  also an attempt toward restoration of power by the bureaucrats.  The reason is that the "iron triangle" found itself in a  situation where the government organization was eroded by the  "zoku" Dietmen and the administrative rationality of the  bureaucrats was distorted. For the individual bureaucrat, due to  such inducements as ensuring one's employment after government  retirement, the benefits brought by the "iron triangle" were a  matter of major concern. On the other hand, the loss of  independence was the price paid by the government organization.    At this point, regulation by the state, for example, was  more  a means to protect the vested interests of the industrial  circles than an expression of the maintenance and expansion of  authority by the government agencies. The realization of  administrative reform through the initiatives of the elite  bureaucrats cannot be understood without such a backdrop. The  fact that pension reform and health insurance reform were  realized through the initiatives of the top elite of the Welfare  Ministry is well known. However, it was also a process in which  the Welfare Ministry escaped from the influence of the Kankoro  which tried to protect its vested interests, and from the  control of such industry organizations as the Japan Medical  Association. Also, the privatization of the Japan National  Railways and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public  Corporation [NTT] was realized because the elite bureaucrats of  the Transportation Ministry and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications who had resisted at the outset changed their  direction. It was because the bureaucrats of the two ministries  became aware of the administrative rationality of their  respective ministries.    In addition, the "zoku" Diet members, who acquired  administrative rationality through the experience of rule under  long-term administrations, suppressed the demands for protection  of vested interests by the rank-and-file "zoku" members and  marched toward reform, thus enabling a series of administrative  reforms. Also, the Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who stand at  the top of the government pyramid, became the major promoters of  administrative reform on the government's side. Moreover, it is  equally significant that the major force for administrative  reform consisted of the top elite of the financial circles, and  that they displayed great power in throttling the demands of the  industrial circles under their jurisdiction.  <H5>  Political Reform Was Necessary </H5>   Various factors nudged Japan's elite toward reform. The  introduction of software and the internationalization of the  Japanese economy provided the backdrop, the maturation of  Japanese society was a factor for pension reform and health and  insurance reform (including aging), and the internationalization  of Japan's politics was a factor for the debate on international  contribution in the era of administrative reform.    However, particularly significant were the demands that  resulted from Japan's internationalization. Concretely, it was  the pressures brought to bear by the United States, demanding  market opening and contributions by Japan. Faced with these  pressures, Japan's elite arrived at the judgment that they must  comply with international demands even at the sacrifice of  domestic demands. It was in this context that, with the progress  of administrative reform, they deepened their awareness that  political reform was indispensable for administrative reform.    Numerous problems remain which could not be solved by the  administrative reforms in the first half of the 1980's. The  agricultural problems centering on rice are typical. Other  reforms are the easing of regulations and the reform of special  corporations. Consequently, the United States has made severe  demands against Japan in the forum of the Japan-U.S. Structural  Impediments Initiative [SII] talks. In order to meet these  tasks, reform of the ruling and opposition parties that have  been resisting--i.e. "political reform"--became necessary.    However, the "political reform" was, more than  administrative  reform, a challenge against the power base of the elite in the  form of stablized control by the conservative party. The greater  the progress toward political reform, the greater was the  resulting destruction of their own power base. However, an  awareness arose among the elite that they could not commit  themselves to the nation's tasks without restructuring their  power base itself. The election system reform proposed several  years ago was a means to meet the tasks by restructuring the  power base of the political parties.    In the first place, administrative reform was pushed through  with powerful support by public opinion mobilized by the mass  media. Its substantial support layer was the urban  salaried-worker class that was unrelated to the vested interests  called the "iron triangle." From the standpoint of the LDP's  support base, it means a shift from the farm regions to the  cities, and from the old middle class to the new middle class.  However, it is extremely difficult to make the new support layer  a stable political base with the current election system as the  premise. The glorious advent and disappointing exit of the  Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club was the outcome of such a risk.    In order to overcome this instability, the reform of the  election system is a most effective means. The proposed  small-constituency system and the proportional-representation  system are both expected to provide stable support bases for the  new conservative parties by centering elections on the political  parties. Moreover, the systems will strengthen central party  authority within the political parties. The plan avoids the fate  of the Shinjiyu Club, and is simultaneously a double-edged  strategy for the elite to cut off pressure from the industrial  circles and the (rank-and-file) "zoku" Dietmen who received  support from those circles.    Ichiro Ozawa, who was the core promoter of election system  reform and the most enthusiastic supporter of PKO [UN  peacekeeping operations], epitomizes the above-mentioned  tendency for a shift from the direction of the Ad Hoc Council to  political reform.  <H5>  Tendency of a "Sense of Play" </H5>   However, there is a second tendency among the new  conservatives which has a number of traits in common with the  above-mentioned tendency, but at the same time it is  intrinsically different. It is personified by Prime Minister  Hosokawa. Its traits are typified, above all else, by his  political style. A sense of play, leeway, an "age of  sensibility" and the natural man--expressions used by the prime  minister himself--describe the tendency. Hosokawa's criticism of  "efficiency for efficiency's sake" and his expression of "a  sense of play" translate into a policy of "not scrimping on  design fees" for public construction, for example, in actual  policies. However, such a posture is clearly foreign to the  direction of the Ad Hoc Council.    The Ad Hoc Council may be said to have concretely  represented  the interests of the "consumers/taxpayers" with the urban  salaried worker in mind. However, the "consumers" represented by  Hosokawa are a class that seeks quality goods that satisfy good  taste despite somewhat higher costs, and not goods that are  "cheap but shoddy." They are people who, despite their awareness  of cost, seek services commensurate with the prices paid.  Regarding easing of regulations also, rather than chiefly  blaming regulations for economic inefficiency, their criticism  is directed mainly toward the bureaucracy for its adherence to  efficiency and its "inelegant" uniformism that strives to  maintain minimum standards nationwide.    Also, Hosokawa's sense of play which contrasts with the late  Toshio Doko's stoic lifestyle and Ozawa's straightforwardness,  is a contrast between the latter's sense of crisis and sense of  mission as the policymaking elite, and the awareness of an  amateur politician who considers politics as one among a number  of pursuits. It is the difference of the political and economic  elite and the upper class (or the cultural elite).    In a word, Hosokawa may be said to express the political  sense of the mainstay upper-class salaried workers of the cities  who do not feel any particularly serious and urgent mission in  politics. The statement by Hosokawa while he was governor that  "the only legacy that can be left by administration is culture"  directly expresses his philosophy.    For the supporters of the Japan New Party and the new  Sakigake, and for the relatively affluent middle class of the  cities, politics is truly one of a number of activity domains.  It is a domain from which "withdrawal" is possible at any time.  The "fickleness" of this class as voting constituents reflects  it. It is the opposite of (a part of) the farmers and smaller  enterprises that are obliged to depend on politics within  economic activity and who regard political support as  indispensable.    It is natural that this class welcomes with a sense of  affinity the Hosokawa style of being able and ready to quit at  any time. Politics must be, above all else, an interesting drama  for them. The drama of a "change in government" was climactic.    Hosokawa's record as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture was  characterized by the construction of buildings and the  sponsorship of events as cultural legacies, and by his appeal  for a "distinctive prefecture." The quickest way to accomplish  this was to invite national-level designers and cultural  personalities to work in Kumamoto. It could be described as  bringing an urban and Tokyo-type sensibility (or, further, a  West European culture) directly into the farming and "local  areas." Typical construction included the ultramodern police  stations, prefecural housing complexes, bridges and toilets. A  cultural orientation quite different from the  development-oriented past is clearly seen here.  <H5>  Ohira-Sonoda Urban Concept </H5>   To reflect on the past, the emphasis on "culture" in  administration goes back to the Sonoda urban concept of the  Ohira cabinet (incidentally, the Japan New Party also advocates  the Sonoda cultural sphere concept). The nine "policy study  groups" organized by Ohira called for the realization of "more  lofty aspirations" or "spiritual and cultural affluence" as  Japan's task in the 21st century. The central slogan was "a  cultural age" as a substitute for the economic age. It also  sought an expanded cultural budget and fiscal spending to build  a transportation/information network (for the formation of a  pastoral city state).    It was premised on pride that Japan had caught up with and  passed Europe and the United States, and optimism concerning the  future. The assumption was that leisure time will increase in  the future, and cultural activity with the elements of "leisure"  and "play" will rise as consumer activity. Of course, forming  the backdrop is self-confidence that Japan has overcome a double  oil-shock to achieve a favorable economic performance surpassing  the other advanced nations. It is a policy direction that is  clearly based on a different awareness from the direction of  administrative reform that appeared immediately later.    Because the continuity between the scholars who participated  in the Ad Hoc Council and the brains of the Ohira cabinet is  often debated, the difference between the two tendencies is apt  to be overlooked. However, the difference between the two groups  is decisive. In administrative reform, aside from the  formulation of the ideological portion, it was the economists  and financiers like Hiroshi Kato and Yoichi Sando who displayed  their power through concrete policy designs, resulting in the  ideology of economic liberalism. However, Ohira's brain trust,  centering on such cultural stalwarts as Masakazu Yamazaki, were  a group with a different and unique principle from the principle  of competition. Those overlapping with them were only a handful  of scholars concerned with international politics (if Kenichi  Koyama, who was later active in the National Council on  Educational Reform, is excluded).    The intellectuals advocating a "cultural age," who formed  the  core of the Ohira group, contended that the principle of  competition on the cultural dimension contained an inherent  tendency for bad money to chase out good money as seen in the  television culture described as "turning 100 million people into  idiots," and that it was impossible to fully agree with the  logic of free competition "to create high-level concepts." Based  on this, they contended that "some sort of public environment  and means are necessary" for "basic academic research and the  creation of a new cultural tradition."    Ohira himself had sought aggressive activity by the state  worthy of an "age of culture," and had intended to solve the  fiscal deficit, not by conversion to a small state, but by  increasing taxes. From this standpoint, the transition from  Ohira to Suzuki and Nakasone was an important turning point in  policy.    Furthermaore, the pastoral city state concept was clearly an  urban planning and national planning concept, and was different  from the direction of the ad hoc commission whose staple was the  principle of free competition. This is most clearly evident in  the difference between the commission mainstream, which stressed  deregulation of land use, and the pastoral city state concept,  which proposed aggressive land expropriation from the standpoint  of public ownership of land.  <H5>  Burden of "Culture" Assumed by Local Regions </H5>   Faced by a budget deficit, Japan at the time may be said to  have had two options. And, faced with these options, there was a  difference in judgment as to how to inherently view the budget  deficit. Beginning with Michio Watanabe who assumed the post of  finance minister in the Suzuki cabinet, the rhetoric of those  who stressed a budget crisis explained the budget crisie in the  same light as the household budget. It is easy for any budget  specialist to understand that such a naive metaphor is a fallacy.    A budget deficit is essentially different from an  individual's loan. The argument can be made that it is not a  problem which requires an immediate solution because there is no  loan from a foreign country involved, and there was actually  such an argument. In Ohira's case, it was necessary to  implicitly recognize the validity of such a rebuttal and, on  that basis, the budget "crisis" had to be solved in order to  invoke future budgetary power. Rather, it was considered to be  necessary as preparation for the display of state power. (As far  as this writer knows, he never stated that a budget deficit in  itself creates a situation of crisis.)    In any case, Ohira's theory implied an awareness that Japan  had become an affluent nation (after overcoming the two oil  shocks), and it is seen as totally different from the awareness  of the Ad Hoc Council which stressed the imminent budget crisis  and the future arrival of the "advanced nation's disease." It  also judged that the urban salaried workers could afford to  accept a certain degree of increased burden.    Generally speaking, the argument for "small government" as a  backlash against the Keynesian welfare state is said to have  appeared with the post-oil-shock economic crisis in the advanced  nations as the backdrop, and the radical reforms by the Thatcher  and Reagan administrations are considered to be typical.  However, Japan's economy had already completely overcome the  economic crisis resulting from the oil shocks when the Ohira  cabinet made its advent.    In Japan, after overcoming the economic crisis and due to  its  impetus, such liberal reforms as the reexamination of welfare  based on the "small government" theory and privatization  appeared on the scene. In that sense, it must be said that the  necessity for reform was lower than in Europe and the United  States. In other words, it may be said that in the early 1980's  there was another option besides administrative reform (this  point is essentially different from the Mitterrand  administration of France which introduced social democratic  policies and was simultaneously brought down).    However, historical reality shows that the Ohira direction  was rejected with a tax increase as the reason, and the  direction of using the affluence achieved by Japan for spiritual  and cultural policies (or more generally, the buildup of social  capital) was denied, resulting in the pursuit of further  efficiency and economic growth. In other words, a policy of  accumulating further wealth to prevent future crises was  adopted. It will probably be criticized as an excessive  preventive step. The bubble economy may be said to be the  consequence (from this standpoint, it is probably ironic that  the Hosokawa administration faces a major task of overcoming a  long-term recession, and is demanded to overcome it through  budgetary mobility).    However, it is also important from the standpoint of later  evolvement that the "age of culture" concept of the Ohira era  had formed a twin pillar with the "age of the local regions" in  support of the pastoral city state.    In the first place, there is very little work concerning  policy by local governments that requires urgent solutions (like  the central government), except routinely processed  administration. Moreover, once a headman is elected, he may  exercise the prerogative of his incumbency to secure his  position for eight to 12 years, or even beyond 20 years. Each  headman has a political base which plays a central role in  "cultural" policy according to his own preference.    That is why the local governments have taken on the  challenge  of an age of culture. And that is exactly what Hosokawa had done  as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture. In the last half of the  1980's when budget reform made reasonable progress, and  particularly about the time the Takeshita regime came into  being, the regional age (of culture) expanded nationally. The  "creation of the homeland," which was the centerpiece of the  Takeshita cabinet, is a concrete example. Governor Hosokawa was  one of its pioneers.  <H5>  Toward Political Participation by the Citizens </H5>   The birth of the Hosokawa administration signifies the  convergence of the aforementioned two new conservative  tendencies. Despite their differences, there was no lack of  opportunities for convergence by the two tendencies  (transcending a simple and impulsive union). The primary factor  was the denial of the LDP's money politics. It was a union  between a denial by the elite based on the practical necessity  for criticism of the status quo-minded policymaking system, and  the perceptional rejection among the urban mainstay and  upper-layer salaried workers on the level of its image as a  "dirty" system.    Easing regulations is at once a strategy for "restructuring  Japan" among the elite and a policy to promote the interests of  the consumers, as we have pointed out. The deregulating policy  agreed upon by the two new conservative forces and proposed as a  policy program may be interpreted as a merger between criticism  from the top and criticism from the bottom against the "iron  triangle." Furthermore, the tendency of an "age of culture" has  provided an opportunity to join also to the SDPJ which has had a  support base in a portion of the urban salaried-worker class.  Its participation in the ruling coalition can be understood in  terms of such a backdrop.    Nonetheless, there continues to be a lack of a strong  political support base in the two new conservative trends. For  example, the easing of controls that began during the Carter era  in the United States was prompted by a rise of the consumer  movement. Reagan's advocation of "small government" also  originated from a movement called the taxpayers' revolt. In  contrast, neither movement exists in Japan.    The direction of the Ad Hoc Council in easing regulations  and  advocating "small government" was merely evoked and mobilized by  "pubiic opinion" with support by the mass media as the backdrop.  Consequently, after the initial stage of reform, an ironic  phenomenon arose in the form of the Japan-U.S. SII talks in that  the United States spoke for the interests of the consumers in  Japan.    Meanwhile, in the tendency toward an "age of culture" also,  elitism takes the lead. It can also be seen in the criticism of  Governor Hosokawa's track record. It is said that, by inviting  designers and cultural personalities from Tokyo and introducing  top-level cultural assets to Kumamoto, he has perhaps merely  strengthened his yearning for Tokyo's culture. It is described  as "providing a dream." The harder a local headman pursues  top-level culture, the more difficult it is for it to take root,  and the limitation of cultural elitism becomes exposed. The  participation of the general citizenry becomes unavoidably  difficult.    It is true that, as governor, Hosokawa energized the will  for  participation by local government employees. He introduced the  method of participation used by employees of Japan's companies  (through QC [quality control] circles, for example) to the local  bodies--i.e. the same method used by (the then) Chairman Hisashi  Shindo of the Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Public Corp. It  served to energize the local bodies, but it is highly  questionable whether it promoted participation at the citizens'  level. The situation is pretty much the same in the cities,  towns, and villages throughout Japan that have been urged toward  city-building and town-building.    It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the two new  conservative forces have failed to create a culture that  promotes active public participation such as participation in  Japan's politics. Therein remains a potential which is yet to be  cultivated in Japan's politics. Amid the internal contest among  the coalition forces, including the Social Democratic Party of  Japan, the political party that arouses the will for  participation and succeeds in organizing it will be able to  survive. And that party will definitely become the matrix of  true political reform.    Hideo Otake: Professor at Kyoto University  law school. Born in 1943.

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / People: From public and private sectors to Avon's lobbying forum The Western Development Partnership in Avon, a public and private sector lobbying forum, has appointed its first chief executive, Richard Brown. Until May this year he was manager of strategic direction and organisation at the power distribution company National Grid. The partnership was formed as a company in June to press the case for Avon's economic development. It arose out of a widely-felt belief that the region has suffered from the lack of a unified voice, especially in pressing its case in Whitehall and Brussels. The impact of the recession on the area has been compounded by the contraction of the defence and aerospace industries. Chris Garcia, a strategic planning consultant, has been drawing up a business plan for the partnership, which has funding of Pounds 250,000 for its first year from councils, industry and Avon Tec. Brown's task will be to promote the region and attract inward investment and job creation. The partnership has already been active in co-ordinating bids for European Community regional aid. Brown's background is in both the public and private sectors. An Oxford graduate now aged 46, his early career was as a civil servant, firstly with the Department of the Environment and then the Department of Trade and Industry. For three years he was head of the North American section of the DTI's Invest in Britain Bureau. In 1988 he joined Meyer International, the timber supplier, where he was head of corporate development and joint managing director of its German subsidiary, Kloeckner-Meyer. He joined National Grid in February last year.</p>

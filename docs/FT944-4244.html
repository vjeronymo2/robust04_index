			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Battle over Ulster fraud stepped up: Renewed fears on racketeering Government officials have drawn up proposals to combat financial crime in Northern Ireland, in the expectation that some former paramilitaries may continue racketeering even if a lasting peace is achieved. Some senior security officials believe that a number of former paramilitaries will continue to engage in fraud and extortion, either in their own right or in organised criminal groups. They consider that investment generated by the 'peace dividend' may present opportunities for financial crime and are insisting that any significant investment from the US and the European Union be closely controlled by civil servants. They fear that current legislation may not be adequate in the changing political circumstances. Under the Northern Ireland Emergency Powers Act the security forces act against racketeering and extortion on the basis of evidence that these are contributing to paramilitary organisations. The Northern Ireland Office's terrorist finance unit, which has co-ordinated a secret war against IRA fundraising for four years, is considering options based on legislation against organised crime in Italy and the US. The recent armed raid on a Newry post office, in which IRA members acting under orders from their local commander killed one man and stole Pounds 150,000, highlights how entangled terrorism and financial crime have become. It is understood that the IRA leadership has privately indicated to Irish officials that the money from the raid could be returned as a sign that armed robberies have been discontinued to mark the organisation's commitment to the peace process. But some IRA members who are less supportive of the ceasefire process are concerned that the organisation is being financially weakened. The IRA's 'operational requirements' just before the ceasefire are thought to have been running at about Pounds 3m a year, half the figure estimated in the early 1990s. It is thought that it is now using its funds for intelligence gathering and to support members who remain fugitives from justice as well as families of political prisoners. There is little evidence of big arms purchases. The government claims success in cracking down on one of the main sources of fund-raising for the IRA in recent years by closing numerous Belfast drinking clubs associated with the paramilitaries and reopening them under strict licences. The NIO's finance unit claims to have found no evidence of companies being used as IRA fronts, although such companies are widely believed to exist. Officials remain anxious to control another traditional source of IRA funding - from Irish-American supporters. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, announced plans in Washington this week for Cairde Sinn Fein, a new fundraising organisation in the US on behalf of the IRA's political arm. He pledged 'accountability and transparency'. Mr Adams is aware that Noraid, an organisation once stigmatised as the IRA's main fundraising arm in the US, has openly defied a court order to file regular reports with the US Justice Department. The organisation's last filed accounts cover the 12 months to July 1991 and involve claimed funds of Dollars 1.8m. According to Department of Justice officials the last Northern Ireland group to register a fundraising organisation was Mr John Hume's Social Democratic and Labour party in March this year. British officials have long suspected that funds raised on behalf of republican prisoners in the US were being diverted to the IRA.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Property profits help Clyde Blowers to double Clyde Blowers, the expanding materials handling equipment company, reported pre-tax profits more than doubled at Pounds 521,000, against Pounds 205,000 in the year to August 31. There were Pounds 603,000 of exceptional profits this time, against Pounds 515,000. At the operating level losses were reduced from Pounds 269,000 to Pounds 92,000 on turnover which rose to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 7.4m). A long-established quoted engineering company, Clyde has been transformed since Mr James McColl bought 29.9 per cent in 1992 and became executive chairman. Its last purchase was Simon-Macawber, a maker of pneumatic pressure and vacuum conveyancing equipment, in April from Simon Engineering. It now forms Clyde Pneumatic Conveyancing and accounts for 65 per cent of turnover, which is expected to reach Pounds 27m in a full year. The exceptional profits included a gain of Pounds 593,000 on a property sale and investment income from property of Pounds 120,000. A final dividend of 3p (2.67p) is proposed making a total of 4.5p (4p) from earnings per share of 5.98p (4.69p).</p>

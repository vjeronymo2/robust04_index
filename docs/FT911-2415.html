			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Mercury urges Oftel to reduce network tariff MERCURY COMMUNICATIONS is urging Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, to reduce charges it will have to pay for using the network of its larger rival, British Telecom. Mercury has joined others in the industry, such as cable television companies and British Rail Telecommunications, in criticising Oftel's proposals on how the interconnection charges between networks should be calculated. The industry says Oftel has been too generous to BT, creating the danger that the government's policy for increasing competition in the telecommunications sector, announced in last month's white paper, may be thwarted. Speculation is widespread in the City and in the industry that Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, has shifted his position in BT's favour in recent months as the result of pressure from the government in the run-up to its sale of a second tranche of BT shares. Mr Peter van Kuylenberg, Mercury's chief executive, said Sir Bryan's arguments were now '180 degrees out of phase' with what they had been. Sir Bryan has refused to comment on the dispute over interconnection charges, but he is likely to issue a statement in about two weeks in an attempt to clarify his policy. Mercury, which has been remaining quiet publicly in the hope of increasing its leverage, believes there is still everything to play for. 'The whole matter is very much in the process of consultation,' Mr van Kuylenberg said. The main point of contention is Oftel's suggestion that rivals should contribute to BT's 'access deficit' whenever they use the company's network. The idea is that BT makes a loss from providing people with a phone line which it subsidises from higher call charges and that its competitors should be required to make a similar subsidy. Mr van Kuylenberg said that Mercury was already paying a fair share of those costs under its existing interconnecting arrangements. He also argued that the method Oftel was proposing to use to calculate the deficit was too generous to BT.</p>

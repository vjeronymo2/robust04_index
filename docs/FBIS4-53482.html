			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  office at Chongwadae, which has been embroiled in unexpected  political disputes in recent months, is trying to climb out of  the rut and forge ahead by tackling major pending issues.    Since President Kim returned home from visits to Japan and  China in late March, it wouldn't be exaggerating to say that  Chongwadae hasn't had a single day of respite beginning with the  controversial revision of the Uruguay Round trade accord.    This was followed by violent clashes between conservative  and  reformist monks at the Buddhist Chogye order, a disruption in  the wholesale operation of farm and fishery products, the  Sangmudae scandal, the problem of resettling North Korean  lumberjacks who escaped from logging camps in Siberia and, of  course, the seemingly never-ending North Korean nuclear row.    But taking Wednesday -- a national holiday -- as a turning  point, Chongwadae wants to put the series of events behind it  and make a fresh start as most of these issues found resolution  and government officials are awakening from their much  criticized lethargy.    Chongwadae selected 11 "core tasks" on Thursday and  proceeded  to tackle them. They are:    -- Strengthening of the international competitive power of  Korean companies through stable labor-management relations and  steady push for a new economy,    -- International trade and trade policy,    -- Measures to spur development of the farm and fishery  industries to cope with the effectuation of Uruguay Round  accords,    -- Expansion of social infrastructure,    -- Buildup of an information superhighway network    -- Persistent development of advanced technology,    -- Steady easing of administrative restrictions,    -- Educational reform aimed at boosting national  competitive strength,    -- Steps to stabilize consumer prices and other aspects  related to the people's livelihood,    -- Political reform aimed at realizing clean politics, and    -- Diplomatic, unification and national security policy.    These are the problems on which Chongwadae wants to work and  set forth broad outlines before President Kim visits Russia on  June 1, according to sources.    Presidential aides are being careful, however, not to repeat  the past pattern when a string of unforeseen events occurred  following the return of President Kim from overseas trips. They  hope that Kim's visit to Moscow will not be followed by an  another series of thorny events.    President Kim spent a quiet holiday Wednesday as five North  Korean loggers arrived in Seoul for resettlement in the South  and the National Assembly settled down to conduct a  parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal.    Kim took the initiative in creating "an atmosphere" in which  all government officials can work hard at their given tasks.    He has invited freshmen and sophomore lawmakers from the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party to Chongwadae for what his aides  called "frank and unassuming" discussions of various problems  this week.    The president also met with lower-ranking presidential aides  at Chongwadae and gave them a pep talk.    On Thursday morning, he held a meeting of seven junior  presidential secretaries on economic affairs and urged them to  take the lead in the government's efforts to increase the  nation's competitiveness.    "Even if there are some disputes in the political sector, we  can tide over any national difficulty as long as the economy  moves ahead smoothly," Kim reportedly told the secretaries.    Kim is expected to invite another batch of first- and  second-term DLP lawmakers to Chongwadae, including Reps. Sin  Kyong-sik, Kwon Hae-ok and Yi Myong-pak, for dinner to express  his thanks for their parliamentary work and to ask them to  continue striving for political reform.    Kim's meetings with lower-ranking DLP lawmakers or  back-benchers and working-level presidential secretaries are  unprecedented. In fact, this is seen by many as part of Kim's  efforts to soften his image as "a hard president."</p>

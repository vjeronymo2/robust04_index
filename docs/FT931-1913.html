			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Hungry American eyes European sales: A look at EDS and its plans to expand internationally Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing services company, sits in his office in Dallas, Texas, and casts a hungry eye over Europe. 'For this decade', he says, 'it is really the (international) marketplace.' Europe, he explains, is just warming to the idea of outsourcing - whereby companies spin off their computer systems management to an outside specialist such as EDS - and is roughly where the US market was five years ago. Asia-Pacific is some way behind Europe. EDS, which now operates in more than 30 countries, has huge global ambitions. It already earns 25 per cent of its revenues in international markets, up from 14 per cent five years ago, and demonstrated its commitment to rapid European expansion with its 1991 takeover of SD-Scicon, the UK computer software and services business. Company officials hint that an Italian acquisition may be on the cards. But financial markets have been most excited in recent months by rumours that it is in the early stages of negotiations with British Telecom which could lead to joint ventures. It may even mean BT taking a stake in EDS, which is a largely autonomous subsidiary of financially troubled General Motors. 'Yes, we're talking to BT. . .', says Mr Alberthal, but then he quickly adds '. . . and NTT (of Japan), and the French, and the Germans, and the Spanish . . . and every other telephone company out there.' This is hardly surprising, as telecommunications and computer businesses are increasingly being pushed towards each other as the two industries converge and corporate customers seek easy solutions to the problems of moving data around the world. EDS, for example, now operates what it claims is the world's largest privately-owned digital information network, with its nerve centre at an impressive control room in Plano, Texas, and 18 large information processing centres around the world. Some 90 per cent of its transmission capacity is leased from telecommunications companies, which are in turn muscling into the computer services business. BT, for example, is doing so in the UK, and has set up a company in the US, called Syncordia, which aims to handle multi-nationals' global communications traffic. Combine Syncordia's slow US start-up with EDS's European ambitions (but a lingering reputation there for Texan heavy-handedness) and it is hardly surprising that many analysts see plenty of logic in a BT-EDS link-up. However, Mr Alberthal, who will not comment directly on the BT rumours, cautions that the media tends to be too eager to link EDS with a single partner. 'But BT isn't all over the world; AT&amp;T (of the US) isn't all over the world. There is no one answer.' In five years' time, he adds, he hopes to have built a number of relationships. Whatever the outcome, there is no doubting the success of EDS in the 30 years since it was founded by Mr Ross Perot - who last year ran as a populist US presidential candidate - to help companies develop and integrate computer systems and to manage systems for those businesses wishing to outsource. Mr Perot sold EDS to GM for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.83bn) in 1984 and parted company with both businesses two years later after a succession of clashes with fellow members of the car company's board. He now runs a smaller rival to EDS, Perot Systems. In spite of his departure, EDS has continued to grow strongly under the owlish-faced Mr Alberthal, with revenues rising from Dollars 4.8bn in 1988 to Dollars 8.2bn in 1992; earnings per share increasing from 79 cents to Dollars 1.33; and its backlog of non-GM business up from Dollars 12.7bn to around Dollars 25bn. Equally important, the mix of business has changed markedly. Work for GM, which accounts for a relatively stable Dollars 3bn of EDS's revenues, represented three quarters of total revenues in the mid-1980s. Last year, however, GM contributed only 41 per cent and analysts expect the figure to drop to little more than a quarter by the middle of the decade. Mr Alberthal has also softened the hard-charging, marine-like and secretive culture fostered by Mr Perot, while maintaining positive elements of the Perot regime such as a strong group loyalty and single-minded focus on getting a job done. 'The old EDS had a 'prolonged adolescence',' admits Mr Barry Sullivan, vice-president in charge of marketing. 'It had this arrogant, 'we can take on the world' point of view. It gave us a very rocky entry to the UK.' However, company officials from the chairman down insist this lingering image is outdated and EDS has become much more sensitive to local cultures. They point out, for example, that 10 years ago it employed 300 people outside the US, of which 290 were Americans, while now it employs 17,000, of which only 100 are Americans. With analysts forecasting rapid growth in information technology services over the next decade, the group's prospects seem very bright, though not without potential problems. One of these is increasing competition as computer hardware manufacturers, led by IBM, and telecommunications companies focus more attention on the services business. EDS's strength in this tussle is its independence - it has no vested interest in pushing a certain product at buyers - but competition could nevertheless drive down the sector's margins. Another potential problem is managing rapid growth to prevent the kind of bureaucratic inertia and cultural dilution which can put the most successful companies out of touch with customer needs. EDS has grown from just 13,000 employees at the time of the GM takeover to more than 70,000 today, and the numbers should keep mounting fast, as every time EDS gets an outsourcing contract, it also acquires the computer staff of the company concerned and has to steep them in EDS ways - a process it calls 'transitioning'. Mr Alberthal argues that this is a source of strength, rather than weakness, as it brings fresh industrial expertise into the group. Moreover, EDS, with 30 years of 'transitioning' behind it, has much more experience in the technique than many newer outsourcing rivals. However, to maintain the entrepreneurial drive of a small company, Mr Alberthal fundamentally shook up EDS's management structure four years ago, dividing the group into 38 strategic business units, each responsible for their own profits. Last autumn he tweaked the structure again to make it flatter, encourage more teamwork across the group and foster the 'cultural diversity' which he says is 'essential to being a truly global company'. The sentiment reflects both the distance the company has travelled from Perotian uniformity and the way it still has to go to realise fully its international ambitions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal to the nation" by Khieu Samphan, head of the party </F> of Democratic Kampuchea; dated 14 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. Presently, the United States is arrogantly and  shamelessly planning to serve as ringleader of the allies in  providing arms to the communist Vietnamese's puppets and  two-headed government for continuing to kindle the war to kill  the Cambodian nation and people.    II. This is a continuation of the strategy of the allies and  the communist Vietnamese to pit the traitorous Cambodians  against the patriotic Cambodians and Cambodian people to kill  the Cambodian nation and people, thus enabling them to compete  for the benefits of the Cambodian nation and people.    III. After our nation and people valiantly and arduously  struggled for the past 10 years and more against the aggressor  communist Vietnamese, thus inflicting heavy defeats on them and  plunging them into an impasse, the Western allies, headed by the  United States, have resorted to a new strategy by joining hands  with the communist Vietnamese to continue slaying the Cambodian  nation and people.    The Baker-Shevardnadze communique issued in Paris in July  1990 is an official and open declaration of this new strategy.    The communist Vietnamese's goal is to smash Democratic  Kampuchea so that they can annex and turn Cambodia into another  Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam].  They have continued to kindle their war of aggression in  Cambodia to seek a chance to send more Vietnamese nationals to  engulf Cambodia.    The United States and its evil allies also have the goal to  smash Democratic Kampuchea to put Cambodia into their sphere of  influence. This is why the allies, with the United States as the  ringleader and France, Australia, and Japan as the proxies, have  joined hands with the communist Vietnamese in launching various  criminal activities.    1. They opposed the Paris Accords by refusing to give the  right and power to the quadripartite Supreme National Council  and not supervising the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from  Cambodia;    2. They organized a sham election under the control of the  communist Vietnamese administration and UNTAC [UN Transitional  Authority in Cambodia];    3. Immediately after the elections and establishing the  two-headed government, they have continued to kindle the war by  leading the forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the  forces of the two Para groups [noncommunist resistance groups],  which are U.S. puppet forces, to launch offensives against  Democratic Kampuchea and the people in Stoung, Phnum Chhat,  Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas. However, they have  suffered successive defeats and more serious setbacks  militarily, politically, economically, financially, and socially.    In the military field, the two categories of Para forces,  which are U.S. puppets, are dissolving, and the communist  Vietnamese puppet forces are badly beaten and collapsing.    In the political field, both the allies and their puppets  grouped up with the communist Vietnamese puppets have all been  exposed at home and abroad as the conspirators of the aggressor  communist Vietnamese, as the warmongers, traitors, and the arch  corruptors.    In the economic and financial fields, the communist  Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government are collapsing.  They have been able to survive only because of the small-scale  aid drops from the allies. They are strangling one another and  are plunging into the abyss. Although in an all-around impasse,  they are blindly seeking to eliminate the Cambodian nation and  people and Democratic Kampuchea through military means.    IV. In what situation are the United States, France,  Australia, and the other evil allies jointly providing arms to  the communist Vietnamese puppets? It is in a situation in which  the two-headed government has only a decaying skin left. In  reality, what remains is only the pure puppet administration and  puppet army of the communist Vietnamese. The Vietnamese puppet  administration and puppet army are also collapsing. They have  no people on their side. The people very strongly oppose them.    This situation shows that the policy to continue kindling  the  war pursued by the United States and the other evil allies is a  blind policy that will only lead them toward an abyss of more  shameful defeats.    The overwhelming majority of countries around the world,  especially in Southeast Asia, oppose this blind policy.    In the United States and other Western countries, public  opinions has asked: Which is better -- to follow this policy to  blindly kindle the war or to reconsider helping Cambodia achieve  peace and national reconciliation?    More and more, public opinion has asked: What benefit do the  United States and the allies expect to gain from opposing the  national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia by continuing to  provide dollars and arms to the communist Vietnamese puppets?    Those who ask these questions have become well aware of the  fact that it is impossible to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea.  Attacking Democratic Kampuchea is tantamount to attacking the  Cambodian nation and people.    V. Esteemed and beloved compatriots, both the communist  Vietnamese and the allies are very very cruel toward our  Cambodian nation and people. They have been jointly mustering  their puppet forces to serve their strategy to eliminate our  nation and people. They have opposed our national  reconciliation. They have opposed the national reconciliation  policy of King Norodom Sihanouk. They have continued to kindle  the war of the aggressor communist Vietnamese. However, they  have suffered serious defeats successively.    The United States and the other evil allies are now openly  taking the lead in providing arms to their puppets, that is, the  communist Vietnamese and the Vietnamese puppets, to continue  killing and exterminating our nation and people.    Therefore, we call on all compatriots to rise up and launch  all forms of activities to check and smash this arch criminal  plan.    Compatriots in the country should rise up and join hands  with  the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in defending your  villages, houses, farm lands, property, oxen, buffalo, and fowl.  You should prevent yourselves from being forcibly recruited as  soldiers or as militiamen. You should call on your offspring  and husbands to desert the fascist administration and the  battlefields and return home.    Compatriots in the cities should rise up to oppose the  fascist regime, which is completely corrupt, betrays the country  and people, and sells out our nation and territory to the  communist Vietnamese and the alliance. You should rise up to  demand national reconciliation and peace so that our nation and  people and each of your families can survive and earn a living  peacefully.    VI. I would like to take this opportunity to stress once  again that the Democratic Kampuchean forces vehemently oppose  the war, vehemently oppose the attempt to continue kindling the  war of the communist Vietnamese, Vietnamese puppets, and the  allies and their puppets. Democratic Kampuchea unswervingly  adheres to the policy of national reconciliation. In whatever  circumstances, it will never deviate from the king's five-point  national reconciliation policy.    The king has repeatedly appealed to us that national  reconciliation is the only holy medicine for our nation and  people to regain genuine peace and thereby move on, step by  step, toward achieving their national independence and  sovereignty.    The king has said: War is death; peace is life.    However, if the communist Vietnamese and bellicose allies of  all categories continue to oppose our national reconciliation  and to kindle the war, they should look back at the past  historic experiences, especially the experiences in the  full-fledged war of aggression of the communist Vietnamese in  the past 13 years and the war rekindled by the allies together  with the communist Vietnamese from July 1993 until today.    These experiences clearly show that the evil elements and  weaponry of the foreign aggressors definitely cannot conquer the  solid and dynamic forces of unity of the Cambodian nation and  people.    Reject the warmongers!    Down with the warmongers!    Long live the mighty great national united forces of the  Cambodian nation and people!    Long live the mighty force of national reconciliation!    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic  Kampuchea    [Dated] 14 May 1994</p>

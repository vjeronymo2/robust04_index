			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA SUPPORT IS ERODING, ARTS PANEL WARNED  </P> <P> The advisory board to the National Endowment for the Arts was warned here  Friday that support for the NEA within the largest arts advocacy unit in  Congress may have been dangerously eroded.  </P> <P> The situation prompted members of the National Council on the Arts and key arts  support groups to observe -- many for the first time publicly -- that the  situation poses potentially fatal new political problems for the beleaguered  arts agency.  </P> <P> The warning was issued to the council by Julie Davis, the NEA's general  counsel, who said she drew her conclusions about increased political risk for  the endowment from a briefing last week conducted by four top NEA officials for  members of the bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus.  </P> <P> The caucus, with about 250 members in the House and Senate, has traditionally  been a crucial source of support for the NEA. But Davis said the withering  political controversy that has beset the arts agency has apparently taken its  toll even among the NEA's most important congressional advocates.  </P> <P> There is, said Davis, "a handful who are still solidly behind us," but, even in  the arts caucus, she said, "I don't think there is very strong, broad-based  support."  </P> <P> The assessment caused serious new concern among the arts council over whether  the agency can survive a running battle over its legislative renewal in  anything close to its present form. NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer  acknowledged the uncertainty of the situation, adding a warning of his own that  the situation "is in a tremendous state of flux right now" and that, in terms  of reliable support for the NEA in Congress, "there is not a lot of solid  ground up there."  </P> <P> At the same time, however, it was learned that Frohnmayer has asked officials  of half a dozen key arts support groups to advise him on changes in the NEA  structure under which the endowment would limit itself to making grants of  $30,000 or more.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer reportedly made the request in a private, unscheduled meeting here  Thursday night. It was learned that he has asked individual arts advisers for  their opinions on limiting NEA support to $100,000 or more.  </P> <P> It was not clear, however, whether Frohnmayer was seeking to build a consensus  for a last-ditch defensive position from which to make the NEA's last stand or  if he had some other reason for seeking the arts groups' advice. Frohnmayer was  not available to reporters during the daytime council meeting Friday.  </P> <P> The alteration in grant policy would turn over to state and local arts agencies  the authority for awarding perhaps more than 90% of the total number of grants  given by the NEA. The agency made 3,900 separate grants last year and endowment  officials said Friday that a survey several days ago had found that 87.5% of  all NEA grants are for $50,000 or less -- indicating that the total below  $30,000 would be significantly greater.  </P> <P> The NEA's total budget for 1990 is about $171 million. Grant officials  emphasized that, while the number of such individual grants is high, larger  arts organizations receive the majority of the total money awarded.  </P> <P> The request by Frohnmayer was apparently linked to a plea for the private  arts-support groups to consider in principle the concept of transferring to  state arts councils authority to make direct spending decisions over greatly  expanded portions of the NEA budget.  </P> <P> The proposal on which Frohnmayer sought the advice was said by sources to be  nearly identical to a plan under discussion by a small group of Republican  congressmen. The plan has already led to outraged reactions among a number of  key arts support organizations, which see it as an abandonment of individual  artists.  </P> <P> Such artists, on the cutting edges of a variety of media, receive many of the  NEA's comparatively small grants. Yet they are widely perceived as the most  risky grant recipients since their work often is the most directly provocative  and politically risky material the NEA supports.  </P> <P> Arts advocates were outraged by the role played in Republican analysis of the  National Assn. of State Arts Agencies' proposal to shift more than half of the  NEA's money back to the states. The association represents the state art  councils and for several years has pursued its own agenda of trying to increase  the political and financial clout of the state agencies.  </P> <P> It was learned that council member Lloyd Richards, dean of the Yale Drama  School, had written to officials of the state arts council group castigating  them for breaking ranks with the arts community at what many art advocates  consider the most dangerous moment for the NEA since it was founded 25 years  ago.  </P> <P> Peter Zeisler, director of the Theatre Communications Group, who a day before  accused the National Assn. of State Arts Agencies of a "double-cross," released  a letter to Jonathan Katz, the association's executive director, accusing it of  attempting to engineer a self-interested coup under circumstances that are  "inexcusable."  </P> <P> The pessimistic analysis of the NEA's political support base in the House and  Senate touched off a new round of intense discussion within the arts council,  whose members have discussed the agency's crisis regularly for the last year  but taken few forceful political or policy positions to back up their concern.  </P> <P> Council member Jacob Neusner complained of "a hot, dry wind that is melting  support that we thought was solid." And Neusner, for the first time in a public  NEA council meeting, gave voice to the possibility that the agency might not  survive in its present form -- a prospect that observers familiar with the  situation have said privately has become a far more realistic possibility than  arts advocates would like.  </P> <P> Neusner posed a series of questions predicated on the contention that "if, by  next November, there is no endowment, which is a possibility."  </P> <P> New York State Sen. Roy Goodman, a Bush Administration Republican who has  established himself as one of the most passionate advocates of an unfettered  NEA in the country, said he was increasingly concerned about "an atmosphere of  panic and hysteria of the type that is now evident in the Congress."  </P> <P> He called the political imbroglio that arose from objections by conservative  politicians and organizations to a handful of controversial work funded by the  endowment "an outrage similar to things that happened during the McCarthy era"  and concluded, "make no mistake -- this endowment is being smeared."  </P></p>

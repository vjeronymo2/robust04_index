			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 31 May.    Preliminary forecasts by the National Foreign Trade Council  show that Mexican exports to the United States reached $4.5  billion in April, a 6-percent increase over exports in March.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 24 May 94 p 22)    The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has reported that  from 1990 to date, Mexico's public foreign debt has negatively  affected the international exchange of the dollar as compared  with other currencies. The report adds that in the first three  months of 1994 the balance of Mexico's foreign debt rose to  $1.116 billion. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 25 May 94  pp 1, 4, 3A)    Francisco Rojas, director of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), has  announced that a huge oil deposit has been discovered in the  Jujo-Tecominoacan field, Tabasco State, with reserves estimated  at 431 million barrels of crude oil. Rojas also reported that  PEMEX will launch the Olmeca Project which is designed to  increase the utilization of light crude reserves from the  Mezozoico Chiapas- Tabasco deposits. He added that the  development of the Caan, Ek-Balam, and Taruntunich fields will  produce revenues of $1.3 billion, which will allow PEMEX to  fully recover all of its 1993 and 1994 investments. (Mexico  City LA JORNADA in Spanish 25 May 94 pp 1, 52)    EL FINANCIERO has conducted some economic research that  shows  Mexico does not have the capacity to retain foreign  reinvestments aimed at increasing productivity because profits  sent abroad amount to $1.41 billion, which is 25 percent higher  than last year's figure. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish  25 May 94 pp 1, 4, 3A)    Finance and Public Credit Minister Pedro Aspe Armella has  reported that although jobs have increased at assembly plants  and commercial establishments, the number of workers registered  with the Mexican Social Security Institute has decreased 1.3  percent over the first three months of 1994. Aspe added that  the unemployment rate during the same period is the highest in  the past six years. He explained that the unemployment rate was  3.8 percent in January, 3.7 percent in February, and 3.6 percent  in March. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 May 94 p 25)    Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of National  Association of Processing Industry, has stated that the Mexican  private sector will not give into pressure from U.S.  industrialists and farmers who want Mexico to expedite the  lifting of tariffs on various products under NAFTA. Terrones  Lopez pointed out that the U.S. industrialists and farmers have  prepared a list that would place Mexico at a disadvantage. The  list contains food, chemical, plastic, and manufactured  products. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT  27 May 94)    The World Bank has granted loans for $80 million to support  educational programs in Mexico over the next five years,  according to a spokesman for the World Bank.

(Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0259 GMT 28 May 94)    A study prepared by the National Bank of Mexico (BANAMEX)  points out that the private sector's level of indebtedness with  the banking system has become an obstacle for overall economic  growth. The report describes statements by some experts who  predict there will be economic growth of more than 3 percent in  1994 as "exaggerated optimism." The BANAMEX study adds that  1994's economic growth will be approximately 2 percent. (Mexico  City LA JORNADA in Spanish 30 May 94 p 53)</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Regular savers lend stability - Investment trusts / Discounts are at a 20-year low, reflecting trusts' popularity with private investors INVESTMENT TRUSTS passed another milestone during the third quarter of 1993. In August, the average discount to net assets touched a 20-year low of 8.7 per cent. That represents an enormous improvement on the 40 per cent discount at which trust shares traded in 1977, and indicates how far trusts have succeeded in winning back the affections of private investors. A good contrarian will naturally ask whether this represents the high point of investment trust fortunes. Could a sudden reversal in the stock market clobber investors with the 'double whammy' of falling assets and a widening discount? There have certainly been some signs of overheating in the trust market. Many emerging-market trust shares, benefiting from being the investment fashion of the moment, have traded at premiums to net assets; at one stage in August, Templeton's emerging markets fund reached a 17.6 per cent premium. Such a premium creates a lot of scope for disappointment. However, there are reasons to hope that investment trusts will not return to the wide discounts they suffered in the 1970s. The first is the existence of savings schemes, which provide a steady drip of demand for trust shares. Figures from Henderson Touche Remnant indicate that trusts with savings schemes trade at around a 2 per cent smaller discount than trusts without such schemes. Savings scheme investors, by their nature, tend to be more willing to ride out the market's peaks and troughs. Another factor is personal equity plans. The evidence seems to be that Pep holders are more stable than other private investors, perhaps because they want to use the tax shelter for long-term financial planning. Finally, the trust sector has become increasingly specialised over the past decade. Although the big international generalist funds still dominate the industry, recent fund launches have either had a split-capital structure (designed to attract private investors via tax efficiency) or been geographical specialists (designed to attract institutional investors by offering a service they cannot easily duplicate themselves). Such funds tend, by targeting investor demand more closely, to trade at smaller discounts than general funds. FLEMING TARGETS CHINA THROUGH HONG KONG IN THE Middle Ages, European merchants would dream of the riches they could obtain by trading with the Orient. In the late 20th century, fund managers dream of the returns they will make from investing in China, the world's most populous country which some predict will soon be the world's biggest economy. There are plenty of statistics one can cite in favour of the Chinese option. GDP growth was 12.8 per cent in 1992, well ahead of most other so-called emerging markets, let alone the developed economies. The average factory wage in China is Dollars 35 per month, compared with Dollars 950 in Hong Kong and Dollars 1,919 in the US, giving the Chinese tremendous cost advantages. The origins of the investment trust industry lie in the opportunities presented by such markets, so it is unsurprising to see Robert Fleming launch a Chinese trust. The problem for such funds is that the onshore Chinese stock market is tiny; there are only 30 listed companies with a market capitalisation of Dollars 1bn. Initially, therefore, the Fleming fund will have to invest a large proportion of its assets in Hong Kong companies which derive their earnings from China. Some commentators are worried by the current investment fashion for China; there are signs that the Chinese economy is overheating, with inflation rising rapidly. But Fleming had little difficulty in raising Pounds 60m for the trust, which will be available via its savings scheme. F&amp;C CASTS ITS BREAD UPON THE WATER JOHNSON FRY was the first financial services company to launch a utilities investment trust earlier this year. Now Foreign &amp; Colonial has followed suit with Suit  - the Special Utilities Investment Trust. This unusual fund specialises in the former 'statutory water companies', such as South Staffordshire and Bristol. These companies are not the privatised water groups (such as Thames Water); they are responsible purely for water, not sewage, and, until recently, their profits and dividends were set by statute. Around 55 per cent of Suit's portfolio is in water stocks; the remainder is in shares of other utilities. The idea for Suit was formed when Duncan Savile, a substantial investor in water company stocks, approached F&amp;C with the idea of swapping his holding for investment trust shares. He has acquired capital shares in the trust, which has a split-capital structure (the first time F&amp;C has launched such a fund). Private investors will probably be more attracted by the income shares, which had an initial gross yield of 7.75 per cent and which are Pepable. As well as the capital and income shares, there are package units, which can be converted into one capital and one income share at any time.</p>

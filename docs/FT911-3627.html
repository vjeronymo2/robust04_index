			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: NatWest gloomy on first half LORD ALEXANDER, chairman of the National Westminster Bank, warned yesterday that there would be no immediate improvement in the bank's performance because of the recession and continued high level of bad debts. However, the bank had taken several initiatives to cut costs which should begin to flow through in the second half of the year. This would be followed by significant improvements in 1992 and 1993. Lord Alexander told the annual meeting that NatWest was taking several initiatives to deal with problems which depressed last year's result, particularly at its two loss-making arms, County NatWest, the investment bank, and NatWest Bancorp, its US arm. The equities business of County had met 'all significant milestones' which were set for the first quarter of this year, and was well ahead of its plan to achieve satisfactory profitability. In February, Lord Alexander gave the business two years to get back in the black or risk closure. NatWest also announced the appointment to the main board of Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of UK financial services.</p>

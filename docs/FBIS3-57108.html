There is almost no doubt that the masterminds of  the "Union..." -- deputies Aleksandr Braginskiy, Irina  Khakamada, and the already mentioned Mr. Makarov -- who had  managed, in less than a week's time, to double the number of  their supporters, will successfully clear this last hurdle as  well. Already now they hold 22 applications from deputies who  intend to join their group, and eight verbal assurances from  colleagues who are ready to write such application "even today."    True, deputies Braginskiy and Khakamada had to approach  nearly all the existing factions: starting from Russia's  Choice, they turned in sequence to the leaders of Yabloko, the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Democratic Party of  Russia, and finally Vladimir Medvedev's New Regional Policy with  a request to delegate voluntarily their supporters to the new  group. Let us note that their efforts met with the least  understanding precisely in Russia's Choice, and it is from there  that a considerable number of deputies finally fled to  Khakamada's colors.    The greatest sensation among such deserters was produced by  Boris Fedorov, who was absolutely enraged -- as one can conclude  from the series of interviews he gave on Sunday and Monday -- at  the fact that Yegor Gaydar's decision to renounce participation  in the new government had been preceded by consultations with  all sorts of people rather than with the closest cabinet  associate. As is known, Choice paved the way to parliament for  this same Makarov or, say, Mikhail Kisilev, who told journalists  yesterday he was changing his faction allegiance.    It is enough to state even these samples: "Russia's Choice  has passed up the chance to create a `satellite faction' linked  to it by strict and long-term commitments of joint activities in  parliament. The "Union of 12 December" is now being born  despite, rather than thanks, to it. The good-natured parting  words like Yegor Gaydar's phrase, "We have nothing against the  new faction, and will obviously form a block in a friendly  manner with them," appear belated and not quite sincere.  Essentially, though, leaders of "Choice" should not have  special reasons for fears: it is not Communists, really and  truly, that Choice will have to take cues from in important  voting.    One must assume that the skeptical attitude by the leaders  of  Choice to the efforts of Mr. Braginskiy and Mrs. Khakamada was  based, it is easy to guess, on the unpleasant memories of the  cruel scandal thrown at them by a group of supporters in the  course of the famous conference at "Lesnyye Dali" [holiday spot  near Moscow] shortly before the opening of the Duma session.  Several recent members of the movement's Executive Committee  spoke at that time against appointing Yegor Gaydar head of the  faction, and supported the candidature of Gennadiy Burbulis.  Mr. Burbulis for that matter preferred to be shy and say  nothing, and Andrey Makarov led the riot.    It is not surprising that, getting the wind of the latter's  efforts (which had been carefully concealed by him until  recently) to split off some deputies from the "maternal  faction," observers were awaiting a statement from Mr. Burbulis  on supporting this initiative and maybe on taking over the  functions of leader of the "allies." But on reflection, the  splitters finally convinced each other that it is not quite  decent for deputies elected on party lists to violate the  political residency qualification by so quickly and easily going  back on their election commitments. This triumph for common  sense was helped by, among other things, fears of the Duma's  impending approval of a law on deputy status: no potential  defector is guaranteed that the law would not incorporate a norm  on the automatic transfer of the seat of a deputy showing a bent  for disorderly political contacts to the candidate next on the  party list.    Formulating, so far unofficially, the position of their  group, organizers of the "Union of 12 December" are speaking  especially often about their disagreement with the creation of  what Mrs. Khakamada described as "Duma politburo," in the shape  of the council of the leaders of factions and the already  elected chairman of the chamber. "The agreement on the  inadmissibility of whatever compacts with the Communists and the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has been broken by the heads  of Choice," stated Deputy Makarov in an interview for SEGODNYA.  "The package agreement on electing leaders of the Duma and of  its committees has become a model of bargaining in a situation  where all bargaining is out of place. The genius to strike  bargains has been shown in the most graphic manner by Mikhail  Poltoranin, who received direct powers to do that from Gaydar  himself.</p>

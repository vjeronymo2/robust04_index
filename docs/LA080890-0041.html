			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING REPORT: CATFISH AT MOST SITES; STRIPERS IN SOME AREAS  </P> <P> It's catfish and more catfish at most Southland reservoirs, but two offer an  alternative -- striped bass.  </P> <P> The bite is rated fair at San Bernardino County's Silverwood Lake, where Paul  Offerdahl of Mira Loma caught a 26-pound striper. In Los Angeles County's  Pyramid Lake, Ed Kurihara of Monterey Park took 14-, nine- and five-pound  stripers, while Ernie Benabidez of La Crescenta landed a 15 1/2-pounder.  </P></p>

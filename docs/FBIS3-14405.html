The oil minister told KUNA that the agreement is the best  that could be reached under the current circumstances. He said  he believes that demand for oil and prices will improve during  the third and fourth quarters of this year.    Concerning OPEC's stance on non-OPEC countries, the oil  minister stated that the organization is waiting to get a firm  commitment from those countries to freeze their actual output,  although it has received a verbal pledge on cooperation with  OPEC members.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Major wins support on resisting two-speed EC MR JOHN MAJOR ended the first round of a diplomatic offensive in Europe last night with assurances from his counterparts in France, Germany and Denmark that they would not seek to push Britain into the slow lane of a two-speed Europe. But during meetings in Paris and London with the French and Danish leaders and a lengthy telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the prime minister admitted that he could not ratify the Maastricht treaty until next year. Mr Major appeared to have made little headway with his demands that the emergency summit of EC leaders later this month in Birmingham should initiate a fundamental overhaul of the workings of the European exchange rate mechanism. The other leaders accept that the wave of speculative activity which forced sterling and the lira out of the ERM merit a review of the system but do not accept the British view that there are 'fault lines' in the ERM. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, also created fresh confusion with a suggestion in an interview in a German newspaper that European countries with stable economies and currencies could make up a joint currency zone that would be the nucleus of a future Europe. He said in an interview with the Nordkurier newspaper that he would not describe this as a two-speed development, but rather a Europe of concentric circles. In Paris, Mr Major and French president Francois Mitterrand agreed on the need for EC states to advance 'as Twelve' to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Mr Major said Mr Mitterrand showed 'no impatience, but a lot of understanding and agreement' with him on the difficulty of pushing the Maastricht treaty on European union rapidly through a divided UK parliament. A joint statement issued by the two leaders indicated that Mr Mitterrand is, for the moment, more anxious to help than to pressure Mr Major on the treaty's ratification. The two leaders 'stressed the importance of the Community developing as Twelve and respecting the interests of each member state', the statement said. 'In this context, they looked forward to the ratification and entry into force of the Maastricht treaty.' The absence of any mention of timing on ratification will be helpful to Mr Major, as well as to his Downing Street dinner guest last night, Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister. Mr Schluter called for a 'new basis' for the Maastricht treaty as a condition for a fresh referendum in Denmark next year. He said he saw 'common ground' with other EC countries on the need for more openness and less bureaucracy in EC decision-making. After assurances from Mr Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl that France and Germany were not hatching a fast-track move to a restricted economic and monetary union, excluding the UK and other weaker EC economies, Mr Major said: 'I don't think any of us want to see what is loosely called a two-speed Europe.' Later after his dinner with Mr Schluter, Mr Major added: 'We are gradually beginning to piece together the way in which we might move forward from the present difficulties.' He said there was some way to go before the government brought back to the House of Commons the bill to ratify the Maastricht. But he added that it need not be delayed until a second Danish referendum. Hurd soft-pedals on Maastricht, Page 2 French budget seeks to stave off pressure on the franc, Page 3</p>

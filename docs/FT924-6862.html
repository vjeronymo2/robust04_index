			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (4): Each town has decided to beat its individual drum - Strategies to attract inward investment AT A time when local authorities and regional development bodies throughout the UK and Europe are seeking to attract inward investment, the approach in Lancashire is worth noting. What is possibly a little odd about the Lancashire towns is that they are individually setting out their stalls. Lancaster's decision to beat its own drum is perhaps not so strange. It is isolated from the other towns and has a different economic structure. The city has benefited from the expansion of the port of Heysham, where British Gas's 20-acre purpose built operations base for the Morecambe Bay gas field is located. But Lancaster has also developed a strong service sector. The three towns of Preston, Blackburn and Burnley are close together physically. Preston is the largest, with a population of 120,000, but the two other towns have catchment populations of more than 100,000. The three have similar economic structures: traditional industrial centres, where in spite of some diversification there remains a heavy dependence on manufacturing. In this belt of towns along the M65, employment in manufacturing accounts for over 40 per cent of all employment. Moreover, they now face similar problems with the possible rundown of defence industries. Would it not make better sense to pool resources to attract new investment? Mrs Louise Ellman, leader of the Lancashire County Council, says: 'There is little rivalry between the county and the district councils. We all realise we are part of the same problem - we are facing a potential problem with the rundown of defence industries. There could be 21,000 jobs lost from aerospace alone.' Mr David Borrow, the leader of the Preston borough council, areas says: 'There is little rivalry between the councils. We would rather a new company came to Preston rather than Blackburn, but we are all close, so any new investment to the region is welcome.' Mr Peter Greenwood, the leader of the Blackburn borough council district says: 'Rivalry is the wrong word. We all talk together. The county council does a good job. But the district councils should concern themselves with the individual needs of the areas.' Mr Kenneth McGeorge, leader of the Burnley borough council, points that in discussing the towns like of Blackburn, Burnley and Preston are parts of overlapping travel-to-work areas. He says: 'People come to work here in Burnley from Blackpool and Lancaster. We also have people commuting out to work in Preston and Warton. Any new company benefits us all.' Mr Stanley Henig, leader of the Lancaster city council, sums up: 'You need both. You need a regional organisation which is going to take a strategic overview. But the individual towns and councils must involve themselves in economic development. Only they know what the local needs are in terms of economic structure. One problem has been dissatisfaction with regional organisations in the past. But the county council does well it has the resources to promote economic development.' If there is little disagreement that both the county and the boroughs should involve themselves in economic development, there is a sharp divergence of views about the reform of local government. Both Blackburn and Burnley would like to be unitary authorities if the offer should come when the local government commission reports next July. Mr David Borrow in Preston feels no pressure to become a single tier of local government. Mr Henig in Lancaster says his council is broadly in favour of a single tier of local government; the city would probably opt for unitary status if it were offered, but he adds: 'The worst of all possible worlds would be if some of the boroughs were offered unitary status but not others. This would leave an enfeebled county council with fewer resources and less power to deal a very large area. That would be a real botch.'</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Schindler seeks to revise terms of Jardine deal SCHINDLER, the world's second biggest lifts and escalators group, is seeking substantial revisions to the terms of its joint ventures with Jardine Pacific of Hong Kong for serving far eastern markets. Mr Bruno Donni, chief executive of Schindler's lift and escalator division, said the terms of the joint ventures, set up in 1974 and 1980, now appeared unfair to the Swiss group, and it was determined to change them this year. 'Our target is to take over the companies for ourselves, but we are open to leave a minority position for Jardine,' he said. Mr Donni said Jardine was not eager for change, but Schindler was trying to explain its position. Jardine has a 60 per cent stake in Jardine-Schindler, which sells and services Schindler products in Korea, Taiwan and countries in the Asean trade grouping. It also has minor stakes in Schindler ventures in China. Annual sales of these companies are about SFr300m (Pounds 115m).</p>

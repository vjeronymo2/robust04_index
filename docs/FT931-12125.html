			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Microsoft to cut some European prices MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, will make its European pricing more consistent by lowering the prices of some of its PC applications programs in certain countries. The price changes 'will have no material effect on overall sales revenues,' said Mr Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe. However, prices will fall by 10 to 21 per cent in France, Germany and the Benelux region. Microsoft also announced a distribution and software licensing programme aimed at boosting its sales to large multinational companies and organisations. Microsoft is setting the stage for an ambitious effort to move beyond its stronghold in the PC software market. It is expected to introduce a new program, Windows NT, that will control the functions of entire networks of computers. Sun Microsystems, the US computer workstation manufacturer, reported a steep decline in second quarter earnings as shortages of a new microprocessor chip limited sales of the highest performance version of its new product line. Net income was Dollars 34.3m, or 33 cents a share, down 28 per cent from Dollars 47.4m, or 47 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.05bn from Dollars 909m. Sun said the chip supply problem had eased, enabling it to ship the new high performance workstation in greater volume.</p>

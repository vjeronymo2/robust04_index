			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / More does not mean merrier: Why the EU enlargement row has spread into a dispute over the power balance in Europe The smart money is on a deal. But whatever the outcome of tomorrow's emergency foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, the latest crisis over enlargement of the European Union seems certain to have far-reaching repercussions. Much more than a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian fish is at stake. Either through miscalculation or as a matter of principle, the UK has forced its EU partners to confront the one issue which most would prefer to ignore: the distribution of power in an expanded Union. The resulting clash has pushed the enlargement talks to the brink of collapse. Britain, and to a lesser extent Spain, stand accused of breaking the pledge of the twelve to wrap up negotiations by early March so that Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway can enter the Union by January 1 1995. The row has exposed the faultlines in the Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between a rich north and a poorer south; between big and small member states; between sovereignty-conscious countries such as the UK, which hankers for a looser Union based on inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists such as Belgium and the Netherlands which want faster integration and streamlined decision-making. Diplomats in Brussels remain baffled at the readiness of Mr John Major's government to risk sacrificing enlargement, a policy which seemed central to its aim of a wider Union. 'The British are playing politics at any price,' said one German official, 'but this is a very dangerous game.' There has always been a paradoxical element in plans to expand the Union. Increasing the number of member states will, at some point, require a reform of collective decision-making. Without such an overhaul, the Union risks grinding to a halt, says Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and the senior British commissioner in Brussels. Yet the basic cogs in the EU's machine have remained unchanged for 35 years, in spite of a doubling of member states from six to 12. The number of commissioners and official languages has crept up to 17 and nine respectively, though some are visibly underemployed. Above all, the EU still runs by a 'weighted voting' system, whereby the voice of the bigger countries is reduced so as not to drown smaller neighbours. At the Lisbon summit in June 1992, the 12 agreed that it was more important to press ahead with enlargement than tinker with the institutional balance of the Union. Leaders concluded that it was better to delay reforms until the next batch of entrants, the central and east Europeans, Malta and possibly Cyprus. At this point, it was agreed, reform of decision-making in a union of 20-plus countries would become irresistible. Crucially, the Lisbon summit understanding maintained the principle of the 'blocking minority', whereby a member state mustering sufficient support can thwart the legislative intentions of its partners. Until the latest British and Spanish interventions, it had been assumed that the number of votes required to form a blocking minority would rise slightly to take account of the four new members. Thus the current proposal is to increase the present 23 votes out of a total of 76, to 27 votes out of an expanded total of 90. The compromise maintains the proportion needed for a blocking minority at roughly 30 per cent; but it has two big drawbacks: First, the increase from 23 to 27 further distorts the relationship between a country's voting strength and population. It would mean that a combination of smaller states could technically outvote large states representing 40 per cent of the population of the Union. 'This raises an important democratic principle,' says a UK diplomat. Second, the end of the 23-vote threshold would mean that two large countries and one small country could no longer join forces to block measures. Spain, fearful that enlargement will tilt the political gravity of the Union to the north, wants to preserve the 23-vote threshold on core Mediterranean issues such as agriculture. British officials argue, too, that the power-sharing dispute is about vital national interests. A recent survey of Whitehall departments, says one UK official, suggested 'there was greater advantage in forming a blocking minority rather than forming a qualified majority (needed to push decisions through)'. Where do the British believe they are most at risk in being outvoted? One answer is trade policy, where the UK has traditionally led a blocking minority of free-traders including Germany, the Netherlands and sometimes Denmark against a protectionist camp led by France and Spain. Yet the line-up on such issues is far from clear: Germany wobbled during last year's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations to appease the French government over protection for agriculture; but the entry of the Scandinavians ought technically to strengthen the free-trading club in the Union. Other British arguments on the blocking minority risk sounding defeatist. Officials fret about the threat of being outmanoeuvred on social policy. But this suggests that the much-vaunted opt-out of the social charter which Mr Major secured during the Maastricht negotiations, may not be as effective as first thought. It underlines, too, how the prime minister's vulnerability at home is affecting British negotiating tactics in Brussels. UK officials confirm there was a 'political calculation' in London that a change in the blocking minority could provoke a revolt by Tory Euro-sceptics. There were worries about a split in the party ahead of the European parliamentary elections in June in which the Conservatives are expected to suffer heavy losses, possibly provoking a leadership challenge to Mr Major in the autumn. Yet diplomats agree that Britain's stand on the blocking minority may have the perverse effect of arousing the Tory right: an arcane Euro-squabble has been elevated into a cause celebre, making a climb-down this week or next harder than it might have been. Virtually none of these arguments impress Britain's European partners. Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands are upset that the UK seems oblivious to the risk that the European parliament will block the enlargement agreements if the voting weights are not adjusted. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is said to be crestfallen at Mr Major's equivocation on enlargement. German officials complain that the Chancellor has had no reward for standing by Mr Major during ratification of the Maastricht treaty, or for agreeing in 1992 to extend the British budgetary rebate to 1999, a concession worth almost Pounds 2bn a year. German nervousness is compounded by Britain's argument that voting weights need to take greater account of the size of population. The logic points to Germany, with 80m people, moving up from 10 to 15 votes; but this would end the voting parity between France and Germany, undermining the Franco-German partnership which in the post war period has depended on a delicate balance of political power. The more conspiratorially-minded believe weakening the Paris-Bonn axis is Britain's 'great game' in Europe. French officials routinely state that the UK aim in freezing voting weights at their present level is to paralyse decision-making inside the Union and create a 'wider Europe' which is little more than a free trade area. 'Major is trying to bring back Maggie's Europe,' says one senior Brussels diplomat. None of this may be true. It is possible that the British are simply putting down a marker ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the operation of the Maastricht treaty, signalling that they intend to protect vigorously the interests of the larger member states in an expanded Union. But the risk is that if sufficient numbers of Mr Major's EU partners believe the opposite, they may well be tempted to move faster toward integration. He would then face the choice he is desperate to avoid: splitting his Tory party or swimming with the continental tide.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Explaura Explaura Holdings, the USM-quoted dolomite and limestone quarry group, was still looking for a strategic partner, Mr Robin Finch, the chairman, told the annual meeting. Shareholders were reminded that Explaura was progressing only with the forbearance of its main creditor, Royal Bank of Canada, which had received no interest payments for a 'considerable period'. When the current management took control it began building up the business prior to looking for a strategic partner. Negotiations were taking place with three big companies which are interested in a joint venture, the chairman added. Mr Finch also announced the resignation 'for personal reasons' of Mr Rick Sandri, a director nominated by Inco.</p>

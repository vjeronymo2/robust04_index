			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> Woo has got it right; his proposal to limit campaign contributions will do much  to correct the scandalous conditions arising out of campaign contributions.  </P> <P> My only complaint is that the provisions of his measure could be more  stringent. And it ought to be, at least, a statewide initiative.  </P> <P> The voter, not special interests, should be calling the tune. It follows that  the voter should pay the piper.  </P> <P> STANLEY HART  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

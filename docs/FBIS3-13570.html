The source said that the detainees include 8th Division  Commander Staff Brigadier General Salah al-Juburi and a number  of middle-ranking officers and retired officers.    A system for the control of retired officers has enabled the  Iraqi Government to impose a procedure on them under which they  have to report daily and sign the registers at military  industrialization offices and Olympic Committee offices where  they have to appear nominally for work every day, and under  which they are not allowed to leave Baghdad or Iraq. This  system is supervised by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, son of the Iraqi  president, a responsibility previously shared with him by Husayn  Kamil al-Majid, who has been forced by illness to stay home.    Meanwhile, a state of alert continues for the fifth day at  the entrances to and in the main streets of the capital where  cars are searched and the identities of passengers and  pedestrians are checked.</p>

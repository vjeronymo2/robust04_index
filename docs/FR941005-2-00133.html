(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to amend the Phlx's Options Floor Procedure Advice (``OFPA'') F&hyph;7 relating to firm quotes for customer and broker-dealer orders. On September 27, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposal to eliminate a reference to public customers in OFPA F&hyph;7 and to replace a reference to its Ten-up rule (``ten-up'' rule) with the actual Options Floor Procedure Advice section (``OFPA A&hyph;11'') governing minimum volume guarantees. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated September 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30134 (Dec. 31, 1991), 57 FR 730 (Jan. 8, 1992). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OFPA F&hyph;7 currently states that bid and offer prices shall be general ones and shall not be specified for acceptance by particular members. The proposed amendment modifies OFPA F&hyph;7 to reflect the development of different execution guarantees depending on the status of the order to be executed. Under Phlx Rule 1033(a), the current ``ten-up'' rule, public customer orders are afforded a ten-up guarantee on the Exchange, receiving an execution of up to ten contracts at the best market price regardless of whether size was quoted. Broker-dealer orders do not qualify for the ten-up guarantee. Accordingly, the stated purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit floor traders to provide greater bid and/or offer sizes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  more than 10 contract guarantee) to facilitate customer orders while not being under such obligation with respect to broker-dealer orders, unless specified. However, the proposed amendment to OFPA F&hyph;7 requires that quote sizes be maintained equally for all orders of the same account type. Therefore, if a specialist elects to give a size of twenty-up to one-broker-dealer, he must honor the size of twenty-up for all broker-dealer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In approving the Phlx's ``ten-up'' in rule in June 1987, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  the Commission found that it was designed to benefit public customers by increasing the size of orders for which they can be assured executions to a minimum depth of ten contracts at the best bid or offer as quoted by a specialist or Registered Options Trader (``ROT''). Although the Commission carefully scrutinizes discriminatory order execution practices, limiting the ``ten-up'' rule for public customers furthers the purposes of the Act. The intent of the ``ten-up'' rule is to encourage options specialists and ROTs to become more competitive in making markets, thereby contributing to a more free and open market. Because the ``ten-up'' rule was designed by the options exchanges for the benefit of public customers, however, the incentive for market makers and ROTs to benefit public customers through the ``ten-up'' rule is contingent on the assurance that these market makers volume guarantees will not be exhausted by competitors to the detriment of public customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24580 (June 11, 1987), 52 FR 23120. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

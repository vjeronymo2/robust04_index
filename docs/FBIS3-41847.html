			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 28 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata pledged Tuesday (28 December) to monitor the reported  outflow of Japanese high technology and an estimated 200 billion  yen annually in remittances from Korean residents in Japan to  North Korea.    ``I am determined to watch these reported outflows,'' Hata  told a luncheon meeting at the Japan National Press Club.    Hata said he is concerned about statements by a North Korean  defector that the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongryun) has systematically shipped  high-technology products to North Korea.    Lim Song son, a first lieutenant in the North Korean  People's  Army, defected to South Korea in August.    He told a Japanese think tank in November that Chongryun has  circumvented Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export  Control (COCOM) regulations by clandestinely shipping  military-related communications equipment, computer microchips  and other high-tech products to Pyongyang.    Hata said he has been informed by government officials that  the cabinet information research office estimated the annual  outflow of money from Japan to North Korea at 200 billion yen.    The estimate apparently includes Chongryun's banking  remittances to the North Korean Government, cash gifts from  Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in North Korea and  the value of various manufacturing plant-related investment,  according to Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korean  Institute.    Hata said, however, that the government faces difficulties  in  obtaining accurate data about the remittances and in confirming  the alleged COCOM violations by Chongryun.    He ruled out applying an immediate economic sanctions to  halt  the alleged shipments.    Japan will not take the initiative of imposing economic  sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council adopts a  resolution calling for sanctions, he said.    North Korea could ``erupt violently'' if Japan put pressure  on Pyongyang, he said.    Hata stressed that Japan and Asian countries need the  presence of U.S. troops on Japanese soil as there are still  ``some countries armed with nuclear weapons'' in this area of  the world.    ``We would face trouble if a vacuum was created in Asia  following the withdrawal of U.S. Troops,'' he said.    ``My ideas are not very different from those of Liberal  Democratic Party President Yohei Kono,'' who recently voiced  concern about a possible negative security impact following the  withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the Philippines.</p>

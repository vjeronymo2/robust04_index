			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Travel: A horse and cart journey through old Transylvania - Nick Haslam eats goats' cheese and listens to fireside tales in the Carpathian mountains FIFTY YEARS ago, Romania was known as the little Switzerland of the Balkans. Standing high in the Carpathians on the fringes of Transylvania, looking down on to Lake Bicaz, it was easy to see why. Towering 2,000-metre peaks folded into a blue distant horizon; below, the lake snaked indigo through dark green pines. We were a small group of five, travelling through the high wooded valleys of Transylvania by horse and cart or minibus and staying overnight in peasant houses. Our Romanian guides, Mirca and Marius, had long dreamt of having their own business, and we were the first group to pioneer their new green tourism. We spent the first two days visiting Orthodox monasteries on the borders of Moldova. With white painted walls, and cloisters lined with flowers, they lay in clearings at the end of unmade roads like hidden jewels. It seemed the perfect way to arrive by horse and cart after three hours of silent trotting over pine needles through the woods. At one small 16th century timber church, a bearded monk in black showed us a medieval wall painting of the devil, a fearsome figure that stared from a hidden alcove in the narrow apse. The church was, he proudly assured us, wired for theft, and proceeded to demonstrate by lifting an icon from the wall to reveal the hidden alarm. It had been fitted by the security forces during the Ceausescu era, he said, but then added that the church had been robbed of its most precious artefact a year before, during a power cut. Our route during the 10 days lay along the 'Border of a Thousand Years', the former frontier of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On the fourth day we climbed one of the high peaks, Mount Ocolusul Mare, and were admiring the view from the summit when a sudden summer storm engulfed the hillside. We scrambled for cover in a barn standing above steep pasture. Pebble-sized hailstones clattered on to the roof and we found that we were not alone. Propped on their scythes, a group of hay-cutters regarded us with some curiousity. With Mirca as translator, I told them how beautiful I thought the country was. This brought a slight ripple of mirth, and one of them said something in Hungarian. 'Yes, it is beautiful', translated Mirca, 'but she says that town life is much more beautiful, for you don't have to work so hard and that Hungary is far away.' Nearly 2m Hungarians, Europe's largest ethnic minority, still live in Transylvania, ceded to Romania in 1921. The villages of high Transylvania are living museums to a peasant existence that disappeared over 50 years ago in western Europe. Black timber houses surrounded by barns and lush paddocks run along the simple unmade roads, punctuated by groups of ducks and a sleeping pig. At night, the silence is absolute, save for the occasional jingle and clatter of a passing horse and cart. Few cars or lorries come this far; electricity is a long-awaited luxury. Each night we stayed in a different village along our route, eating copious meals by oil light, and talking with our hosts, some of whom had never met westerners before. They told us that life was getting better now that the old regime had gone, but that coping with privatisation was a problem. Previously, large co-operatives had supplied tractors to work the land, but now farmers were forced to plough with horses; the cost of a day's tractor hire (about Pounds 40) was equivalent to one month's salary for a farm labourer. Their hospitality was extraordinary. We feasted on chicken and polenta, or pork washed down with tuica, a strong spirit distilled from plums or apricots. Towards the end of the trip we camped one night high in the mountains. Mirca, a veteran boy scout, wanted us to experience the true solitude of the Carpathians. A cold wind blew down from the tops, and we lit a blazing fire of pine branches. Attracted by the flames, a herdsman came to join us, bringing some fresh goat cheese and a bottle of tuica. He told us that he lived in the mountains throughout the summer, tending his cattle on the high pasture. He had, he said, lost a cow the night before and Marius looked uneasy as he translated that it had been eaten by a bear. The herdsman told us that this area had been one of Ceausescu's favourite hunting spots. Hunters would locate the largest bear and feed it regularly at the same spot within metres of a specially-built hunting hide. The Great Leader, a notoriously bad shot, would arrive 30 minutes before feeding time by helicopter, blast the bear at close range from the security of the hide, pose for a photograph and then disappear back to Bucharest. However, on one occasion, the bear failed to arrive on time. A trembling Securitate man, fearing for his life, had located a travelling circus nearby and borrowed its performing bear, which he released within smelling distance of the bait. Miraculously surviving the fusillade from the hide, the bear took cover. The herdsman paused and then said with a twinkle: 'Do you know what happened next? It leapt on to the Securitate man's bike and pedalled for its life.' We all laughed, but I noticed that night that the food was carefully placed a long distance from the tents. On our last day we boarded the train at the old Saxon town of Brasov, and travelled down to Bucharest, leaving the mountains for the simmering heat of the plains. The train stopped at a village, and there was a knock soon after at the compartment door. An astonishingly beautiful gipsy girl held out a basket brimming with small paper cones of freshly-picked raspberries. As I bought some her chestnut hair fell forward, carrying a strong aura of woodsmoke. It was only with the greatest of difficulty that I stopped myself from sweeping her off her feet, abandoning the train and hijacking the nearest cart to return to the mountains.

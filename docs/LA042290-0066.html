			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Shirley and Boyd Brewster have a big family: 10 children and 10 grandchildren  -- and 250 tenants in the senior citizen apartment complex that the Brewsters  manage in Inglewood.  </P> <P> The Brewsters are on call 24 hours a day at Inglewood Meadows Apartments,  listening to tenants' concerns, lobbying for increased services and, throughout  it all, treating residents like family.  </P> <P> The couple's personal touch has won them an award as the national apartment  managers of the year by the Assn. of Housing and Urban Development Management  Agents. They will be honored at a luncheon Monday.  </P> <P> In nominating the couple, the Brewsters' boss, Philip Sutherland, wrote, "One  of the greatest needs of seniors is to be loved and cared about, and that Boyd  and Shirley Brewster supply in abundance."  </P> <P> The average age of their tenants is over 80. The oldest resident is 97. Most of  those in the 199-unit government-subsidized complex are on Social Security.  </P> <P> "These people have nobody in the world," Shirley Brewster said.  </P> <P> That's where she and her husband come in.  </P> <P> Boyd Brewster cooked 95 pounds of chicken and ribs for a Fourth of July  barbecue that drew nearly 100 residents, including a few who had not ventured  out of their apartments in years.  </P> <P> When Christmastime came, instead of heading off to their real family in the Bay  Area, the Brewsters decided to trim a tree in the apartment recreation room for  those who had no place else to go.  </P> <P> When the guest list grew to 80, and their vacation money ran out, the Brewsters  solicited food and gifts from local merchants and community groups. At the  party, they cooked four turkeys and three hams.  </P> <P> But tenant Amal Alexander, 80, points out that sacrificing their personal  vacations is not all the Brewsters contribute.  </P> <P> "If you have a problem they will see that that problem is taken care of," said  Alexander, president of the complex's senior citizen association. "It's never  too late to call them."  </P> <P> Shirley Brewster, known to her tenants as Dutch, is frequently on the phone  herself, lobbying whoever it takes to get services for her residents.  </P> <P> The Brewsters, who moved into Inglewood Meadows last April after numerous other  apartment manager jobs in Northern California, said the award is an honor --  but not why they do what they do.  </P> <P> A bigger thrill for Boyd Brewster came after the Fourth of July barbecue when  the cooking was done.  </P> <P> Dozens of the residents gathered together and surprised Boyd Brewster with a  round of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."

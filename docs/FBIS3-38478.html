Jordi Pujol made no change to the schedule which he is  following during his five-day official visit to Germany, on  which he is accompanied by 50 Catalan businessmen in the hope of  winning new investments in that community. In the meantime, the  Catalan cabinet had a normal working day, with the councillors  in their offices.    Pujol took the view that the strike "is not important" in  itself, but the fact that it could lead the government to amend  the contents of the labor reform, which has had CiU's  parliamentary support, is important. According to Pujol, the  coalition will not withdraw its support from the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] even if the strike is a massive  success, but it will if the Socialist Party "gives in and  decides to change policy."    Speaking to the same effect, Miguel Roca [Democratic  Convergence of Catalonia Secretary General] Miquel Roca asserted  yesterday that "the trade unions will have to reflect," since  yesterday's strike "is not a general strike," with a  considerable impact on industry, but has had "a very modest  impact" on small and medium-sized industry, "virtually none" on  trade, and "very little" on the civil service and the services  sector.    In Roca's opinion, this uneven response and the much lesser  impact than the 14 December 1988 strike are "a sign" that the  government should "go ahead with the aims laid down in the the  field of economic and labor policy."

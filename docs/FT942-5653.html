			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obviously mistaken Sir, Although I will always believe that the government was wrong in ever setting up the National Lottery in the way it did, I do not believe I behaved badly on receiving the news. The news was received privately by a number of us. It was received with great disappointment by all of us. (We had just failed to create the largest charitable foundation in Europe - much needed by small charities all over the UK.) However, there were no angry outbursts. No ripping up of faxes. There were also no photographers. An hour later the popular press asked for a couple of staged shots. Having read Lucy Kellaway's diary piece (Management, May 30), I was obviously mistaken in agreeing to their suggestion. I should have known better. Richard Branson, chairman, Virgin Group of Companies, 120 Camden Hill Road, London W8 7AR</p>

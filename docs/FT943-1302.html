			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Where waves crash and otters frolic - On Safari Far below me among the grey, wave-worn rocks of the inhospitable shore were the tiny white forms of young seals. They appeared lifeless: their puny bodies must surely have been shattered by the tumultuous ocean as it beat upon the island and flung them among the hard stones. However, through binoculars I could see an occasional movement. I also spotted several of the rocks shifting, too, for some of the 'rocks' were adult grey seals. They had come to give birth on this nursery beach and now some of the mothers were suckling pups. Giving birth in the grey seal world is closely followed by mating, for it is the one time in the year that bulls can find groups of cows gathered together. From my cliff-top vantage point I had an excellent view of the action as males skirmished with males, bulls pursued cows and mothers protected pups. These dramas were unfolding in the Shetland Isles, the archipelago of about 100 islands which makes up the most northerly point of Britain. As close to Bergen in Norway as to Aberdeen. The Shetlands are inhabited by a people whose musical tongue seems to owe as much to Norwegian as it does to English and who are the first to acknowledge their strong links with Scandinavia. Including Mainland, there are five notable islands in this wind-swept but mild northern outpost, and each appears to have a wildlife speciality of its own. The northernmost island is Unst. The Burra Firth forms a deep cleft in its north coast and on one side of this fjord is Hermaness national nature reserve, the spring-time breeding site for thousands of sea birds. Of these, the most sensational are the gannets: goose-sized birds which fish by plunging into the ocean from a considerable height. I watched them hunting for over an hour as bird after bird folded its wings back against its body and plummeted like an arrow deep into the water. Both great and arctic skuas nest here, too. Unmerciful pirates, they will harry the other birds until they disgorge the fish they have caught. Fetlar is the smallest of the main islands. With fewer than 100 people, it struggles constantly to maintain its human population, though matters are reversed in the summer when bird-watchers arrive because of two rare visitors. Beautiful snowy owls nested here for a number of years until 1975. The females of these white, amber-eyed birds still return each summer, though sadly not to breed. Seventy per cent of the British population of red-necked phalaropes, a small swimming wader, breed on Fetlar. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has a large reserve and a public viewing hide. Yell, with its high heather moorland and convoluted shoreline, is reputedly the otter island of Shetland, although I caught sight of otters on all the islands apart from Fair Isle. Shetland is home to around 1,000 otters - one of the densest populations in western Europe. Otters turn up in the sheltered voes or fjords around Yell's coast. I watched one animal playing exuberantly in the wake of my ferry. Those who are patient should have good views of these lovely mammals as they swim and dive or feed along the shore. Mainland is the largest of the islands. Its southern-most point hit the headlines in January 1993 when the oil tanker MV Braer went aground releasing 84,000 tonnes of crude into the sea. The effect on Shetland and its wildlife appears to have been slight, and there are still big sea-bird colonies on the cliffs of Sumburgh Head. Much of Shetland's coastline consists of dramatic cliffs, some of the finest are on the west coast at Westerwick. These are good spots to watch for cetaceans. Killer and pilot whales have been seen from here and several species of dolphin occur around Shetland. It is said that the Good Shepherd, Fair Isle's boat, encounters dolphins on almost half its summer voyages. Spring and early summer are the best times to catch the large colonies of nesting sea birds but autumn can be good for other reasons. It is the time when migrants, flying south from the Arctic Circle, pass through. October is when grey seals pup and mate and there is much seal activity in many hidden coves and caves.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French jurist (Jean Marc Vareau) by Eldad </F> Beck in Paris; date not given -- recorded, in French with Hebrew  subtitles; translated from the Hebrew]    [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat has launched an effort to  arrange the drafting of a Palestinian constitution. The Channel  2 news department has learned that to that end, he conveyed a  draft document for the perusal of a French lawyer. According to  the document, Jerusalem is the capital of an independent  Palestine. Our Paris-based correspondent Eldad Beck heard the  details of the constitution from the French jurist:    [Begin recording] [(Vareau)] He assured me that he would  honor human rights; that the provisional constitution would  ensure the separation of powers, the independence of legal  institutions; that it will not be an Islamic state; that there  would be genuine equality between men and women, between Muslims  and non-Muslims; that Christians and Israelis would enjoy  freedom of worship and education. At that point, to prove to me  that it would be a state of law, he handed me something that had  just been prepared -- a proposal for a transitional constitution  to be used before the state is fully sovereign.    [Beck] Then 'Arafat plainly told you that this text would be  the Palestinian state's constitution?    [(Vareau)] We agreed that since they have physical authority  over a defined territory, since they rightfully control a  legitimate police force, and since they have the right to pass  their own laws, they are practically a sovereign state. That  text plainly indicates that Jerusalem is the capital of  Palestine, but the Palestinian government that will be elected,  that will be appointed before parliament is convened, will be  able to decide on a capital in another location in Palestine.  Thus Jerusalem will be a constitutional demand, while the  actual capital will be either Gaza or Jericho. [end recording]    [An announcer-read report later in the newscast adds: "In  reaction to the report about 'Arafat's plan to draft a  constitution for the Palestinian state, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin said a few minutes ago: `It is all talk, just like the  radio program.'"]</p>

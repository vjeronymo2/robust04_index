			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities steady despite weaker bond market Wall Street Although the dollar plunged again on foreign exchange markets yesterday, US share prices held their own in the face of the rapidly declining US currency and a weaker bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.15 at 3,702.99 well above its low for the day of 3,680.33. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 1.49 at 448.06, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished off 0.68 at 424.77 and the Nasdaq composite down 0.63 at 706.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was light at 224m shares. Stock prices took their cue from the bond market in early trading. After firming slightly at the opening, stocks soon retreated as bonds posted modest losses. The quarter-point decline in the benchmark 30-year bond was sparked by higher commodities prices and further declines in the dollar. By late afternoon the US currency was down at a new post-1945 low against the Yen of Y97.65, and below the DM1.53 against the D-mark for the first time since November, 1992. The fall in the dollar unsettled bonds because fixed-income investors feared it would persuade the Federal Reserve that interest rates would have to go up to protect the ailing currency. The drop in bonds, however, was not especially disturbing, and the resilience of fixed-income investors appeared to buoy stock market sentiment. Both bonds and stocks were helped by the opinion of analysts that Fed would not make a decision on whether to tighten monetary policy until after the release of the June inflation figures today and tomorrow. Among individual stocks, McKesson was the star of the show, soaring Dollars 24 1/2 , or 33 per cent, to Dollars 97 5/8 in volume of 3.2m shares after drugs group Eli Lilly agreed to buy McKesson's retail drug distribution subsidiary, PCS Health, for Dollars 4bn in cash. The news, however, was not so well received by Eli Lilly shareholders: the company's stock dropped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 50. Caterpillar continued to be the stock of choice among cyclically-minded investors. Cyclical stocks have been strong recently as buyers anticipated improved earnings in the wake of the growing economy, but none has benefited more than Caterpillar, which yesterday firmed another Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 107 3/8 . Dow Jones dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 in busy trading after the financial publishing group announced second quarter net income of 46 cents a share, up from 40 cents a share a year earlier but below the consensus of analysts' forecasts. On the Nasdaq market, Gaming Corporation of America, a Nasdaq-quoted stock, dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 2 5/8 after the company was denied a renewal of its licence by the Wisconsin Winnebago gaming commission. Canada Toronto prices ended mixed in moderate trading, despite higher gold stocks. The TSE-300 composite index added 5.04 points, or 0.12 per cent, to close at 4,103.94, although losing issues led winners by 394 to 325. Volume of 42.06m shares was down from 45.82m last Friday, and trading value was CDollars 515.5m compared with CDollars 567.5m. Northern Telecom was downgraded to intermediate-term neutral from above average by Merrill Lynch. The company also announced a Dollars 100m cellular system contract in Taiwan. The stock fell 3/8 to 40 7/8.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 15/4/1994 -- Russia reduced  the volume of natural gas supply for Moldova by 30 percent  beginning on the afternoon of 14 April, told BASAPRESS Ion Grau,  vice-director of the State Gas Department. The cause was  Moldova's failure to pay the Russian "Gazprom" organization  debts amounting to 150 billion Russian rubles, specified the  quoted source. Ion Grau said that in order to economize  supplies the pressure in the gas pipelines is to be reduced.  According to Grau, many people did not pay in time for natural  gas and that is why the debts were not repaid. Natural gas  worth about $700,000 is consumed each day in Moldova, specified  Grau.</p>

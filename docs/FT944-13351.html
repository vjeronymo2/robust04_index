			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Salomon Bros in move to overhaul its pay structure Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities firm hit by heavy losses this year, is to overhaul its system for compensating top executives in an attempt to link pay more closely to performance. The firm said the changes were also intended to make it easier to run its various client-related businesses as a single global operation, and to encourage better cost management. Although the new system will only affect the firm's 125 or so highly-paid managing directors in proprietary trading and client-driven businesses - such as investment banking, securities sales and trading, and currencies - their salaries and bonuses take up a significant share of Salomon's compensation expenses. While the bankers and traders in these core areas tend to be well-paid whatever the circumstances, the revenues they generate can be volatile. This often leaves the firm with a large wage bill, even when earnings are poor - as has been the case this year, when Salomon in its first nine months lost Dollars 547m on proprietary trading and other businesses. With the new pay structure, Salomon's compensation expenses should move more in line with performance. Under the system, which will be introduced next year, managing directors in the firm's client-driven businesses will receive a fixed minimum salary equal to 35 per cent of this year's pay, plus 40 per cent of the earnings their business generates in excess of an after-tax return to shareholders. That return will initially be 7 per cent of equity capital, and will rise to 10 per cent over a two-year period. Managing directors in Salomon's proprietary trading business, meanwhile, will be paid from pooled deferred compensation accounts which accumulate pay over a multi-year period. This could mean that traders may see their pay from a good year subsequently reduced by losses incurred in a later, bad year.</p>

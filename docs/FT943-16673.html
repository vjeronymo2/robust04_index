			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / British government rejects call for Hong Kong human-rights commission The British government yesterday rejected recommendations by an all-party parliamentary committee in London for an independent human-rights commission in Hong Kong, writes Our Foreign Staff. The rejection was part of a reply to a report on Hong Kong by the foreign affairs committee, which prompted an angry reaction in Beijing because of its outspoken comments on Tibet and Taiwan. The British decision confirmed the view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, that existing legal arrangements, including a forthcoming Equal Opportunities Bill, are adequate to protect human rights. The UK government also told the committee that it was deeply concerned about human rights abuses through China, including Tibet, but it did not think it would help the Tibetans for London to try opening discussions on the region's future. 'Any lasting solution can be found only through dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetans without preconditions,' the report said, adding that London urged all parties to begin this process without delay.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference held at the Environment Ministry </F> in Kiev on 3 March, by Edvard Kotenko -- passage within  quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Ukrainian Environment Minister Yuriy Kostenko  invited journalists for a briefing on the results of his  official visits to the Netherlands and the United States. The  minister was commissioned to visit Haag by the Ukrainian Cabinet  of Ministers. In Haag, a memorandum on mutual understanding  regarding ecological cooperation was signed. Precisely how can  the Netherlands help Ukraine? Although it is a small country,  it has much experience in resolving ecological problems. The  following was said on this topic by Yuriy Kostenko:    Kostenko: "During the negotiations, emphasis was  put on practical activities that are possible given the current  situation in Ukraine. An entire range of concrete topics was  proposed. First of all, there is ecological management and  planning, protection of air, water resources, and protection of  nature. Regarding practical implementation of these issues, we  agreed to work out so-called pilot or demonstrative projects in  each of these areas, meaning projects that could be financed and  implemented in Ukraine. Based on these projects, we will be  able to teach our specialists and pressure the appropriate  authorities, to expand this experience to other territories.  What does it mean? For example, regarding the quality of  drinking water, we have requested that they help us work out an  appropriate project and establish laboratories to control the  quality of drinking water. This can be done with the help of  money allocated by the Dutch Government. I expect that concrete  results of the signing of this agreement will be visible this  year."    The second part of the news conference was devoted to Yuriy  Kostenko's visit to the United States at the invitation of the  Environmental Protection Agency. The minister briefed  journalists on meetings with his U.S. colleagues,  representatives of the World Bank, the Agency for International  Development, and the Energy Department, as well as congressmen.  As was emphasized, U.S. state departments expressed their  interest in cooperating with Ukraine in the area of ecology,  particularly, in establishing modern laboratories, conducting  radiological monitoring, controlling the quality of water,  reprocessing toxic waste, broadcasting ecological- educational  television and radio programs, and developing an information and  education center similar to the Kiev-Mohylanska Academy. The  U.S. side is planning to allocate $6 million to these modest  but, as we expect, fruitful projects.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Tube line extension set for go-ahead THE government will on Friday give the formal go-ahead for the construction of the Pounds 1.7bn extension of the Underground's Jubilee Line to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, Robert Peston writes. Barring last-minute hitches, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary; Sir Wilfred Newton, chairman of London Transport; and Sir Brian Unwin, president of the European Investment Bank, are planning to announce that all hurdles to the construction have been cleared. The last barrier to authorisation of the scheme is court approval for Canary Wharf, the Docklands property development, to come out of administration under UK insolvency procedures. Only if Canary Wharf comes out of administration and is reconstituted as a going concern will the project's bankers provide the Pounds 400m contribution to the costs which the government has made a condition of the extension being built. The High Court is expected to allow Canary Wharf to come out of administration on Friday.</p>

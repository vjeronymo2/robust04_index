			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Countdown to rolling settlement There are only two complete account periods left until rolling settlement - the new system of settling payment for buying and selling shares - begins on July 18. The stock exchange divides the year into account periods named by letters of the alphabet. Yesterday was the last day for dealings in account period L and a bill for the net amount for all trades conducted in the period, which began on June 6, has to be settled on June 27. This allows investors who dealt early in the account up to 15 working days to settle. Being able to settle the net amount is useful for all investors. Speculators aiming to make a profit within the same account can, if successful, make money without ever having to put up a penny. Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who deal in the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25. But from July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day - or T+10.</p>

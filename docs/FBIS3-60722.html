Kopeykin and domestic and foreign media, claiming that  americium-241, which was discovered after the Chernobyl  breakdown, is far more dangerous than cesium, strontium, and  plutonium, were the reasons behind a press conference held  recently at the Ministry for Chernobyl Issues. The reports also  indicated that measures applied after the Chernobyl catastrophe  should be reexamined, including the possibility of evacuating  certain districts of Kiev.    In the opinion of B. Prister, first deputy minister for  Chernobyl issues, who headed the press conference, as well as of  other Ukrainian specialists and scientists, the reports on the  americium threat are groundless. Studies have shown that the  volume of this element--which was discovered in 1944--does not  exceed previous readings. Compared with cesium, strontium, or  plutonium, its contribution to the radioactive pollution is  insignificant, however, whereas the radioactivity of cesium and  strontium will be gradually decreasing, the radioactivity of  americium and other elements will increase. Nevertheless,  according to our scientists, even when the maximum radiation  level of americium is reached, which will be by the year 2050,  its concentration in the Dnepr river will be so low, that this  will be an exclusively scientific problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The General Office of  the State Council, Chinese "cabinet", has issued a circular  demanding that all provincial, autonomous regional and municipal  governments as well as the leadership at the ministerial level  improve the administration of the grain market so as to keep it  stable.    The circular notes that grain is a special commodity with  strategic significance, and that the stability of the grain  market has an important bearing on the overall situation.    It says that strengthened administration of the grain market  is an important content of and a necessary measure for the  state's macro control of grain.    In order to maintain regular order in the circulation of  grain and keep the prices of grain and edible oils basically  stable, the circular says, the General Office of the State  Council has demanded that governments at all levels pay close  attention to the following six aspects:    First, they should attach great importance to the purchase  of  grain. State-owned grain enterprises should take an active part  in purchasing grain according to their purchasing quotas and the  relevant policies. Except for those given approval to purchase  grain and engage in the wholesale of grain, no other units or  individuals are allowed to purchase grain directly from the  countryside.    Second, when the enterprises engaging in grain wholesale and  grain-consuming units in grain-purchasing areas go to buy grain  in grain-production areas, they are only allowed to buy grain on  the wholesale grain markets above the county level.  Transactions outside the grain market are banned.    Third, enterprises engaging in grain wholesale should be  re-organized and re-registered. Those engaging in grain  business without licenses and those hoarding or speculating in  grain will be strictly punished.    Fourth, it is necessary to make appropriate arrangements for  the transport of grain from the grain production areas to the  purchasing areas.    Fifth, it is imperative to raise enough funds for the  purchase and transportation of grain.    Sixth, efforts should be made to set up and perfect  wholesale  grain markets in both supplying and purchasing areas. Measures  should be taken to gradually standardize, legalize and modernize  the grain and oil wholesale markets. Supervision and control of  the prices in and transactions in grain and oil in the wholesale  and free-trade markets should be strengthened.</p>

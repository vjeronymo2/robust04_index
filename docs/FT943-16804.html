			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities create burden on pensions Sir, We have seen adverse reactions, in your columns and elsewhere, to the proposal in the government's white paper that guaranteed minimum pensions for contracting out of the state earnings related pension scheme should be abolished. Some scheme members will, it is stated, be worse off. This may be true, though this depends on a number of factors, not least the definition of the minimum 'requisite benefits' which a pension scheme must provide before it can contract out. As yet these benefits have not been defined. The critical comments, however, seem to smack of all that is worst in pensions planning, namely the view that nothing should be changed unless no one can possibly be worse off. This simply fuels the inexorable rise in administrative complications - among which contracting-out rules have always ranked highly - and, ultimately, may result in employers withdrawing from pension provision altogether. Simplification in pensions legislation must be to everyone's benefit and we should applaud the government's intention to eliminate unnecessary and debilitating complications in this area, though I would urge them to go further. There is much scope for social security legislation to be cut back without in any way weakening the position of members. Practitioners and administrators would be even more pleased if this spread to the Inland Revenue, whose rules on benefit limits, etc, make the complex contracting-out rules look like child's play] N G Preston, partner, R Watson &amp; Sons, Watson House, London Road, Reigate, Surrey RH2 9PQ</p>

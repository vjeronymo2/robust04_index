			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Polls put Labour ahead in Israel: Coalition with Likud widely predicted as the likely outcome to today's election FINAL opinion polls for today's Israeli general election were unanimous yesterday in putting the opposition Labour party ahead of the ruling Likud. However they indicated a stalemate once support for small parties allied to the big two were taken into account, reinforcing widespread speculation that a Labour-Likud coalition is likely. Labour, led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a former prime minister, is desperate to overturn 15 years of Likud supremacy, replacing the uncompromising ideology of its rival with a more pragmatic approach which it promises will produce early progress in Middle East peace negotiations and restore frayed relationships with the US. Likud, under Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the 76-year-old prime minister, has been on the defensive throughout the campaign, internally divided and often giving the appearance of a political force past its prime. Three election-eve polls gave Labour a lead of between nine and 14 seats over Likud in the 120-seat Knesset. Such a gap would represent a big breakthrough for Labour, given the marginal swings usually seen in Israeli elections. It would give Mr Rabin the whip-hand in the inevitable coalition bargaining that would start tomorrow. But similar polls in previous elections turned out to be wrong. A fourth poll yesterday, based on the widest sample, put the Labour lead at only two seats. Two of the polls also predicted Likud would be able to muster a narrow majority along with small right-wing and religious parties. Labour has focused on Mr Rabin's tough image in its attempt to woo disaffected Likud supporters, who are thought to make up a large portion of the 20 per cent undecided voters. In its final television broadcasts, the party ran clips from 1976 of Menachem Begin, the great Likud hero and then leader of the opposition, warmly praising Mr Rabin, then prime minister, for ordering the successful commando rescue of a hijacked airliner at Entebbe airport in Uganda. A key to the result may lie in the 500,000 first-time voters, more than half of whom are recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and in the 390,000 Arab voters. To succeed, Labour needs to win heavily among the former, and either a big direct vote from Arabs or a strong result for the three Arab-based parties which would sup-port a Labour-led government. Altogether 25 parties are standing, encouraged to do so by the system of proportional representation in which there are no local constituencies and seats are distributed according to the proportion of national votes. However, this year the minimum needed to enter the Knesset has been raised from 1 per cent of votes cast to 1.5 per cent.</p>

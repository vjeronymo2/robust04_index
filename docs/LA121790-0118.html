			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-EAST GERMAN CHIEF RESIGNS AMID CLAIMS OF STASI TIES  </P> <P> Former East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere resigned today as minister  without portfolio in the German federal government after claims that he had  been an informer for East Germany's communist state security police.  </P> <P> De Maiziere said he will also give up his positions as vice chairman of  Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union and leader of  the CDU in the eastern state of Brandenburg.  </P> <P> Announcing his resignation at a news conference, he again rejected the  contentions he had acted for the police agency -- known as Stasi -- under the  code name "Czerny."  </P> <P> De Maiziere, East Germany's last prime minister, made the announcement after  meeting today with Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and Joachim Gauck, the  government official in charge of evaluating Stasi documents.  </P> <P> In a statement read by Schaeuble, Kohl said: "Lothar de Maiziere has earned my  complete trust and I have no reason to doubt him."  </P> <P> De Maiziere, who worked as an attorney before heading the East German  government, said he does not know whether the once-powerful Stasi kept a file  on him.  </P> <P> "My contact with the Stasi was limited to attempts to help clients. I accepted  no money and signed no statement committing myself," he said.  </P> <P> "I will resign from my post as minister for special assignments, and will not  be available for a Cabinet post in the new government," he said.  </P> <P> Kohl is to form a new government early next year, after the victory of his  center-right coalition in Dec. 2 all-German elections.  </P> <P> "The evidence in the files which could connect de Maiziere to Czerny is not  clear enough," Schaeuble said.  </P> <P> German media recently published statements by a former Stasi major, Edgar  Hasse, who alleged that since 1982, de Maiziere had reported to the agency  about church activities in East Germany and about his contacts with West German  officials.  </P> <P> The Stasi was disbanded after the collapse of East Germany's communist  government in fall, 1989. Documents released recently showed that 85,000 people  worked as full-time employees of the organization and as many as 300,000 people  acted as informers -- about one in 30 East Germans.  </P> <P> De Maiziere led the conservative CDU to victory in East Germany's first free  elections March 18, and became the first non-communist leader in the country's  40-year history.  </P> <P> Upon the Oct. 3 unification of Germany, he joined Kohl's Cabinet as a minister  without portfolio, or specific assignment.  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Official inquiry ordered into running of Credit Lyonnais The French government yester-day dismissed Mr Jean-Yves Haberer after five months as head of the Credit National banking group and announced an official inquiry into the management of Credit Lyonnais during the period when he was chairman. Mr Haberer, 61, served as chairman of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks, for five years from 1988, when he was appointed by the former Socialist government. Last November the new centre-right administration moved him to the same role at Credit National, a smaller and less prestigious institution. His move followed fierce criticism of Mr Haberer's expansionist lending and acquisition strategy at Credit Lyonnais. The criticism reached a climax last week when Mr Jean Peyrelevade, his successor, revealed the bank had made a net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 790m) last year and that the government had agreed to back a FFr44.9bn rescue which involves a FFr4.9bn cash injection and the creation of a new company to take on FFr40bn of non-performing property loans. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman, said after yesterday's cabinet meeting that ministers had decided that Mr Haberer should not be 'left in charge of another public enter-prise' given 'the depth of the losses and the magnitude of the mistakes' made at Credit Lyonnais during his chairmanship. Mr Sarkozy rebuffed criticism of the decision to move Mr Haberer to Credit National by saying ministers only realised the full extent of Credit Lyonnais's plight last week when they saw the 1993 accounts and studied Mr Peyrelevade's 'thorough analysis' of its position. The cabinet yesterday yielded to a demand from Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist French president, for a formal inquiry into Mr Haberer's management of Credit Lyonnais. Mr Haberer on Tuesday called for such an inquiry, claiming he was not solely responsible for Credit Lyonnais's problems. He said some of its difficulties were due to the actions of previous chairmen and that, in some cases, he had been acting on government 'recommendations'. Liberation, the French newspaper, earlier this week published a leaked memo sent to Mr Haberer in 1992 by Mr Michel Sapin, the former Socialist finance minister who is a member of the Bank of France's monetary policy council, expressing concern about Credit Lyonnais's condition. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, Mr Sapin's predecessor, had in 1991 warned Mr Haberer about Credit Lyonnais's involvement with a takeover bid for MGM, the US movie studio. The present government is trying to distance itself from the Credit Lyonnais affair. Observer, Page 21 Last chapter in a stormy career, Page 31</p>

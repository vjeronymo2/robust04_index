			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised trip limit modifies the document published on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 697), at paragraph IV.G.(1)(a), as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Vessel Limits in the Open-Access Fishery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Set net, hook-and-line, pot, and other exempt gear except exempted trawl gear: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rockfish. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No more than 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per month. No more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip, unless caught with a set net, in which case the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit does not apply. Rockfish means the Sebastes complex (including yellowtail rockfish), shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and thornyheads, as listed at 50 CFR 663.2. Within these limits, a vessel may not take and retain, possess or land more widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, thornyheads, DTS complex, Sebastes complex, yellowtail rockfish, or bocaccio than authorized for the limited-entry fishery. (See paragraphs B.(1), C.(2), D.(1), and E.(3).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Clarify the Provision for ``Fishing Ahead'' on the Next Limit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some confusion has arisen regarding the provision at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.A.(4), that allows a vessel that already has landed its cumulative or daily limit for a species to ``fish ahead'' on its limit for the next cumulative or daily period. Some vessels would off-load part of their catch, keeping trip limit species on board for offloading after the next legal period begins. This is not permitted because, if a vessel off-loads any fish, all fish on board count toward the limit for the current period. The definition of ``landing'' at 50 CFR 663.2 states that ``once transfer begins, all fish aboard the vessel are counted as part of the landing.'' Therefore, if a vessel off-loads any species of fish (including groundfish with no trip limits, shrimp, prawns or other nongroundfish species) while having on board a species or species group whose cumulative (or daily) limit has been reached, the fish on board will be counted toward the current period's cumulative or daily limit, which then is exceeded. Paragraph IV.A.(4) is clarified as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel which has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the limit for the next legal period so long as no fish (including but not limited to groundfish with no trip limits, shrimp, prawns or other nongroundfish species or shellfish) are landed (offloaded) until the next legal period. As stated in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.2, once offloading of any species begins, all fish aboard the vessel are counted as part of the landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Clarify the Calculation of the Sablefish Trawl Trip Limit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council originally recommended a sablefish trip limit of 25 percent of the DTS complex (Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught sablefish). This has caused some confusion. The legal limit for sablefish is difficult to determine because it is based on the total amount of legal DTS complex, including sablefish. To simplify this trip limit, NMFS is restating it in equivalent terms that are easier to calculate_25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish) is equivalent to 33.333 percent (approximately one third) of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole (i.e. the DTS complex excluding sablefish). Paragraph IV.E.(3)(b)(ii), at 59 FR 696, is restated below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trip and Size Limits <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trip limits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Coastwide, no more than 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per month. Within this 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), no more than 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) cumulative may be thornyheads, and no more than 12,000 pounds (5,443 kg) cumulative may be trawl-caught sablefish. In any landing of the DTS complex, the trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish is 1,000 pounds (454 kg), or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater. In any landing, no more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of sablefish may be smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  33.333 percent of thornyheads and Dover sole (the DTS complex excluding sablefish) is equivalent to 25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish). As stated in paragraph A.(6), at 59 FR 695, percentages are based on round weights, and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

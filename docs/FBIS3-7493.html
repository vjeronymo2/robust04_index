The move reflects the automobile industry's effort to play a  part in bridging the gap between Japan and the United States in  their bilateral "framework" trade talks.    Honda Motor said it will locally procure U.S.-made auto  parts  worth 4.65 billion dollars for fiscal 1995, up 6 percent from  its fiscal 1994 plan it set in 1992. The company will also  import auto parts worth 540 million dollars, most of which is  seen to be from the U.S.    Mazda Motor said it will purchase 2.25 billion dollars worth  of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal 1997, procuring 1.9 billion  dollars worth locally. Of the 870 million dollars worth of auto  parts the company plans to import worldwide, about 40 percent is  seen to be from the U.S., the company said.    Mazda also said it will boost sales of cars imported from  Ford Motor Co. of the U.S.</p>

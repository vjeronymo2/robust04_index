			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Evidence on opt-out schools uncertain THE FIRST report by the school inspectors into schools which have opted out of local authority control in England and Wales has found no conclusive evidence that they have raised educational standards. Overall standards in grant-maintained schools were slightly higher than in those which remained under local education authority control. The standards were judged to be satisfactory or better in 3 per cent more of the lessons in grant-maintained schools than in local-authority schools. But if selective schools in the two sectors are compared, the local-authority schools had slightly higher standards. Only among non-selective schools did grant-maintained schools achieve higher standards. The report covers 81 of the first 143 schools to opt out - mainly secondary schools. The inspectors say they found no significant difference in the quality of the teaching between the two sectors. The grant-maintained schools have adapted well to their new framework, the inspectors say. They have taken advantage of enhanced funding and greater flexibility in budgeting to increase staffing, pay teachers extra and improve buildings. The report came as Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted in the Commons that the movement towards grant-maintained schools would be 'absolutely irreversible' by the next general election. The proportion of secondary schools which had voted to become grant-maintained would increase rapidly from the present level of 15 per cent, he said. It was important that parents were given clear information about the pros and cons of moving to grant-maintained status. Grant-maintained Schools 1989-92. HMSO. Pounds 3.50.</p>

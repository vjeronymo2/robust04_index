			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> PAY RAISES OF 10% TO 17% PROPOSED FOR TOP OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Reviewing the thorny issue of pay raises for the city's top officials, a Long  Beach City Council committee has recommended salary increases ranging from 10%  to 17% for the city manager, city attorney, city prosecutor, city auditor and  city clerk.  </P> <P> The proposed salary increases, which must be voted on by the full council, are  smaller than those suggested by a private consultant hired to review the  officials' salaries. But committee members argued that the Hay Group's  recommendations were too heavily influenced by comparisons with private  corporate salaries.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, all but the city manager's salary would jump between 10%  and 17% both this year and next. The city manager, who has the highest salary,  would get 11% more this year and an undecided raise next year.  </P> <P> Currently, the city manager earns $118,200, the city attorney $99,800, the city  prosecutor $92,000, the city auditor $84,400, and the city clerk $52,700.  </P></p>

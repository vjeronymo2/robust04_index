Islam is also  portrayed as an intolerant and its followers as fanatics craving  for war. He said the Western media frequently resorted to  tactics of generalization and simplification to portray Islam's  image by claiming that the Islamic movements in Algeria and  Afghanistan, for instance, were also prevalent in other  countries. All these were described as that of Islamic  fundamentalists. The Western media went to the extent of  describing the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria  in 1992 as the victory of totalitarianism of democracy.    Datuk Sri Najib said Islamic leaders are often associated  with a negative image even if they had achieved economic  excellence for the benefit of their people. He made these  remarks at the forum on current challenges in the Islamic world  and the role of Malaysia, organized by the Malaysian Strategic  Research Center in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

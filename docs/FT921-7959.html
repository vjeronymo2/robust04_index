			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Canadians to lobby for non-tariff barriers A DELEGATION of Canadian cabinet ministers and farm leaders arrives in Europe today, hoping to win sympathy for the non-tariff barriers which protect Canadian poultry and dairy farmers. These barriers are threatened by the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Ottawa recognises that, except for Japan and South Korea, its supply-management system has little backing in Gatt. But vigorous lobbying by farmers has forced the government to put on a display of opposition to the Uruguay Round proposals, which would replace import and production quotas with tariffs. Mr Michael Wilson, trade minister, who is leading the group to various EC capitals and Geneva, told parliament Ottawa would defy Gatt's early-March deadline for tabling its final negotiating offers on supply-managed products, including milk, eggs, butter, cheese and chickens. Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, told farmers earlier this week that 'marketing boards are unique, they work, and why should we give them up?' He promised to 'fight day and night non-stop on behalf of the boards'. Thousands of dairy and poultry farmers are expected to demonstrate in Ottawa tomorrow in support of continued protection. The dairy industry has mounted a newspaper advertising campaign to win public support. The supply-management system has put Ottawa on a political tightrope in the Uruguay Round. It has strained Canada's relations with other members of the Cairns group of food-exporting countries which are seeking elimination of non-tariff barriers. The government has also faced the dilemma of balancing demands of dairy and poultry farmers for protection with the drive by hard-pressed grain farmers for liberalised trade in farm products.</p>

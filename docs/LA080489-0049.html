			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The House ignored a veto threat by President Bush and voted to ease  restrictions on public financing of abortions in the District of Columbia,  halting nine straight years of House votes tightening control over government  abortion aid. The 238-189 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where its fate  is uncertain. The legislation is the first containing abortion language that  Congress has considered since the Supreme Court granted states the rights to  impose new limitations on abortion last month. Currently, public assistance is  available in the district only when the mother's life is threatened.  </P></p>

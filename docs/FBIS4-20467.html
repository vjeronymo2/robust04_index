			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deng Xianchun [6772 6343 2504]: ``Sichuan </F> University Develops Multi-Ion-Beam Reactive Co-Sputtering  Apparatus'']    [Summary] The multi-ion-beam reactive co-sputtering  apparatus and thin-film fabrication technology developed as a  State 863 Plan key project by Sichuan University's Department of  Materials Science and Institute of Nuclear Science and  Technology recently passed expert technical appraisal. The  apparatus, which uses microwave plasma-assisted sputtering  techniques, has been utilized by the Sichuan University  researchers to fabricate world-class lead-lanthanum-titanium  (PLT) and lead-titanium (PT) thin films on a variety of  substrates. The technique is particularly useful in fabricating  ferroelectric thin films, high-Tc superconducting ceramic thin  films, and superlattice films.</p>

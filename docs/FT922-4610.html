			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Clean-up warning to building groups CONSTRUCTION companies should reduce noise, wasteful consumption of materials and energy and clean up building sites and improve their environmental record, according to a report published by the industry yesterday. The report by the Construction Industry Employers Council, which represents the industry's biggest trade associations, warns that companies face big fines and directors and employees face imprisonment if they fail to comply with environmental legislation. The report, produced by a task force led by Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of Costain, one of the country's biggest contractors, says the industry should seek to reduce waste on building sites by 50 per cent by the year 2000. It should also cut energy consumption, establish clear standards for reducing noise and encourage better design, landscaping and land use. 'If we don't, others will and the industry will find itself increasingly sidelined by ever-increasing amounts of legislation and competition from abroad,' says Mr Costain. The report also says all companies should establish an environmental policy with well-defined objectives. Marley, the UK building materials group, yesterday launched a scheme to recycle waste plastics from building sites, in collaboration with Second Life Plastics, British Polythene's recycling division. Marley said many building materials were supplied shrink-wrapped in polythene. A similar scheme launched by Second Life and the farmers' union had resulted in 4,000 tonnes of polythene film being recycled last year. The Prince of Wales yesterday renewed his attack on modern urban development and said that it was partly to blame for the 'horrendous' social problems of inner cities. Speaking at the launch of a report from the Urban Villages Group, he called on architects, planners and developers to create living conditions which enhanced human values. He commended the report, which covers issues such as location, design and planning, management, finance and community involvement. It advocates the creation of 'mixed-use urban developments on a sustainable scale', creating communities 'where people actually want to live'. The group was established by Business in the Community in 1989 to investigate how cities could be made better places to live and work. Construction and Environment.

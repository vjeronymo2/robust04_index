			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Holiday is no respite for pound and dollar STERLING and the dollar remained under pressure yesterday in thin holiday trading, as strains in the European exchange rate mechanism showed few signs of easing. The Italian lira recovered slightly on foreign exchange markets, buoyed by a surprise weekend meeting between the French and Italian prime ministers which could presage the start of a Franco-Italian effort to persuade Germany to cut interest rates. In Britain, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, called on the government to urge the Bundesbank to signal an interest rate cut when it meets on Thursday. This might stave off pressure on some of the weak European currencies, and with it the possibility of increases in borrowing rates in nations such as Britain, France and Italy. Both the dollar and the pound remained little changed against the D-Mark, while the Belgian central bank increased its seven-day advances interest rate from 9.6 per cent to 9.7 per cent to bolster the value of the Belgian franc relative to the German currency. Upward pressure on the D-Mark yesterday was limited by Friday's European Community statement ruling out an ERM realignment. Some of the weaker ERM currencies, including the pound, Italian lira and French franc, may encounter fresh selling pressure today, when European foreign exchange trading returns to normal after yesterday's bank holiday in Britain. This depressed European trading volumes to about one-third of their customary levels. In New York yesterday, the dollar closed against the D-Mark at DM1.4028, just over half a pfennig down on Friday night's close and near its all-time low. In early Tokyo trading today it slipped to DM1.4002. The pound held at DM2.7885, little changed from Friday night, and roughly 1 pfennig above its DM2.778 ERM floor. Against the dollar the pound weakened slightly in New York to Dollars 1.988, but opened in Tokyo today at Dollars 1.99. The lira was quoted last night at L763.75 to the D-Mark, up from the close of L765.7 on Friday, when at one point it dipped below its ERM floor of L765.4 to the D-Mark. In Italy, no details were released of Sunday's one-hour meeting in Versailles between Mr Pierre Beregovoy and Mr Giuliano Amato, the French and Italian prime ministers. The session was interpreted in the Italian press as indicating the birth of a Franco-Italian axis on the ERM. The pressure on Italian interest rates was shown last night by an auction of seven-year floating rate government bonds, on which the net annual return was set at 14 per cent, the highest for years. Dealers seem to have been unaffected by Friday night's figures showing a sharp deterioration in Italy's balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves.

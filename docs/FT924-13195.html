			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: US drug groups show growth THE DRUG industry's consistent ability to meet analysts' expectations was underscored by the third-quarter results of Merck, American Home Products and Upjohn. Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, continues to benefit from its new product line, which helped lift third-quarter net income by 17 per cent to Dollars 644.5m, or 55 cents a share, from Dollars 552.4m, or 47 cents, last year. Sales advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn from Dollars 2.12bn, and were led by Vasotec for cardiovascular disease, Mevacor and Zocor, which lower cholesterol. Nine-month net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, or Dollars 1.61, from Dollars 1.59bn, or Dollars 1.37. Sales were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 7.06bn, against Dollars 6.29bn. American Home Products, another large pharmaceuticals group, turned in third-quarter net income of Dollars 427.7m, up 11 per cent from Dollars 384.9m. Earnings per share were 12 per cent up at Dollars 1.37, against Dollars 1.22. Sales grew 12 per cent to Dollars 2.11bn from Dollars 1.86bn, led by a 16 per cent improvement in drug sales to Dollars 1.21bn. Like Merck, American Home Products' performance has been helped by several relatively new products. In contrast, growth at Upjohn has been held back by a lack of major new products. The company posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 138m, or 77 cents a share, against Dollars 140m, or 77 cents, a year ago. Sales of Halcion, the sleeping pill banned recently in the UK, fell 47 per cent in the quarter. Earnings in the latest quarter included after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 15m, or 8 cents a share. Third-quarter sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 894.4m from Dollars Dollars 831.7m.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Critical day for the ERM THE BUNDESBANK helped to ease intense strains inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday after it cut the cost of lending short term funds to commercial banks by a slightly larger sum than had been expected, writes James Blitz. The lowest accepted bid for 14-day funds in the Bundesbank's weekly money market operation was 6.95 per cent, mildly beyond market expectations of a cut to 7 per cent. The move made a reduction in Germany's discount rate very likely at today's council meeting, and helped to stop extraordinary falls in the values of the peseta and escudo in early trading. Also, the French franc rose back above the FFr3.40 level to the D-Mark and ended in London at FFr3.405, up from Tuesday's FFr3.416 close. But, in spite of yesterday's easing, there was uncertainty in the currency market over what the Bundesbank must do today if it wants to bring the crisis in the ERM to a halt. Dealers in interest rate markets were anticipating a 50 basis-point cut in the German discount rate today as a result of yesterday's move in the repo rate. But now that this easing is priced into the market, some analysts are uncertain over what its actual implementation will mean for the French franc. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS in London, said the Bundesbank would have to lower the discount rate by at least 75 basis points today. Anything less could, in his view, trigger the collapse of the ERM. The currency tension was all too clear yesterday morning after the peseta and escudo moved with a volatility that was described by one analyst as unprecedented. After closing on Tuesday night at Pta80.89 per D-Mark, the Spanish currency plummeted to an historic low of Pta82.30. The Portuguese escudo brushed its ERM floor against the D-Mark, bottoming out at Es102.35. Intervention by the Bank of Spain and the Bundesbank rate cut helped to stabilise the Iberian currencies. The peseta finished at Pta80.41 against the German currency. Yesterday's tensions depressed the Belgian franc, forcing the authorities in Belgium to intervene in support of the currency. It bottomed out at BFr20.7710 to the D-Mark before ending at BFr20.66, above the previous day's close of BFr20.72. However, in the futures market it was striking that the implied annualised volatility in the D-Mark/Belgian franc was at 7 per cent, having been at 0.25 percentage points only a few weeks ago. Dealers clearly took a dim view of Belgium's commitment to keep the franc within  1/2 per cent fluctuations against the German currency. Sterling suffered another fall against the D-Mark following strong speculation in interest rate markets that the UK could reduce base rates in the next few weeks. The British currency closed at DM2.5675 from a previous DM2.5700.</p>

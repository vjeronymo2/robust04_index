			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Tokyo may act in drugs row Japan's ministry of health and welfare is considering disclosing its evaluation procedure for new drugs, after the death of 20 patients who took a cancer drug during clinical tests. The ministry is trying to alleviate public criticism over the approval by the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council last month of irinotecan hydrochloride, a lung, uterine and ovarian cancer drug which also causes diarrhoea and a decrease in white blood corpuscles. From March, the Health Ministry is expected to inform hospitals and medical associations on how it examines and evaluates new medicines during screening and provide doctors and pharmacists with clinical data of the checks. Ministry officials have blamed drug companies for not providing sufficient information about new drugs, and says it wants to promote the proper use by providing information. Before the anti-cancer drug case, 14 people died after taking sorivudine, a shingles drug, causing a rift between the Health Ministry, doctors and drug companies. Ministry officials blamed doctors for failing to read warnings against the combined use of the shingles drug with an anti-cancer agent, while doctors criticised the ministry and the drug maker for not placing conspicuous warnings.</p>

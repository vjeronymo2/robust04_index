			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Nominees Named for American Music Awards: Bobby Brown, Soul II Soul and Paula  Abdul led a pack of dance-oriented artists that dominated the nominations  Wednesday for the 17th annual American Music Awards. Vocalist Brown and British  R&amp;B outfit Soul II Soul each got five nominations, while dance-pop diva  Abdul, rapper Tone-Loc and pop duo Milli Vanilli all took four. Brown was  nominated as best male vocalist and his "Don't Be Cruel" as best album in both  the pop/rock and soul/R&amp;B categories. The winners will be named during a  live, three-hour ABC telecast from the Shrine Auditorium on Jan. 22. The  awards, considered an indicator of the more prestigious Grammy Awards to come  later in the spring, are based on votes cast by the public. The oddest  nomination: the Traveling Wilburys as best new artist. The grouping of George  Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison represents  a combined total of about 120 years of pop history. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

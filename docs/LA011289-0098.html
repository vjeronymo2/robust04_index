			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 3 YEARS, GIRL NEEDS NEW HEART DONOR  </P> <P> A new heart is needed by a 17-year-old girl whose body is rejecting the heart  of a friend that was transplanted into her after his unexpected death three  years ago.  </P> <P> Donna Ashlock has been treated for 10 episodes of organ rejection since she  received the heart of her classmate, Felipe Garza Jr., her father said, so her  doctors are seeking a new donor for another transplant.  </P> <P> "They had a new heart they were going to give her last Thursday night, but it  didn't match," Ray Ashlock said Tuesday at their home in this Central  California farming town.  </P> <P> Donna Ashlock's case became famous because of the circumstances surrounding the  heart that has been beating in her body since January, 1986.  </P> <P> Garza, a 15-year-old who had a crush on Ashlock, knew that she had a  degenerative heart disease and would not live much longer without a transplant.  </P> <P> Although he had not been ill, Garza told his parents, farm workers, that he  wanted his heart donated to her after his death. A short time later on Jan. 4,  1986, he died unexpectedly when a blood vessel burst in his brain.  </P> <P> As Garza wished, his friend, then 14, received his heart in an operation at  Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. Patterson's City Council  named a park in the boy's honor. The family has since moved away from the  community.  </P> <P> Ashlock has had to return to the hospital 75 miles northwest of her home often  since the operation for organ rejection treatment and check-ups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejection Common  </P> <P> Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Millhouse said it is fairly common for a body to  reject a transplanted organ. "In 5% to 10% of the cases, there is chronic  rejection. She's been through a lot and she's handled herself well."  </P> <P> Ray Ashlock said his medical insurance as a city employee did not cover all the  $500,000 cost of Donna's initial operation, and bills for treatment and  transportation have mounted since, leaving him wondering if he can ever pay off  all of his daughter's medical bills.  </P> <P> "We've got some bills that are $35,000 a whack," he said.  </P> <P> Donna Ashlock, who turns 18 on April 1, is anxiously awaiting another heart.  </P> <P> "I think I'll be better off with a new one," said the teen-ager, who studies at  home since her condition keeps her from attending regular classes at Patterson  High School. She will graduate this spring if she can stay well enough to  maintain her grades.  </P> <P> She hopes to go to college and become a nurse, not because she has had so many  nurses care for her, but because "I like helping people and stuff."  </P></p>

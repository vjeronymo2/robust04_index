			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Argyll makes Pounds 23m supermarket buy ARGYLL Group has spent Pounds 23m buying nine Grandways supermarkets from William Jackson, the Hull-based food manufacturer and retailer, in a deal which symbolises the ever-growing power of the national grocery chains. The family-run William Jackson said it was 'inappropriate' to continue operating its Grandways supermarket chain in a marketplace dominated by 'some excellent and much larger national retailers'. Instead, the company said it would switch its resources in a 'radical move' to become a 'major player in the convenience store sector within a short period of time'. William Jackson, which has been developing the convenience store concept over the past 18 months, intends to open 32 stores by Christmas and will use the proceeds of the Grandways disposal to accelerate its opening programme. The company added it was in negotaitions with another group to dispose of its 12 remaining Grandways supermarkets and expected to make a further announcement shortly. Argyll will convert eight of the Grandways supermarkets in the Midlands and north east England into Presto stores with the biggest 35,000 sq ft outlet, located in Willerby, North Yorkshire, being transformed into a Safeway superstore.</p>

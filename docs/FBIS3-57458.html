			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel Valentin Rudenko: "Today's Main Priority </F> Is To Pay Money Owed to the Defense Industry"]    [Text] Folk wisdom holds that the way you see in the New  Year is an omen for the way life is going to treat you in the  rest of the year. Some people may think my claim not quite  objective, but most enterprises in Russia's long-suffering  defense complex this time met the New Year in fairly good  spirits, and even with a certain degree of optimism and hope.    First, despite the gloomy forecasts -- which, it should be  stated directly, were more than sufficiently well-founded -- our  defense industry has not collapsed or been fragmented into a  multitude of design bureaus, scientific research institutes, and  plants, cast upon the whim of fate. What is more, in some  areas, above all in spheres defined as priorities by the  Ministry of Defense -- strategic nuclear forces, automated  command and control systems, communications in the tactical  echelon, intelligence systems, high-precision conventional  weapons, and a number of others -- definite progress was  achieved. The construction of a new multi-purpose submarine was  begun, a new frontline combat aircraft was tested, and a number  of models of new-generation command and control radio stations  are ready for mass production. There are also other achievements.    As for optimism and the glimmer of hope suddenly kindled in  the breasts of defense industry workers, these are due to the  Russian president's edict of 6 November 1993 "On Stabilizing the  Economic Situation of Defense Industry Enterprises and  Organizations, and on Measures to Ensure the State Defense  Order" (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 20 November 1993). Let me recall that  this document covered many of the sore spots of enterprises  fulfilling the State Defense Order. And, most importantly, it  determined specific measures to implement many of the proposals  made to the president and the government by the Ministry of  Defense.    It would not be far from the truth to assert that, following  this edict, many began to believe that this year would be a year  of revival for Russia's industry. And at the end of December  the papers brought more joyful tidings -- the president had  given an instruction to the government on the payment to  enterprises and organizations of money owed by the state for  deliveries of arms and military equipment, completed scientific  research and experimental design work, and for deliveries of  fuel, food, and clothing and related gear. No one had even  dreamed of a better New Year's present. Let me remark that this  is not a question of a couple of million rubles [R] but of a far  more significant sum -- more than R1 trillion. This is just for  regular deliveries of weapons systems and combat equipment, and  also for completed research and development.    But then the New Year holidays began; in many enterprises,  because of an absence of orders and a lack of funds to pay for  electricity and heating, they lasted until 10 January, and the  omen that the defense industry was in for a prosperous year  simply failed to come true. Rather the reverse -- the first  half of January showed that a still more austere and uncertain  situation is developing over funding than last year. The  Russian Federation president's instruction remains unfulfilled,  as do the corresponding government directive and an instruction  to Finance Minister Boris Fedorov personally.    But meanwhile the economic and financial situation in the  country is indeed extremely difficult. The Ministry of Defense  and leaders of industrial enterprises fulfilling the State  Defense Order are deeply committed to cutting the inflation  level and in principle support the measures adopted. However,  it can hardly be correct to implement them at the cost of the  virtually total shutdown of industries which still retain a  unique human, scientific, and technological potential, and which  are capable of ensuring the recovery of Russian industry as a  whole, and also the production of competitive,  science-intensive, civilian output. In addition, the  inflationary properties of the State Defense Order in its  current form are highly exaggerated.    Sad to relate, but we are already on the brink of chronic  delays in the supply of funds even for the purchase of the spare  parts and consumables necessary for maintaining in operational  readiness the equipment which the troops already have, let alone  for the development of new weapons systems. The majority of  enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order are wholly  deprived of the possibility of accumulating funds and compiling  circulating capital, and therefore, of functioning normally.  According to data from Defense Ministry military  representatives, around 70 percent of enterprises fulfilling the  State Defense Order are standing completely idle.    The implementation of the Long-Term Arms Program -- whose  basic directions and priorities, according to the report of  Russian Federation First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey  Kokoshin, were approved by the Russian Federation president and  the Security Council 19 January 1994 -- is threatened with  breakdown. Without the payment of money owed to enterprises,  scientific research institutes, and design bureaus, the Ministry  of Defense is unable to begin fulfilling the government-approved  1994 defense order. Andrey Kokoshin stresses that without a  solution to this problem a significant number of defense  production units are threatened with a crisis that is fraught  with the most serious consequences for Russia's defense  capabilities.    Furthermore. By reducing funding year after year and not  paying debts we place millions of people employed in defense  production units in a critical situation and doom them to  unemployment and an impoverished existence. Especially in  cities and camps which are in effect satellite cities of the big  defense plants. There are hundreds of them across Russia. Take  Severodvinsk, Votkinsk, Kaliningrad, Zhukovskiy, Arzamas-16, and  many others.    The editorial offices receive virtually every day alarming  reports that many defense enterprises have been placed in a  critical situation because of poor funding. Here are just a few  of them which were received through ITAR-TASS channels.    "The largest defense industry enterprise in Siberia -- the  Biysk `Sibpribormash' association -- has been completely shut  down. This happened after the city's No. 1 TETS [heat and  electric power station] switched off the enterprise's steam and  hot water. The reason for this was the association's R5 billion  debts. `Sibpribormash' owes the same sum to the power generating  industry. In the very first hours the electroplating and powder  metallurgy workshops were rendered inoperative and will now cost  several billion rubles to restore..."    "One-third of workers and employees of the `Amurmash'  association have been sent on indefinite leave on the minimum  salary of R14,620. The enterprise has no funds -- the Ministry  of Defense owes the association R2.5 billion for the output  which it produced over the past three months."    The tragedy of the situation lies also in the fact that the  entire social sphere -- schools, kindergartens, hospitals,  dwelling houses, and so forth -- is, as a rule, funded by the  defense enterprises. Formerly these facilities were an asset  for these plants; today they are a heavy burden. According to  specialists' assessments, up to two-thirds of the funds  allocated to the defense order are spent on maintaining the  social infrastructure and paying wages. But this must be done,  and Defense Ministry leaders must treat enterprises' problems  with understanding. Otherwise life in these cities would simply  be at a standstill -- which would, naturally, provoke a mighty  social explosion.    The year just gone was not an easy one for the defense  industry. It also began with debts. Then the state owed the  defense complex R39 billion (somewhere in the order of R300  billion at today's prices), but by February these debts had  largely been cleared; moreover, in March 1993, for perhaps the  first time in recent history a certain proportion of the defense  order was actually paid for in advance. Many defense enterprise  directors mark this down as greatly to the credit of the  Ministry of Defense. The Russian president's edict of 6  November 1993 again provided for advance payment, but so far not  a kopek has been received for these purposes. So the Ministry  of Defense, instead of concentrating all its attention on  ensuring the implementation of the approved priorities in  military-technical policy, the State Defense Order, and the  Long-Term Arms Program, has to spend a great deal of time and  energy on literally extorting the proper funds from the  government and the Ministry of Finance.    In these conditions, trying to distribute financial  resources to enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order  equally is like patching up a caftan -- you sew it up in one  place, and it tears in another. Nevertheless, last year the  Ministry of Defense managed to ensure the funding of a number of  the most important weapons systems, thereby preserving the  backbone of the defense industry. Whether it will manage to  stabilize the situation this year and move forward in a number  of areas is a big question. Right now the government is again  examining proposals from the Ministry of Defense geared not only  toward the swift payment of debts and beginning the advance  payment of enterprises, but also at the creation of a mechanism  for the regular and timely supply of financial resources aimed  at fulfilling the decisions of the president and the Security  Council.</p>

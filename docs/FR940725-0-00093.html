			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We caution States to carefully evaluate how section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules will affect the waiver population. Generally, the election of the section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules would not adversely affect the waiver recipient. However, there is at least one exception with respect to individuals who  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> are not living  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> with their community spouses. If the section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules are used for such individuals, the waiver recipient is not likely to have enough protected income to pay for his or her maintenance needs. This situation can occur because only the personal needs allowance for institutionalized individuals is protected in the section 1924 post-eligibility calculation. Income above the personal needs allowance would go either to the community spouse in the form of a monthly income allowance, or for medical and remedial care expenses (including waiver services). Thus, the waiver recipient is not likely to have income to pay for his or her food, clothing, and shelter in the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are adopting the proposed &sect;441.301(a)(2) to allow a State to request a waiver of section 1902(a)(1) or section 1902(a)(10)(B) as final. We are also adding a provision to that section to allow for waiver of the requirements of section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act concerning income and resource rules applicable to institutionalized individuals with spouses living in the community, as added by section 4118(a)(1) of OBRA '87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adopting the proposed revisions to &sect;435.726(c)(l) and &sect;435.735(c)(l) as final, without further modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Expenditure for Waiver Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Prohibition on Imposition of Certain Regulatory Limits on Expenditures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9502(c) of COBRA amended section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act and added a new section 1915(c)(6). Section 9502(c)(1) of COBRA clarified section 1915(c)(2)(D) to specify that, under a home and community-based services waiver, a State's estimated average per capita expenditure for individuals under the waiver must not exceed the estimated average per capita expenditure for services without the waiver. We refer to this as ``a cost-neutrality test for section 1915(c) waivers.'' (We have always interpreted section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act in this manner and previously implemented the applicable standards accordingly.) The cost estimate formula is located in regulations at &sect;441.303(f)(l).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1915(c)(6) of the Act, as enacted by section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA, directs the Secretary to abolish the regulatory limitation concerning home and community-based services waiver expenditures. This expenditure limitation appears in existing regulations at &sect;&sect;441.302(e)(2) and 441.310(a)(2) and requires a State to provide satisfactory assurance that actual total expenditures for home and community-based services and the State's claim for FFP for the services will not exceed the State's approved estimates for waiver services. Under the existing regulations, expenditures that exceed the State's approved estimates would not have been eligible for FFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we revised &sect;441.302 (e) and (f) that deal with a State's assurances on the cost-neutrality of its waiver programs. Section 441.302(e) deals with a State's estimates as contained in its waiver proposals and &sect;441.302(f) deals with a State's actual expenditures as reported on the State's annual expenditure reports as required under section 1915(c)(2)(E) of the Act. We inserted ``100 percent'' in each section to clearly indicate the intention of section 9502(c) of COBRA that a waiver be cost-neutral (formerly referred to as ``cost-effective''). The Congress intended that expenditures made under a State waiver not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made if the waiver had not been granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also proposed revisions to &sect;441.304(d) to indicate that we will review all estimates very closely to determine if they are reasonable and based on statistically supportable assumptions. For waivers that are approved and operational, we will compare the data the State must furnish annually on its actual experience (HCFA form 372) with the approved expenditures the State estimated would occur absent the waiver. If we find that actual expenditures exceed the State's approved estimates for expenditures absent the waiver, we will require the State to amend its estimates for the subsequent waiver year(s). We will compare the revised estimates with the State's actual experience to determine if these estimates are reasonable. We may terminate a waiver if we find that, based on the revised estimates in the amendment request, the waiver is not cost-neutral or that the revised estimates are unreasonable. For waiver renewal requests, we will compare the estimated expenditures for the renewal period against the State's actual experience as shown in its annual reports. Based on this comparison, we will not approve a waiver renewal request if we find that the renewal request is not cost-neutral or that the estimates are not reasonable based on the annual reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These revisions were required by section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received the following public comments on these proposed provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A State agency suggested that a single recipient's cost not be used to determine the waiver's cost effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): Too quiet at home  -Japan's Big Three join race for East Asian orders SLOW GROWTH at home is making Japan's power equipment makers turn to the high growth East Asian markets. They are led by Toshiba and Hitachi, better known for their light electronics products, and Mitsubishi, the heavy industrial group. While the electronics industry has been suffering over the last few years, both Toshiba and Hitachi have remained profitable thanks to their heavy electrical businesses. Now, however, these divisions are also in trouble as Japan's economy slows and as Japanese companies become increasingly ready to take advantage of cheaper imports. For the Japanese power equipment makers this competition reduces their margins even when they succeed in winning domestic buiness. 'Until now, the power companies have stuck with particular makers,' says Katsuro Tsujiyama, manager of the power systems marketing planning department at Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MEC), which provides generating equipment and electrical systems for power stations contracted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). 'But this system is collapsing, partly because of pressure from America and Europe,' he says. 'It has a big effect on us. Buying abroad is cheaper and the power companies can get us to reduce our prices.' The solution they have hit on is a traditional one for Japanese companies: look abroad. However, this time they are not eyeing Europe and the US, whose markets are marred by recession and trade friction, but Asia. Countries with fast-growing economies such as Malaysia and Indonesia are still plagued by power shortages which they want to remove as soon as possible. 'We're thinking about developing countries,' says Hiroharu Takayasu, deputy manager of the overseas marketing group of MEC's power department. 'The priority market now is Hong Kong - the economy is growing and its light industry is getting bigger. China is the biggest hope for the future and Thailand has a lot of potential.' Baring Securities (Japan) reported last year that MHI's Asian sales could well rise from around 10 per cent of total parent turnover in the year ending March 31, 1993 to around 30 per cent over the next five or 10 years. The company's power equipment division increased its export ratio from 30 per cent in fiscal 1991 to 35 per cent the following year, it said. The pattern of increasing demand is similar throughout the region. First, demand comes from industrial development. Countries inviting foreign investment need a solid infrastructure, a major aspect of which is electric power to run factories. Later, consumers using the products of these factories create further demand. However, countries vary widely in how they award contracts to satisfy this. China, says MEC's Takayasu, while having the largest potential, is one of the trickiest markets. Foreigners angling for contracts have to negotiate a maze of opaque regulations and tariffs, which often vary from state to state. Thailand, on the other hand, is clear and open, making it, he says, 'the hardest in the world'. The Mitsubishi group has received an estimated Yen 30bn order for three steam turbines and generating equipment for Indonesia's Surabaya thermal power station, which will make a total of 24 steam turbines it has supplied to that country's electricity generating authority. Hitachi and Toshiba are moving in the same direction, a policy that sits well with their company-wide strategies to get into emerging consumer markets: as well as making electricity generating equipment, they also need electricity to set up consumer goods factories and to see their products being used in people's homes. Most developing countries want to develop their own equipment industries to a degree, so participating in their markets often means local joint ventures or co-operation at the technological or manufacturing level rather than exporting completed products, according to Toshiba. While India, Vietnam and the Asean nations are all attractive markets, China stands out with its vast population, double-digit economic growth and untapped natural resources. Hitachi says there are already plans there to add 15GW of new capacity annually. Two thirds of this will be in thermal plants, to take advantage of the country's abundant coal, and Hitachi announced last November a joint venture, Beijing Hitachi Huasun Control System, to make and sell control systems for thermal plants in China. In January, it set up a joint venture with Harbin Electric Machinery Works to provide engineering services for electricity plants, mainly in hydro-electric power. It hopes this company will later become a base for supplying generating equipment.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Legal auditor damaged client relationship - Legal Briefs The trend in the US towards companies employing independent legal auditors to vet their law firm bills may be reined back by a legal action which has been launched by a Los Angeles law firm claiming a legal auditor irretrievably damaged a 20-year relationship with a valued client. Allen Rhodes &amp; Sobelsohn is suing Mr Bruce Bealke of Legal Audits Inc of St Louis for Dollars 3m in economic damages plus punitive damages for defamation and interference with business after he 'erroneously' misconstrued the firms charging rate for client ITT Hartford Insurance. Allen Rhodes claims that the auditor's comments led prospective clients and even judges to inquire about rumours that the firm had been indicted for fraud; was intending to file for bankruptcy; had laid off 17 lawyers; and was being sued by Hartford for several million dollars. Important changes to the law covering goods bought in bulk have been put forward by the law commissions in England and Scotland. Under existing law a person who buys a specified quantity of goods forming part of an unidentified bulk - say 100 tonnes of wheat stored in a warehouse containing a much larger quantity - will not actually own the goods until they have been ascertained which is normally not until delivery. The thinking behind this is that a person cannot own something until they know precisely what it is. Although logical this causes problems for commodity traders in particular. The commissions recommend in future that buyers should be able to become owner not of particular grains of wheat but of a proportionate part of the bulk corresponding to the quantity bought and paid for. A solution of this type has been in operation in the US since 1906.</p>

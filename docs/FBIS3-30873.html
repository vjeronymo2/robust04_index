Before departure, Teodor Melescanu highlighted in a news  statement at the Otopeni Airport the new element of the meeting,  as it had resulted from the Bucharest consultations with the two  negotiators, namely a possible involvement of the countries  neighboring the former Yugoslav area in the international  efforts for seeking out a solution. The talks in Geneva, Teodor  Melescanu said, will focus mainly on the latest solutions the  two negotiators and the European Union are considering for  stopping the conflict, on the support the neighbor countries can  give and, maybe, on other issues associated with the prospect of  settling the conflict.    "I think it is an attempt in good faith of the neighbor  countries, Romania included, to contribute to ending this  tragedy which has lasted far too much for everybody and which is  already worrying all of us, not only those who live in the  former Yugoslav space."</p>

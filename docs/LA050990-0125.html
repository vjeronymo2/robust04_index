			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S BLACK-OWNED FIRMS THRIVE;  </P> <P> MINORITIES: COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA REGISTERED A 6.7% INCREASE IN REVENUE WHILE  THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ROSE ONLY 0.3%, A SURVEY SHOWS.  </P> <P> While the nation's largest black-owned businesses had virtually no revenue  growth as a group last year, such firms in California surged ahead, helping the  state claim the title of home of the largest number of successful black  entrepreneurs, according to a survey released Tuesday.  </P> <P> Black Enterprise magazine's latest annual list of the top 100 black-owned  industrial and service companies contained 14 California firms -- more than any  other state. New York, which tied California for the top spot last year, ranked  second on the new survey with 13 firms.  </P> <P> In a separate top-100 list, Black Enterprise cited the revenue leaders among  America's black-owned automobile dealerships. Nine California dealerships made  the list, putting California second to Michigan (12 dealerships) among the 100  leaders.  </P> <P> Survey statistics also showed that the revenue trend for the top black-owned  California firms bucks the national average. Of the 200 firms on the two lists  last year, 22 were California-based. There are now 23 California firms on the  two top 100 lists.  </P> <P> The California firms -- not counting the newcomer to the list -- had combined  revenue of 677.2 million in 1989, an increase of 6.7% over the previous year's  revenue.  </P> <P> By contrast, the combined revenue of the leading black firms on the two  national top 100 lists totaled $6.81 billion in 1989 -- up a negligible 0.3%  over 1988, the report said.  </P> <P> The magazine's editor and publisher, Earl G. Graves, blamed the economic  climate and governmental policies for the flat performance nationwide.  </P> <P> "A sluggish economy has wreaked havoc on major industrial sectors -- from auto  manufacturing to finance," Graves said. "And the Reagan Administration's legacy  of exclusion has been realized with the subsequent retrenchment of affirmative  action plans and minority business set-aside programs."  </P> <P> On the other hand, local black business leaders were upbeat about the  performance of the largest California firms owned by blacks.  </P> <P> "California has a diverse economy, and there are lots of opportunities," said  Gene Hale, chairman of the 400-member Black Business Assn. of Los Angeles.  "California hasn't had a recession in a long time, but there have been regional  recessions in other parts of the country. The climate is right for business  starts. Blacks are moving into different fields like high-technology."  </P> <P> Traditional black business enterprises such as construction and food and  beverage retailing still dominate the magazine's national list, accounting for  31 of the top 100 industrial and service firms. However, the number of firms in  fields related to computers and office supplies increased to 18 in 1989 from 13  in 1988.  </P> <P> Among the most successful companies in these nontraditional sectors is Advanced  Consumer Marketing Corp., a Burlingame, Calif.-based holding company involved  in sales of computers and garden supplies and direct mail marketing. Black  Enterprise named the firm its "BE Company of the Year." The company ranked 13  on the magazine's list of industrial and service companies.  </P> <P> Ranking ahead of Advanced was the Los Angeles-based Gordy Co., which includes  the entertainment operations of Motown Industries, whose record business was  sold in 1988 to MCA Inc. and Boston Ventures.  </P> <P> Among the other high-ranking California firms was Shack-Woods &amp; Associates  in Long Beach, No. 1 in the nation on the auto dealers list.  </P> <P> Retaining the top spot among industrial and service companies was TLC Beatrice  International Holdings Co., the foods processor and distributor. The New  York-based holding company acquired the international food businesses of the  former Beatrice Cos. in a $985-million buyout in 1987.  </P> <P> However, like many of the other companies, TLC Beatrice suffered from weak  conditions in the economy and declining capital pools. A planned public  offering of 35% of the company, which would have made TLC Beatrice the first  black-owned company on the New York Stock Exchange, was withdrawn in December  due to a sagging stock market and a weak reception by investors.  </P> <P> THE BIGGEST BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES  </P> <P> The following are lists of the 10 largest black-owned industrial and service  companies in the United States and in California as compiled by Black  Enterprise magazine. To qualify for the list, a company must have been fully  operational in 1989 and must be at least 51% black-owned. It must manufacture  or own the product it sells or provide industrial or consumer services. The  list includes the company, city where headquartered, line of business and 1989  revenue.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has already made a determination in promulgating subpart T that compliance with the 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> pCi/m2-s standard protects public health with an ample margin of safety. EPA con <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> ducted a risk analysis in promulgating subpart T in 1989. At that time, EPA determined that the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard was a ``baseline'' that was provided by EPA's general UMTRCA standards at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. EPA further determined that compliance with that baseline would be protective of public health with an ample margin of safety. EPA promulgated subpart T to ensure achievement of the flux standard at non-operational sites in a timely manner. In conducting this rescission rulemaking, EPA is not revisiting the risk analysis nor decision methodology that supported the promulgation of subpart T; rather, EPA is only visiting whether NRC's regulatory program under UMTRCA will meet the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard established in subpart T as being a safe level in a timely manner thereby rendering subpart T unnecessarily duplicative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposed determination that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety includes a finding that NRC and the affected Agreement States are implementing and enforcing, in significant part on a programmatic and site-specific basis: (1) The regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC consistent with the settlement agreement described above; and (2) the operating license (i.e., tailings closure plan) requirements that establish milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> pCi/m2-s flux standard. In addition, in determining whether EPA's and NRC's regulatory changes have been effectively promulgated, EPA will assess whether any judicial challenge to these regulations is pending and, if so, whether such challenge presents a significant risk of interference with the purposes and objectives of the MOU, as reflected in the regulatory changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. EPA's UMTRCA Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, EPA has modified its UMTRCA regulations (40 CFR part 192 subpart D) to require compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (and factors beyond the control of the licensee), and to require appropriate monitoring to verify the efficacy of the design of the permanent radon barrier. By definition, no more rapid compliance can, as a practical matter occur, because this schedule represents the earliest that the sites could be closed. EPA expects that these compliance schedules will be developed consistent with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When EPA promulgated subpart T it recognized that many sources might not be able to comply with the two year compliance date then required pursuant to section 112. Based on this, subpart T includes a provision that in such a case EPA would ``establish a compliance agreement which will assure that disposal will be completed as quickly as possible.'' 40 CFR 61.222(b). The time period required for closure under subpart D embodies the same approach. In practice, therefore, both subpart T and subpart D establish the same basic timeframes for achievement of the flux standard. Assuming NRC and the Agreement States faithfully implement subpart D and the license amendments required under subpart D, EPA would not expect there to be any significant difference between these two programs in the amount of time required for sites to comply with the flux standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, subpart D as amended, provides that NRC may grant an extension of time to comply with either of the following deadlines: (1) Performance of milestones based upon a finding that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard has been met, or (2) final compliance beyond the date or relevant milestone based upon cost. EPA considers these two bases upon which NRC may grant an extension to be mutually exclusive, i.e., a request for a specific extension may be based on one or the other but not both grounds. If a milestone is being extended for a basis other than cost, such an extension may be granted if NRC finds that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard has been demonstrated using EPA Method 115 or an NRC approved alternative. In addition the site must continue to demonstrate compliance with this flux standard on an annual basis. However, if a licensee requests extension of the final compliance date (or relevant milestone) based upon cost, such an extension may only be granted if NRC finds that the three criteria specified in 40 CFR section 192.32(a)(3)(iii) are met. Any extensions of the final compliance date based upon cost will be granted on a site-specific basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

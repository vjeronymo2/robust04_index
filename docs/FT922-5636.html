			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / PM rules out rescue but Tube line talks possible MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ruled out a government rescue of Canary Wharf and reaffirmed that the proposed extension of the Jubilee line depended on a substantial contribution from the owners of the docklands development. But, in what appeared to be a hint of flexibility over the details of the rail financing package, the prime minister added that the government was ready to listen to any new proposals made by the administrators. He also emphasised that Whitehall departments would continue negotiations to relocate upwards of 2,000 civil servants to the development as long as any such move was 'on commercial terms'. Speaking in Hungary at the end of a four-day visit to central Europe, Mr Major said repeatedly that the enforced move into administration of Canary Wharf had not changed his policy towards the project. Under an agreement negotiated with Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary Wharf, the government agreed to invest about Pounds 1.5bn to extend the Jubilee line to docklands as long as the developers provided a total of Pounds 400m towards the project. About Pounds 40m of that was due to be paid by O&amp;Y in March with a further Pounds 60m next year and the remainder in small instalments until well into the next century. Last night, Mr Major said the agreement would stand with the creditors of the development: 'We have agreed to spend around Pounds 1.5bn on the Jubilee line but that is subject to the owners of Canary Wharf, whoever they are, making a substantial contribution to the cost of the project and a further contribution once the project is built'. He added that 'nothing you should take from me suggests our position is going to change'. The hint of flexibility on the details came when Mr Major was pressed repeatedly as to whether the administrators would have to agree precisely the same conditions as those agreed with O&amp;Y. He responded: 'I think we should wait and see what the administrators have to say. I'm not going to prejudge that.' Senior officials travelling with the prime minister stressed that the comment did not imply he was ready to increase the government's financial contribution. The remarks, however, did suggest that Mr Major does not want to close the door on the possibility of rescheduling the private sector contribution or agreeing to a delay in the line's construction timetable. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, is expected to be among ministers arguing over the next few days that the government should try to help the project.</p>

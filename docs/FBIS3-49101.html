The AFD holds the government responsible for the failure and  states that the bill, which required a two-thirds majority of  votes, was improperly prepared. The AFD says the government  ignored all suggestions from the liberal party.    According to the AFD, the government's original proposal  would not have made it possible for all minorities to have  parliamentary representation. Adopting it would have put  minorities of smaller numbers into a detrimental position.  Larger minorities would receive representation almost  automatically, which would jeopardize the existence of the  unicameral parliament. Furthermore, the "one minority -- one  list" proposal ignored differences of political views within  minorities.    According to the AFD's proposal, representatives of  minorities would get a seat in Parliament by winning half of the  votes usually necessary for an MP. Also, the proposal would  give minorities outside of Parliament a right of consultation in  Parliament's human rights committee.    The AFD seeks to launch coordination talks on minority  parliamentary representation with the participation of the  minority roundtable and parliamentary parties.</p>

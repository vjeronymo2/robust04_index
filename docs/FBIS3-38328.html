			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Giorgio Battistini: "The Gray Thing Is Born and </F> Is Waiting for Senatur Bossi"]    [Text] Moving toward the elections. At the National  Alliance party convention, Fini attacks Segni and reevaluates  the Lega. And Forza Italia indicates its "compatibility."    Fini's National Alliance springs forth born from  Berlusconi's  right rib. In reality, it is the MSI [Italian Social Movement]  with the addition of many converts: former Catholics, former  Liberals (Costa and Biondi are interested, even though they did  not attend), and a few former Socialists. For the time being, it  is little more than a thing, the Gray Thing--actually a faded  black. It wears an air of respectability and comes in the  economy package so as not to waste votes--old-style, family  size. It is a barrier against the dreaded "red tide." It is the  immutable nucleus around which the moderates (from Forza Italia  to Bossi and including the centrists and the fleeing right-wing  Christian Democrats) can gather when the time comes for a  conservative majority. And what about Mario Segni? "A snake  charmer," hissed Gianfranco Fini (but he quotes him 16 times in  his closing speech).    Fini is the leader of a party that hopes to garner heavy  gains in votes and image from this maneuver, following their  strong showing in mayoral elections in Rome and Naples. The  setting is a large hall in the back of a hotel in Rome. In the  same hotel, Communist Renewal is holding its party convention at  the same time. They are only 30 rooms away, but a few centuries  separate these opposite extremes. Their understated logo  consists of three red, white, and green brushstrokes. Eight  hundred delegates and 2,000 guests are in attendance, many more  than had been anticipated. A few MSI Deputies are present, but  the militant rank and file is noticeably absent as planned. This  is the debut of the respectable political right, which is a  high-quality product for the middle classes that are in a  confused muddle. It represents a daring strategy on the part of  the leaders of a new party that leaves behind any nostalgia for  the good old days and opens the way for an ultra modern  technocracy that is actively courting the Catholic vote. On the  platform, we find right-wing Christian Democrats like Fiori and  Selva; and in the audience, some former Christian Democrats who  are mad at Martinazzoli and even a venerable former head of the  Revenue Guards (and of Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security  Service], Ramponi, who calls for a tax cut. One of the  interested observers is Francesco D'Onofrio (former Christian  Democrat and now a centrist outsider), who came to offer his  well-meaning "recognition," explaining that the "great majority  of Catholic voters belong to the center right, whereas its  leadership does not. The cold war had concealed this difference.  Now that everything has broken apart, are we the only ones who  should stand in the center, providing the highest, solitary  witness that Martinazzoli is calling for? Even the pope praised  the market as an instrument of liberty."    Another high-ranking observer is Giuliano Urbani, the  political scientist at Fininvest who is Berlusconi's ghost  writer. With him is Antonio Tajani, a young spokesman for the  group. Urbani is pleased with the way the day went. He says he  "came to show his interest" and support. Bobbio is absolutely  right--the First Republic will not completely die (and, I say,  there will not a happy birth) if we cannot first overcome the  deadly dichotomy between fascism and antifascism. I have not  heard anyone here express sorrow over the end of Salazar's  regime in Portugal. I see minimum differences of opinion, even  though their origins hark back to the distant past. We are all  the "children of our history, and this is important."    It is a remarkable event and, in its own way, even an  historic one. A very agreeable right-wing is on parade in the  audience: an ecologist, a writer, a labor union representative,  a bureaucrat, and even a terrifying anti-Bossi Leghist. Fini is  the ecumenical secretary who is trying to relegate fascism to  the archives of history. He is trying to redeem (now or never)  those growing millions of votes he has. He is widening the  political boundaries of a right that longs to lead the  government, that suffers, and volunteers itself.    What about the economy? This is Pietro Armani's (former  center-left-wing president of IRI [Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction]) formula. We need a strong majority "that knows  how to force decisions that are certainly not pleasant or  popular." He has four [as published] exhortations: fewer  administrative restrictions on company decisions; more private  (with less taxation) and public (long-term debt) investments; a  policy for demographic growth; a revival of research; striving  to comply with European standards while better defending  national interests; and paying for public services based on  actual cost. He promises the return of the "salary brackets"  favored by Berlusconi. "At relatively lower labor costs in the  south, they fostered the first valid industrial developments."  An absolute faith in the "market" and in a "free economy" is  guaranteed to the moderates on the right, even though they  oppose technocracies and support public employment. Having said  that, "politics is the primary tool to regulate, but not  intervene in, the production process," declares conservative  philosopher Domenico Fisichella. The Alliance's attitude toward  the Lega is sweet and sour: a lot of understanding for the  voters, but none for their leaders. They are actually accused of  having a Marxist-style vision of the state.    But even Fini (acclaimed coordinator of the Alliance) seems  to think they have gone too far and he makes some revisions. His  reevaluates the Lega: "If Bossi is not still under the effect of  his honeymoon, his new opinion of us (the only force in the  center south that is neither for state socialism nor for the  welfare state) is a great step forward from the state of war in  the past." He detests Mario Segni ("he is deceiving himself; he  will have to make a choice") because he is suspended between the  right and the left and most of all because "he has volunteered  to lead a government that is open to the moderate progressives,  which includes the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], but  excludes the Rete and Communist Renewal once they have been used  and discarded."</p>

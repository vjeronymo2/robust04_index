			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 8 (CTK) -- Ex-premier Vladimir  Meciar today accused the government coalition of having brought  parliamentary democracy into a profound crisis and said the  parliament was liquidating constitutional officials and was  monitoring the activity of neither the president nor the "ruling  politburo."    In a live television debate, Meciar accused Deputy Premier  Roman Kovac, a former member of his Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), of having embezzled five million dollars.  Kovac, also taking part in the debate, said he would lodge a  complaint against Meciar.    Earlier this week, the parliament failed to pass a vote of  no  confidence in Kovac motioned by the opposition. But the  opposition was unable to submit any evidence to support its  embezzlement claim.    Meciar pointed out an alleged disagreement between the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the rest of the government  coalition. He told SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, also present at  the debate, that he had made him four "serious offers" to create  a coalition when the HZDS was at power (until March 11).    Meciar also claimed that there were serious disagreements  within the SDL and that Weiss had sent to the government people  with whom he had been in conflict so that they "discredit  themselves by the elections." He specially mentioned Defence  Minister Pavol Kanis and Agriculture Minister Pavel Koncos.    Elections are to be held on September 30-October 1.    Meciar also attacked Premier Jozef Moravcik in connection  with the screening (lustration) of government members. He said  that it is amoral of Moravcik, "a former member of a Communist  Party of Czechoslovakia Leninist group," to demand that the  ministers submit a negative screening certificate. Under the  screening law of 1991, former high-ranking communist officials,  collaborators with the secret police (StB) and members of the  People's Militia (the party's paramilitary force) are barred  from public posts until 1996.    Meciar also criticised the Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH), saying that it was usurping the right to assert in the  coalition solely its own interests.    In this situation the cabinet exists only thanks to "a  secret  agreement" with representatives of the Hungarian coalition of  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles which  supports it at the cost of "outrageous conditions." The  Hungarian coalition represents an ethnic minority of about  560,000 or 11 per cent of the Slovak population. It has 14 out  of a total of 150 seats in the parliament.    Meciar claimed that the HZDS had never "dictated" anything  in  the parliament which, he added, could not be said of the present  coalition. "We have never had an absolute majority, we always  decently asked for support," he said.    Meciar dismissed the arguments of the coalition  representatives present at the debate, who said that it was  mainly his own fault that he had lost one-quarter of his  deputies over one and a quarter years and that he had painted a  bad picture of Slovakia abroad. "You are only conceited, you  are not strong," Meciar told the present coalition.</p>

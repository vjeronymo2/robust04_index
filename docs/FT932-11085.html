			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Minister concedes aerospace position BRITAIN has again been overtaken by France as the west's second-largest aerospace industry after the US and is also being challenged by Germany at the top of the European aerospace league, Paul Betts writes. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, yesterday told a Commons inquiry into the UK aerospace industry that the sector's Pounds 11bn turnover last year was slightly less than the Pounds 11.32bn turnover of the French aerospace industry. However, he acknowledged that both the French and German industries had received greater direct support from their governments. He said the government had provided since 1979 Pounds 1.22bn in launch aid for seven aerospace projects involving British companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Batticaloa -- At a press conference held in the  party office in Batticaloa, E. Durairatnam, Central Committee  member of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front  [EPRLF] said: In today's context, the Tamils want a political  solution and not elections. After a ten-year conflict, if an  election is the answer for the Tamils and if we accept it, it  will weaken us.    Former provincial council members N. Nesarasa and K.  Parameswaramoorthy were also present at the news conference.  Durairatnam further said: This election is the first step to  dividing the Northeastern Province. By holding a separate  election for the Eastern Province after a referendum there, the  government is now working with the aim of smashing the  traditional (?fort) and motherland of the Tamils as well as  dividing and destroying their region through a planned Sinhalese  settlement. Several irregularities have taken place in fielding  the candidates. By force, the Army has fielded candidates  against their will. Is it possible to hold free and fair  elections under these circumstances? One can guess the  government's planned move to bolster its views in an atmosphere  of strife by adopting fraudulent methods in the elections. Why  do certain groups who say that they contest the elections only  to defeat the United National Party not condemn the outrageous  acts in fielding the candidates and keep quiet? It is doubtful  whether the local bodies will be able to function independently  in today's atmosphere today, where it is not possible to run the  civil administration even amid military intervention. We should  not forget the legitimate demands of the Tamil people by  involving ourselves in the election process and should give up  our struggle for power only. All the organizations should unite  together and fight for a political solution. The experiences we  gained by our participation in the northeastern provincial  elections tell us that the Tamils are not going to reap any  immediate benefits from the local body elections. At the same  time, we will fight for boycotting the elections in a democratic  way. We will not hesitate to strongly condemn anybody who works  for or against the elections at gunpoint.</p>

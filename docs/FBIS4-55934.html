			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/5/1994 -- After concluding  his visits to Brazil, Peru and Paraguay (over 10-22 May),  Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and those who  accompanied him on his tour made a review on the positive  results of the visits.    Stressing on the fact that his visits "have marked a  relaunch  of bilateral ties with the three states," Nicolae Vacaroiu  mentioned that several agreements and firm contracts worth $80  million have been concluded, to which the contract-framework  accounting for $800 million is added with real possibilities for  rapid capitalization.    "The tour has brought to the fore an extensive potential of  growing Romanian exports," Minister of Industries Dumitru  Popescu commented, "and this because the area is rich in raw  materials and we must operate exports to get them. An example  is Brazil with which we have set ourselves to reach a volume of  trade worth some $70 million, half of which being expected to  represent Romanian exports. We are to focus on car, metal and  chemical products and equipment exports."    Minister of Trade Cristian Ionescu stated in his turn that  prospects are in place for relaunching Romanian commercial  exchanges with the three states, especially with Brazil: "The  fact that our Brazilian partners have shown special interest in  growing ties with Romania is an extremely encouraging fact for  us. Obviously, ties will also grow with Peru and Paraguay".    According to Education Minister Liviu Maior, conditions are  in place "to send student researchers in Latin America, as well  as prospects to open lectorships of Romanian language and  civilization in three major universities. As for culture, there  is a high demand for Romanian exhibitions, first of all of  Brancusi works, as well as for tours of musical groups,  especially for the Madrigal Choir. Moreover, we were asked to  promote a tighter collaboration in the field of Romance studies".    As for the political-diplomatic field, Foreign Ministry  State  Secretary Marcel Dinu stated that "we are collecting the results  after promoting a constant policy of close ties with Latin  American countries, which is one of our main priorities.  Certainly some could raise the question if these visits were  put under the sign of integration in Europe. I view these  priorities as complementary, and by no means one is excluding  the other."</p>

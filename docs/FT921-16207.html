			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Boxing: Lewis shows the moves of a champion - Keith Wheatley meets a serious British heavyweight contender FEW British sportsmen are looking forward to 1992 as much as Lennox Lewis. If the dice roll his way, the Kent-based heavyweight could be fighting for the world heavyweight title before the year ends. Furthermore, there are grounds for believing that Lewis could be the first Brit to hold that title since Bob Fitzsimons in 1897. Should that happen, his earnings would make those of Frank Bruno look like pantomime takings. Boxing may not enjoy the profile or support it once did. Yet one should not underestimate the fervour that would surge behind a Briton who made it - not least in America. 'England is seen here as the birthplace of boxing and with nearly 100 years since there was a British champion, Lennox is beginning to tap into that wave of sentiment,' explained John Hornewer, a young Chicago attorney and Lewis's lawyer, friend and confidante. 'Since he did so well in his last fight, he's beginning to have a big profile here.' That fight, two months ago in Atlanta, saw Lewis achieve a controlled and capable three-round demolition of contender Tyrell Biggs. Producers at Home Box Office, who have Lewis under contract for two more fights, were thrilled at what they saw as his entertainment value. What inspired Lewis himself that night was less the sight of Biggs hitting the canvas than the later, main bout between Evander Holyfield and Bert Cooper. Holyfield looked a less-than-worthy champion, taking seven struggling rounds to stop Cooper, a journeyman pro who accepted the fight at six days' notice. 'Having watched him against Cooper, I know I can beat Holyfield,' said Lewis immediately after that fight. 'The problem is that a lot of other fighters will be thinking the same thing and there'll be a queue to get into the ring with him. I want to be first.' At this point, lawyers and an alleged rape enter the picture. Dozens of lawyers are petitioning in Indianapolis, trying to persuade Judge Patricia Gifford to postpone Mike Tyson's trial on rape charges. In March he is contracted to fight Holyfield in a Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.4m) match at Las Vegas. If Tyson cannot beat the rap, hoteliers and promoters are anxious that he should at least delay it. 'Everything depends on Tyson,' observed Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva. 'We can't make plans with Lewis or anyone else until we know whether Tyson will be fighting again. If he's not in jail, we have to stick to our contract.' Lennox Lewis has become used to lawyers in the background of his life. His principal backer and financial adviser is Roger Levitt, the disgraced and bankrupt financial services entrepreneur currently on bail in London over 24 criminal charges and facing personal claims of around Pounds 50m. Lewis was a principal component of the Levitt Group's plan to develop and manage a string of high-earning international athletes to match those of the International Management Group. It was Levitt who flew the boxer and Hornewer over from Canada - where Lewis lived until 1989 - and offered him a car, house, Dollars 200,000 signing-on fee, and even a job for his mother. Hornewer concedes that the terms were absurdly generous, but says they reflected the passion of the boxing-mad tycoon to 'breed' a British champion. 'The deal is personality-based. Levitt had to have Lennox Lewis, whatever it cost,' says the attorney. Lewis, 26, is one of the most pleasant, intelligent and articulate sportsmen you could wish to meet. If Bruno is Ian Botham, Lewis is David Gower. He describes himself as 'just another buppy' (black urban professional) who wants to earn a fortune from boxing and get out as fast as possible. In spite of his connection with Levitt, it is hard to see him dropping into any kind of shady milieu in the way that Tyson and promoter Don King fit so cosily together. Although born in London, Lennox Lewis grew up in Canada, for which country he won an Olympic gold medal in 1988. A streak of sentiment, Levitt gold and a hunch that Britain might offer a fairer face to a hungry black boxer than North America brought him back home. In Toronto, they still tell the story of how boxing promoter Irving Ungerman, who made his fortune in the chicken business, offered to take the young gold-medal winner, about to turn pro, into his stable, which had once included contender George Chuvalo. Lewis listened attentively and then noted that Ungerman Donovan Boucher, a black welterweight who had ended the career of white hope Shawn O'Sullivan some months earlier. 'Mr Ungerman,' Lewis observed, with the utmost courtesy, 'you manage Donovan Boucher and he knocked out Shawn O'Sullivan who made all those chicken commercials for Swiss Chalet. And you sell the chickens to Swiss Chalet, so now how come Donovan Boucher isn't making any commercials?' For once, the loquacious Ungerman was dumbstruck. One cannot help thinking that a 23-year-old who can handle a chicken magnate so stylishly is going to come out of the Levitt mess in good shape. More important, he may give us the biggest sports cheer of all in 1992 and beyond. Lewis says that if he wins the title he will stage all future defences in Britain.</p>

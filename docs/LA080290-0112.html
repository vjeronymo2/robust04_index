			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WIEDER WAR CHEST SWELLS, TOPS NEUGEBAUER'S 20 TO 1;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGNS: THE SUPERVISOR HAS RAISED $319,000 FOR HER RUNOFF WITH THE  WESTMINSTER COUNCILWOMAN, WHO REPORTS DONATIONS OF $14,542.  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, the only board incumbent facing a  runoff election this fall, has raised a whopping $319,000 -- more than 20 times  the amount raised by her opponent, Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer,  according to the most recent campaign-finance reports.  </P> <P> Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Don R. Roth, who won reelection by wide margins  in the June 5 election, each raised about $235,000 in their respective  campaigns, their reports show.  </P> <P> The reports, which had to be postmarked no later than Tuesday under state law,  detail campaign spending and fund-raising from May 20 through June 30, and  include cumulative totals from earlier periods.  </P> <P> Neugebauer, who has raised only $14,542 in her bid to unseat Wieder in the 2nd  Supervisorial District, said she that was not discouraged by her relatively  small war chest.  </P> <P> "I intend to plan my campaign to win and I don't intend to have it be a battle  of who can raise the most dollars," Neugebauer said. "I will be relying on my  qualifications and not someone else's dollars."  </P> <P> Wieder, who is seeking her fourth term, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Neugebauer, a veteran councilwoman who served three terms as mayor of  Westminster, noted that she spent only $8,802 during the most recent filing  period -- which includes the final days of the June primary race -- but that  she still won enough votes to force a runoff with Wieder. During the same time  period, Wieder spent $145,840, according to her disclosure statement.  </P> <P> Wieder garnered 47.1% of the votes cast in June to Neugebauer's 19.9%, while  three other challengers split the remaining votes. Because no one in the race  received a clear majority, the two top vote-getters face the runoff in  November.  </P> <P> Wieder's disclosure statement shows that her campaign has $35,303 in cash on  hand and no debts. During the latest filing period, her campaign received  $86,085 in contributions from a variety of sources, including developers,  architects, engineers and attorneys.  </P> <P> Her largest single campaign contribution for the period was $2,500, from  Newport Beach-based William Lyon Co., one of the county's largest developers.  </P> <P> Among others who contributed $1,000 to Wieder's campaign are the Building  Industry Assn. of Southern California, the Los Alamitos Racing Assn., the  United Auto Workers and Disneyland.  </P> <P> Also listed among Wieder's contributors is Lettuce Amuse U Comedy School Inc.,  which won an exclusive contract earlier this year from the Board of Supervisors  to run all of the county's traffic-violator schools. The company donated $750  to Wieder.  </P> <P> Neugebauer reported receiving only $2,410 during the last reporting period. The  largest cash donation reported was $400 from a dentist; she also reported  receiving $715 in free printing services. Her campaign has $3,014 in cash on  hand and no debts, according to the statement.  </P></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Forte The fund-raising for Forte's acquisition of Meridien hotels has been well-handled. The hotel group's share price has remained strong while the new equity was raised at only a small discount. Forte had been at pains to point out that it could cover the costs with extra borrowing and played down the idea of a rights issue which would have depressed the price. Yet some form of equity issue always seemed the most likely route. Forte's gearing is already set to rise to over 60 per cent at the year-end due to a change in the balance sheet treatment of sale and leaseback arrangements in line with new accounting conventions. Although this is mostly a matter of presentation, raising new equity does give Forte more flexibility. In particular, it will not be under any time pressure over the sale of its stakes in Alpha Airports and Gardner Merchant. If it had been seen as a forced seller, it would have been unlikely to get the best prices. The fact that Forte has opted for a fairly modest placing rather than a full rights issue may reflect its reluctance to issue shares, or merely to do so at a big discount. Theoretically, the bulk of the new shares were placed on behalf of Meridien's vendors; so institutional investors' pre-emption rules, which limit placings for cash to 7.5 per cent of capital in any three-year period, did not apply. As a result, the shares could be placed with old and new investors at a 4 per cent discount rather than offered to existing shareholders for considerably less. This significant difference rests on an illogical distinction in the pre-emption rules and it is high time they were changed.</p>

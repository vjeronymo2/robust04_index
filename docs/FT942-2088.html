			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Philip Morris It would be too simple to blame Marlboro Friday for the sudden departure of Mr Michael Miles from Philip Morris. True, Dollars 12bn was wiped off the company's market value following its decision to cut the US price of its leading cigarette brand. Shareholders are understandably concerned that they will never see a decent return on that investment, but the shares had been driven up by margins on Marlboro that were unsustainable. The bigger mistakes came earlier, when the price differential between Marlboro and cheaper brands was widened despite falling market share. Since Mr Miles took charge in 1991, though, the bind was partly of his own making. The episode underlines the fact that, despite its food interests, Philip Morris faces bigger challenges in tobacco. It is no coincidence that Mr Miles, who arrived with Kraft Foods in 1988, has been replaced by two tobacco veterans. The margin squeeze experienced across the US industry following Marlboro Friday is likely to change the competitive landscape. BAT Industries' acquisition of American Tobacco in April may be a sign of consolidation to come. The introduction of a new federal excise tax also poses problems, although the sums being mooted are less fearsome than a few months ago. Against that background, Mr Miles' advocacy of plans to split food from tobacco may have seemed like a distraction. While some measures to increase shareholder value would be welcome, squeezing the most from the tobacco business would be a good place to start.</p>

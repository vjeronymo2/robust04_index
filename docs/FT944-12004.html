			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Sainsbury held to 6.5% rise: Plans for new superstores curbed by tougher planning restrictions J Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, said yesterday that tougher government planning restrictions were starting to bite, and it expected to open only 12 new supermarkets next year compared with plans for 20. Speaking the day after the Commons environment committee called for tighter restrictions on out-of-town retail development, Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, reported a 6.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 444.3m from Pounds 417.2m. Last year's figure was restated to take account of new depreciation policies. Mr Sainsbury said the group had won only one out of nine planning appeals this year, and spent Pounds 182m in the first half on new stores, compared with Pounds 309m in the same period last year. 'The difficulty of obtaining planning consent on appeal has become extreme,' he said. 'That has also led to greater difficulty in negotiating consent with local authorities. We do not foresee a reversal of this situation in the near future.' Spending on new UK superstores in the full year is expected to be little more than Pounds 300m. Twenty stores will be built this year, but the number will fall to 12 next year. However, Sainsbury will spend more than Pounds 100m on refurbishing and extending older stores, and Pounds 150m on developing other divisions than its core UK supermarket chain. 'We would prefer to invest in other opportunities rather than acquire sub-standard sites (for supermarkets) with lower returns,' Mr Sainsbury said. Sainsbury last month acquired 50 per cent of voting shares in Giant Food, the Washington DC-based supermarket group, and expects Giant's profits to outweigh financing costs this year. Its existing US business, Shaw's, increased operating profits 44 per cent to Dollars 36.3m (Pounds 24m). With a strong performance from the DIY chain Homebase - where profits grew 34 per cent - the other divisions increased operating profits 26 per cent to Pounds 58.1m. That far outpaced the 7.7 per cent rise in UK supermarket profits to Pounds 405m. Total UK supermarket sales increased 7.7 per cent, of which 7.3 points came from new space. Like-for-like sales volumes, excluding new space, increased 1 per cent, with price deflation of 0.6 per cent. The fall in prices was partly a result of Sainsbury's 'Essentials' price-cutting campaign, which started a year ago, reduced gross margins by 0.2 percentage points. Mr Sainsbury said he believed the campaign had neutralised the threat from low-priced discount competitors, and gross margins could now be held. Total group sales increased 8.2 per cent to Pounds 6.35bn from Pounds 5.87bn. Total UK sales grew 8.3 per cent to Pounds 5.61bn, while US sales increased 7.2 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn (Pounds 735.7m). Group operating profits increased to Pounds 463m from Pounds 421m. The interim dividend was lifted to 3.2p from 3p, with fully diluted earnings per share increasing to 15.93p from 15.45p. Picture, Page 26; Lex, Page 24</p>

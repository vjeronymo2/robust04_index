The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37, in limited circumstances, and to clarify certain definitions in rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change to facilitate compliance with rule G&hyph;37. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the propose rule change from interested persons. As discussed below, the Commission finds good cause for granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The proposed rule change: (i) Provides procedures for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37's prohibition on business, in limited circumstances; and (ii) clarifies certain definitions in rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change to facilitate compliance with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Board's initial proposal on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business and its rule G&hyph;37 filing with the Commission, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  the Board received a number of comments recommending that the Board consider providing, in limited instances, a ``good faith exemption'' to the rule's prohibition on municipal securities business. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In light of these comments, the Board has determined to submit the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved rule G&hyph;37 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621. Rule G&hyph;37 became effective on April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Board previously considered and rejected the inclusion of a good-faith exception to the rule. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33482 (January 14, 1994), 59 FR 3389. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A registered securities association or appropriate regulatory agency may exempt a dealer who is prohibited from engaging in municipal securities business with an issuer from such prohibition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters on rule G&hyph;37 have expressed concern that imposing a prohibition on municipal securities business may be unfair in certain limited situations when political contributions have been made. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  For example, a disgruntled municipal finance professional may make a contribution purposely to injure the dealer, its management or employees. Also, a municipal finance professional eligible to vote for an issuer official may make a number of small contributions during an election cycle ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , over four years) which, when consolidated, amount to slightly over the $250  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , $255). In both examples, the contributions would trigger the prohibition on business under rule G&hyph;37(b), thereby prohibiting the dealer from engaging in municipal securities business with the issuer for two years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See rule G&hyph;37 approval order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board recognizes that in certain circumstances, such as those discussed above, the rule's prohibition on business may be too harsh a consequence for truly inadvertent contributions or the contributions of disgruntled employees. Thus, the Board has determined to add new paragraph (i) to rule G&hyph;37 to establish a procedure whereby the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') and the federal bank regulatory agencies ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), upon application by a dealer subject to such association's or agency's inspection and enforcement authority, may exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, a dealer who is prohibited from engaging in municipal securities business from such prohibition. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In determining whether to grant such an exemption, the proposed rule change would require that the NASD and bank regulatory agencies consider, among other factors, whether: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD and the bank regulatory agencies are statutorily authorized to inspect for compliance with, and to enforce Board rules.

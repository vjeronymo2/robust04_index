			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Andonovski: "The Circle Is Closed"] </F>   [Text] The strategists of the U.S. State Department and  the White House were probably not aware of what a small  signature on the decision for recognition of Macedonia meant for  the 2 million citizens "out there in the Balkans." It really is  possible to paraphrase here the words of the first man who  stepped on the moon -- Neil Armstrong -- "this may be a small  step for the United States, but it is an enormous one for  Macedonia." No matter which positions we start from in  assessing the act of recognition and establishment of full  diplomatic relations between Macedonia and the United States, it  certainly is true it is of greatest political importance after  the proclamation of the independence of Macedonia and its  admission to the United Nations. Therefore, the process of  international integration of Macedonia has come full circle, and  Macedonia has passed a thorny road full of obstacles in  confirming its own position, its own policy, its model of  organized state in the last few years, always starting from the  positions of a small but peaceful country in the center of the  Balkans.    If Macedonia needed a final proof that the United States  wants Macedonia to exist and survive, the proof is here. The  Macedonian official foreign policy assessed the recognition as a  logical ending of the efforts involved in the past period in  persuading the world not only of the endurance, but also of the  democratic orientation and peaceful policy of our country. The  more emotional ones assess the great success of the Macedonian  diplomacy as a jewel in the crown of the recognitions that  Macedonia has experienced since the proclamation of its  independence. It is an indisputable fact that the diplomatic  strategy and tactics applied in the past period produced results  and that the meticulous and cautious policy convinced all those  who were skeptical. There is also the fact that the biggest and  most influential economic, political, and military force in the  world, by recognizing Macedonia, made it clear that Macedonia is  in its interest, and that it will contribute to the promotion of  stability in the region by this act. If we assess the  activities of the Macedonian diplomacy, we must admit that the  success is even greater because it was achieved without any  preconditioning by the state which, to be honest, could have  afforded that. Therefore, by recognizing Macedonia, the United  States confirmed its policy of principles, which some had  started to doubt. The United States started this confirmation  with the sponsoring of our membership in the United Nations,  with its support for our inclusion in international financial  institutions, and with humanitarian and technical aid, getting  now to a logical ending. By doing that, it made clear to  everyone that the independence and stability of Macedonia is in  its interest, too, and a factor and a condition for solving a  part of the problems in the region.    In that context we must speak of what postponed, and  sometimes made uncertain the achievement of equality between the  world's most powerful force and the small country in the Balkans  -- the dispute with Greece. That was exactly the reason for  blocking the recognition of peaceful Macedonia. All our pleas  for cooperation, mutual respect for territorial integrity of  neighbors, and respect for borders, remained in the shadow of  that dispute. Resilience and honesty was shown by Macedonia in  innumerable practical examples, and now the United States  accepted it not as a verbal mimicry, but as an autochtonous  policy with deep roots in the behavior and practice of our  country.    Therefore, the recognition of Macedonia by the United States  is really multifaceted. If it is a message to Macedonia that  its model of state organization is functional and applicable for  the Balkans, that can also be a message to the other countries  in this region and at large, that it is possible to endure and  survive in merely impossible conditions via a sincere and  good-neighborly and peaceful policy. The support of the United  States for Macedonian policy is exceptionally important and it  can contribute to a faster and more efficient settlement of the  problems which emerged in the relations with Greece. With this  act of recognition it was once again reaffirmed that an open and  direct dialogue is the only possible and correct way of  constructing good neighborliness and measures of mutual  confidence. That is why good will is needed, which is the only  possible way of solving the open questions in the mutual  relations, through a constructive spirit and indispensable  flexibility from both sides. Macedonia has practically been  sending this message since the very beginning of the problems,  which has been accepted by almost the whole international  community.    Undoubtedly, the act of the United States represents a  certain closing of the circle of recognition of the Republic of  Macedonia, initiated with the admission of our country into the  United Nations. Macedonia has been now recognized by all five  permanent member countries of the UN Security Council, and it is  quite normal to expect the other members of the United Nations,  like Canada, Australia, and others, of vital interest for  Macedonia, to recognize it and establish full diplomatic  relations with Macedonia.    Besides the pleasure, there is also the obligation of  Macedonia to continue on the same road which ensured its  international identification and to be constantly open to all  initiatives leading to peace, cooperation, and mutual confidence  in the Balkans.</p>

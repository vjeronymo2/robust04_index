			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEOTAPE IS CENTERPIECE OF 'VICTORVILLE 5' BRUTALITY LAWSUIT;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE ARREST WAS RECORDED BY A NEIGHBOR. BUT A LAWYER FOR 6 SAN  BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES SAYS THE TAPE DOESN'T SHOW ALL THAT  HAPPENED.  </P> <P> It began on a hot summer morning in 1988, when authorities responded to a  complaint about an all-night party in a front yard in an otherwise quiet  Victorville neighborhood.  </P> <P> When it was over, six San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies had used batons,  elbows, fists and chokeholds to restrain five Mexican citizens.  </P> <P> The men claimed police brutality. Deputies said their use of potentially deadly  force was justified because one of the men pushed an officer, then grabbed for  the guns of two deputies in a scuffle. The others, the deputies said, had tried  to come to the man's aid.  </P> <P> What no one knew is that a next-door neighbor captured part of that explosive  confrontation on videotape. Viewings of the tape of that June 30, 1988,  incident fueled the anger of the local Latino community.  </P> <P> Now, that four-minute tape -- which appears to show several uniformed officers  using fists and batons on men who offered little resistance -- is at the heart  of a multimillion-dollar civil rights lawsuit being tried in U.S. District  Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The video camera has long been a tool of law enforcement, as in the FBI's  Abscam sting targeting U.S. congressmen in 1980. But this civil trial  represents one of the first uses of a videotape as evidence against police in  federal court, said Stephen Yagman, an attorney for the Mexicans, who have  become known as the "Victorville Five."  </P> <P> "We will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers mercilessly and  viciously beat these plaintiffs, injured them, and did that with the knowledge  that no one would ever know," Yagman told jurors in opening statements last  week. "And even when the videotape came to light, (San Bernardino County  Sheriff Floyd Tidwell) took out his big stamp and stamped it and said (of the  deputies' actions) 'That's OK.' "  </P> <P> But David D. Lawrence, attorney for the six deputies, contends that the  videotape is only a partial account that fails to show the hostile behavior of  the five men that led to the deputies' use of force. Moreover, he says, actions  portrayed on the videotape are not what they seem. U.S. District Judge A.  Wallace Tashima last week denied Lawrence's motion to block jurors from viewing  the tape.  </P> <P> Latino community activists, meanwhile, see the videotape as the first  incontrovertible proof that a pattern of abuse by police exists in San  Bernardino County.  </P> <P> "The difference that makes this case of the Victorville Five stand out is the  videotape," said Armando Navarro, executive director of the Institute for  Social Justice, a San Bernardino-based civil rights group. "I've dealt for 21  years in community activism, but I've never had something so classic, showing  the violence in living color."  </P> <P> Also monitoring the trial closely is the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles,  which has become increasingly active in cases of alleged discrimination against  Mexican citizens in the Southland. A representative of the consulate has sat in  the courtroom since the trial began last week.  </P> <P> The case "is extremely important," said acting Consul General Mario Nunez  Mariel, who hopes a victory for the plaintiffs will help end what he called  violence and discrimination against Mexican citizens by U.S. law enforcement  officers. "We think it is the right time for stopping all kinds of abuses and  violations of human rights of Mexican citizens in this country," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sheriff a Defendant  </P> <P> The defendants in the lawsuit are Sheriff Tidwell, San Bernardino County, Sgt.  Tim Miller, Deputies Mark Swagger, Mike Stout and Joe Lee Phillips, and Sgt.  John Gocke, who was a deputy at the time. Also named is Deputy Paul Schmidt,  who now works for the Nevada County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Lawrence said the suit seeks $5 million in damages for each of the five  plaintiffs -- Jose Serrano, his father, Efren, and his brother, Victor, as well  as friends Auro Ruiz and Javier Ruelas.  </P> <P> Some elements in the case are not in dispute: The Serrano family and their two  friends had been playing loud music and drinking beer in their front yard on  5th Street since 9 p.m. on June 29. A neighbor complained to the Sheriff's  Department that the men were still partying at 10 a.m. the next day and  urinating in the yard.  </P> <P> Both sides agree that arriving deputies asked the men to take their party  indoors, and that one deputy followed Jose Serrano into his house to persuade  him to get the others to comply. Deputy Schmidt also did not leave the house  despite Serrano's repeated requests to do so, until an increasingly irritated  Serrano started out the door.  </P> <P> At that point, deputies contend, Jose Serrano shoved the deputy and a struggle  ensued. Schmidt testified that when he put his arm around Serrano's neck in an  effort to use a "carotid control hold," he felt Serrano's hand reaching for the  gun on Schmidt's right hip.  </P> <P> Deputy Phillips testified that, as Schmidt forced Serrano to the ground,  Serrano reached forward for Phillips' gun and that he shoved Serrano's arm away  and helped Schmidt to handcuff the still-struggling man.  </P> <P> Hearing the commotion, a next-door neighbor known only as "Chava" turned on his  video camera and began recording the events through a window of his house. A  few days later, he gave the tape to a Latino activist and is now said to be  living in Mexico, where he cannot be found.  </P> <P> The videotape begins recording the action at about the time that the two  deputies were trying to carry off the handcuffed Jose Serrano, who was  clutching a porch railing.  </P> <P> The tape -- played, rewound and replayed for jurors repeatedly last week --  shows Phillips yanking on a night stick under Serrano's arm. It also shows  Phillips jamming his elbow down between Serrano's shoulder blades -- in an  effort, the deputy testified, to release the man's grasp. At one point,  Phillips is heard to say, "Now you're mine."  </P> <P> The videotape shows other deputies who had arrived at the scene.  </P> <P> One of them, Deputy Swagger, swings his baton at two seated men -- Efren and  Victor Serrano, and one blow appears to strike Efren Serrano in the head. But  Swagger testified that he struck him in the forearm and legs in an effort to  stop the two men, who he claimed were moving forward off a couch to try to help  Jose Serrano.  </P> <P> The tape also shows Swagger striking Jose Serrano three times while the latter  was on the ground, handcuffed. Swagger testified that the first two blows hit  the ground and that he only struck Serrano on the leg once to subdue him.  </P> <P> At another point, Swagger ordered Efren and Victor Serrano to stand, and  another deputy ordered them to sit down. The conflicting orders were repeated  and one of the deputies pushed the men back down on the couch.  </P> <P> "It was kind of confusing" and demeaning, testified Mary Frances Henry, a  neighbor who watched part of the incident from her porch across the street.  </P> <P> The videotape then shows deputies dragging Jose Serrano away.  </P> <P> Yagman said the Serranos and their two friends suffered cuts and bruises as a  result of the beatings, which he described as "brutal, unprovoked" attacks.  They were not hospitalized.  </P> <P> The attorney also noted that only one of the men was charged in the case. Those  charges, he said, stemmed from a small amount of cocaine found in Jose  Serrano's wallet. Yagman told jurors that while the man has pleaded guilty and  entered a drug diversion program, Serrano denies that the cocaine was his.  Yagman alleged that the cocaine was planted in Serrano's wallet after it was  taken from him.  </P> <P> Yagman contends that the officers had no right to enter Serrano's house without  a warrant and that, at a minimum, they were required to leave after Serrano's  repeated requests. Yagman also contends that the men were doing nothing illegal  by drinking on private property and were not required to go inside as deputies  had ordered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contradictions  </P> <P> The deputies have testified that they were acting within their legal authority  throughout the incident.  </P> <P> Much of the questioning in the trial has centered on contradictions in various  written and recorded statements made by the deputies to their superiors and  during pretrial depositions.  </P> <P> For example, initial written statements made by the officers before the  videotape's existence was made public by Latino activists do not mention some  of the blows depicted on the tape. There are further discrepancies between the  videotape and subsequent statements to Sheriff's Department internal affairs  officers, Yagman said.  </P> <P> Regardless of the verdict of the four-man, four-woman jury in the case of the  Victorville Five, relations between the Sheriff's Department and Latinos in San  Bernardino County have improved dramatically since the 1988 altercation, say  Latino activists.  </P> <P> "I think (the videotape of the confrontation) was really the catalyst" for the  change, said Felix G. Diaz, a Latino community leader in Victorville and member  of the local high school district school board.  </P> <P> "They are doing more now than they ever did before to resolve problems of  communication with minority communities," Diaz said, citing cultural awareness  seminars for deputies and community members that the Sheriff's Department has  sponsored in Victorville and elsewhere.  </P></p>

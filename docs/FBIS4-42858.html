			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] There are no ideological differences  within the Socialist Party (PS), wrote Orlando Raimundo in the  21 May Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, but only different roads to  power. The "saga" of the PS, which has already "sacrificed" two  secretaries general--Vitor Constancio and Jorge Sampaio--is  permanently marked by a lack of faith in the leader, Raimundo  continued, fomented by a president [Mario Soares] who "insists  that everything be done his way." Besides his own--mostly  young--allies, PS leader Antonio Guterres seems to have only  poll results on his side. Were Guterres to lose the 12 June  European Parliament elections, hostilities would immediately  begin, centering on how to bring about Prime Minister Cavaco  Silva's downfall, the socialists' "great obsession" in recent  years, Raimundo contended. However, if the PS wins, victory  would be "devalued" and Guterres would only get, once again,  "the benefit of the doubt." Meanwhile, Raimundo continued,  various party officials are waiting in the background to decide  about reentering the scene.    According to Raimundo, the PS's "hard core" is formed by  Guterres partisans who throw themselves wholeheartedly in the  struggle to prove the validity of their strategy, which aims at  removing the PS's leftist stigma and waiting for disillusioned  "Cavacoists" to join them. Their rallying point is the clash  with President Soares. The group includes Antonio Vitorino, who  heads the PS list for the Euroelections, Jorge Coelho, Jose  Lamego, Arons de Carvalho, and Jorge Lacao.    The group around former Minister of Defense Jaime Gama  includes Eduardo Pereira, Jose Lello, and Miranda Calha. Absent  in recent years from the political debate because of their  leader's "desertion," they are attempting a comeback by  supporting Gama as an alternative to Guterres. While Gama seems  to be a "born loser," he still wields a measure of influence,  according to Raimundo.    The Sampaio group--Joao Cravinho, Alberto Martins, Antonio  Costa, Lopes Cardoso, and Ferro Rodrigues--aims at ensuring  Sampaio's candidacy for the presidency and reunifying the Left.  Like President Soares, they want internal diversity and a  plurality of opinions.    Betting on the values of humanism and of the Left, the  Soares  group, formed by Almeida Santos, Manuel Alegre, and Antonio  Campos "cannot reconcile itself with the `tragedy' of a country  governed by the Right," but lacks a strategy and an alternative  to Guterres.    Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes "runs on his own track," keeps  intact his presidential ambitions, and is best placed to succeed  Guterres, according to Raimundo, despite his trumpeted  solidarity with the PS leader.    The "free" group, which includes PS official Joao Soares,  former General Workers Union (UGT) leader Torres Couto, and PS  luminary Vitor Constancio, is awaiting electoral results to  decide its future course.</p>

You and the road, you and the elements, generally a  freedom feeling," the 70-year old Forbes said Sunday before leaving Glendale on  a red-and-black Harley-Davidson. An estimated 5,000 bikers navigated the  circuitous, 100-mile route to a ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, raising  $500,000 in pledges for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. and the Jerry Lewis ALS  Center.  </P> <P> Entertainers at the post-ride barbecue at the Calamigos Ranch included  motorcycle aficionado David Crosby.  </P></p>

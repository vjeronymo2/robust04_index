			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Citicorp, Chase apply to open Russian operations CITICORP and Chase Manhattan, two of the largest US banks, have applied for banking licences to operate in Russia as part of a strategy to strengthen their east European presence. The licences would be the first granted in Russia to US banks, and would follow one given last August to Credit Lyonnais to open a full subsidiary, and to Bank Austria to open a branch. Both Citicorp and Chase have representative offices in Moscow. Chase Manhattan said it had obtained internal approval to set up the subsidiaries, while Citicorp is understood to be going through the process to obtain board approval. Mr Mikhail Pomazkov, head of foreign banking operations at Russia's central bank, said it had signed letters of intent with the banks. He forecast that the licences might be granted by the end of 1993. The banks would be capitalised at Dollars 5m each, the minimum required for foreign banks to operate in Russia. Unlike representative offices, they would be able to provide local banking services, such as granting letters of credit, settle payments, and take deposits. Mr Richard Lowry, senior vice-president at Chase in London, said the subsidiary would initially serve European and US customers, with a number already interested in Russia's oil, metals and mining industries. Chase's representative office, in Moscow for more than 20 years, has up to now mainly helped Russia in dealings with international financial markets. Mr Lowry believed Russia was likely to limit the number of foreign banks able to operate in the country, and the decision to seek a licence was 'a tactical move to get to the front of the queue'. Chase intended to open one subsidiary concentrating on corporate finance, and was 'highly unlikely' to open a retail bank. Citicorp was likely to follow a similar strategy, said an official. Citicorp has branches or subsidiaries in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, believing that the market opening of eastern Europe offers profitable opportunities in corporate banking. It has no immediate plans for a retail bank.</p>

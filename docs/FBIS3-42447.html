			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major V. Afanasyev] </F>   [Text] The UDM universal heavy construction vehicle is  designed for preparing and maintaining troop movement routes.  Its operating equipment includes a loader or double-jaw fork and  a swinging dozer blade.    When preparing troop movement routes, the vehicle performs  the following types of work: Working and moving soil; making  crossings over ditches, craters, and ravines; laying  cross-country routes on terrain with low forest growth, brush,  and rocks; laying cross-country routes over unpacked snow and  clearing snow off roads; erecting crossing ramps; digging  ditches; and loading bulk materials.    When equipping the UDM with a double-jaw device, it becomes  possible to perform additional work such as clearing  obstructions, piling and stacking lengthy objects (logs, pipe,  and so forth), and loading lengthy objects and rubble into  transport vehicles.

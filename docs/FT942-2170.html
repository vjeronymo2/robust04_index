			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Rise in high-street rents forecast High-street shop rents will start growing at the beginning of next year, says a report by chartered surveyors Erdman Lewis. Rents are static in town centres, although there has already been a reduction in incentives offered by landlords from an average of 18 months' rent to six months' rent. But tight retail margins and intense out-of-town competition means that rental growth is unlikely to exceed inflation in the short term. 'Retailers, while dusting down limited expansion programmes, show no enthusiasm to pay higher rentals. Overheads remain their paramount concern,' the report says. Outside town centres, there has been strong demand for property as retailers strengthen their operations and new traders join the market. However, some larger units remain empty because they are poorly located and require sub-dividing to achieve successful lettings. Rents for out-of-town retail units, excluding food, rose by 4.3 per cent in the year to May 1994. Erdman Lewis expects that out-of-town retail units will continue to show rent increases above inflation if the consumer-led recovery continues. The level of money being poured into the sector has produced the lowest yields for several years and record levels for retail warehouses. Investor demand for out-of-town stores has pushed yields down by at least 2 per cent to 6 per cent. Erdman Lewis 1994 Midsummer Retail Report. Erdman Lewis, 6 Grosvenor Street, London W1X OAD.</p>

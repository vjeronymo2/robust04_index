			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Universities win extra funds ADDITIONAL teaching funds will be provided next year to English universities to attract more part-time students and to encourage growth in science, engineering and technology. Details published yesterday of the allocation of the Pounds 2.3bn budget of the Higher Education Funding Council for England for 1993-94 show that Pounds 45m will be provided to fund additional places meeting these priorities. There will also be a big rise in funding for research, with the former polytechnics receiving a five-fold increase on their transition to university status.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour ready for union offensive SUPPORT within the Labour party for the proposals loosening the party's links with the unions is to be mobilised shortly in a counter-attack to the campaign against the reforms mounted by some of the largest unions. Since February, when Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, threw his weight behind the plans to end the unions' ability to vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates and in the election of leader and deputy leader, some of the biggest unions have been vigorously opposing the move. At least some of the biggest unions will need to be won over, as the unions will still account for 70 per cent of the total vote when the issue is discussed at the party's annual conference in October. The basis of the decision will be a recommendation from the ruling National Executive Committee, which will be drawn up in July, after the present consultation period is over. The counter-attack is intended to shame the unions into not using their block votes to kill the reforms. It will highlight the extent of support for the changes within the constituency parties as well as among Labour MPs, and underline the weapon that would be handed to the Tories if the reforms were defeated. Most prominent in the campaign against the loosening of the links have been the Transport and General Workers Union, the GMB general union, and the National Union of Public Employees. But late last month Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, voted narrowly to retain a union vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates, against the recommendation of the union's executive. Mr Bryan Gould, a former shadow minister and candidate for the Labour leadership, last night accused the party of failing to land a blow on the Tories 'through the worst recession for two generations' in the influential left-of-centre paper Tribune.</p>

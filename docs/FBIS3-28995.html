			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States have agreed to carry on efforts to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said in Washington on Thursday.  "Our two countries decided to exert all available efforts to  settle the nuclear question through dialogue until the regular  Board of Governors' meeting of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) opens (on Feb. 21)," Han said.    He made the remarks to reporters at the Watergate Hotel  following talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore and National  Security Adviser Anthony Lake at the White House.    "It is true there are some hard-line voices in the United  States with respect to the nuclear question," said Han. "But,  the United States' official policy direction now is to carry on  with dialogue."    The two countries, Han said, also shared views on the  importance of maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula, even  though the peninsula is not in a state of crisis now.    Discussing recent efforts by the five permanent members of  the U.N. Security Council to adopt a statement on North Korea,  Minister Han said dialogue was discussed as part of its policy  on the North Korean nuclear question. "The five countries can  pool their opinions for conveyance to North Korea," he said.    Han said that if the nuclear question were referred to the  U.N. Security Council, it would choose one of two available  options. The first is to begin with a resolution on North Korea,  followed by weak sanctions initially and stronger steps later:  The second is to impose sanctions from the start after a  certain period of time passes.    Regarding China's future role, Han said its behavior at the  Security Council depends on how far "we have striven to resolve  the question peacefully."    "Substantial achievements have been made between Seoul and  Beijing through direct discussions and cooperation. I believe  China will continue to try to settle the question peacefully in  what they think is the best manner," the minister said.    On the possibility of the United States and North Korea  resuming contacts in New York, Han said there are no plans to do  so at the moment. He was quick to add, however, that "we think  it is better to have an exchange of opinions in whatever form."    Minister Han is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry on Friday  afternoon to discuss the nuclear question. The talks will be  preceded by an earlier meeting between Han and Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Tom Hubbard and several other senior State Department  officials.</p>

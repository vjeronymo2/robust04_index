			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Attack on town breaks ceasefire in Georgia GEORGIAN government troops last night attacked the Black Sea port of Poti, breaking a ceasefire agreed with supporters of ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Reuter reports. Troops loyal to the military council now ruling Georgia opened fire shortly after the 5pm GMT expiry of a deadline for Poti to surrender. The troops had advanced to within 400 metres of the pro-Gamsakhurdia forces. But a further advance had been made difficult because the city's defenders had bombed one of two bridges providing access to Poti. The other bridge was barricaded off with concrete blocks. Poti is one of the few remaining towns controlled by Mr Gamsakhurdia's supporters in west Georgia, his home region where he has launched an attempt to regain power from the military alliance that drove him from the capital Tbilisi three weeks ago. Mr Jaba Ioseliani, co-chairman of the military council, said peace talks that had been going on throughout the day had failed. 'War is inevitable. There is no other way.' There was uncertainty about the fate of the other main redoubt of Gamsakhurdia support, Zugdidi to the north. Its inhabitants had spent the day in fear of an attack from government troops about 25km away after failing to meet a deadline to surrender. Mr Gamsakhurdia's representative there, Mr Volter Shurgaya, told reporters earlier that Mr Ioseliani had threatened to attack unless the town's railway station was unblocked. Inside his local government headquarters overlooking the town square, there had been bedlam as panic-stricken citizens thronged corridors and banged on his door in search of news. But by late evening a crowd of several hundred, huddling around bonfires in the square in heavy snow, had dwindled to about a dozen. There was no sign of preparations for armed resistance although the military council said around 800 armed men had taken refuge in Zugdidi.</p>

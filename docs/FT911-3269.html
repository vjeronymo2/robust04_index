			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Mandela holds 'cordial' talks with Major: De Klerk moves on to Denmark to plead for easing of sanctions MR Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC), yesterday held what he called 'cordial and productive' talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, but said they 'did not see eye to eye' on some issues, including sanctions. Mr Mandela, who arrived in London shortly after President F W de Klerk left for Denmark on the second leg of his three-nation European visit, also expressed his opposition to the planned visit to South Africa later this year by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. Speaking at a press conference after the hour-long session with Mr Major, the first meeting between the two men, Mr Mandela said that Pretoria should be kept isolated and under pressure during negotiations for a post-apartheid South Africa. British officials said that Mr Major stressed that he and the ANC leader shared a common objective - the ending of apartheid - but maintained that lifting sanctions encouraged the reform process. At the press conference, Mr Mandela repeated his threat to break off talks with Pretoria on May 9 if President de Klerk did not take further steps to end township violence. In Denmark, Mr de Klerk failed to persuade parliamentarians to back the European Community's recent decision in principle to lift the embargo on imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins. The minority Conservative government led by Mr Minister Poul Schluter, who was due to meet Mr de Klerk, is unable to enact Community policy without the approval of the Danish parliament. Conservatives argue that Pretoria should be rewarded for its reforms, but opposition parties in parliament's Market Affairs Committee, led by the Social Democrats, won a vote to maintain sanctions against South Africa. In theory, Denmark can exercise an effective veto over implementation of the Community decision to lift sanctions. But Community officials suggested yesterday that in practice continued Danish opposition would do no more than cause a delay.</p>

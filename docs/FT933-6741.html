			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Japan's industry feels the pain of a strong yen: 'The most difficult problem is people.' SOME 175 skilled Japanese workers will from next month make an unfamiliar journey. Toyota Motor, Japan's industrial flagship, is for the first time seconding employees to an affiliate because it has no work for them at its own plants. Toyota, usually the country's top income earner, is suffering the twin impact of dull domestic demand and a currency crunch on export margins - the group warned yesterday it faced an operating loss if the yen stays strong. The 175 have not lost their jobs, as might happen at Toyota's western rivals, but the security of working for Japan's most admired automotive group has been rattled. Japan has seen a number of previous assumptions upset this summer. The latest rise in the yen has left the currency up by nearly a sixth against the dollar since January, throwing exporters' earnings forecasts out of kilter. A domestic economic upturn glimpsed in the spring has failed to materialise. Company executives' decisions are further clouded by official policy uncertainties. The new government averred when it took office two and a half weeks ago that it would maintain the basic economic stance of promoting non-inflationary growth pursued by its Liberal Democratic party predecessor. But ministers in the seven-party coalition are in apparently increasing discord on how to proceed. An autumn public spending package remains uncertain, the cabinet is divided over whether any income tax cuts should be offset by a VAT increase or by government borrowing, and some analysts are playing down previous expectations that the official discount rate will be cut next month from its already historic low of 2.5 per cent. Business leaders are urging the government to act. Mr Kosaku Inaba, new chairman of the 1.5m-member Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said on Tuesday income taxes and the discount rate should both be cut, even if this meant creating a deficit which had to be funded through a government bond issue. The Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, in its monthly economic review maintained this week that the economic slowdown appeared to be coming to an end but acknowledged that clear indications of recovery remained absent. Fixed investment by manufacturers continued to decline, it noted. The automotive sector, export-reliant and with sales at home also down some 10 per cent this year, is having to revise earlier, already modest, expenditure plans. Nissan, the second-largest automotive group, is cutting capital spending by another Y20bn (Pounds 129m) this year on top of an original Y30bn reduction. Mazda said this week it was seeking further economies than envisaged in an adjustment plan unveiled only in June. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said yesterday there was a limit to the measures one company could implement in a short time. Such new investment commitments as are being made in Japan are mostly for high value-added products: NEC, the electronics group, is spending Y30bn to make liquid crystal display colour screens in western Japan, the market for which is growing by 40 per cent a year. Manufacturers in sectors such as consumer electronics say that when they are shifting output of more standard lines abroad, the question remains of what to do with the workers left at home. In a culture which inhibits redundancies 'the most difficult problem is people,' says Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo Electric. Many company executives say they have already done what they can to counter the adverse effects of the high yen, and suggest that it is now the government's turn. 'We would like to see the Japanese government step up efforts for a stimulus to the economy. We are disappointed they have been so slow,' says Mr Takeshi Kondo, head of political and economic research at Itochu, a leading trading house. Mr Ichizo Ishitsubo, president of Clarion, the car audio manufacturer, adds: 'Last autumn we took great pains to draw up a restructuring plan and we did everything we needed to do in the latest half-year.' The workers that Toyota is transferring will now help produce a popular line of recreational vehicles for Toyota's smaller Auto Body associate. With no sight yet of a government programme to jump-start the economy they, like the rest of Japanese industry, are left wondering what happens down the road.</p>

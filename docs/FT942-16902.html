			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (1): Service now worth having  -While recovery in the hotel market has been patchy, the message of the past few years is clear: hotel guests are demanding better service for less money. Even when the world economy has fully recovered, this trend is likely to survive During the 1980s, hotels around the world treated their guests so lavishly that people joked that the next treat would be a BMW on your pillow. By the early 1990s, hotel executives had stopped smiling and so had their guests. The Gulf War was followed by recession in the US and Europe. Hotel room rates fell, managers in many businesses lost their jobs, other feared they would do so, and everyone started cutting their travel expenses. Hotel business has now picked up in North America, London, and in much of Asia, where the downturn had not been so severe. The question hotel executives are asking is whether their guests will return to the free-spending habits of the 1980s, or whether their behaviour has changed for good. Mr Peter George, chief executive, of the Ladbroke Group of the UK, which owns the Hilton International chain, believes that hoteliers should not lose sight of the principles of supply and demand. Hotel rates have been depressed because rooms have been empty. When rooms are full again, rates will rise, he says. Mr Darryl Hartley-Leonard, the British-born president of Hyatt Hotels, believes, however, that hoteliers need to be aware of a more fundamental change. It is not just that hotel guests have been unable to afford additional luxuries over the past few years. Even when they have more money in their pocket, they will not want those luxuries, he believes. In a speech to a conference three years ago, Mr Hartley-Leonard recounted the BMW joke, and admitted that Hyatt had been as responsible as any other organisation for the hotel excesses of the 1980s. He said: 'The excesses of the 1980s have become socially unacceptable. We simply need to wake up and take advantage of new times. 'Less is more' doesn't mean quality has to deteriorate. It means that when you serve a Bloody Mary, you don't have to serve a vegetable garden on top of it. Hyatt, as much as any company, was responsible for growing that vegetable garden. It seems that all of us kept piling more and more on to the customer until it became crude.' Three years on, Mr Hartley-Leonard believes the reaction against hotel excesses will continue after an upturn in business. 'What happened in the US and what is happening in many parts of the world is that an element of conservatism is coming in. In the 1970s and 1980s matters got out of control. We created an unstable business environment. That has caused a rejection of waste. Anything that is reminiscent of the excesses of the 1980s is rejected as inappropriate,' he says. Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice president for marketing and strategic planning at Inter-Continental Hotels, agrees, arguing that the change in hotel guests' attitudes mirrors developments in sectors such as retailing. Customers are not necessarily looking for the cheapest offer but they are considering their purchases more carefully. Mr Stajdel says: 'I don't think any consumer today shops the way he or she used to. We have all changed the way we shop in the supermarket. I look at the labels, the freshness of the goods, and at the overall cost.' Mr Stajdel, who is based in London, believes hotel guests will pay for services, if they believe they are worth having. So what services do hotel guests value? Hyatt's research shows that while hotel guests want choice, they do not need an excessive amount of it. They expect hotel restaurants to have enough staff to ensure they can be served promptly. Indeed, they want to spend less time in the restaurant than in the past. Offered a choice between a wine list with 100 bottles on it and one with 30, Hyatt says its guests opt for the smaller list. There are some new services that hotels need to introduce because guests constantly ask for them. Because 63 per cent of calls to its housekeeping departments were for an iron and an ironing board, Hyatt decided it was simpler to put these items in every room. Hotels in North America, Europe and Asia agree that hotel guests want less hassle and more time in which to work. Business travellers are expected to do more work on their trips than ever before and they are even prepared to pay extra for an environment which enables them to work more efficiently. This has led to the appearance in hotels of a service which airlines have been selling for years: special business sections for those prepared to pay for them. Business floors in hotels appeared in Asia some years back. Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, has such floors at its establishments in Singapore, Manila and Jakarta, where guests have their own check-in and check-out facilities and lounges, as well as facsimile machines in every bedroom. Inter-Continental, which also has business floors in Asia, has now begun to introduce them in Europe. The first was in Frankfurt, and the second is in London. Mr Stajdel describes the floors as having 'the ambience of a private club. It's intimate and clubby. There's a complimentary continental breakfast, a business centre, and a library with reference books and magazines.' Guests pay Dollars 25-Dollars 30 a night extra for the privilege. Mr Stajdel admits that one of the incentives for introducing business floors is that small, intimate 'boutique' hotels had been taking business away from the large chains. He argues that business floors provide guests with the intimacy and service of a small hotel, while still providing access to facilities only available in a large establishment, such as a choice of restaurants and a fitness centre. Even those hotel guests not paying to stay on the business floors have higher service expectations. Mr Hartley-Leonard says that they now want efficient business services rather than lavish gifts, and they want messages delivered on time and access to telephones and facsimile machines. If hotels are to deliver these services while still achieving acceptable levels of profits, they need to turn to technology to help them to do so. Technology can help to reduce the amount of time that travellers waste in hanging around. At Hyatt's hotels at O'Hare airport in Chicago and in Atlanta, the company has been testing automated check-in machines which, if successful, will be introduced throughout North America. Mr Hartley-Leonard says the machines are not designed to replace the reception desk, but to provide an alternative for guests who want simply to collect their keys and go straight to their rooms. The device looks like a bank's automated teller machine. A guest with a reservation inserts a credit card. Check-in information appears on the screen, the guest taps a series of Yes or No buttons, and the machine dispenses a room key. Guests can also check out of the hotel by inserting a credit card into the machine, which shows the expenses they have incurred during their stay and prints out a copy of the bill. Some people might regard the hotel checking-in machine as providing too impersonal a welcome after a long trip. Mr Hartley-Leonard argues that the same was thought about automatic cash dispensers. In time, these caught on.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS* 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Income                                       Average                Before                           Occupancy     Daily      Total      Fixed                                Rate      Rate    Revenue    Charges                                   %   Dollars    Dollars    Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All hotels                     61.6     72.20     32,968      8,469 Africa and the Middle East     60.8     65.82     30,666      8,329 Middle East                    72.4     66.21     42,683     13,288 Africa                         60.8     65.40     27,265      4,067 Asia and Australasia           69.7     77.93     34,937      9,735 Asia                           71.0     84.51     36,985     14,130 North Asia                     83.4     65.19     35,4593    10,889 Australia                      58.3     85.53     33,138      4,539 North America                  60.1     55.13     18,183      3,551 Canada                         54.3     69.85     21,427      3,620 United States                  60.1     54.33     17,794      3,551 Europe                         60.6     77.16     38,363     10,019 Continental Europe             62.4     104.3     44,570     10,243 United Kingdom                 58.0     70.41     36,431     10,325 Latin America                  58.7     58.05     19,645      2,455 Mexico                         60.4     66.31     24,285      2,552 South America                  50.1     44.73     15,747      2,775 Caribbean                      72.3     29.36     17,639      1,422  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on medians  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Howarth International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

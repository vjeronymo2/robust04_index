Syrian sources said that nothing would achieve "calm and  relaxation in the region" like an Israeli initiative to withdraw  from the occupied territories. The sources pointed out that the  policy of "evasion" has achieved nothing for the Israelis so  far, and some 27 months have elapsed since the peace process  began. And "the occupation has not achieved, nor will it  achieve, security for Israel. Peace is the guarantee of  security, and peace depends on complete withdrawal from the  occupied territories."    The sources said that the peace process between the Arabs  and  Israelis is now "at the final turning point: Either it will  overcome the challenge successfully or it will fail," especially  after the Hebron massacre. The sources pointed out that the  Jordanian, Lebanese, and Syrian tracks have not achieved any  progress so far, "as the Israelis spend their negotiations with  the Jordanians talking about economic cooperation, not  withdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories."    The Syrian sources, which reflect the official view, went on  to say that Syria has invited the parties concerned to meet in  Damascus in the light of Israel's refusal to comply with the  demand for peace and withdrawal from the occupied territories.  The sources said: "If a change emerges in the Israeli position  to move the peace process toward the establishment of a real  peace, the Arab parties will show every possible response" when  the bilateral negotiations resume in Washington.</p>

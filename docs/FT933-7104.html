			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Good faith at risk - Lloyd's case reveals a lacuna in English law, according to A H Hermann The dispute between Mrs Patricia Ashmore and other Lloyd's Names and the Corporation of Lloyd's, will be heard by the Court of Appeal in February next year. It has been before the courts since 1988. After much effort and money was spent on the full trial, the Corporation asked that the preliminary issues of law be tried first, thus avoiding publicity for the underlying facts. The plaintiffs' objections were overruled by the Law Lords. Deciding the issues of law a year ago, Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled the Corporation has no duty of care towards its members and has immunity from damages. The final decision will affect the readiness of Names to underwrite risks and the City's reputation as a place where contracts are performed in good faith. English law is different in that it does not include a generalised concept of good faith and fair dealing. To achieve the same effect judges developed a variety of devices. Thus for 200 years the courts of equity have refused to enforce contracts which no sane, honest or fair-minded person would accept, calling such contracts 'unconscionable'. Trustees, and directors of companies, are bound by a fiduciary duty, while a duty of care, not to cause harm to their employers and inform them of potential dangers, is implied by law in such contracts as are daily concluded by agents or builders. One would assume that these rules, without which business could hardly exist, bear on the relationship between Names and the Corporation; and that they are reinforced by special Lloyd's Acts between 1871-1982. But this was not the judge's view. He rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the Corporation had a duty of care to protect them against misbehaving or dishonest agents managing Lloyd's syndicates, and to inform them in time of misbehaviour so they could avoid losses. The judge also accepted the extensive interpretation of the immunity from damages granted to the Corporation by the 1982 Lloyd's Act in respect of their statutory duties. He ruled that it also encompasses breach of contractual duties about which the Act is silent. The Court of Appeal will be asked to say what are the implied contents of the contract concluded between a Name and the Corporation. By such contracts Names allow agents managing Lloyd's syndicates to underwrite in their name risks for which Names then bear unlimited liability. They must not interfere with the business of the agents, who are not members of the Corporation, but who are admitted and supervised by the Corporation and report their dealings to it. As it is a duty of a contractual agent to obey his principal's instructions, it would appear managing agents are organs of the Corporation and it is the Corporation which is the agent of Names. This argument, which the plaintiffs seem to have overlooked, is reinforced by the fact that all premiums are collected by brokers admitted and supervised by the Corporation, and who also acted as managing agents of syndicates until 1987 when this conflict of interests was removed. The contract leaves Names two safeguards: an individually agreed limit on total premiums, which limits the risk that may be underwritten in their name; or the statutory assurance that the object of the Corporation is to protect and further Names' interests and keep them informed. Only the Corporation knows, or can take steps to know, whether the premium limit has been exhausted, and it seems to be its contractual duty to stop the limit being overstepped. When inviting a prospective name to sign the contract, the Corporation gives him documents claiming that it controls the admission and operation of brokers and managing agents. He who claims influence and power in making a contract should exercise it in performing it. Or, as Sir Henry Fisher, the judge, wrote in his 1980 report, the Names 'can reasonably look to the committee (now the Council) for protection'. The Corporation's duty to respect the premium limits and inform Names of any doubt about the skill and honesty of the agents must be on the mind of the parties when signing the contract as 'a matter of course' - a test of implied duty. The other test, that such implication is also necessary, is obvious: no person in his right mind would put in another's hands not only his fortune but also the power to bankrupt him by undertaking in his name risks without limit; nor would he forgo the right to be informed about mismanagement or dishonesty by those underwriting risks in his name. If the higher courts decide that the Corporation has such a duty of care towards Names, the case will return to the High Court for trial. To succeed, the plaintiffs will have to prove the Corporation failed to protect them against exposure to risks substantially exceeding the agreed premium limit and that the Council did not even inform them of the conclusions of the Chester Committee of Enquiry. This alleged certain underwriters and brokers were claiming they kept business within the agreed limits when they were exceeding them. The plaintiffs add that the Council allowed the agents to continue to operate on behalf of the Names though it found the Chester report's allegations serious enough to stop new Names joining the criticised syndicates. The Corporation has made a number of reforms and is seeking corporate investors to underwrite insurance. The latter are likely to press for better internal controls. Yet the outcome of the appeal remains of great significance.</p>

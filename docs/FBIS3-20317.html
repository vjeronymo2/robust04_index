From Batman, five groups of the Humanistic Union reported  that they had been detained in a hotel since Friday [25 March];  until Sunday they were not permitted to use the telephone. "In  Batman, we were followed by special police units at every step.  They wanted to prevent any contact with the population. Those  who had contact with us (even bus and taxi drivers) were  threatened with arrest, torture, and death."    The groups reported that, over the past year, more than 200  persons were "killed by so-called unknown perpetrators (death  squads controlled by the state)" in Batman.    From Diyarbakir, a group of unofficial observers, including  Angelika Beer of the Federal Executive Committee of Alliance  90/Greens, faxed a message saying that they noticed "that in  southeastern Turkey/northern Kurdistan those who advocate  democratic rights and rights of self-determination for the  Kurdish population are threatened with mass arrest, torture, and  even death." Therefore, the signatories called on the Federal  Government to "immediately stop any kind of deportation and  expulsion of Turkish Kurds."    Like the Humanistic Union, the Society for Endangered  Peoples  (GfvB) also accused the Federal Government of supporting the war  against the Kurds by means of arms deliveries. From 1985-91  alone, Bonn delivered armament goods worth 3.6 billion German  marks to Turkey, GfbV Chairman Tilmann Zuelch said in Bonn on  Monday. "Unfortunately, the relentless civil war is also a  consequence of German policy."</p>

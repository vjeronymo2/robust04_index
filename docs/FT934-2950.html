			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (8): Screws will tighten again - Emissions and Noise Regulations Stricter exhaust emission limits for new trucks came into effect throughout the European Union two months ago. Despite some grumblings when the standards were announced several years ago, truck manufacturers have had relatively little difficulty meeting them - though the investments in new technology have been substantial. In the mid-1990s, the screws will be tightened further. 'Euro II' standards will come into force for new designs of trucks from October 1 1995, and for all trucks emerging from production lines from October 1 1996. The standards will require further cuts in emissions of oxides of nitrogen - a cause of acid rain - carbon monoxide and particulates - the well-known diesel 'soot'. To achieve the Euro II standards, the petroleum industry must become involved, as the sulphur content of diesel fuel needs to be reduced if particulate emissions are to be cut substantially. Under a EU-set timetable, the 0.2-0.3 per cent sulphur content usual in diesel fuels will have dropped to a maximum of 0.05 per cent by the time Euro II is fully effective. To cater for the first stage of the Euro II standards, by October 1 1995 at least 25 per cent of the diesel fuel available in EU member states must be below the 0.05 per cent ceiling. Around the end of the decade, yet another tightening can be expected, with the standards based on a new test driving cycle reflecting 'real life' road conditions in Europe. The current EU test driving cycle - simulating a supposedly typical journey and on which emissions are measured - is a much-criticised slow speed one, still not reflecting that 80 per cent of the EU's goods are moved by truck and across ever-longer distances along high-speed motorways. Despite such measures, says Mr Sten Langenius, president and chief executive of Sweden's Volvo Truck Corporation, technology's advance is such that emissions will cease to be an issue by 2005. By then, he predicts, emissions of nitrogen oxides, for example, will be more than halved compared with the Euro II standards, to 2 grammes per brake horsepower. Emissions of particulates - accused of being a carcinogen - will fall proportionately more as fuel formulation improves. Volvo Truck, one of the world's biggest truck makers, earlier this year underlined the industry's long-term commitment to the diesel with the launch of its new FH heavy truck range - the result of a seven-year development programme costing Pounds 600m. The trucks are powered by an all-new 12-litre diesel engine which accounts for nearly half the total spending. Using a combination of old and new technologies, it is capable, says Volvo, of meeting all current environmental standards anywhere in the world. More important, Volvo expects it to meet all future standards to the end of the decade without any significant redesign. The unit uses new, high-pressure fuel injection technology from Lucas, the UK motor components and aerospace group. The 'EUI' (electronic unit injector) operates at very high pressure - 1800 bar - and can make instantaneous adjustments to fuelling quantity and timing in each injector, under the control of a central computer which takes readings from various sensors around the engine. Other leading truck makers have little choice but to make similar investments if they wish to stay in the game - and some, like DAF with its excursion into receivership this year, have had great difficulty in doing so. Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles arm, is spending around Pounds 1bn on truck engines as part of an overall Pounds 2.5bn vehicle renewal programme. Mr Leif Ostling, general manager of Scania Truck and Buses, Volvo's Swedish rival, says that technology improvements linked to emissions will have other pay-offs. Engines that have to work less hard also produce fewer emissions and there should be further scope for a reduction in energy consumption from non-engine related improvements. Aerodynamics, rolling resistance and weight reduction improvements have already cut energy consumption by one half per tonne-kilometre over the past 20 years, he points out. Emissions, however, are not the only major environmental issue confronting trucks. The other is noise. Under an EU directive to become effective in October 1995, an 80-decibel limit will be introduced for trucks, based on the vehicle passing a pair of microphones at 50kmh. Manufacturers will find it a difficult target to meet as a relatively small drop in decibel rating can mean a large reduction in perceived noise. As Mr Ostling points out, the noise emitted by Scania (and most other) trucks has fallen by 8dB (A) over the past decade - equivalent to an 84 per cent drop in perceived noise. But this remains well above the planned EU level and truck makers are arguing that the problem now lies more with the way noise is measured than the actual amount of noise made by the vehicle.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUCK EXHAUST EMISSION STANDARDS IN THE EU* (grammes per kilowatt hour)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Introduction date                   NOX      HC     CO   Particulates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro 1 (new models) Jul 1 1992 Euro 1 (all production) Oct 1 1993    8     1.1    4.5   0.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro II (new models) Oct 1 1995 Euro II (all production) Oct 1 1996    7    1.1    4     0.15**  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * For engines above 150 kilowatts (brake horsepower ** Envisages diesel fuel containing less than 0.05 per cent sulphur by    weight  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

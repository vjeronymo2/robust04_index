			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SHOPPER: PARIS: BIG DESIGNERS WITH SMALL PRICES  </P> <P> The new year is a good time to consider creating a new personal image or giving  new color and shape to the old one.  </P> <P> It may be time for a new wardrobe, or maybe the addition of one or two basic  pieces, plus several stunning accessories.  </P> <P> When it comes to making acquisitions to enhance a personal style, there's no  better shopping destination than Paris, where fashion is a way of life.  </P> <P> Shop windows, billboards, magazines and even people on the street can be  inspiring.  </P> <P> Prices are on the high side, however, but so is style. In general, French  shoppers buy expensive clothes that wear well and are versatile, rather than  fads that are pushed aside after one season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Budgetary Solution  </P> <P> Economics are important, too. Paris is populated mostly by middle-class people  who succeed in looking fashionable, despite modest incomes. They buy from  younger, lesser-known designers with big talents and relatively small price  tags.  </P> <P> A cluster of boutiques belonging to excellent, varied and relatively unknown  (to Americans) stylists is in the 1st arrondissement, among some famous  designer salons.  </P> <P> Designer Sylvie Essel has two shops in the Forum des Halles (Level 2), Paris'  largest shopping mall. Essel's clothes are beyond seasonal chic. Patches of  velvet, silk, satin and lace are used to create layered skirts ($120 and up).  There are color-coordinated sweaters ($150 and up) with applique, beads and  fringe. Unusual accessories include handbags with bas-relief faces molded into  the leather ($140), and belts ($40 and up) adorned with feathers, beads and  coins.  </P> <P> Nearby is the boutique of Elisabeth de Senneville (3 Rue Turbigo), who worked  with Jean-Charles de Castelbajac before developing her own line of haute  sportswear for the entire family.  </P> <P> De Senneville is a good source for basics, sometimes faddish, and affordable  accessories. Color-coordinated trousers ($50 and up) and well-designed shirts  ($60 and up) are interchangeable staples, inventively detailed and made of  unusual fabrics.  </P> <P> Look for a creative interplay of patterns, vibrant colors and basic black. The  knit pullovers ($70) can be worn tucked in or belted or baggy.  </P> <P> At 12 Rue de Turbigo, designer Ana Salazar's boutique is a sea of gray, black  and beige. This Portuguese stylist works frequently with tweed fabrics that are  mixed and matched in tailored business suits ($200 and up), casual slacks ($120  and up) and jacket ($160 and up) ensembles.  </P> <P> A distinctive Salazar touch is the use of zippers, on pockets, up pant legs and  in lieu of slits on straight skirts ($125). The boutique carries a line of  Portuguese-made shoes ($70 and up) and other accessories.  </P> <P> Around the corner, designer Claudie Pierlot (4 Rue du Jour) shows cotton  clothes in easy-to-wear, flattering shapes. Pierlot's designs are similar in  mood to those of agnes b., but prices are much lower.  </P> <P> Ensembles are made up of slacks ($60 and up) in a wide variety of shapes, with  tank tops ($45), turtlenecks ($60), jackets ($100 and up), as well as dresses  ($120 and up). Various sized and reverse-color polka dots are thematic, and the  sophisticated use of dotted Swiss is especially attractive. Accessories here,  too.  </P> <P> Designer Sara Shelburne's boutique is nearby at 10 Rue du Cygne. American-born  Shelburne has a large following for her updated retro styles. Her clothes are  feminine, luxurious and sophisticated. Sequined evening attire ($200 and up) is  a specialty. Also combed wool and bi-colored day dresses ($145 and up) based on  1930s fashions. Anything can be made in any size or any of 18 colors, at no  extra cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Versatile Ensembles  </P> <P> On a popular fashion street, Claude Barthelemy's boutique (10 Rue Etienne  Marcel) displays versatile knit, velour and wool ensembles, with varied skirts  ($60 and up), slacks ($60 and up), jackets ($140 and up), dresses ($145 and up)  and coats ($200 and up).  </P> <P> Barthelemy's clothes also sell in other Parisian boutiques, but since this is  her own shop, prices are lower. Styles are traditional, well-made, detailed and  wearable. Colors are rich, but not flashy.  </P> <P> Down the street, British designer Vincent Smith (52 Rue Etienne Marcel) outfits  men in very chic, put-together outfits that mix traditional and avant-garde  elements. A conventional blazer ($245), for example, is finished off with a Mao  collar and worn with white front-pleated trousers ($170).  </P> <P> Near the famous Place des Victoires, Island (4 Rue Vide-Gousset) is a new  designer label for outdoor and sports-oriented clothing for men.  </P> <P> There are woolen V-neck sweaters ($60 and up) in dozens of vibrant colors, plus  corduroy trousers ($50), sweat shirt ($40) and pant ensembles ($30) and lively  flowered cotton undershorts ($15). Coats and jackets ($145 and up) are stylish,  warm and rugged.  </P> <P> Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of  writing.  </P></p>

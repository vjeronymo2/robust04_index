The elections to local government  bodies are scheduled for March 27th.    The bloc includes the Novosibirsk branches of Constitutional  Democrats, of the Liberal Democratic Party, and of the National  Salvation Front, as well as representatives of the local Cossack  community.    A leading member of the bloc, Aleksandr Lyulko of the  Cossack  community, told Interfax that Fatherland gathered all parties  and movements from Novosibirsk Region opposed to the present  government and president.    According to Lyulko, the bloc hopes to win the upcoming  elections to local government bodies. "The victory won at  December's elections by the Liberal Democratic Party shows that  the Russian people, particularly those who live in Novosibirsk  Region, are attracted by national-patriotic, not democratic,  ideals," he said.</p>

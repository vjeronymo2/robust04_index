			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary </F> general of the National Security Council, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] Does the recent spate of bombings  indicate the country is having a security problem?    [Khachatphai] There is no question that everyone wants the  country to enjoy peace and progress and people to enjoy decent  livelihood. The bombings, bomb threats, and creating of rumors  have misled people into feeling that security is lacking. I  wish to given the assurance that the country enjoys complete  security. All the officials concerned have worked together  closely to find the culprits and gather information to prevent  the future occurrence of these problems. Security at various  installations has been strengthened to prevent acts of  terrorism. Everyone can be confident in the government  mechanism dealing with this matter and in the officials  concerned.    In any event, to better tackle the matter, people must  cooperate by acting as informants. This will lead to the arrest  of the culprits. This is one way of helping prevent untoward  incidents.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that the performance of the  officials concerned has not been effective?    [Khachatphai] One must realize that there are people who  look for opportunities to create trouble. They will carry out  their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore, it is  difficult to absolutely prevent every problem. Intelligence  operations and security vigilance have been responsible for  preventing many incidents. These types of operations, however,  cannot be publicized. So, people do not know about the  performance of such operations. Therefore, it is unfair to say  that officials have been ineffective.    [Correspondent] What are the causes of the bombings  perpetrated by local or foreign elements?    [Khachatphai] There are many causes for the bomb attacks  carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts and  deliberate attempts to create a situation. The officials  concerned are investigating the causes.    Operations by foreigners concern acts of international  terrorism. They carry out their operations in Thailand to  achieve their objectives. The country's public safety is  affected regardless of which group carries out its operation as  innocent people suffer. Everyone should condemn such an evil  operation.    [Correspondent] Do international terrorist groups pick  Thailand for their operations because they find it easy?    [Khachatphai] Thai society, like in other liberal countries,  is open. Tourists can travel where they please. Several  million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition to more  than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point, but it  does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand  because it is so easy to stage an incident.    [Correspondent] Compared with Singapore and Malaysia whose  societies are also open, why do terrorists pick on Thailand to  carry out their sabotage activities?    [Khachatphai] There are several factors international  terrorists consider in choosing a country for their sabotage.  One factor is their intended target. It is probably not true  that security in those two countries is so good that it is  impossible to carry out terrorist activities. The elaborate  counterterrorist measures in the United States and the UK have  not been able to completely prevent terrorist activities there.    [Correspondent] In addition to foreign terrorist groups, are  there local groups which complicate the sabotage picture?    [Khachatphai] Possibly both. That is, there could be  foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand.  Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create  public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and  order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore,  officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent  an incident and timely solve it if it happens.    [Correspondent] What about groups which seek to topple the  current government?    [Khachatphai] The results of initial investigations have not  linked groups seeking a political change to the disturbances.  Normal incidents of disturbance are probably linked to personal  disputes or to intimidation with some purpose in mind.  Officials concerned are trying to verifying the causes.    [Correspondent] Is the intelligence work sufficient to cope  with the current situation?    [Khachatphai] To date, I have found through working with  military and civilian intelligence oficials that they have  worked hard. Several pieces of intelligence have been exploited  to timely solve the situation. However, current and future  problems are diversified and complicated and, therefore,  intelligence efficiency should be further developed to timely  cope with the situation and keep up with the game.    [Correspondent] Do the currently numerous protests affect  national security?    [Khachatphai] The administration system in Thailand is  democratic and the government comes from the election.  Therefore, if a group of people feels that it is not given fair  treatment it has a right to express its views and inform the  government so that the unfairness can be remedied. If a protest  arise from the people's genuine hardship then it is not  difficult to solve. But if there are instigators in the  background it is more difficult. Therefore, I ask that people  cooperate with the officials and act as their eyes and ears.  The mass media has a role as well to help create a peaceful  atmosphere by constructive reporting and avoiding emphasizing  things that will excessively worry the public.    Although there are issues which affect peace and order,  overall national security is good. Please have confidence in  the state mechanism to protect and maintain national security.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE DEMOCRATS DECIDE 'AIR FOLEY' DOESN'T FLY  </P> <P> Hit by flak from Administration officials and others, House Democratic leaders  Wednesday grounded an effort to create a one-plane air force commanded by  Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.).  </P> <P> The leaders dropped the plan to put a $19-million military jet under control of  the Speaker after presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called it a "foolish  idea" and others ridiculed it as "Air Foley" and "Foley's Royal Air Force."  </P> <P> The proposal suddenly appeared in a compromise $285.8-billion defense spending  measure crafted by House and Senate negotiators. Foley claimed to be surprised  by the provision, which was tucked into the bill by Rep. John P. Murtha  (D-Pa.), apparently without the knowledge of most other negotiators.  </P> <P> Murtha said that the military aircraft would give Foley needed protection from  terrorists. Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), a chief advocate of the proposal,  added that it would help lawmakers avoid flying corporate planes and thus would  help them avoid conflict-of-interest charges.  </P> <P> Disposal of the plan means that lawmakers will continue the current practice of  requesting a plane from the Air Force when one is needed.  </P> <P> The timing of the proposal was awkward for Foley, who is pushing a 33% pay  raise and ethics package for House members in a vote scheduled for today.  </P> <P> The defense appropriation measure approved by the House and sent to the Senate  for final action calls for spending nearly $286 billion in the fiscal year that  began Oct. 1.  </P> <P> That represents a $3.4-billion increase over last year and is $2.4 billion less  than President Bush requested.  </P> <P> The bill closely conforms to a funding authorization measure that won final  congressional approval by the Senate Wednesday.  </P> <P> The $3.8 billion approved for "Star Wars," the Strategic Defense Initiative, is  a reduction of 22% from Bush's request of $4.9 billion. Although Congress has  slashed the "Star Wars" funding request each year beginning in 1986, this is  the first time that the budget for the anti-missile research program has been  reduced below the previous year's level.  </P> <P> The legislation also provides $4.3 billion of the $4.7 billion requested to  continue production of the B-2 Stealth bomber -- enough to buy two planes in  fiscal 1990 and components that could be used for five additional planes  scheduled for inclusion in the fiscal 1991 budget.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Heinz in NZ food group deal HJ HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday completed the deal to buy Wattie Foods, New Zealand's biggest canned and frozen foods group, from Goodman Fielder Wattie (GFW) for NZDollars 566m (USDollars 308m). GFW, Australia's biggest foods group, had planned to sell the Wattie division through a public flotation next month, which had been expected to raise NZDollars 490m. GFW is to use the money from the sale to buy Uncle Toby's, an Australian cereals company, as part of its strategy to concentrate on baked foods and cereals. It will retain some baking and related businesses in New Zealand which operate under the Goodman name. Heinz said yesterday it would allow Wattie to compete against Heinz products in Australia. Both companies would be controlled directly from Heinz' Pittsburg headquarters in the US, but under the existing local management. Wattie Foods has annual sales of approximately NZDollars 750m, which compares with Heinz' global sales of USDollars 6.58bn. Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, said Wattie would provide the US group with an 'exciting opportunity' to expand its presence in Asia using Heinz's expertise in marketing, product development and global distribution.</p>

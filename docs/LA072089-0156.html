			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CANCELS VISIT TO U.S.  </P> <P> Frederik W. de Klerk, who is expected to be South Africa's next president,  Wednesday bowed to anti-apartheid pressure and turned down an invitation by  U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit the United States.  </P> <P> The announcement was made by Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha in  Pretoria. De Klerk was in Mozambique on Wednesday for talks with the government  there.  </P> <P> "It appears that elements within the American Congress are intent on making the  visit as controversial as possible," Botha said in a statement, adding that De  Klerk "would like to avoid creating any obstacles to constructive discussion"  by undertaking the trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letter From Congress  </P> <P> More than 100 members of the House of Representatives asked President Bush in a  letter released Tuesday not to meet De Klerk unless South Africa relaxes its  apartheid policies of racial separation and white minority rule and ends its  three-year-old state of emergency.  </P> <P> "To meet with the National Party leader and anticipated president of South  Africa without any significant political change by the white minority regime  would send a terribly wrong signal concerning the direction of U.S. policy  during the Bush Administration," the letter stated.  </P> <P> No dates had been announced for the trip, but it had been expected that De  Klerk would head for the United States toward the end of the month. He accepted  a general invitation to visit Washington after Baker met with South African  President Pieter W. Botha last May in Rome.  </P></p>

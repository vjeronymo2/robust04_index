			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Cadbury has the kind of problems most other UK food manufacturers would envy. Its strong brands and resilient results highlight the possibilities for considerable international growth. But management's attention may now focus on mainland Europe, which represented the only serious blemish in Cadbury's performance. The 36 per cent fall in trading profits was attributable to beverages. But Cadbury also faces a long-term strategic bind in confectionery, where it lags well behind Mars and Nestle. Philip Morris's recent purchase of Terry's suggests pressure will intensify in the UK. A sizeable acquisition may represent the only means of acquiring sufficient mass. This, though, raises the tricky issue of funding, even supposing a suitable target could be found. Cadbury has never generated as much cash as its high margins would suggest and the balance sheet has been hollowed out by goodwill write-offs. Equity funding must remain a possibility. This may partly explain the company's surprisingly sunny view of the UK economy.</p>

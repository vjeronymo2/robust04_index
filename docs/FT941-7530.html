			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: National Westminster After TSB, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland raised their dividends by 20 per cent or more, the stock market decided that a mere 6 per cent increase from National Westminster was stingy and marked the shares down accordingly. It would have cost only another Pounds 40m to increase the dividend by 20 per cent and cover would still have been close to 1.7 times. That NatWest chose to be cautious suggests both doubts of its own about growth and that it is still anxious to conserve its capital. Tier 1 capital has risen to 5.7 per cent from 5.2 but half the improvement was due to a Pounds 4bn drop in weighted risk assets. Unlike Lloyds, which has plenty of capital and sees signs of a revival in loan demand, NatWest maintains that loan demand is sluggish. Were it to recover, the bank has ample scope to create new tier 1 capital by converting the exchangeable capital securities it issued last year. In that sense, it is simply being economic, operating flexibly with just enough capital to meet the needs of the moment. Such an approach would be laudable if it produced a high return. NatWest's net return on shareholders' funds is 10.8 per cent, half that of Lloyds. It is difficult to see where the earnings will come from to boost that return. NatWest points proudly to the growing importance of non-interest income, but that is inevitable when interest income is falling. Since fee income is flat, the main driving force has been dealing profits and so-called 'other' income, which includes a commendable contribution from insurance but a jumble of other items such as venture capital and securities gains. NatWest has scope to grow, for example, in its Coutts private banking division. The bank itself is talking of a 'sensible' acquisition in the US. It would never make a foolish one, would it?</p>

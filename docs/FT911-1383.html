			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Moscow deal may not end coal strikes THE SOVIET government yesterday transferred control of coal mines to the Russian Federation, as part of a deal with Mr Boris Yeltsin to end a crippling two-month coal miners' strike. But Mr Alexander Smirnov, a strike leader in the vast Siberian Kuzbas coal fields, said the Kremlin's signature yesterday of a protocol relinquishing the mines did not yet mean an end to strikes. He said a third of the 80 Kuzbas pits were still idle yesterday, together with 25 other pits in the area. Mr Smirnov said the striking miners would wait to see the fine print of the agreement, before calling off industrial action which has paralysed sectors of Soviet industry. He said leaders of the local strike movement would today meet their counterparts from Vorkuta, the other Russian mining region covered by the protocol, together with miners from the Donbas in the Ukraine, where the strike has all but crumbled. Meanwhile, workers in the vast Siberian oil and gas fields of Tyumen have written to President Gorbachev demanding a tripling of their pay and an increase in the extremely low internal oil price of Rbs38 a tonne to Rbs180. And a group of workers at the huge Kirov plant in Leningrad yesterday launched a warning strike to call for Mr Gorbachev's resignation and protest against a proposed one-year ban on strikes. The protocol, signed by Mr Yeltsin last week, gives the Russian mines more independence from the state and the right to spend part of their hard currency revenues on imported goods and other benefits for miners. But details of the protocol have yet to be published. It is also likely to be followed by a transfer of other industries and plants to Russian jurisdiction. Workers at the giant Uralmash engineering plant in the Urals, for instance, last week voted in favour of a similar transfer. Kommersant newspaper said yesterday that miners would be able to dispose of 7 per cent of the Russian mines' hard-currency earnings. It also reported that the protocol provided for the transfer to Russian jurisdiction of two big steel plants.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Strive To Put on First-Rate Work </F> Performance for the Motherland"]    [Text] The divine flame of the 17th winter Olympics has  gone out, but the heroism of Ye Qiaobo -- a worthy daughter of  the Chinese nation, who fought indomitably to enable the  five-starred flag to be hoisted up the pole, despite injuries to  her legs and other parts of her body -- still stirs the heart of  every Chinese citizen. Ye has composed a magnificent song of  youth with her blood, sweat, and tears, and has set a brilliant  example of patriotism to a generation of youth.    A feeble girl, who made light of her major injury and  refused  to be outdone by her strong rivals, made amazing achievements in  the world-level competition. Where did her strength come from?  Ye answered: "What I have done is done for my beloved  motherland." What a noble heart she has! She consciously  regarded rendering service to her motherland as her highest  ambition, and was ready to exchange her youth for her  motherland's honor and her nation's dignity. It was her  passionate patriotism that constituted the abundant source of  her heroism.    Patriotism has always been a spiritual prop for a strong and  prosperous country and a rising nation. The implications of  patriotism vary from nation to nation. For the younger  generation of the Chinese nation, loving their country has the  particular meaning of loving socialism. Historical experience  and the reality of reform and opening up to the outside world  have told us that socialism cannot only save, but also develop  China. Ye has been to a dozen countries and regions, and has  witnessed Western societies of every description. While abroad,  she did not improperly belittle herself, worship and have blind  faith in everything foreign, and still less shake her  conviction. Instead, she bore in mind "I am my motherland's  loyal daughter," took pride in it, and displayed a national  integrity that was neither arrogant nor obsequious, and "made  one above the power of poverty and mean conditions to cause a  deviation from principle, one who could not be subdued by force."    Loving one's country means linking one's career and future  with one's motherland, and changing fervent patriotism into the  real action of dedicating oneself to the service of one's  country. Ye dedicated herself to the service of her country by  applying herself to sports -- her career -- and by trying hard  to win a "gold medal" for her country. She has worked hard and  dauntlessly on speed skating -- her difficult and glorious  career -- for 20 years, and has made great achievements time and  again in scaling new heights in speed skating. People work at  different posts, but they can have the same wish to render  service to their motherland despite the fact that they will  carry out the wish on different occasions and in different ways.  To carry out the wish, one must base oneself on one's work post  and start with little things so as to make outstanding  achievements at one's ordinary work post.    Loving one's country means rendering great service to reform  and the opening up. Ye always cherished a high aspiration for  winning honor for her motherland and set the highest target for  herself. After winning honor for her motherland on many  occasions and becoming a glorious sportswoman in the sports  field, many people told her to resolutely retire at the height  of her career, but Ye declined their advice. She felt she had  not realized her ambition and wanted to convert her dream of  obtaining a gold medal for her motherland into reality -- a  dream, in fact, of turning China into a prosperous country. How  striking a contrast she brought out between herself and those  who pride themselves on their merits or are content with small  achievements!    Being patriotic means combating decadent ideas, such as  individualism and money worship. To render service to repay her  motherland's kindness, Ye bore hardships unbearable for ordinary  people and buried the happiness ordinary people deserve. She  regarded her motherland's honor as a weight like unto Mount Tai,  and her own interests weighing as lightly as a goose feather.  Such a noble virtue, which "enables a patriot to dash ahead  regardless of his own safety," is all the more precious in the  current period when a new system is replacing the old.    "One must not forget one's duty to take care of the  country's  interests, no matter how insignificant one may be." Youth  represent the future of the country and are to bring the  country's major plans to fruition. Ye's heroism has shown the  broad masses of young people a correct and glorious way for them  to render loyal service to the motherland. This is the great  trust history has placed in them and also what the current  reform era expects of them. Like Ye, we should keep the  motherland's interests at heart, carry forward the revolutionary  cause pioneered by our predecessors, forge ahead into the  future, and participate in the country's great reform and  development plans with enormous enthusiasm and creativity. We  should work hard to make progress and achievements at our own  posts. We should inject our precious youth into the motherland's  great cause of reform and development to put on a first-rate  work performance!</p>

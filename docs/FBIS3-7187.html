Prathin also said he was "not confident at all" that Thai  police would be able arrest the culprit behind the foiled  attempt to carry out what could have been the worst sabotage on  Thai soil. He added it was most likely the criminals had fled  overseas.    "I have sent the sketches of two suspects to four countries,  which I can't name at the moment, in the hope they may know  their identities," Prathin said. Those countries have official  organizations which keep records of international terrorists, he  added.    Asked if Thai police would be able to arrest the culprits,  Prathin said: "I'm not confident at all." He added that he was  not afraid of the "political consequences" of his remark.    Pratin said the large amount of fertilizer found in a truck  abandoned by an Arab-looking man near the Israeli Embassy in  March 11 after a minor accident was uria nitrate, not ammonium  nitrate as previously reported.    "I've checked with foreign experts and it turns out the bomb  does not have as much destructive power as we first thought," he  said.    Meanwhile, a police source said one of the terrorists behind  the conspiracy is believed to be among three men still at large  after bombing the World Trade Centre in New York in February  last year. The source said Mir Aimal Kansi 30, is one of the  three suspects. The combined rewards for information leading to  his arrest in connection with the worst terrorist act on US soil  amounts to $2 million.    Police suspect this man was behind Bangkok's truck-bomb  attack but that he fled the country through a border point in  Songkhla province last week.    The source said officials at Sadao district, on the border  with Malaysia, remembered a man "who looked like an Arab"  crossing the frontier on March 15. They had photocopied his  fake Pakistani passport.    The source said the picture in the passport looked like  Kansi  except that his haircut had been changed.    About 300 senior metropolitan police officers attended a  special meeting yesterday on how to cope with saboteurs using  explosives. The meeting at the metropolitan police headquarters  was held because "metropolitan police have no knowledge about  how to cope with suspicious objects or explosive materials,"  according to Pol Maj Gen Somchai Praphatpakdi, deputy Bangkok  police chief.</p>

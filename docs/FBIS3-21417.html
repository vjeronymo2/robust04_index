Raja Mohan: "Clinton Rakes Up Human Rights </F> Issue"]    [Text] Washington, Feb. 15--The U.S. President, Mr. Bill  Clinton, reaffirmed on Monday the increasing alignment of his  country's position with that of Pakistan on Kashmir, a  development that could further set back relations with India.  All American pretence of providing an even-handed approach to  the problem now appears to have been dropped. It is possible  that the Clinton Administration is stepping up its diplomatic  activism on Kashmir to extract major concessions from India and  Pakistan on the nuclear issue. The policy of linking nuclear  non-proliferation in the subcontinent to the resolution of the  Kashmir dispute is being fully backed by Pakistan.    Declaring that promoting respect for human rights around the  world was a "pillar" of U.S. foreign policy, Mr. Clinton  declared that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights  abuses in Kashmir." His remarks came while accepting the  diplomatic credentials of the new Pakistani Ambassador to the  United States, Ms. Maleeha Lodhi. Mr. Clinton made no effort to  provide a balance by either referring to terrorism or  territorial integrity of States in the region. All that he had  to add on the subject was "we also oppose infringements of  individual human rights as a result of extremism and fanaticism,  whether of religious or secular nature, wherever it occurs."  <H5>  Plea to Clinton </H5>   Ms. Lodhi made a strong plea for U.S. support on Kashmir,  when she presented her credentials to Mr. Clinton. In a speech  peppered with resounding references to the founding fathers of  the United States, she called on Mr. Clinton to use his "good  offices to put the issue of Kashmir on the front burner of world  attention," so that there was a breakthrough in 1994 on the  issue that "threatens regional stability and world peace."    Declaring that the people of Kashmir were alone in the  subcontinent in being denied "self-determination," she alleged  that "half a million brutal occupation troops (were) making  their life miserable," and that they "are denied the basic tenet  of Jeffersonian democracy," the "pursuit of happiness." Praising  Mr. Clinton for his policies on promotion of human rights and  democracy, Ms. Lodhi asked him, "can we proselytise democracy  around the world, and deny it in Kashmir? Can we reach human  rights but only selectively apply it when convenient? Mr.  President, morality selectively applied is by definition  immoral. It is not worthy of the new global agenda to which both  our nations strive."    Ms. Lodhi thanked Mr. Clinton for bringing the issue of  Kashmir before the United Nations last September, and said she  was encouraged by the remarks of Ms. Robin Raphel, U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, who has  called for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute "in a way  consistent with the views and aspirations of the people of the  valley."  <H5>  Dialogue Welcomed </H5>   He looked forward to the occasion when he could "accept" the  offer of the Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, to visit  Pakistan, Mr. Clinton said. He had a "strong interest in  reducing tensions in South Asia and especially encouraging  productive relations between Pakistan and India." Welcoming the  resumption of Indo-Pakistan dialogue, Mr. Clinton called the  Foreign Secretary levels talks "an important step to address  outstanding issues, including Kashmir and the control and  elimination of weapons of mass destruction."    Ms. Lodhi made a strong appeal to the United States "to  seize  its unipolar moment to implement the goals we share: peace,  security and non-proliferation." Declaring that Pakistan shared  U.S. goals on non-proliferation in South Asia, she called on Mr.  Clinton to end the current "discrimination" against Pakistan, in  the form of the Pressler Amendment. Expressing anguish that the  Amendment targeted only one nation on the earth, Pakistan, she  said the current U.S. law on non-proliferation "removes all  incentives to India, which is the only nation in South Asia that  has demonstrated a nuclear capability, to be forthcoming on the  question of non-proliferation."    Ms. Lodhi reiterated the readiness of the Government of  Pakistan "to go any place, at any time, and talk to any one to  advance the cause of a nuclear free South Asia." She urged Mr.  Clinton "to act as a facilitator of a new initiative, a new  dialogue on a regional solution to the problem of proliferation."  <H5>  `Eliminate Weapons' </H5>   In his response, Mr. Clinton noted that India and Pakistan  were engaged in programmes to acquire weapons of mass  destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. "Continuing  tensions between Pakistan and India, combined with these  on-going programmes, creates the potential of a nuclear exchange  with devastating consequences for the region and the world at  large." He asked Ms. Lodhi to "work constructively with us to  cap such weapons programmes, and then to reduce and eliminate  weapons of mass destruction from South Asia."    On purely direct bilateral relations, Ms. Lodhi made a  strong  sales pitch for the continuing "strategic relevance" of Pakistan  to the United States. She declared that Pakistan was a model of  "enlightened, progressive Islam for the entire world." As a  nation of "moderation," Pakistan could provide a "nexus" between  southwest Asia and the West Asian and the Central Asian  republics. Mr. Clinton welcomed the economic reforms in Pakistan  and expressed the hope that "Pakistan will enact and enforce  tough laws to fight the drug trade more vigorously."    The emerging consensus between the United States and  Pakistan  on Kashmir and the nuclear issue remains, however, to be  consolidated.</p>

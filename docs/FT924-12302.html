			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (3): Drive for links with the west - Eastern Europe THE collapse of Soviet power in eastern and central Europe has been accompanied by a collapse in trade with the east and a remarkable westward shift in the focus of eastern European aspirations. Historically it was the defeat of Napoleon which confirmed Russia as a European power. Similarly, it was the vacuum at the heart of Europe caused by the defeat of Nazi Germany 130 years later that brought Soviet power to the banks of the Elbe and gave Moscow control over half the continent. That control has now vanished, together with most of the armies which sustained it. Soon the Red Army will vacate its last bases in eastern Germany and withdraw from the Baltic states. Germany has re-emerged as the dominant economic power in the region and is preparing to move the capital of the newly re-united country back from Bonn, on the Rhine, to Berlin in the heart of old Prussia. It is worth dwelling briefly on the historical background to the changes now taking place in eastern Europe because this helps to underline the aberrant nature of the region's temporary control from Moscow and the underlying reasons for the enthusiasm behind the drive for ever closer economic, trade, financial, political and other links with western Europe. Some of the strongest supporters of the European Community idea are to be found in this region and three of the newly-liberated countries - Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland - already have association agreements with the EC and aspire to full membership by the turn of the century. Others like Romania and Bulgaria have similar long-term aspirations but are most distant and economically less advanced. All three central European associate members of the EC have made rapid progress towards privatising their economies and shifting their trade to EC markets. More than 50 per cent of Hungary's exports now go to EC markets, for example, compared with only 14 per cent in the 1970s and 25 per cent in the 1980s. Unsurprisingly, the restored importance of western trade and other links has placed a premium on proximity to EC markets. Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are busy building new hotels, office blocks, airports and updating their antiquated telecommunications. Within 20 years a network of new motorways and upgraded railways and telecommunications will have knitted central Europe firmly into the wider EC, the ultimate shape of which still has to be decided. Prague, the most westerly of the central European capitals, is 200km further west than Vienna and this factor, as well as its undisputed charms as a largely intact renaissance and baroque city on the banks of the Voltava river, has made the Czech capital one of the preferred locations for western companies doing business in Czechoslovakia and the region. Investors looking for bargains from the privatisation process have also been busy snapping up engineering, glass, cement and other industries in western and northern Bohemia. This region was the industrial power house of the former Habsburg empire and borders directly on to Bavaria and the five east German lander in the throes of a reconstruction boom. Poland, too, has benefited greatly from its proximity to Germany and easy access to the European motorway and other infrastructures. But the Czech case is the best illustration of the general principle that the prosperity and potential for future growth is highest in the western part of the region and diminishes as one travels east. The Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia were historically wealthier and more advanced than Hungarian-controlled Slovakia. The gap looks like becoming wider after the impending divorce between the Czech lands and Slovakia. In its favour, however, Bratislava, the Slovak capital, does have the advantage of being less than 80kms from Vienna. It hopes to attract cross-border investment into new export-orientated factories in the border area. But an independent Slovakia is expected to find increasing difficulty in attracting investment to the eastern part of the country which was highly dependent on the Soviet market and has poor road, rail and air links with the west. Uptil now Hungary has been the favourite destination for foreign investors who have poured in more than Dollars 4bn of equity investment over the past three years, around 60 per cent of the total into the region. This is due both to much small investment by private Austrian, German, French and Italian entrepreneurs and to big investments by General Electric, General Motors, Suzuki, Ford and other multinationals such as Electrolux as well as the big food, tobacco and consumer goods companies. All have been looking for new low-cost production centres and new outlets for their branded products. In terms of market potential, however, Poland, with nearly 40m people, Romania with 23m and the more distant but larger Ukraine with 52m are much more populous than Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech lands with around 10m people each or Slovakia with under 5m. But decisions on where to locate to serve these new markets could well be affected by moves underfoot to revive trade between these countries and especially between the so-called 'Visegrad three' of Hungary, Poland and both the future Czech and Slovak republics. The Visegrad three are exploring the feasibility of creating a free trade area offering a market of nearly 70m people. For companies such as Electrolux, which made its first big investment in Hungary, from which it exports 60 per cent of its output to EC markets, such a development could have important investment and location implications. Mr Heikki Takanen, the company's senior vice-president for cold products, believes this would enable the company to source all its refrigerator and other cold product sales in the area from its existing Hungarian plant. It would then build new plants for stoves and its other products in Poland or Czechoslovakia to achieve the advantages of scale. Despite the collapse of the former Soviet economy, cities such as Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are full of people with contacts and experience of trading with the huge potential markets in the 15 newly-independent former Soviet republics. Once trade and investment picks up these skills will be worth tapping again.</p>

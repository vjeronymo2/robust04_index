			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 11 -- "Good will on both sides is  necessary to sign an agreement. If one side has no such will  there will be no agreement. So what is this comedy for?,"  Polish Ambassador to Lithuania Jan Widacki said at a press  conference after Lithuania had suspended signing a TV agreement  with Poland.    Director of the Broadcasting Centre of the Lithuanian TV  Petras Uzpelkis said in the Lithuanian TV main news bulletin on  Tuesday that the Polish side extorted its visit to Lithuania  while the truth is it was invited by the Lithuanians and  Uzpelkis participated himself in the preparations, Widacki said.    Uzpelkis tried to explain on TV why he had stopped an  agreement while he said to a Polish delegation to Vilnius that  it was not his decision.    There is no conflict between the Polish TV and the Baltic  Television, that are to broadcast their programmes on the same  channel, as it was announced in Lithuanian press. The board of  the Lithuanian Television and the Ministry of Communications are  partners for the Polish side and they can decide about TV  broadcasting in Lithuania, the Polish ambassador added.    He concluded that such a treatment of the Polish delegation  does not make Lithuania a reliable partner. Both sides lose  when the agreement is not signed.</p>

I was disturbed, however, by the quote  that "Belgians are not very patriotic." It is true that Belgians are not  chauvinistic, a very different notion.  </P> <P> The Belgian people have amply demonstrated their patriotism by resisting  invasion and occupation during two world wars.  </P> <P> CHARLES SPIRA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

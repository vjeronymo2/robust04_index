			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CUTE' HOME REMODEL  </P> <P> I read about Eileen Heyes' flightly waltz into home remodeling and wish to  point out numerous mistakes she appears to be making:  </P> <P> 1. Her attitude toward this project is not businesslike. This is not a game.  This is probably the primary source of her net worth.  </P> <P> 2. She apparently chose an architect that does not share her aesthetics. Hence,  she finds herself in "tense negotiations" with him. Prior to choosing an  architect, she should have had some concepts of design and style down pat, and  should've determined whether a prospective architect could guide her through  rather than fight her through the final design and construction drawing phase.  </P> <P> 3. She is paying too much for the bathtub. There are a number of ways to buy  products for the bath. She apparently chose the method of purchase whereby you  buy retail one item at a time. Frankly, this is the costliest way. She could  have grouped her entire bathroom fixtures purchase and saved a considerable sum  by buying direct (which would have taken a bit of work).  </P> <P> 4. Why "skip the math" regarding the financing? Obtaining the appropriate  financing (as well as determining the amount to finance) is a critical part of  the remodeling decision. Why did she take out a second and turn around soon  thereafter and take out an all-inclusive jumbo loan for $250,000?  </P> <P> It appears that she presents a profile of what not to do when remodeling. No  doubt, before she is through, she will have spent top dollar or more for every  aspect of her project.  </P> <P> HOWARD P. BRODY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

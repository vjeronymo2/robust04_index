			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): No fantasy for the man from Dallas - William Hall meets a small investor who has beaten the professionals Mention Jayesh Manek and most City fund managers look blank. But this could be about to change as Manek, a 38-year-old pharmacist from Ruislip, Middlesex, has done what many small investors dream about and proved it is possible to beat the professionals at their own game. The Sunday Times is expected to announce this weekend that Manek has won the Pounds 100,000 first prize in its Fantasy Fund Manager competition. Every week since May, he has been pitting his wits against 40,000 other contestants - including a fair sprinkling of investment professionals - to see how much he could make from a hypothetical Pounds 10m invested in a range of 250 genuine shares. Despite operating during a period when the stock market has fallen, Manek's wheeling and dealing means that his Pounds 10m JP Income fund is now worth more than Pounds 500m. Altogether, he entered 28 separate funds, and eight of the top 12 in the competition belong to him. Admittedly, he has taken very big bets on very small shares and, in some cases, has invested several times more than the market capitalisation of the stock in question. In real life, that would have been impossible - and, when it was possible, the share price would have run away long before he could have invested a fraction of his money. But Manek's consistency in winning, and his ability to spot small stocks that are just about to move, is due to more than luck. He emigrated to Britain from Uganda in 1971 and owes his early success to his late uncle, BJ Manek, who is reckoned to have been the Financial Times' first reader in Nairobi, Kenya, and also encouraged his nephew to read the newspaper when not studying for his pharmacy exams in Sussex. Soon, Manek had caught the stock market bug. He added the Investors Chronicle to his reading list and started to play the traded options market. Although Manek took delivery recently of a Reuter terminal, and has moved on from reading Jim Slater's The Zulu Principle ('very good') to John Train's The Money Masters and The New Money Masters ('very useful'), he remains convinced that diligent reading of the IC and FT is enough to give the private investor an edge when investing in stocks with a market capitalisation of under Pounds 100m. Most of the information on his biggest coups - such as Orb Estates, Middlesex Holdings, United Breweries, Virtuality, Bullers, Anglo United and CRP Leisure - has been gleaned from these sources. 'You are learning all the time,' he says. Manek, who monitors both the fundamentals and the charts, does not believe a company warrants investment just because 'old so and so' has gone on the board, but he always wants to see how a share price reacts to a boardroom change. Share price movements can often send out the wrong signal but, for Manek, they are the best indicator he has got. Now that he has a Reuter screen, it is easier to monitor changes in directors' shareholdings and volume figures. But that is not enough. 'The biggest challenge is to know when to take a profit,' says Manek - and, judging by his record in the Fantasy competition, this is where his real skill lies, rather than in individual stock-picking. He has a warning, though. With vivid memories of what happened when he once fell in love with Glaxo options, he stresses: 'Never get emotionally involved with a particular stock.' Manek is the first to admit that he could do nowhere near as well if he was investing his own money rather than the fantasy funds of the Sunday Times. As for whether any City fund manager would want to hire him, he says he has yet to be approached. Foreign &amp; Colonial's Michael Hart, who admits he has never heard of Manek, refuses to believe anyone can turn in such a consistent performance year after year. Legal &amp; General's David Manning says that if Manek did have a future in the City, it would be in a highly-geared hedge fund prepared to take big bets. Not that it matters, as Manek is not looking for a highly-paid spot in the City. His job is helping his brother run the family's chain of Dallas chemist shops, which he finds just as challenging intellectually as the stock market. They started the business in 1980 and now have eight stores, including a rather glitzy affair in London's Charing Cross station. Indeed, when it comes to this specialist sector, Manek probably knows just as much, if not more, than the big guns at Boots, Lloyds Chemists, Unichem and AAH Holdings. As a businessman who likes playing the market in the UK and India, it would be surprising if the Fantasy Fund Manager competition is the last we hear of the man from Dallas.</p>

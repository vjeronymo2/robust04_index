			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Most of London bomb area opens ABOUT 90 per cent of the area in the City closed because of the IRA bomb at the weekend has been opened to building keyholders to allow repairs to go ahead. Much of the remaining 21-acre area will be opened progressively during the next few days, but Mr Colin Snowden, the City engineer, said yesterday that it would take some weeks to open the streets close to the site of the explosion. The area of Bishopsgate from Wormwood Street to St Helen's Place is likely to remain closed for two months. Mr Snowden said: 'We have made good progress in the five days since the explosion. We have succeeded in getting things virtually back to normal thanks to the heroic efforts of the police and all other services.' Buildings near the heart of the blast are being cleared of glass and debris, and considerable rebuilding needs to be done on a wrecked sewer beneath the bomb crater. Mr Snowden confirmed that 25 buildings had been badly damaged and 30 had sustained moderate damage. Decisions on whether to demolish or refurbish will be taken by the owners, their technical advisers, and insurers. He said the clearing-up process, involving nearly 500 tonnes of broken glass and debris, had cost the City Corporation about Pounds 300,000. Some of this will be recovered from property owners. Buildings that suffered most damage were those made of reinforced concrete.</p>

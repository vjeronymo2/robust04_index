			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' DIVISION II;  </P> <P> MURRAY PACES GLENDORA WITH 37 POINTS  </P> <P> Dominguez High School Saturday witnessed what opponents of Glendora High have  seen all season: the Tracy Murray Show, as the Tartans defeated the Dons,  61-57, in the Southern California Regional Division II final at the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> After a shaky start, Murray provided a great ending, by scoring 19  fourth-quarter points and finishing with 37, as the Tartans earned a spot in  Saturday's State championship game at the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> Murray, the career and single-season state scoring leader, also controlled the  boards in the fourth quarter, grabbing 10 of his game-high 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> "We have a team of great character," said Glendora Coach Mike LeDuc. "It is a  situation where you have the best player around, surrounded by a group of good  players."  </P> <P> Dominguez, the Southern Section 4-A Division champions, held Murray to only 18  points after three quarters. He scored only three points in the third quarter,  as the Dons led, 47-40.  </P> <P> J. J. O'Laughlin played a major role in keeping the Tartans from getting routed  in the third quarter, scoring on three acrobatic layups to keep Glendora within  10 points.  </P> <P> Murray may have had problems early on, but he showed a preview of things to  come with a three-point jumper with eight seconds remaining in the third  quarter to bring Glendora to within seven points.  </P> <P> "I had lost my confidence a little when I was missing," said Murray, who has  not decided where he will attend college. of The choices, he said, are between  UCLA, Louisville, Villanova, UNLV and New Mexico.  </P> <P> "When I hit that shot (at the end of the third quarter), I said to myself 'I  can finally hit a shot now,' " said Murray, who averaged 45.5 points per game  this season.  </P> <P> Dominguez did not fold at the start of the fourth quarter, stretching its lead  to 51-40, on an explosive, one-hand dunk by 6-foot-4 guard Xavier Edison.  </P> <P> After that, it was all Murray.  </P> <P> Dominguez Coach Russell Otis credited Murray for Glendora's success, but also  praised Murray's teammates.  </P> <P> "Tracy Murray is a good player," said Otis, whose Dons finish at 26-5. "But,  Glendora is just not Tracy Murray, they are a good basketball team." LONNIE  WHITE  </P></p>

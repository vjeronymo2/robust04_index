			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vito Gnutti by Giorgio </F> Lonardi in Rome; date not given: "The Ministry Will Move"]    [Text] [Industry Minister] Vito Gnutti, [Budget Minister]  Giancarlo Pagliarini, and [Finance Minister] Giulio Tremonti,  the three economic ministers from the North, are each preparing  to open a "branch" of their ministries in Milan. The tax office  building in Via Manin has been chosen as the location. It is a  beautiful building a few hundred meters from the Cerchia del  Navigli that overlooks the municipal gardens. The news, that  was foreshadowed yesterday by LA REPUBBLICA, was confirmed by  Pagliarini, who is responsible for the budget. A spokesman of  the same Pagliarini had in fact observed that it was "necessary  for the ministry to open a branch in Milan." The reason is to  be closer to the real economy, to the production center, and to  the factories and offices of the North.    The minister was more loquacious in the lower house during  the evening. He joked that the Budget Ministry could be  "transferred to Lametia Terme, maybe to the former SIR [Italian  Resins Company] headquarters." Then Pagliarini added: "In  exchange, the Interior Ministry and the Bank of Italy could be  moved to Milan or at the most to Como." In short, a continuous  stream of witticism. It is an ironic mood that spills over into  enjoyment of being provocative. "We will move out of the  splendid building in Via Venti Settembre, that houses the Budget  and the Treasury Ministries and transform it into a beautiful  museum like the Louvre or the Prado. It would not even be  necessary to move the furniture. Giancarlo Pagliarini's desk is  already there," the minister ironically added, "it is a pity  that there is also the chair that belonged to Cirino Pomicino."    Jokes apart, Pagliarini then confided that he was in favor  of  moving the economic ministries to the North. "However, it can  only be a feasible project in the medium term," he specified,  "let us say in about 10 years." As regards the people who work  in Via Venti Settembre, "the problem can be resolved by freezing  the turnover, and in any case by avoiding traumatic solutions."    Vito Gnutti, who is responsible for industry, was more  cautious. He also began by laughing: "What do you people from  LA REPUBBLICA do? Are you mind readers?"    [Lonardi] So you confirm the project.    [Gnutti] It is a good idea to open a branch of the economic  ministries in the North. I willingly accept the suggestion that  your paper made.    [Lonardi] So, Minister Gnutti, have you already chosen to  house the Milan Industry, Finance, and Budget Ministries'  offices on Via Manin?    [Gnutti] In my dreams there is the hypothesis of opening  some  offices in the North. I repeat: You have read my mind.  However, there have been no meetings on this subject with my  colleagues, the other ministers.    [Lonardi] Did you not meet Pagliarini for dinner at a  restaurant in EUR [Rome suburb] a few evenings ago to celebrate  the new government?    [Gnutti] It may seem strange, but when we meet for dinner we  do not talk politics.    [Lonardi] However, you quite like the idea of opening a  branch in the North.    [Gnutti] I do not deny that at all. It forms part of our  idea of a "network capital."    [Lonardi] Could you explain this better.    [Gnutti] Federalism can be understood in various ways. There  is no law that says that all the ministries must be in Rome.  Therefore, they could be scattered over various regions of the  country.    [Lonardi] Are you convinced that this is the best solution?    [Gnutti] No, I like the idea of a "network capital." This  means that the ministries must be as close as possible to the  people. The risk to be taken is that of decentralization.    [Lonardi] And then?    [Gnutti] On the one hand, the offices must be where the  people need them. Even in the South clearly, in Palermo rather  than in Naples.    [Lonardi] And on the other hand?    [Gnutti] On the other hand, there is the solution offered by  computer science, that allows offices to be connected in a  "network," even if they are far apart. I will shortly be  holding a meeting on the computerization of the offices here at  the ministry. I think that this is a very important subject.    [Lonardi] Let us go back to Via Manin. Do you not think that  it is a suitable location for the Industry Ministry in the North?    [Gnutti] If you really want to know, the UUPPICA [Provincial  Offices of Industry, Commerce, and Crafts] offices at every  chamber of commerce are already a branch of the Industry  Ministry.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Fewer Bank of France branches The Bank of France should halve its number of regional branches and be more efficient in making notes and coins, according to reports by McKinsey and two other outside consultants commissioned by the French central bank itself. The bank's board commissioned the studies on its future over the next six to ten years, in the light of its new independence from the government over monetary policy and the prospect of itself become a regional branch of the European Central Bank under the Maastricht treaty. With 16,500 staff, the bank employs more than other central banks because it not only prints money and runs the payments clearing system but also has 176 regional branches offering management advice and some private banking facilities.</p>

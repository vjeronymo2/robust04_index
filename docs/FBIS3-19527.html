			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Employment Minister Michel Giraud by </F> Delphine Girard; place and date not given]    [Text] [Girard] Faced with the degree of discontent, should  the government not abandon the CIP [Youth Vocational Training  Contract]?    [Giraud] Following wide consultations with the social  partners, the prime minister has agreed to refine the initial  proposal. The additional decree to be published at the end of  the month will amend to two points which are being questioned by  the public. On the one hand, the content of the vocational  training will be specified. On the other, young graduates with  a "bac plus two" degree [two years of higher education] or with  an equivalent diploma may not receive less than the minimum  wage. The government will not budge any further.    [Girard] The CNPF [National Council of French Employers]  believes that changes to the 1937 decree on working hours will  have dramatic consequences for industry. Are you going to take  this into account?    [Giraud] At the moment, everybody is trying to retain their  own benefits. But we are not closing the door to discussions.  The government has decided to extend by one month, or longer,  consultations with the social partners on the new decree. Of  course, the final text must be compatible with existing labor  organization in industry. But any conclusion is premature for  the time being.    [Girard] What lessons do you draw from the Detroit summit on  employment?    [Giraud] Even if there were no negotiations -- that was not  the purpose of the meeting -- this summit did, for the first  time, allow the world's seven most industrialized countries to  exchange ideas on employment. It is now established that social  and economic aspects are closely linked and that it is no longer  possible to deal with economic problems without also tackling  the social questions.    [Girard] Did the G-7 serve to establish points of  convergence  between the countries regarding the fight against unemployment?    [Giraud] Discussions showed that the governments share  common  convictions. First, certain solutions were rejected. Together,  we have condemned a return to protectionism, a general and  compulsory reduction in working hours, and a reduced rate of  productivity. The countries agreed that growth is essential to  create jobs and that we must pursue macroeconomic policies  favoring a return to growth. But there was a consensus that  growth alone will not be enough.    We did not draw up a single model to be applied to  everybody.  Each country has its own culture, its own customs, and its own  methods of management and employment. We must not try to draw  up a global plan to combat unemployment.    [Girard] But beyond this, you agreed on the avenues to be  pursued?    [Giraud] We have identified four principal ways forward  which  are likely to promote jobs. The improvement of human resources  through training is essential to job growth. Training which  should not be aimed exclusively at the young but also at people  throughout their working life. The cost of low-skilled labor is  excessive, and this requires a reduction in the charges on low  wages.    Some countries take the view that the solution to the  recession is to pay some people very low wages, below the normal  wages; that is not France's position. We must remember that  the "minimum wage" in the United States is 4.25 dollars an hour,  or 4,300 francs gross for 169 hours. The third point is a more  flexible labor organization through part-time work and working  hours determined on an annual instead of weekly basis. Finally,  countries are calling for a more dynamic approach to the way we  handle the problem of unemployment, by requiring companies or  public authorities, whichever the case may be, to support a  return to work. You will be aware that these points of  convergence are also to be found in Jacques Delors' White Paper  as adopted by the European Council. They are also to be found in  the [French] five-year law on labor, employment, and vocational  training.    [Girard] Has progress been made on the idea of including a  social clause in trade agreements?    [Giraud] Two members of the French delegation intervened in  defense of the social clause, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery  and myself. We were followed by the Italians, the Canadians, as  well as the Greeks, who were present in their capacity as  current holders of the European Union presidency. The other  delegations did not intervene, but I have the feeling that the  United States is not opposed to the idea.    The next step now is Marrakesh. [Foreign Trade and Industry  Minister] Gerard Longuet will be the French Government's  representative at the Marrakesh meeting, which will lead to the  establishment of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). The  social clause question will again be raised. I intend, as I did  last year, to argue for this once again before the WTO general  assembly in June. I believe that after having sought, in  various circles, the backing of other countries on the principle  of such a clause, it is now up to the WTO -- as a tripartite  structure -- to precisely define the content and the procedures  which will ensure the widest possible ratification and respect  for such a clause.    I see five areas which constitute the hard core of human  labor rights: free trade unions; prohibition of forced labor,  that is slavery; child labor; working conditions for women; and  prison labor.</p>

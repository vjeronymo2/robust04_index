			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] At the invitation of the prime minister of the  Federation of Russia and Governments of Ukraine and Kazakhstan,  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife will pay  official visits to these countries from July 8-20. It is the  first official visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to these  states since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The prime  minister is accompanied by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam;  minister of the Government Office; minister of energy; minister  of science, technology, and environment; and 31 Vietnamese  businessmen. The prime minister's trip will start in Kiev and  then Almaty and Moscow. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will be  received by presidents of all these states and Vietnam will sign  with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan agreements, treaties, and  joint communiques on cooperation.    Relations between Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and  Kazakhstan  have been established for a long time. After the collapse of  the former Soviet Union, Vietnam and these states try to  maintain these relations. Cooperation has continued to develop  in the fields of energy and oil and gas. Vietnam also has  cooperated with Russia in other areas, such as transportation  and agriculture. However, two-way trade turnover between  Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan was still at a  modest level. The turnover with Russia was $300 million and  with Ukraine $330 million. During the trip, further cooperation  will be developed in accordance with their potentials.    Meanwhile, relations between Vietnam and Germany are  developing strongly. The visit to Vietnam by Minister of  Cooperation and Development of Germany Carl-Dieter Spranger at  the end of May made considerable contribution. The development  of relations between the two countries does not reflect  Germany's official development aid -- ODA -- to Vietnam, but  Germany's efforts are clear in increasing its aid to both north  and south Vietnam equally. In 1990, Germany granted aid to  Vietnam 12 million Deutche marks, in 1991 the amount of aid from  Germany increased to DM27 million, in 1992 it was 49 million,  and 1993 63 million. These figures prove that over the past  four years relations between the two countries have achieved  important steps which were not obvious in previous years. The  main reasons are the changing and development in Vietnam itself  because of renovation.</p>

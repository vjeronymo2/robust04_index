			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- It appears that "Ricardo Z"  has become the new leader of Peru's Maoist gang Shining Path  [SL] after ousting Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "Feliciano." So  far, Peruvian intelligence services have been unable to  establish the real identity of "Ricardo Z."    According to sources in the intelligence services, it seems  that after Abimael Guzman was arrested, almost a year and a half  ago, "Ricardo Z" stepped into the shoes of SL's imprisoned  founder and main ideologist.    Many analysts have reported that "Ricardo Z" could be one of  the four SL leaders still at large, including Julio Cesar  Mezzich, aka "El Doctorcito" ["the little doctor"], and Teresa  Durand.    They do not rule out the possibility that second-level SL  leaders may have ousted their superiors, or that "Feliciano" --  who took over after Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 --  is now calling himself "Ricardo Z."    The Lima daily EXPRESO quoted the National Counterterrorism  Directorate (Dincote) as stating that Ramirez could have changed  his alias to evade security forces, which according to military  sources are on his tracks in the mountains of Ayacucho  Department.    Dincote claims that "Ramirez has changed his alias to avoid  an impending arrest." The same source indicated that another SL  leader could have taken the alias "Feliciano."    The news media also speculate that "Ricardo Z" could well be  a leader of Colombian drug traffickers who are afraid of losing  coca plantations in the Peruvian jungle, which they control with  SL's help.    "Ricardo Z" could also be a SL military leader who has  staged  a "coup d'etat" against the organization's high command.    Former Deputy Alberto Valencia, an expert in subversion,  told  EXPRESO that he is under the impression that Teresa Durand,  known as "the strongest military commander," could be calling  herself "Ricardo Z."    Valencia does not believe that Ramirez could be "Ricardo Z,"  although he did say that Ramirez had been entrusted with  organizing the SL "people's guerrilla army." According to  Valencia "neither could Mezzich be `Ricardo Z,' as he has lost  power and is looked upon as an upstart."    All the experts agree that security forces are bound to  defeat the SL, which has been going downhill since Guzman and 90  percent of the SL high command were arrested in September 1992.    A military offensive is currently under way in Leoncio  Prado,  a jungle province of Huanuco Department, Peru's central mountain  region. The objective of this offensive is to eliminate SL  columns which are operating in the area, because these columns  appear to be the strongest force SL has left.    Various circles have criticized "Operation Aries," and there  are witnesses who claim that the military have used helicopters  to bomb civilians who are fleeing from the area.</p>

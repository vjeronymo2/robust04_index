			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK shares fall out of favour with funds UK fund managers' enthusiasm for buying British equities has waned further, according to the latest monthly poll of investment intentions from Smith New Court and Gallup. The balance of bulls over bears of UK shares has fallen from 20 per cent in April to 8 per cent in the June poll, carried out early last week. This is in spite of a balance of 28 per cent of respondents, up from 17 per cent in May, expecting the FT-SE 100 index to rise over the next three months, and 81 per cent (74 per cent) bullish on the index over the next 12 months. Fund managers have become more bullish about gilts, however, with the balance of those planning to buy over those expecting to sell rising from 2 per cent to 16 per cent between May and June. A desire to reduce cash balances, currently 3 per cent of pension funds' money, is persisting and fund managers' favourite target market is the Japanese equity market, with Smith New Court saying investors were 'rampantly bullish' about the outlook for this market. The balance of buyers over sellers was 47 per cent in the June poll although the market has already risen significantly this year. Among other European markets, fund managers favour France, Germany and Spain at the expense mainly of Italy. The US market is expected to show the lower growth over the next 12 months than the UK, Japan or Europe.</p>

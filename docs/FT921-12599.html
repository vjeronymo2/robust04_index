			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Rescue details NATIONWIDE Building Society has announced the details of its 'mortgage rescue' plan, which is designed to keep its beleaguered mortgage-holders with roofs over their heads. The Home Rescue Scheme involves the society in lending Pounds 8m to three housing associations - London &amp; Quadrant, Newlon, and Notting Hill Housing Trust. The housing associations will then take over the ownership of houses belonging to around 100 borrowers in the London area. The borrowers will then effectively become housing association tenants, and pay rent. Borrowers can then have their arrears wiped out, if they stay with the scheme for at least three years. Rents will be lower than mortgage repayments, and will be set at between 3.5 per cent and 8 per cent of the value of the house. Nationwide is also launching from Monday a free mortgage protection policy which provides one year's cover of mortgage repayments against unemployment, sickness or accident. You have to buy your home through Nationwide Estate Agents to qualify. Citibank is offering free unemployment insurance for two years. BES schemes currently being used to fund mortgage rescues involve The Mortgage Corporation and the Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association.</p>

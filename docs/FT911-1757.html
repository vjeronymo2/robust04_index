			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson seeks Pounds 9m via rights OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the retail jeweller, yesterday announced a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 9m and revive a balance sheet decimated by a disastrous foray into the property market. The issue at 35p, just below the closing price of the shares on the market yesterday, will also finance a rapid expansion of a number of jewellery and footwear stores. Owen also reported a Pounds 5.45m provision against losses on the sale of property companies which it bought in 1989. In addition it faces a redemption call from a preference shareholder, which will cost it Pounds 1.7m in July. The company will have to apply to the High Court to reduce its share premium account by Pounds 6.69m to allow the resumption of dividend payments in future years. If the rights issue is successful, Owen will finish this fiscal year with gearing of 40 per cent and debt of about Pounds 3.5m, said Mr Tom Forsyth, finance director. Owen reported a pre-tax loss in the year to end-January of Pounds 638,000, compared to a profit of Pounds 1.01m the previous year, on sales up Pounds 4.1m at Pounds 18.14m. Losses per share came out at 9.29p - compared with earnings of 1.59p - and the company passed the final dividend leaving a total for the year of 0.15p. Most of the properties have now been sold for Pounds 4.2m in cash. Owen paid Pounds 3.2m for the property company which had book assets of Pounds 10m and debt of Pounds 6.5m. Mr Maurice Dwek, chairman, said that stripping out the property division, the retail loss had been reduced from Pounds 754,000 to Pounds 163,000. Mr Forsyth said the rights issue was not solely designed to rebuild the balance sheet. 'The provision on property left a horrendous hole in the balance sheet but now we are buying stores with equity,' he said. By the end of November, Mr Forsyth said, Owen would have nearly doubled to 70 the number of Gold Centre stores which sell a limited range of 9 ct gold jewellery at an average sale price of between Pounds 12 and Pounds 14. It will also have doubled the Foothold branded footwear stores to 16 by January, he said. Mr Forsyth said the rights issue was well supported. Nearly 40 per cent of the shares being issued will be taken up by directors and large shareholders. Mr Dwek votes 24 per cent of the Owen shares through trusts managed by MIM Britannia. Mr Richard Ratner, a cousin of Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman of Ratners, the headline-grabbing retail jewellers, resigned yesterday as a director of Owen.</p>

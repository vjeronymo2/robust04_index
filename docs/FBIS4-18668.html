			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Thomas Knipp: "Correction Instead of a </F> Slump"]    [Text] Was that it? Is the correction on the  international share markets already at the point of ending? One  look at the development of leading market indicators around the  middle of the week could give precisely that impression. After  turbulent days with high losses in rates, the stockbrokers again  enjoyed rising rates. It will probably be no more than a short  breather, however. Anyone who looks at the basic data -- removed  from all the hectic of the market, the hysteria of some brokers,  and the often little illuminating comments by analysts -- comes  to the conclusion: The international share markets are  currently correcting the excesses of the past year. And this  correction does not seem to be completely over yet. The danger  of a profound slump is not particularly great, however.    Once again, the hedge funds and other professional  speculators, such as the big banks' own brokers, smelled a rat  in time. This was not difficult. In contrast to the majority  of analysts, they correctly advocated the view that a rising  prime rate in the United States would put a temporary end to the  boom on the bond markets and then on the share markets. The  speculators got rid of large amounts of those investments that  were good in 1993, but had become too expensive in the end.    After losses in the quotations over the past few weeks, some  of which were painfully high, it now seems that good advice is  difficult to get. Many analysis, who predicted skyrocketing  rates at the beginning of the year, are now exercising -- in  conformity with the market -- slump scenarios. If, however, one  takes a sober look at the situation, the following scenario  seems to be likely: If interests in the United States continue  to rise and there are prospects that the dollar will go up, more  and more uncertain U.S. investors will take their leave from the  share markets all over the world and will invest their money in  domestic bonds. This leads to another correction of the  excessively expensive dividend values. In the United Stats and  on most of the European markets, shares are still too expensive,  measured by the usual target figures and compared with the past.  Conservative European investors will not be willing to fill the  gap left behind by withdrawing U.S. capital at such high prices.  Therefore, the correction on Wall Street and at the European  stock exchanges will continue.    However, this very likely correction of values is laying the  foundation for a new, well-founded upswing at the end of the  year. The U.S. interest policy will probably lead to a  low-inflation, constant growth in the Anglo-Saxon countries.  Together with rising company profits, this will provide the  stock markets with trust and higher rates; the European markets  will follow with a slight delay. At the moment, there is no  fundamental justification for a slump. Therefore, investors with  courage and good nerves are selling shares and U.S. bonds; they  are buying European bonds. And, being certain of generous  interest revenues, they are waiting for the appropriate  opportunity to purchase on the share markets.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reforms would curb 'wildest excesses' SIR David Calcutt QC recommended yesterday that a wide range of measures should be taken against the press to protect individual privacy, including the setting up of a statutory tribunal with the power to restrain publication and to fine newspapers up to 1 per cent of annual revenue. In his much-leaked report, Review of Self-Regulation, published yesterday after a six-month study, Sir David concluded that press self-regulation under the Press Complaints Commission had not worked. He called for the creation of new criminal offences against physical intrusion, such as using surveillance devices, with fines of up to Pounds 5,000. He also recommended that the government consider introducing a new tort (civil wrong) of infringement of privacy. It could not be restricted to the press - it would have to include all the media and cover a wide range of human and technological activities. Sir David, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, also called on the government to consider: Whether the Data Protection Act's provisions are relevant for tackling misrepresentation of intrusion into personal privacy by the press. Whether further legislation on interception of telephone calls is needed. Whether legislation preventing the identification of minors involved in court cases should be amended to remove inconsistencies. Sir David said his recommendations were designed to make a positive contribution to the development of the highest standards of journalism 'to enable the press to operate freely and responsibly and to give it the backing needed in a fiercely competitive market, to resist the wildest excesses'. They were not designed to suppress free speech or stultify a vibrant and dynamic press. 'They are designed principally to ensure that privacy, which all agree should be respected, is protected from unjustifiable intrusion, and protected by a body in which the public, as well as the press, has confidence.' Many of the proposals closely follow the regime Sir David recommended in 1990 should be imposed if 'the last chance' for self-regulation were to fail. That was when his committee published its report on 'privacy and related matters'. His verdict on the performance of Lord McGregor's PCC  - which replaced the Press Council under the Calcutt Committee recommendations - is unambiguous. He said the PCC had not turned out to be an effective regulator of the press - it was largely a creature of the newspaper industry, its members had not been independently appointed, the code of practice had been watered down, and no 'hotline' had been set up for those who feared their privacy was about to be invaded. 'The commission has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which enables it to command not only press but also public confidence,' Sir David said. He said the PCC was not holding the balance fairly between the press and the individual. He was also concerned about the PCC's handling of the serialisation of Mr Andrew Morton's book on Princess Diana and of reporting of stories concerning Mr David Mellor, the former National Heritage secretary, and the actress Ms Antonia de Sancha 'and the commission's apparent lack of public action in other cases involving public figures where some action might reasonably have been expected'. Sir David said that nothing he had learned about the press led him to believe it would make the changes needed, and the answer was a statutory tribunal chaired by a judge or senior lawyer. The report does not give extensive evidence, other than criticism of the way the PCC was set up, to justify the view that self-regulation had failed and could never be made to work. 'The review received evidence from several private individuals who were unhappy with the way they had been treated by the press,' Sir David said. Claims included inaccurate reporting, harassment, the taking and publication of unauthorised photographs and the invasion of privacy of hospital patients or grieving relatives. Sir David's main remedy, a statutory press complaints tribunal, could not only 'restrain publication of material in breach of the code of practice' by means of injunctions and impose fines. The new offences of physical intrusion - entering private property without consent, using surveillance devices without consent, and taking photographs or recordings without consent on private property - would be summary offences not carrying a prison sentence. Sir David proposed that the High Court be able to grant injunctions preventing publication of material obtained by any of the proposed offences.</p>

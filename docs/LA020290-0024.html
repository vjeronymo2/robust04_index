			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GIANNINI WANTS BYE INSTEAD OF KENNEDY  </P> <P> Montclair Prep football Coach George Giannini said Thursday that his team will  not play Kennedy in the fall, despite a published report that said such a  meeting had been tentatively arranged.  </P> <P> According to the report, the schools' athletic directors had agreed to the  Sept. 22 game, pending approval from Giannini.  </P> <P> But Giannini is strongly opposed to the game.  </P> <P> "That report is absolutely premature," Giannini said. "Right now, there's no  contract and there's no game. I want to take a bye on the third week. In fact,  I'm absolutely not leaning toward playing that game. I think I'm almost sure  we'll take a bye."  </P> <P> Montclair Prep has scheduled nine games, including five against Alpha League  opponents and three against nonleague foes Santa Paula, St. Genevieve and Simi  Valley. Also included is a game against Oahu Farrington High in Honolulu as  part of a tripleheader in Aloha Stadium in August.  </P> <P> Canyon and Crespi also are scheduled to play Hawaiian teams, pending approval  by the Southern Section.  </P> <P> Southern Section rules allow for only 10 regular-season games, forcing the  Mounties to take at least one bye -- in either the first week of the season  (Sept. 7) or the third (Sept. 21). Giannini said that he would rather play the  first week and take the third week off.  </P> <P> "I would love to play Kennedy," Giannini said. "But I want to do what's best  for our program. And that would mean taking the third week as a bye."  </P> <P> Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said that his City Section team is willing to play  if Giannini changes his mind.  </P></p>

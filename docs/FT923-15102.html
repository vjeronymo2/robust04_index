			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Third Chicago airport plan 'dead' MR Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago, has declared the project to build a third big airport in the city 'dead'. The Illinois Senate defeated legislation to allow work on the Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 5.8bn) airport proposal, for which Mr Daley has fought for nearly three years. It was to have been the largest public works project in the US, creating 200,000 jobs. Many believe, however, that Mr Daley, who often expresses his frustration in public, is likely to take the project up again in the legislature's autumn session. Mr Jim Edgar, Republican state governor, favours the airport and hopes Mr Daley, a staunch Democrat, will not give up. In a reference to the powerful political machine once run by Mr Daley's father, who as mayor from 1955 to 1976 was the last of America's big city political bosses, Mr Edgar said: 'You just don't make a phone call any more and have these things happen.' Mr Edgar was unwilling to spend all his political capital rallying his party's senators behind the airport.</p>

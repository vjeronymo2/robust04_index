			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Arab states start meeting The six Gulf Arab states and principal Arab allies Egypt and Syria began a two-day meeting yesterday, but were expected to put aside controversial Egyptian proposals for military co-operation, according to diplomats, Reuter reports from Doha. 'The first priority of the Damascus Declaration (signed by the eight states last year) is political co-operation,' Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the conference chairman, said. Egypt, however, is seeking a chain of rapid deployment forces that could respond to a request from any of the eight states - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Syria.</p>

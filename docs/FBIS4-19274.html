			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  described Albanian President Sali Berisha's letter to the EU  [European Union] commission as positive. At the same time,  Venizelos stressed that even with a few days' delay, the  Albanian side's reaction to Greece's proposals to defuse the  situation make things easier. Venizelos said that in the past  few days, the Albanian side attempted a dangerous spread of the  tension, but Greece's stance was calm and firm from the  beginning.</p>

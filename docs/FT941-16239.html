			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Takeover stalemate ends with share sale KNP BT, the Netherlands' biggest paper and packaging group, has disposed of its 46 per cent stake in Ahrend, the Dutch office furnisher. The move brings to an end a stalemate that has existed between the two companies since a failed takeover attempt in 1989. The shareholding, worth around Fl 100m (Dollars 51m), was placed mainly with institutional investors, with Ahrend itself buying back around 10 per cent of the shares. The Ahrend shares are a legacy of an unsuccessful takeover attempt nearly five years ago by Buhrmann-Tetterode (BT), which merged in early 1993 with KNP and VRG of the Netherlands to form KNP BT. KNP BT said that the disposal would lead to an unspecified extraordinary gain. However, the company added that, overall, it would be taking an extraordinary charge of around Fl 300m this year to finance reorganisations, in line with earlier predictions. KNP BT indicated last year that it wanted to sell its Ahrend shares, saying the shareholding had been downgraded from a strategic to a financial investment.</p>

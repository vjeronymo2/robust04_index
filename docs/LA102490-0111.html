			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Glenfed Cuts Dividend: The parent of Glendale Federal Bank, California's  third-largest thrift, slashed its quarterly dividend to 15 cents per share from  30 cents.  </P> <P> Glenfed Inc. said it cut the dividend as part of an effort to increase the  amount of capital it generates internally. Federal capital standards for  thrifts are set to rise in 1993. Glenfed also said the new dividend would be in  line with the dividend yield paid by similar-sized thrifts. Before the  announcement, Glenfed's dividend yield was 14. The new dividend will be payable  Nov. 16 to stockholders of record on Nov. 5. Glenfed's stock closed at $7.50 a  share, down 62.5 cents in NYSE trading.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> UNION CONTRACTS DELAY CITY BUDGET  </P> <P> Despite two months of study and debate, the City Council is still wrangling  over the city's $218-million budget because contracts with the police and fire  unions have not been settled.  </P> <P> Santa Ana is the largest city in the county without a final 1990-91 budget at  hand. The council missed its own deadline last month for passing the budget.  The city councils of Irvine and Westminster have not passed final budgets  either.  </P> <P> "We're being held hostage by the contracts," said Mayor Daniel H. Young, who is  pushing for budget passage. Young described the delays as "embarrassing."  </P> <P> However, Councilman Richards L. Norton contends that the council should not  pass the budget until contracts are settled. He said the city might be forced  to change budget appropriations after the contracts are approved.  </P> <P> "It's not fair to pass it now," Norton said. "We will be taking from Peter to  give to Paul."  </P> <P> Santa Ana's budget, which emphasizes a beefed-up police force to battle gang  activity, was unveiled by City Manager David N. Ream in May, but final adoption  has been postponed six times throughout the summer.  </P> <P> Ream said on Wednesday that further budget delays could begin to affect  personnel expenditures, such as the amount of overtime paid on a monthly basis  and service contracts. The city has also had to delay many public works  construction projects and all capital improvement projects.  </P> <P> Until the new budget is passed, the city will not be able to add the 15 new  positions budgeted for the Police Department, Ream said. Those positions  include six additional investigators for the department's narcotics unit and  four more investigators for its gang unit. In addition, five more non-sworn  officers will be added to the force to allow officers more time to patrol the  streets. The 10 new investigators will be chosen from within the department's  roster of 351 officers. The budget also allocates $219,055 for the promotion of  three sergeants to the position of lieutenant.  </P> <P> The Police Department's $40-million budget represents approximately 40% of the  city's general fund budget.  </P> <P> Also delayed is additional funding for Project Pride, a program run by the  Recreation and Community Services Agency, Ream said.  </P> <P> Funding for this program, which attempts to steer youngsters away from joining  gangs, has been nearly doubled from $66,000 to $110,000 to make it available at  six additional schools.  </P> <P> A total of $34.8 million has been budgeted for the delayed capital  improvements. In addition to the work being done in neighborhoods, there will  be resurfacing of major thoroughfares, new traffic signals, parks improvements  and a library renovation and expansion program.

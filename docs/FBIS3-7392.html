To make matters worse, North Korean criticisms against South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Kim's strong reactions against  them have collided, resulting in an "emotional" tit-for-tat.    "Reneging on its promise not to slander or vilify each other  (in the inter-Korean basic agreement), North Korea extended its  time for anti-South Korean propaganda to 13 hours from 10 hours  a day," Kim was quoted as telling military leaders in a  luncheon meeting at Chongwadae [presidential offices] Tuesday.    He further criticized the North for remaining the same as it  was 50 years ago in failing to keep promises, citing that the  North Korean continued its nuclear weapons development program  secretly even after it agreed to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.    The fresh recrimination between the two Koreas can be seen  most clearly at the working-level contact on exchanging envoys  at the truce village of Panmunjom March 19.    In front of the North Korean delegates at the inter-Korean  talks, chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae read aloud a  "bill of indictment" issued by the North Korean Committee for  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, a body in charge of  South Korean affairs.    In the indictment dated Feb. 25, Pyongyang harshly lashed  out  at President Kim Yong-sam and called on the South Korean people  to wage decisive battles against the government to overthrow it.    To the North Korean delegates, all of whom are associated  with the committee, Song strongly demanded that the North  withdraw the indictment and apologize in order to engage in  further dialogue.    "If the contents of the indictment were true, wouldn't it be  hypocrisy for you to hold a talk with our side here and now?"  Song was quoted as saying.    Song's vigorous protest was in response to the North's  renewed demand of the four preconditions it had set for the  envoy exchange. The North had backed down over the preconditions  at the sixth contact March 12.    Such a turnaround on the part of the South was mainly caused  by the North's repeated and escalating criticisms against the  Seoul government, especially President Kim Yong-sam, analysts  say.    With the exception of the first 100 days after Kim took  office late February 1993, North Korea has not ceased to slander  the South's Chief Executive.    Regardless of these vilification, President Kim decided to  try to improve inter-Korean relations by proposing a summit  meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song early this year,  but met with more high-blown slander, which billed his offer  "the whining of a hooligan caught in a trap."    The North's continued mudslinging against the South was  reported to have something to do with the President's complete  about-face on North Korean policy from appeasement to hardline.    According to a report compiled by the National Unification  Board (NUB), the North's number of slander against the President  amounted to 1,000 during the past year.    "Recently, it has doubled, to eight to ten times on a daily  basis," Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae said.    North Korea's verbal attacks against the southern leader are  centered upon Kim's personality, his policies and remarks  regarding the North.    In extreme cases the North called President Kim Yong-sam a  "political whore," "civilian fascist wearing business suit," and  "first-class poodle of Japan and the United States," to name a  few.    That is why the South Korean chief delegate demanded that  the  North immediately stop slandering the President, during the  eighth contact at Panmunjom March 19, where the North ruptured  the talks by walking out of the meeting.    The North's slander against the South Korean President are  due to the country's great worry over the Seoul-Washington joint  strategy in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, the NUB  report analyzed.    The North Korean leadership must have reasoned that the  close  cooperation between South Korea and the United States would be a  great stumbling block to the future negotiations between  Washington and Pyongyang in resolving the nuclear issue.    Other reasons included the North's bid to maintain  anti-South  Korean hard-line sentiment among the North Koreans to calm  discontent over its economic difficulty, and to weaken the  President's popular support and instigate antigovernment  struggles in the South, the NUB report analyzed.    However, many experts on North Korean affairs advised people  not to be bothered with North Korean demagoguery, which stresses  rhetoric. The government's North Korean policies should not be  adversely affected by it they said. (LMH)</p>

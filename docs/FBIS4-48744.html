			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Enrico Kemp] </F>   [Text] Addis Ababa May 25 SAPA -- South Africa has to  consider humanitarian aid to refugees displaced by civil war in  Rwanda, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said on Wednesday.    In an interview en route to Addis Ababa, he said possible  military intervention in Rwanda by the South African troops  would have to be carefully considered by the government. "There  is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to  assist and desire to help is there."    Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in  Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South  Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity  headquarters.    South Africa became the 53rd member of the OAU on Monday.    Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict  mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the  United Nations.    He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic  benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU.  "Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign  debt and must do everything possible to end that debt."    The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the  OAU was "the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa  will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of  Africa".    South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself  in international politics and there was an increased potential  for trade links with other African states.    He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy  would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South  Africans. "We are not going to foster big brother relations with  the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help  uplift the other countries of Africa."    The flag-raising ceremony, which would be attended by the  OAU  Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, is scheduled to take  place at 3PM SA [South African] time.</p>

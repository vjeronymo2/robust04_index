			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A TASTE OF RIO JUST SOUTH OF THE BORDER  </P> <P> There are moments when Tijuana seems immeasurably more sophisticated than San  Diego, and moments when it seems drab and cheerless; the trick, of course, is  to catch it at the right time, an event not easy to prognosticate.  </P> <P> A good place at which to find Tijuana in its most European mood (the surprise  is that any city in this area would have such a mood, but Tijuana can) is Plaza  Fiesta, the instantly quaint Mexican village of small shops and restaurants  that was built catty-corner to the Cultural Center several years ago as this  city's answer to Seaport Village.  </P> <P> Plaza Fiesta boomed when it opened and quickly became a gathering spot for the  chic, the would-be chic, the young and, according to Tijuana sources, some  segments of the underworld. A police crackdown cleared the winding byways about  six months ago, and, on a recent Saturday, the place was relatively quiet.  </P> <P> If anything, there seem to be more restaurants than before in the maze-like  collection of two-story buildings. There are at least 20 eateries, including  not only Mexican houses but Italian, Greek and even Yugoslav, and, since  virtually all of them feature live music, a stroll through Plaza Fiesta can  make visitors feel like spectators at a monumental battle of the bands.  </P> <P> La Taberna Espanola, an authentic Spanish tapas bar run by Galicians, remains  the most popular place by far, but right across the way is a tiny establishment  called Oba Oba that flies a banner reading comida brasiliera. It takes about  two seconds to translate this into "Brazilian food" and perhaps another two  seconds to be seated at one of the seven tables in the minuscule but handsome  dining room.  </P> <P> If one has not already had a sherry and a tapa at La Taberna, the way to start  a meal here is with a caipirinha, a feisty cooler of sugar cane liquor, lemon  juice and sugar that strolling vendors concoct on the beaches in Rio de Janeiro  and that reputedly puts languid sunbathers on Copacabana Beach in the mood for  another dip in the sea.  </P> <P> Oba Oba's menu is written in Brazilian and translated into Spanish, so that  anyone familiar with Mexican menus should find it easy to read; examples would  be feijao, which translates into frijoles and beans, and queijo, or queso and  cheese.  </P> <P> Starters divide into two competing categories, pasteis (empanadas) stuffed with  cheese, shrimp or the hashed meat called picadinho (picadillo), and  churrasquinhos, or skewers of marinated beef, chicken or pork cooked to a  crusty finish on the grill. The latter are tasty but filling and are simply  half-sized versions of the churrasco skewers offered as entrees. The empanadas,  on the other hand, are alluring meat pies encased in flaky pastry; the shrimp  version is a masterwork of subtlety whose suggestion of sweet-sour flavor  vanishes if one thinks too much about it.  </P> <P> One can also start with a typical hearts-of-palm salad (palmito) or one of a  trio of traditional soups, including very Brazilian chicken-with-vegetables  (canja de galinha) and beans with spaghetti (feijao con massa). It is as well  to begin on the light side, though, since entree portions can be formidable.  </P> <P> All the entrees are utterly typical and each plate seems engineered to be its  own cornucopia; the only constant factors are the mounds of rice studded with  peas and chopped carrots (it is excellent), the fried bananas and the little  piles of farofa, a toasted flour that one sprinkles over anything and  everything to add a slightly nutty taste and gritty texture. Farofa and  Brazilian cooking are synonymous, and the stuff does have its moments,  especially when added to the picadinho, the wonderfully savory and teasingly  sweet hash of ground beef, tomatoes, onions and olives.  </P> <P> Another typical offering is tutu a mineira, a sort of buffet-on-a-plate of  spicy chorizo-like sausage (linguica); a lacy fried egg; farofa-coated fried  bananas; rice; a mound of black beans cooked down to a paste (Brazilians know  that there's more than one way to cook a bean); a peeled orange and a  sensational pile of melting, chopped kale seasoned with enough cayenne to make  a definite statement. The plate reads like a shopping list of favorite  Brazilian foods and is a delight.  </P> <P> The dessert list offers flan out of a sense of obligation, but also pastel de  goiabada e queijo, a fried, cinnamon-dusted empanada that combines the quince  paste-cream cheese combination popular in many Latin countries.  </P> <P> Meals are priced reasonably, and three courses with wine, tax and tip should  cost about $15 per person.  </P> <P> The tiny room is magically enlarged by a mirrored wall; another wall is taken  up by a collection of carnival masks and, rather amazingly, room has been made  for an upright piano. This recently was manned by a tuxedoed pianist who  effortlessly moved from classical nocturnes to mean sambas to such dandy things  as "Blue Moon (You Left Me Standing Alone)." With the food thrown in, this all  added to an unexpected taste of Rio just south of the border.  </P> <P> Oba Oba is easily located. From the San Ysidro border crossing, follow the Zona  Rio signs to Avenida Paseo de los Ninos Heroes and watch for the large Plaza  Fiesta sign half-way around the first traffic circle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> OBA OBA  </P> <P> Avenida Paseo de los Ninos Heroes 1001, Tijuana  </P> <P> Telephone: Tijuana 85-10-11  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner served Tuesday through Sunday; closed Monday.  </P></p>

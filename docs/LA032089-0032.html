			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> A federal judge has set May 24 for a hearing on a lawsuit filed by a group of  real estate investors who are suing talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. for  allegedly selling them worthless plots of land in the California desert,  advertised as being laden with gold. The class action suit, filed in December  in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charges that in 1982-83 Downey bilked  investors out of $10 million to $20 million. Downey, 56, whose controversial TV  show is taped in Secaucus, N.J., told a Hackensack newspaper (The Record) over  the weekend that the complaint is unfounded.

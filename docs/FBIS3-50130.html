Perhaps not the way he thought. It can  certainly be seen as a fact that last week's Prague summit was  the final blow to the Visegrad Four, and it seems completely  improbable that this forum of regional cooperation could be  saved in its current form. Actually, there is not much reason to  save it in its current form. All along, Visegrad remained a  dream and it never became anything like it had been intended or  what it could have been if Prague had also wanted it. However,  this way, it did not turn into a regional power center or a  framework of political and economic cooperation -- at the most,  it was a political saloon, a discussion club, where the region's  leaders passed some time together. This could not have had much  practical use; it did not stop the economic links between the  three -- later four -- Visegrad countries from breaking down,  while the nations in question have not come closer together  emotionally or politically, either. The main reason for this  must be sought in the fact that, rather than seeing each other  as partners, the governments of the given countries saw each  other as rivals, or even as a burden hindering their march  toward the West.    The only positive results of this cat-and-dog friendship  arose almost completely independently of the participants,  sometimes even against their wishes. They are very lucky that  the West continues to treat the Visegrad countries as a group,  and this has been to their definite advantage so far in their  integration efforts.    The Prague summit brought important new elements into this  situation. First of all, through offering the Partnership for  Peace, Washington (although it still wants to see the four  countries together) has resigned itself to the probable  amplification of the rivalry and to an increased regional  differentiation. Secondly, the Prague meeting also made it  clear that the Czech Republic is canceling even the existing  rudimentary forms of the Visegrad cooperation. The emerging new  situation favors the strong, and according to all indications,  Prague feels strong just now.    It would be pointless to dispute the Czech Republic's right  to take a separate course from its neighbors, and to form its  international relations independently of these countries, solely  in accordance with its own interests. If Prague breaks with  Visegrad -- so be it. However, the others should, by all means,  realize that the Czech Republic is trying to do this in such a  way that, without it, nothing should be left of Visegrad.  Naturally, this intent is perfectly understandable from  Prague's point of view -- a Visegrad without Czechs would be a  serious counterbalance or alternative to Prague and the Czech  way in Europe.    Up to now, in the Visegrad Four, everything has happened the  way Prague wanted it; simply as a result of the decision-making  mechanism based on consensus. Prague also shaped Visegrad's  image to its current form -- namely to be without character.  Now, for the first time, the time has come to say no to Prague.  It is simply not true that, in the current situation, Central  Europe does not have any other common issues but free trade,  which is the only issue urged by [Czech Prime Minister] Klaus.    Naturally, for Central Europe to be able to represent its  particular interests, a Visegrad group that no longer has the  Czechs (and whose place the Slovenians, for example, would  obviously be happy to take) should radically change its views.  Much more imagination, goodwill, trust, and tolerance would be  needed. All the factors that are missing in this region.    However, this situation might change slowly because the  circumstances might compel the affected nations in this  direction. So far, the main objection against closer Central  European cooperation has been the argument that it would force  the states that are trying to get access to the western  integration to wait too long. In the meantime, however, the  same situation has arisen even while regional cooperation was  being disarrayed. By now, it has become clear that Central  Europe will have to wait a long time for European Union  membership and for NATO membership. However, we will still have  to carry on living somehow until this happens. For this reason  alone, Central Europe is doomed to cooperate; in fact, a more  effective regional cooperation would actually strengthen the  region's position in the process of negotiations with the West.    If Prague realizes this fact, it is good. If it does not  then the others will still have to make a step. Even without  Prague.</p>

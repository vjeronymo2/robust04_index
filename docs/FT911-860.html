			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Observer: Talent spotted At 80, Lord Kearton may have long ceased treating Courtaulds as his personal domain. But the appointment of Sipko Huismans as its chief executive shows he still has influence over its fate. It was Kearton, a colossus of post-war industrial Britain, who first spotted Dutch-born Huismans in 1961. At the time, he was 21 and a 'very bad chemist' with a Courtaulds offshoot in Swaziland. But Kearton saw a latent sales and marketing man hiding inside and brought him to England. What caught Kearton's eye? Dynamism, he recalls, ability and an irrepressibly adventurous approach. All of which paints Huismans very differently from the cerebral, precise and very English Sir Christopher Hogg, another Kearton recruit who has been chairman and chief executive for nearly 12 years. Hogg, 54, says it is time to give someone else a go. He will remain chairman of Courtaulds and of Courtaulds Textiles, which was successfully hived off last year. With the chairmanship of Reuters also in his quiver, he claims he has no immediate ambition elsewhere. He describes his successor as 'a bloody good decision-maker with great judgment'. The new chief executive, for his part, remembers travelling in the lift with Kearton, dreaming of the job which will be his from August. 'I have wanted to be here for 30 years. We will see how things go but seven or eight years in the seat may be enough.' He has been on the board since 1984 and managing director of the speciality materials business since last year's de-merger. And while he does not envisage any shake-up in strategy or personnel, his appointment as the first non-Brit to the top job in Hanover Square seems appropriate. 'When Chris arrived,' he says, 'Courtaulds was a UK business with overseas offshoots. I take over when two-thirds of sales and more than half the workforce are outside the UK.' His five languages should come in handy.</p>

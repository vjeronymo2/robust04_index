			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Roussel-Uclaf beats forecast with 33% rise Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceuticals company which was last year taken over by Hoechst of Germany, yesterday announced an unexpectedly strong 33 per cent increase in net income before exceptional items to FFr976.6m (Dollars 164.41m) in 1993 from FFr734.8m in 1992. The company had forecast a more modest increase, but fared particularly well during December when it benefited from strong sales of antibiotics such as Rulid and Orelox. Roussel-Uclaf, which became a subsidiary of Hoechst last summer when it bought a minority stake from Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals concern, mustered sales growth of 7.3 per cent during 1993 to FFr15.89bn from FFr14.81bn in 1992. However, the company suffered a slight fall in overall net profits of 3.8 per cent to FFr987m from FFr1.03bn due to a reduction in capital gains. Roussel-Uclaf made just FFr271m from capital gains during 1993, compared with FFr676m in the previous year.</p>

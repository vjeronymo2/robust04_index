			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. We selected this source because it provides an electricity rate for industrial use during the POI from India, our preferred surrogate country. To value water, we have used public information for India from the Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (November 1993) which is also published by the Asian Development Bank. To value coal, we used Indian Import Statistics. We adjusted the factor values to the POI using wholesale price indices published in the IFS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value hourly labor rates in India, we used the International Labor Office's 1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics and Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on relevant data from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin (RBI), December 1993. We based our overhead percentage calculations on the RBI summary income statement data applicable to the chemical manufacturing industry, and adjusted to reflect an energy-exclusive overhead percentage. For selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, we calculated percentages based on the RBI summary income statement data. We used the calculated SG&amp;A percentages because they were greater than the ten percent statutory minimum. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&amp;A expenses, because the RBI percentage was less than eight percent. We added packing based on Indian values obtained from Indian Import Statistics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available (BIA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because information has not been presented to the Department to prove otherwise, any PRC company that did not respond fully to the Department's questionnaires or otherwise did not participate in this investigation, are assumed to be under government control, and, therefore, are not entitled to separate dumping margins. In the absence of responses from those companies that did not fully respond to the Department's questionnaire, and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the All Other rate on BIA, pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act (see Silicon Carbide). In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and more adverse margins for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation. When a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation (see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993). In this investigation, since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning to them the highest margin based on information submitted in the petition (see Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Coumarin from the People's Republic of China, 59 FR 3841, January 27, 1994). This rate applies to all exporters other than those responding exporters that are receiving separate rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Circumstances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners allege that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of coumarin from the PRC. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

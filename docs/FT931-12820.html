			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reckitt buys Mantovani Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food, pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene group, is buying the Mantovani division of the Star foods company in Italy, writes Haig Simonian. Mantovani, a well known brand in Italy, comprises the bulk of Star's soaps and personal care products activities, with annual sales of about L50bn (Pounds 22m). No price for the transaction has been disclosed. The deal will raise Reckitt's sales in Italy, which stand at L100bn at present, by about 50 per cent. It will also give it its first manufacturing presence in the country. Star, which is 55 per cent owned by the Italian Fossati family, has been moving back to its core food activities. The other shareholders are BSN, the French foods group, and Ifil, the Agnelli family's quoted investment vehicle. Group sales amounted to L708bn last year with net earnings of L29.3bn.</p>

Yeltsin Has Opened a New Automatic International  Communication System'']    [Text] Unusual animation held sway in the room of the  Moscow international dial office in the capital region of  Belyayevo on the morning of 10 April. A crowd of journalists,  our own and from other nations, high-level European and U.S.  diplomats, and finally, the arriving presidential entourage  entering the room headed by B. N. Yeltsin, all bore witness to  the importance of the forthcoming event. Such considerable  attention to the international communication system brought  about by the efforts of specialists, organizations and companies  from Russia, Denmark and other nations was no coincidence: for  the first time Russia and Western Europe were being joined by a  fiber-optics communication line laid at the bottom of the Baltic  Sea.    And so, from this day forth, our citizens can be connected  with no great effort to 170 world nations, and in Moscow and St.  Petersburg there will be no need to go through operators and be  bothered with waiting for the call to be completed: callers will  be able to dial direct to almost any point on the globe. Such is  the result of concerted work by the ``Intertelekom'' Joint-Stock  Company and its foreign partners: Telecom Denmark, the Great  Northern Telegraph Company of Denmark, and a number of other  companies from Europe, the United States and Japan. The fiber-  optics communication line that they have laid at the bottom of  the Baltic in conjunction with a number of new radio relay lines  and municipal dial offices is capable of carrying 15,360  simultaneous telephone calls. We remind you that just last year  there were only 2900 international channels in all of Russia,  and the only Moscow international dial office, built in 1980,  was pretty well overloaded.    The end points of the new communication line, which is 2085  km long, are Moscow and the Danish town of Albertslund near  Copenhagen, where the fiber-optics communication line is  connected to the international telephone network. The underwater  fiber-optics cable, 4 cm in diameter, consists of two pairs of  fibers having throughput of 565 Mbit/s, and is 1250 km long. On  the Russian shore, the cable emerges onto dry land in the  vicinity of Kingisepp. Thence to St. Petersburg and Moscow,  where three new international telephone offices are installed,  the relay race is continued by two radio relay lines with  lengths of 124 and 810 km respectively. The section of the radio  relay line to Moscow is designed for 5760 channels (3x140  Mbit/s), and the one to St. Petersburg for 3840 channels (2x140  Mbit/s). In addition, each main section has a reserve 10 Mbit/s  trunk that is automatically connected in case of malfunctions.    It took just two months to lay the cable along the sea  bottom, a time that was full of the most unexpected problems for  those taking part in this complicated operation: Danish cable  specialists and our divers. For the first time in world  practice, the task was to bury the cable 60 cm under the bottom  over the entire multikilometer line. However, it was not until  work had already begun that it was learned that the heavy marine  plow, weighing 25 metric tons, by which the cable was to be  buried, could not be used along the shallow Russian coast.  Divers had to do the job. But the plow could not always be used  even in the open sea because it ``stumbled'' over other cables  or rocky ground. And here all kinds of contrivances had to be  devised. And when laying the shore cable near Kingisepp under  arduous land conditions, the builders used an unusual approach:  the excavator was set up on a raft from which the machine first  broke through ice, and then made a trench along the bottom in  which divers laid the cable. Nevertheless, difficulties did not  stop the project from completion on time.    Expenditures on construction of the system amounted to 500  million rubles and 123 million U.S. dollars. The principal  investors were the "Intertelekom" Joint-Stock Company, the  Danish companies Telecom Denmark and GNTC, and also the American  company U.S. West International. Construction of the new line  did not impact in any way on growth of the national debt of the  country, as the government of Russia offered no financial  guarantees to the parties in the project. At the same time, all  of the system situated on our territory, and also the underwater  section of the fiber-optics communication line to the midway  point have become the property of Russia.    Equipment suppliers were determined on a competitive basis.  They were the British company STC Submarine Systems which  supplied the optical cable, amplifiers and other equipment for  the underwater line; the Japanese company NEC, which furnished  the digital equipment for the relay section; and the Croatian  company Nikola Tesla which installed its AXE-10 digital  switching offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Credit for  purchase of the AXE-10 dial offices in the amount of 34.5  million dollars was provided by U.S. West Int. The Moscow  offices are designed for 7801 and 4780 channels and lines, and  the St. Petersburg office for 4170.    The Russian President became the first subscriber to the  system. At the festive opening ceremony in the presence of a  throng of guests, B. N. Yeltsin and the Danish Prime Minister P.  Rasmussen had a talk by videophone, ending with a symbolic  handshake between the leaders of the two nations bound by the  five-hundred year history of their diplomatic relations. Boris  Nikolayevich praised the work of Russian and foreign specialists  who had taken part in setting up the Denmark-Russia line, and  presented the distinguished order of Friendship of Nations.  Those present were congratulated for completion of construction  by Minister of Communications of the Russian Federation V. B.  Bulgak, and by the heads of diplomatic delegations of Denmark  and the United States; there was also an announcement of a  message sent by U.S. President B. Clinton to B. N. Yeltsin on  the occasion of opening up the new international  telecommunication system.    However, in the words of V. B. Bulgak, there is still a long  way to go before the needs of the nation for international  telephone service are satisfied. Therefore plans have been made  to begin operation of the Southern, Eastern and Trans-Siberian  sections of a trunk that will close the world telecommunication  ring before 1998. The overall capacity of the international  telephone offices of Russia, according to tentative estimates,  will be 29,000 channels in 1995, 40,500 in the year 2000, and  64,000 by the year 2005.    Within the scope of the Southern project, it is proposed  that  a Novosibirsk-Istanbul-Palermo fiber-optics communication line  be built, 3400 km long, with an extension to Moscow (1622 km),  and also that an international telephone office be opened in  Rostov-na-Donu. The Eastern project includes a  Russia-Japan-Korea underwater fiber-optics communication line  1809 km long with 930-kilometer Nakhodka-Khabarovsk cable  section. On the Trans-Siberian section of the trunk, a Moscow-  Khabarovsk digital radio relay line is to be constructed, 8300  km in length with capacity of 11,520 channels. It is planned  that international telephone offices will be introduced by  stages in Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Samara.  Foreign communications operators and producers of equipment will  take an active part in realization of these projects.    Opening of the Russia-Denmark line has provided a rather  graphic demonstration that cooperation with us in such  large-scale projects is not only possible, but even  advantageous. For example, Telecom Denmark has already sold part  of the capacity of the new underwater cable to 22 communications  operators from the United States, Belgium, Italy, Germany,  France and other nations. From the very beginning of operation  of the Trans-Siberian trunk, there will certainly be even more  extensive opportunities for cooperation in the field of  communications.</p>

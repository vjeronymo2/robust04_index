			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Pharma Vision rights issue PHARMA Vision 2000, the Swiss investment company specialising in pharmaceutical share holdings, is raising SFr310m (Dollars 203.9m) in a rights issue with the aim of broadening its holdings to include companies outside Switzerland, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The group, which is controlled by a syndicate led by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ financial group, also signalled its intention to take a more aggressive role in managing companies in which it held large stakes. With a net asset value of SFr1.9bn, Pharma consists almost entirely of shares in Roche and Ciba-Geigy. The Pharma rights issue is on the basis of one-for-five held on October 6 at SFr3,000 per bearer share and SFr600 per registered share.</p>

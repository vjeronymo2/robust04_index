			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez at </F> opening ceremony of the Nation and Emigre Community Conference  held at the Convention Center in Havana City on 22 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Moderator Sergio Corrieri] Good morning to all. The  long-awaited time to begin this conference has arrived. On  behalf of the committee in charge of preparing this conference,  I wish to extend the warmest welcome to all.    First of all, I would like to introduce the people who are  here with us: Comrade Carlos Lage [applause], secretary of the  Council of Ministers Executive Committee; Comrade Roberto  Robaina, minister of Foreign Relations [applause]; Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [applause]; Abel Prieto, president of the National  Union of Cuban Writers and Artists [applause]; Miguel Alfonso,  who will be the spokesman for this conference; Jose Cabanas, the  secretary [applause]; and myself, Sergio Corrieri, president of  the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [applause], who  will be the moderator of this conference. I would like to add  that a group of personalities from various sectors of Cuban  society are here as guests of the conference. We feel that these  personalities, because of their work, their experience, or the  nature of the posts they are holding, can be useful and suitable  for the work we are doing. They will participate in this  conference, and if they wish, will also be able to express their  opinions on the subjects discussed here.    For the official opening of this meeting, we give the floor  to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina [applause].    [Robaina] Guests of this conference, on behalf of the  government, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all.    For those of us who for more than three decades have  experienced pressures, threats, and aggressions, it is easy to  understand the personal effort made by many and the merit of  their decision not to allow themselves to be defeated by those  who have threatened and applied pressure to prevent this meeting  from taking place, nor by economic difficulties, the family, or  other problems that have thwarted the attendance of many.    We interpret your presence here today as a demonstration of  attachment to and identification with the Cuban nation. We must  also stress the courage of our government in calling for this  conference immersed as it is in the country's unavoidable  mandatory tasks. We are facing difficult circumstances for  guaranteeing our future, when the actions seeking to destroy the  projects undertaken by our people for more than 30 years not  only prevail, but are intensifying and multiplying. This  conference is taking place under the same abnormal conditions  that stemmed from the hostile U.S. policy against Cuba since the  revolutionary victory, conditions that have marked Cuban  relations with the emigre community.    The fact that we are here today in this room is not even  remotely the result of a miracle or accident. It is above all  the result of our maturity, strength, and independence, and also  the result of a growing attitude of respect and understanding of  a significant portion of the emigre community who identifies  more each day with the vital interests of Cuba.    You have arrived in Cuba in the midst of an exceptional  period, when our people are making extraordinary efforts to  heroically preserve the fatherland's independence and, and the  gigantic accomplishments of the Revolution. If we commit to this  conference, it is because the subject deserves to see the  beginning of a joint discussion aimed at making progress along  the road to normalize ties between the nation and its emigre  community.    As expected, the call for this conference has prompted mixed  reactions. The name, and the seriousness of our intentions have  been criticized. There were even those who expressed doubts that  this conference would take place, without mentioning those who  by all means tried to prevent it, thwart it, or frustrate it. Of  course, there were also those who, knowing us better, realized  from the very beginning that this endeavor was feasible, and  supported it. Many people of goodwill have joined them in this  task and they jointly managed to clean up the stains to  appreciate the light.    This conference has also become a reality because of the  resoluteness and persistence of many who are present here, and  of others who for different reasons are not present here today.  Many have participated in this effort to achieve rapprochement,  some silently, others openly. There are those who have been  dedicated to this task for many difficult years, while others  joined only recently. In spite of everything, various  initiatives and contacts have been promoted, and several actions  have been carried out.    We are finally here to begin the meeting in accordance with  the call made on 14 February 1994. The objectives have been  established, but it would not hurt to repeat them here today.  They are: to study possible measures to normalize relations  between emigres and the nation, between institutions and the  family; to promote stable exchange in the cultural, family, and  social areas; to foment constructive actions of residents  abroad, taking into account the current historical situation in  which the country's destiny, the preservation of its sovereignty  and independence, as well as the achievements of the people,  represent a common platform for all Cubans of good will.    We must therefore jointly identify those areas in which,  through the participation of all, we can progress toward the  establishment of normal relations to which we all have the right.    Some have questioned the use of the word emigration in our  call. You may interpret this, as some of you have already done  publicly, and as is our intention, as referring strictly to  those who live outside the fatherland.    The participation in and representation at this meeting has  also been questioned. The data can speak for itself. Here we  have with us 204 emigres, residents of 27 countries. This number  is increasing as the hours pass. Among them we can find  professionals in various areas -- journalists, artists, writers,  housewives, retired people, workers, employees, businessmen,  teachers, social workers, religious people, and students.  Moreover, we all know that the various political and ideological  trends are represented at this conference, which does not  prevent our willingness to work for the objective that has  brought us together here today.    This conference is the continuation of difficult, complex  work that has been carried out over a long period. The first  important result is the conference itself and the possibilities  it offers to go on. The respect and intelligence with which we  are to discuss each of the subjects that are worrying us within  the nation-emigres conference, must characterize our current  dialogue, and must represent essential premises for the future.    It would be too ambitious to pretend that in only three days  we will be able to resolve all existing problems, when some of  the essential ones do not depend exclusively on us. The  important thing is to keep up this common effort.    With that spirit, let us begin then the work of our  conference. Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

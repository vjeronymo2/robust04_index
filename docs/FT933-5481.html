			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Factory orders decline sharply in July ORDERS received by US factories fell in July at the sharpest rate for more than 1 1/2 years, the Commerce Department announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The principal reason was a fall-off in demand for cars, aircraft and railway equipment. The 2.1 per cent decline, to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 250.15bn, followed a revised 2.9 per cent gain for June. Wall Street economists had been expecting a 1.7 per cent drop. It was the sharpest decrease since the 3.6 per cent in December 1991, department officials said. Excluding transport goods, factory orders in July rose by 0.2 per cent after a 1.2 per cent increase in June. The Commerce Department reported on August 25 that orders for long-lasting durable goods, which account for about half of total factory business, dropped sharply in July by 3.8 per cent. It revised that in the orders report to 3.1 per cent. But orders for non-durable goods also fell in July, down 1 per cent after rising 1.4 per cent in June. On Wednesday, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives showed the manufacturing sector declined in August, the third monthly contraction in a row. Consumers still lack confidence in the economy's direction, surveys indicate. This is reflected in a softening of car and retail sales as well as a relatively tepid pace of new-home sales despite the cheapest interest rates in decades. The Clinton administration on Wednesday cut its own estimate of expected growth in total goods and services output this year to 2 per cent from 3.1 per cent projected last April. During the second quarter this year, gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of only 1.8 per cent after rising by 0.8 per cent in the first three months.</p>

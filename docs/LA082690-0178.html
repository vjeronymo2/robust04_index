			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERATELY HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD SPUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, EASE NEED FOR  IMPORTS  </P> <P> Philip Verleger's viewpoint that the "U.S. Could Do a Lot More to Cope With Oil  Crises" (Aug. 12) presents a rational analysis of the problems. In closing, he  advocates that higher energy prices, though not popular, should be part of the  solution.  </P> <P> However, he should have included a fourth point. Our increased use of foreign  oil is the result of five years of depressed crude oil prices making many of  our domestic oil fields uneconomic. The greatest potential for reducing our  dependence on imported oil (and hence future economic stability) is by allowing  moderately higher oil prices to revitalize the U.S. Oil Patch. This won't  result in proportionately higher gasoline prices since it will restore the  balance of profit between petroleum production, refining and marketing while  reducing the trade deficit.  </P> <P> CHRIS HALL  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

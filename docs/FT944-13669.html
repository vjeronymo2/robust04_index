			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (18): Multimedia skills in demand - The shortage of staff needed for training programmes Within four months of implementing an interactive multimedia training project, the Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst in Germany had saved over DM14.2m in time and travel costs. By far the largest multimedia installation in Europe, with more than 2,000 'Learning Stations', the system was custom-built by VideoLogic using digital video technology to provide a cost-effective solution for the training of a widely dispersed workforce of more than 360,000 people. The initial investment had paid for itself after putting just 100,000 staff through the first two learning programmes. In the training environment, the integration of personal computers with digital video, audio and still images makes learning new skills an exciting and positive experience. Studies show that pupils learn new skills faster and information retention rates are higher than they were with traditional aids such as flipcharts and marker pens. As a result the future of multimedia, particularly as a training aid, is assured. According to Alan Binnie, recruitment director of consultants Recruit Media, the multimedia markets is expected to top Pounds 7bn worldwide this year. He says: 'Sales of multimedia PCs with CD-Rom drives grew by over 160 per cent last year and, if such drives were fitted to just a third of all PCs expected to be sold in the UK in 1995, the potential market would increase by 500 per cent to something like 1.5m.' However, he warns that as the rush to supply the market takes off, so too will the demand for quality staff. 'Multimedia mixes sound, visual images and movement; and the creation of a single product involves a whole range of new skills from computer programming to graphic design. Lack of those skills could hold the UK back.' That view is held by the West London Training &amp; Enterprise Council which conducted a survey last year and found in the IT field alone a national backlog of 50-100m man-days of computer skills training. Moreover, it estimated that catching up though conventional methods would cost Pounds 10bn-20bn. New thinking is called for, the Tec's report concluded. A growing number of organisations are keen to address the problem using new technology. Recruit Media says that 60 per cent of companies have said that they intend to employ multimedia staff within the next 12 months. Unfortunately, 40 per cent of those already travelling the multimedia route are experiencing difficulties in finding the right staff. Mr Binnie says: 'We are getting companies like BP, the Automobile Association, BBC Enterprises and ICL coming to us for trained, flexible and creative staff and it is getting increasingly difficult to find them. 'Now that multimedia has progressed from a cottage industry to one of global significance, we must address that skill shortage.' Technology itself can help. For example, rather than rely on technical staff and outside developers to create interactive multimedia training programmes, British Airways is planning to use AimTech's CBT Express, said to be the first computer-based training authoring software that makes training course development fast, simple and accessible to non-technical personnel. No scripting, flow charting or programming is required. The system uses pre-built templates and colour backgrounds to simplify and accelerate the applications development process. If the current trials are successful, BA's training staff will be able to produce multimedia course material to supplement the programmes being developed by IT staff who use AimTech's IconAuthor, a more complex authoring tool that has already proved its worth in developing interactive training courses for cabin crew. Video has long been used in the training environment. But it can be time-consuming winding tape backwards and forwards trying to find a particularly section. Interactive video is one answer but the need to implement sophisticated computer controls has, until now, made it an unrealistic proposition for the mass market. An interesting development from Japanese electronics giant Pioneer is an interactive LaserDisc combined with bar code techniques. Each laser disc can store up to 36 minutes of video or up to 54,000 still frames and photos, or a combination, with each item or section given a unique barcode for fast access purposes. By running the barcode pen over identical supermarket-style barcodes in the reference book, the relevant section of the programme will appear instantly on the TV screen, complete with relevant photographs, slides, diagrams and text. A growing trend among trainers and lecturers is the use of a PC to create their own training presentations. The addition of an LCD projection panel provides the ultimate flexibility, enabling computer presentations to be prepared in advance then altered quickly and easily up the last minute; an impossible task if slides or OHPs have to be produced. Distance learning, whereby individuals can learn new skills at any time at any location is developing. The one problem with it is the difficulty of interaction between trainee and tutor. QData believes its development of the Marc PC-based software program could be the answer. It enables a tutor to deliver training materials and exercises to a group of dispersed trainees who can then participate in one-to-one or group training sessions. The tutor can take control of all screens on the network, or can ask remote trainees to take control of the host computer and perform certain tasks while the rest of the trainees watch. Messages can be sent to all trainees simultaneously and work completed can be printed out locally or remotely.</p>

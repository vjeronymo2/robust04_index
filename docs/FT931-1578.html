			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government grasps for treaty life-support - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage FOR Mr John Major it is life or death. If the deal he negotiated with his European partners in the Dutch town of Maastricht in December 1991 fails to win the endorsement of the British parliament his premiership will be destroyed. Close colleagues of the prime minister are convinced he would quit, along with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. As the treaty heads for the final stage of its tortuous passage through the House of Commons, the political stakes could not be higher. All the serious betting is that the treaty - and Mr Major - will survive, and that by late July, or at worst the autumn, Maastricht will be ratified. Britain will again have held on to the coat - tails of Europe. Even ardent opponents will admit privately that they believe the chances of sinking the legislation are slim. On the central issue of principle - whether Britain should ratify - there is a clear majority of the Commons in favour. On a 'free vote' - unencumbered by the obligations of party allegiance - around two thirds of the 650 MPs would support it. But life for Mr Major is not that simple. The curious coincidence of interest between 50 or so Conservative diehard opponents of the treaty and the determination (they would say duty) of the opposition parties to weaken the government at every opportunity conspires against him. Between 25 and 30 Tory MPs have defied consistently powerful threats and pleas for loyalty to vote against their own government. A further 20 to 25 abstain. Labour and the Liberal Democrats support the principle of the treaty. But they want ratification on their terms and want in the process to damage the government. Mr Major's paper majority of 20 MPs is thus rendered worthless. The government is hampered also by the arcane procedures of the House of Commons - a set of rules for debate which allows opponents to support the principle of a piece of legislation but to seriously delay and disrupt its passage. Between them the Euro - sceptics, the Labour, Liberal Democrat and smaller opposition parties can dictate the timetable for the legislation. They can filibuster. They can prevent, when they wish, the government winning the votes it needs to speed up progress of the legislation with all - night and weekend sittings. More threateningly, the combined forces ranged against Mr Major can, if their alliance holds, amend the legislation. They have already done so once  -on a relatively minor issue. But if they were to find an amendment (and they have not yet) to change the legislation in a way which forced the government to embrace the social chapter then they just might derail the whole process. Mr Major would not - could not - ratify a treaty without the opt-out he negotiated from its social dimension. The risk of an ambush - and of an unpredictable defeat - will remain until the treaty passes its final House of Commons hurdle - the so - called third reading. On an optimistic timetable the third reading will come early in June. On a pessimistic forecast it might not be before mid July. Then the legislation will face loud opposition during a month or so in the House of Lords. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, the self - appointed spokesman for the nation's street - corner Europhobes, will lead the attack. But in the Lords, Mr Major has a comfortable in - built majority. There will be plenty of noise but no real threat to the substance of the legislation. Mr Major cannot afford to be other than optimistic. The endless wrangling has sapped the authority of his premiership. His is the first government since the row over devolution which destroyed the Labour administration of the late 1970s which has not been able to dictate the terms of debate for a key piece of legislation. He depends on backroom deals with one or other of the opposition parties. After 13 years with unchallengeable majorities, the government has found it hard to rediscover the humility to strike such bargains. Ministers freely admit that until the treaty is ratified they will not be able to regain a grip on domestic policy. Other European leaders may be frustrated by the delay in ratification. None finds it more debilitating than Mr Major. That frustration is visible in the swings in the prime minister's mood. On some occasions he acts as if determined to crush the enemy within. On others he replaces scorn with attempts at persuasion. His own view of the treaty - that it is vital to retain a British voice in the future of a wider Europe - is distorted by his habit of focusing alternately on its positive elements and then on the British opt - outs from monetary union and the social chapter. 'Ratify it because it will never be implemented' sometimes seems to be the message. The struggle risks doing serious long - term damage to the Conservatives. The declared dissidents have the private support of a similar number of more discreet opponents. The risk is that it will prove impossible to heal the schism. There are problems too for the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Both parade their pro - European credentials (though Labour has its own sizeable hard core of passionate Eurosceptics). They are tarnishing those credentials in their anxiety to weaken Mr Major. Political opportunism has a price. But for now - and until the ratification documents leave the Palace of Westminster to receive the signature of the Queen - Mr Major remains the helpless victim of his negotiating triumph in Maastricht.</p>

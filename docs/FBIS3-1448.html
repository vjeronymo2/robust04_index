			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Council of State has declared its intention to  appeal to the West African peace monitoring group ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] to swiftly move into conflict areas to stop the carnage  if current hostilities are not halted. Addressing a  cross-section of citizens of Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, and Lower  Lofa Counties in the palace of the executive mansion yesterday,  the chairman of the Council of State, Professor David Kpomakpor,  said since ECOMOG has the peace enforcement power under the  Cotonou Accord, the subregional force can exercise this power to  prevent an escalation of hostilities.    Prof. Kpomakpor, in his statement, expressed dismay over the  continued fighting between the warring factions which, he noted,  is claiming more innocent lives. He said it was disheartening  for the factions to [words indistinct] hostilities after the  signing of the cease-fire accord and the seating of the  Transitional Government. The LNTG [Liberian National  Transitional Government] chairman declared that the current  fighting in Liberia was an exercise in futility and must be  brought to an immediate halt. Prof. Kpomakpor emphasized that  the Council of State will meet ECOMOG and ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] to discuss  relevant matters pertaining to the current fighting in some  political subdivisions of the country, following which  appropriate actions will be taken. We have now reached a point  in our history when Liberians must put aside all differences and  resolve to work together in realizing the [word indistinct]  aspirations of our people, Chairman Kpomakpor said.    On their part the citizens expressed concern over the  prevailing rift among elements of the defunct [as heard] ULIMO  in their area. The citizens are, therefore, calling on the State  Council to ensure the speedy deployment of ECOMOG troops there.  The citizens observed that the internal conflict in ULIMO  borders on ethnic matters and requested the council to convene a  meeting of the chiefs, elders, and leaders of the ethnic groups  involved -- the Krahns and Mandingos -- to prevail on those  fighting to stop the (?killing) and surrender their arms to  ECOMOG.

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Bidders queue for sell-off of London buses Several dozen bidders, including a number from overseas, have made offers to buy one or more of the 10 companies that run London's red buses, it emerged yesterday. With many of the bidders making offers for all 10 companies, the number of individual bids runs into the hundreds. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, financial adviser to London Transport Buses, was yesterday sifting through the indicative bids which were filed by the Thursday noon deadline. It will draw up a shortlist of organisations that will be asked to make a final bid by late August or early September. The London bus companies, which have a combined turnover of more than Pounds 440m and pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20m, are due to be privatised by the end of the year. Bids have come in from all the large UK bus companies, the management teams of London's 10 bus companies and bidders in South Africa, France and Sweden. There have also been bids from 'a number of companies you would not necessarily expect', BZW said. Stagecoach, the quoted Perth-based company, said it had bid for all the companies though it expected the popular ones to fetch high prices. Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said he was not surprised at the high degree of interest because of the worldwide image of London's red buses. 'Nobody has been put off by the government's decision to defer the de-regulation of London's buses,' said Mr Clive Hodson, managing director of London Transport Buses and the man in charge of privatisation. De-regulation would increase competition on many bus routes. The organisations may bid for as many bus companies as they like, but they would not be allowed to acquire operations accounting for more than 25 per cent of the market. This means they would be able to acquire at most three of the smallest companies or two of the larger ones. They would also not be permitted to acquire neighbouring bus companies. Successful bidders will be expected to provide acceptable pension arrangements for staff of the former bus companies, Mr Hodson said. London represents the final stage in the privatisation of Britain's bus services.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   BUS COMPANIES FOR SALE IN THE CAPITAL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 LEASIDE       2  EAST        3 LONDON                    5  SOUTH   BUSES            LONDON        CENTRAL     4 SELKENT        LONDON 17 million      21 million     16 million    16 million   13 million   1,800            1,950         1,700         1,400          1,350     600              590           500           390            410 Pounds 49m      Pounds 59m     Pounds 47m    Pounds 38m   Pounds 40m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 6 LONDON        7  LONDON      8 CENTRE-     9 METRO-      10 LONDON   GENERAL          UNITED        WEST          LINE           NORTHERN 17 million      21 million     16 million    16 million   13 million   2,150            1,400         1,500         1,150          1,100     600              430           510           370            320 Pounds 60m      Pounds 43m     Pounds 42m    Pounds 33m   Pounds 36m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Barclays de Zoete Wedd  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

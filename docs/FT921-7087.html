			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: Love and war Anyone in any doubt that the Tories will be losing one of their few remaining mavericks now that Alan Clark is bowing out of the Commons should look no further than the last Christmas edition of New Statesman &amp; Society. When the member for Plymouth Sutton was asked to nominate the book that pleased him most, he chose Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera'. While the choice was not especially noteworthy, the reason given was more interesting. 'For anyone who has been in love - really in love, I mean, which (alas for them) doesn't apply to all - this is the book,' he opined. Hardly the language one would expect from the minister for defence procurement. But all the more refreshing.</p>

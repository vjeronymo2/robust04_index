			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Mayhew seeks US backing on N Ireland PATRICK Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday met senior US politicians to try to win backing for British policy in Northern Ireland and deflect American sympathy for republican fundraisers. Sir Patrick, who spoke with state department officials in Washington and was expected to see Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and Senator Edward Kennedy, is also understood to have reiterated UK opposition to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' mooted by President Clinton. The British government has, however, made it clear that it would accept a delegation with a less specific role. The government is also concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment policies by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Roman Catholics but the government argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. Speaking earlier in New York, Sir Patrick said that Noraid, the US fundraising group that wants a united Ireland, was a declining force unable to collect money for the IRA. Although the IRA claimed to be freedom fighters, Sir Patrick said that all they were fighting for was 'freedom from the common obligations of humanity'. One of President Clinton's top advisers Mr Ray Flynn, the US ambassador-designate to the Vatican, said yesterday that Mr Clinton was as committed now to helping break the political logjam as he was during the presidential campaign. In Londonderry Mr Flynn, the Mayor of Boston, said: 'I do feel the president is very committed to playing a constructive, positive and meaningful role in helping to end the violence in Northern Ireland.' Mr Flynn, who is on a three-day fact-finding visit to Ireland, said he supported the talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, and believed Sinn Fein should be involved in any talks process.</p>

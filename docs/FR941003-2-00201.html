The data revealed that fuel leaked from the vent during the rollover that was conducted as part of this test. The petitioner installed a rollover valve in the fuel tank line to resolve that problem. The petitioner also stated that the vehicle should comply with the lateral impact test at the lower speed of 20 mph due to the reinforcing structure surrounding the fuel tank and the placement of the fuel lines inside the main frame of the vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above.

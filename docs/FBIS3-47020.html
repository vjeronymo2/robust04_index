			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance on  Friday [7 January] denied news reports that the ministry will  study the possibility of abolishing the securities transaction  tax as part of measures to get the economy out of the current  recession. An official at the ministry's budget bureau said the  ministry "has no such plans whatsoever."    The government is expected to come up with a fresh package  of  pump-priming steps later this month.    The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major economic daily, reported  in  its Friday evening edition that the ruling coalition parties  will consider removing the securities transaction tax. The  newspaper's report pushed Tokyo stock prices sharply higher,  with the Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues ending  242.02 points higher at 18,124.01.    The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  Finance Ministry will "act in line with recommendations made by  the government's tax commission last November."    The advisory body suggested that the government should  maintain the securities transaction tax "at least for the time  being." There is no change in the ministry's policy of  reviewing the tax and the capital gains tax "in the future" as  suggested by the commission, said the official.</p>

After the U.S. Senate approved a bill to lift trade  sanctions  against Vietnam, Bill Clinton officially announced the lifting  of sanctions yesterday and thus the way was cleared for  investment by U.S. companies and establishments in Vietnam.    According to agency reports, with the lifting of the  sanctions at least 25 American firms that had offices in  Vietnam, which up until now were prevented from extensive  activity for political reasons, have started their work. The  lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam has taken place at  the same time as the publication of reports in which its  supporters in Washington spoke of the adverse effects of the  continuation of those sanctions on the unhealthy U.S. economy.  Moreover, that group supporters of the lifting of sanctions in  Washington believe that by lifting the sanctions against  Vietnam, Washington will be in a better position to access that  country's market in international competition.    Before the lifting of the sanctions against Vietnam,  Washington had set two preconditions for improving its relations  with them. First was a clarification of the status of 1,500  American soldiers who disappeared during the Vietnam war. The  other was the speeding up of the trend of reforms that had  started in 1985. But the new political and economic realities  in Vietnam are such that America cannot give up a country that  possesses rich oil and mineral resources, as well as the  potential to absorb foreign investment and pull back from  international competition, especially when Japan, France, and  China, as well as other powerful European industrial states and  East Asian regions, started their efforts some time ago to  establish a serious presence in the reconstruction of that  country and offering financial aid to Hanoi.    It is clear that the main obstacle in America's extensive  presence in Vietnam is China's policy regarding Hanoi, something  that has created concern in Washington. Those concerns stem  from the fact that if China succeeds in gathering the small  South Asian states -- that earlier were allied to the former  Soviet Union -- around its own axis and prevent their strong  leaning toward Western capitalism, that country's political  success will be further strengthened in South Asia. Therefore,  if the issue of lifting the trade sanctions against Vietnam is  viewed from the angle of the formation of economic and  commercial competition in South Asia, as well as China's policy  regarding Hanoi, the trend of normalizing relations between  Vietnam and America will be justifiable in the eyes of  Washington's statesmen. Thus, it seems that Vietnam's future,  from a political and economic point of view, will take the form  of a competition framework between China and America.</p>

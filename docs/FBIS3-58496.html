The plans, drawn up by UN commanders in Bosnia at the  request  of a NATO summit here last week, are due to be presented to UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday [17  January], then sent to NATO headquarters here. [passage omitted]    They ordered UN field commanders in Bosnia urgently to draw  up plans for such strikes, which can be launched only if  commanders on the scene ask for them and if Butrus-Ghali agrees.    NATO military planners will review the plans here this week,  and ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member nations are  scheduled to discuss them on Wednesday, the NATO source said.  [passage omitted]    The NATO source added: "We clearly need a process where the  political will (to bomb) is built up in NATO. The credibility  of the West and the international community is at stake. I hope  governments recognise the stakes." [passage omitted]    The NATO source said: "The question is just how does the UN  see air power -- just to protect UN troops or as a political  weapon?" [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Martin quits GrandMet for KKR-backed venture Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist, is to provide the financial backing for a new London-based investment firm set up by Mr Ian Martin, who resigned yesterday as deputy chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group. Glenisla, a privately owned investment vehicle led by Mr Martin with Mr Henry Kravis and Mr George Roberts of KKR on its board, plans to seek undervalued businesses ripe for reorganisation in the UK and elsewhere in western Europe. Mr Martin, whose resignation as a GrandMet director had been expected since September when he lost the contest for the chief executive's job, said these could be in a wide range of industries - though not in food and drinks because he remains a consultant to GrandMet with a non-competition clause. Explaining the arrangement with KKR, Mr Martin said: 'KKR brings the financial muscle and I bring the transformation management skills.' KKR has about Dollars 2bn available for investment, only a small percentage of which will find its way into Glenisla. But the investment will give the firm its first toehold in the European market. KKR has a portfolio of 18 investments in US companies with an estimated market value of Dollars 13bn. Most of these were built up during the 1980s, when the firm became famous for a series of big leveraged buy-outs, culminating in the blockbusting hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and food group, for Dollars 26bn in 1989. But with the end of the 1980s buy-out boom, KKR has had to change direction. Buy-outs are still at the core of its strategy, but they tend to be much smaller and much less highly leveraged. One element in KKR's new strategy is the so-called 'build-up' approach, where local managers are backed to make a series of acquisitions which create a presence in an otherwise fragmented industry. In the last few years KKR has backed a number of 'build-up' ventures including K-III Communications, which has made more than 20 small acquisitions in the US publishing business. Glenisla's activities could be modelled on these. Mr Martin plans to recruit a small team of between four and six people to help him identify targets. He said Glenisla would probably focus on acquisitions 'of Pounds 300m and upwards'. Observer, Page 21</p>

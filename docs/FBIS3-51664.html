Brazil might reopen its embassy in Vietnam sometime this  year, facilitating enhanced ties with Hanoi. The diplomats who  will be participating in the trade delegation might discuss this  issue with the Vietnamese. The Brazilian ambassador to  Singapore is also the concurrent Brazilian ambassador to Vietnam.    Among the Asian countries, Vietnam is much in demand by  European businessmen. The tourism industry, in addition to  other forms of cooperation, has been developing significantly  over the past two years. Hanoi authorities seem to be  determined to follow the Chinese path of "market socialism,"  with an economic opening but keeping a closed political system.    In Vietnam there is a growth rate of 5 to 7 percent per year  and an inflation rate of 5 percent per year. There are 72  million inhabitants, of whom 40 percent are under 15 years of  age. Labor costs, which are still very economical, range  between $30 and $40 per month. Foreign capital is slowly  returning to Vietnam. Efforts are also being made to integrate  the country into international financial organizations. Vietnam  is scheduled to receive an average of $2 billion per year in  foreign investments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Axel Buyse: "Chaos in Rwanda Threatens Stability </F> of Whole Region"]    [Text] The chaos that has gripped Rwanda since Thursday [7  April] could well have far-reaching consequences for the whole  region -- the "Area of the Great Lakes." That covers not just  Rwanda and Burundi, but also a large part of eastern Zaire, and  by extension, even Uganda and western Tanzania. Rwanda and  Burundi are among the least developed countries. The  possibility of more or less stable regimes establishing  themselves there seems to have disappeared for years to come.  The departure of many foreigners and the freezing of some  development funding could put the countries back years  economically. There is a chance that another part of black  Africa will go down in a huge turmoil.    The departure of most foreigners from Rwanda clears the way  for a large-scale settling of scores between what remains of the  regime and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. The contrast  between the two groups is based on more than an ethnic division  between Hutus and Tutsis respectively. During the last two  years the RPF had successfully formed coalitions -- albeit  constantly changing ones -- with a number of the opposition  parties which were recruiting among Hutus. But at times of  crises like this one, everything is easily reduced to the ethnic  component. Hutus who made "common cause" with the Front were  automatically called "collaborators." Which at the moment is  equivalent to "shooting target."    If the Front does succeed in overrunning Kigali, thanks to  its better organization and the motivation of its soldiers,  there is little chance of it being able to rule the whole  country alone. But it remains an open question whether by that  time there will still be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to  take things in hand. And whether RPF discipline will hold. The  outside world is less well documented about what went wrong as  regards human rights in the area controlled by the rebels. But  it is absolutely certain that a large number of acts of terror  were committed there too. There is a great danger of continuing  instability, partly because in past years a large number of  weapons entered the country via legal and illegal channels.    There is also little chance that if the Front "takes power"  in Rwanda, that would not have consequences in Burundi. The  calm which has ruled there in recent days is deceptive and  almost makes one forget that in October and November between  50,000 and 100,000 people died there, and that in a flare-up in  Bujumbura at the end of March several hundred more people died.  These recent experiences and the horrific scenes in Rwanda may  bring the politicians in Bujumbura to a modus vivendi. But  little is necessary to produce another short-circuit.    But even if Burundi remains calm, and things in Rwanda  simmer  down too, the economic consequences will remain. The two  countries are largely dependent on development aid and for years  Belgium has been the largest bilateral donor to these areas  which were formerly under its guardianship. "Rwanda" has  suffered wounds which will be difficult to heal in the coming  years.    The NCOS [National Center For Development Cooperation],  which  groups together the Flemish nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs), said in a declaration yesterday that Belgium could not  abandon the people of Rwanda and that the violence was the work  of an extremist group. Now, it may well be true that the  continuation of development aid in "our" piece of Africa can  well be defended, even on the grounds of pure self-interest --  because a large part of the money flows back to Belgium anyway,  or in order to limit refugee flows. But in a first phase large  sections of the public opinion risk completely turning against  this.    There is considerable pressure to definitively turn away  from  central Africa. In mid-1990 Belgium "provisionally" cut links  with Zaire after President Mobutu Sese Seko had broken the  cooperation agreements out of anger with Brussels' interference  in the incidents in Lubumbashi. In the meantime a group of  experts and professors, at the request of the state secretary  for development cooperation, continued to work on a "master  plan" to restart cooperation on a better basis when the time is  right. But for the time being the political developments in  Kinshasa are not such as to offer sufficient support to any  renewed cooperation.  <H5>  Indifference </H5>   The chance that an authentic democracy will gradually  develop  seems to have diminished. The shrinking but politically and  symbolically important group round Etienne Tshisekedi has been  completely cornered. It is unlikely that Belgian politicians  can in the present circumstances accept a Zaire where there is  no consensus about transition and where President Mobutu  continues to play an important role. If Brussels is to change  its course in this field, then it will take time. And it will  certainly not be enthusiastic. The commercial interests hardly  weigh up any more against an indifference which could turn into  open hostility for a time, following the events in Rwanda. For  many fellow countrymen, Rwanda 1994 is a rerun of Congo 1960-65.    Other donor countries and the international aid  organizations  will in time fill the hole left by the Belgians. But much will  have to be built up from zero, depending, among other things, on  what remains of Rwandan NGOs, cooperative ventures and "civil  society" after the storm which is now gripping the land.    In the coming months Rwanda is in danger of becoming  dependent on international aid for the most basic item -- food  supply. Considerable time could pass before that process gets  started. In the meantime there is also the threat of a  potentially destabilizing disastrous situation among the many  tens of thousands of Burundians who fled over the border at the  end of October and start of November. The costs of restarting  emergency aid will be considerably higher than having aid  continue on the same level. In addition Rwanda and Burundi were  the natural outlets for the most dynamic region of eastern  Zaire: the Kivu. A regression in the two small countries could  further endanger the perspectives of the independent development  of the Zairian Kivu region. At present it is rather hopeless to  look for positive points in a very somber situation.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBT PLAN FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON REDUCTION, BANKS WARN  </P> <P> The world's major commercial banks warned Monday that the Bush Administration's  new Third World debt strategy may end up in failure if it places too much  emphasis on debt-reduction instead of promoting more new lending to Latin  American countries.  </P> <P> In a letter to the International Monetary Fund, the bankers cautioned that  "excessive focus on debt reduction, particularly at discounts that banks regard  as punitive, will result in banks' permanent exit from future lending to  middle-income countries."  </P> <P> They warned that expectations about how much developing countries' debt burdens  actually can be reduced "must become realistic." They urged authorities to give  increased attention to stemming capital flight in debtor countries as a way to  help them meet their debt service.  </P> <P> The letter, made public by the Institute of International Finance, which  represents 184 commercial banks around the world, served to underscore the  resistance that U.S. authorities are encountering in persuading banks to go  along with the new Third World debt plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Banks Resist Plan  </P> <P> Under the plan, developed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, commercial  banks would exchange portions of their bank debt for a smaller amount of  securities from the debtor countries. The interest payments on these securities  would be backed by the IMF or World Bank.  </P> <P> The debt burdens of these countries are increasing so rapidly that debtor  countries now are sending more money back to rich countries than they are  receiving. The World Bank reported over the weekend that the net cash drain  from Third World countries has reached $50 billion.  </P> <P> But the banks, reluctant to discount their loan portfolios too deeply, have  been resisting the Brady formula. Several, offered such a choice in a recent  deal with Mexico, have opted to provide new loans to the country rather than  trade their old ones for securities.  </P> <P> Moreover, Horst Schulmann, the former West German Finance Ministry official who  now serves as managing director of the Institute of International Finance, said  Monday that the opportunities for such Brady plan-style exchanges are limited.  The plan was unveiled last March and put into effect in late summer.  </P> <P> Schulmann noted that the Philippines, which recently completed negotiations  with commercial banks, sought to increase its borrowing rather than trade its  old loans for securities.  </P> <P> "We don't see a long list of candidates (for debt-reduction deals) around the  corner," he said.  </P> <P> He said countries such as Brazil and Argentina are ineligible for Brady plan  debt-reduction deals because they have not yet won approval of domestic  economic reform plans from the IMF -- a prerequisite to any such swaps.  </P> <P> He termed Venezuela's demand for a 50% reduction in its foreign debt burden,  which Caracas has said it will seek in negotiations now under way between  commercial banks and the government, as "totally unrealistic."  </P> <P> And he suggested that other countries such as Chile and Uruguay might find that  prodding banks into discounting their loans as part of Brady plan deals could  impede prospects for them to regain access to credit markets -- a major goal of  many debtors now.  </P> <P> Some critics of the debt-reduction effort believe that it helps Third World  countries more to provide them with new loan money to use to finance their  economic development than to reduce their overall debt-burdens, which carries  relatively less impact per dollar of help.  </P></p>

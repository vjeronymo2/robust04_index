			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Helicopters held back - Delivery forecasts have been cut THE NEWS will be when a helicopter programme happens on time and according to plan. In both the US and Europe, all major military projects - the backbone of the industry - have been subject to delays in development or procurement. Manufacturers have scaled down their forecasts for deliveries over the next 10 years, particularly on the military side. But total deliveries of civil helicopters were lower than expected last year at 650, compared with more than 1,000 in each of the previous two years and a rate of around 1,500 a year in the early 1980s before sales slumped. Excluding small piston-engined craft, industry predictions are for a gradual recovery on the civil side from last year's 380 deliveries, with predicted averages of close to 500 a year up to 2002. In the military sector, industry forecasts point to a market of about 12,600 helicopters in the 20 years from 1992 to 2011, worth about Dollars 105bn. North America is expected to account for about 4,000, Europe 3,300, south-east Asia and Australasia about 2,500 and the Middle East 1,100. Peak delivery levels are expected from 2003 to 2008. What the industry will look like by then is a subject for speculation. Westland has continued to talk about closer ties with Agusta, while Eurocopter, the joint venture between Aerospatiale of France and Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, advocates broader European links. Since last year. McDonnell Douglas, which bought its helicopter division from Hughes in 1983, has been in the market for 'joint ventures, partnership or sale'. This might mean different product lines going to different companies. Eurocopter is understood to have been interested in a purchase last year, but transfer of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter to a foreign company was clearly out of the question. McDonnell Douglas sees the helicopter division drawing good profits from the Apache for years to come. But one executive commented: 'It's hard to make a successful company out of a single product.' The Apache is being put forward, in a joint bid headed by Westland, as the leading contender for a UK army contract due to be decided next year for some 100 helicopters, worth about Pounds 2bn. Among four other groups invited to bid, the main rivals are the CobraVenom, an updated version of the veteran Bell SuperCobra led by GEC-Marconi Avionics, and the Eurocopter Tiger, which is under development for French and German forces. British Aerospace is heading the Tiger bid for the UK. The helicopters are due to enter service - barring further delays - in 1998. Two European naval and utility helicopter projects - the Franco-German-Dutch-Italian NH-90 and the Anglo-Italian EH101 - are now fully under way. The EH101 last year won a Canadian contract for 50 naval helicopters, but that would be vulnerable under a change of government. In the US, the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, beset by two prototype crashes and attempts by the last US administration to stop the programme, is expected to be reinstated. But army plans, including Apache upgrades and purchase of a fleet of 1,292 Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche scout helicopters are being reviewed. The Dollars 40bn Comanche programme has been slowed down, with the operational deadline slipping four years to 2003.</p>

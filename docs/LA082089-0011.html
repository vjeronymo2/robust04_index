You gotta go to  New York for a New York pastrami on rye!  </P> <P> Parenthetically, how could the testers have really gotten a good taste of  pastrami at The Times? By the time the runner got back, the pastrami must have  been cold. And no one with any sense of self will eat cold pastrami.  </P> <P> SHEILA KNECHT  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

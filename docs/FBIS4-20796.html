			<p>CSO     [Text] Consumption of natural gas in Iran has increased  from 11.4 billion cubic meters [bm[.sup]3[/]] in 1989 to 28.9  bm[.sup]3[/] by the end of 1994.    This was reported by the director of National Iranian Gas  Company, Asadollah Salihi Faruz, in an interview with  journalists. He said that the increased consumption of natural  gas during the planning years [1990-94] clearly shows that gas  as a replacement for half-distilled imported products has led to  a saving of $16 billion.    He added that for the first time during the last few days  natural gas production has gone up to 111.2 million cubic meters  [m[.sup]3[/]] a day, which is the current level of gas  consumption in the country.    The director of National Iranian Gas Company added that the  National Iranian Gas Company general assembly in a meeting,  attended by the president and six members of the Cabinet,  approved that priority in gas consumption should be given to  domestic use--not to export.    Concerning gas pipelines, he said that the total length of  pipelines built by the end of 1989 was 5,000 km, which will  reach 8,100 km by the end of 1994. In other words, there was  more than 62-percent growth of gas pipeline construction during  the First Five-Year Plan.    About extending pipelines to cities in the country, Mr.  Salihi Faruz said that building networks and installing service  lines reached 15,660 km and 758,000 extension lines by the end  of 1989. By the end of the plan, there will be 33,834 km  networks and 1,880 extension lines. In this way, the length of  laying networks during the five-year plan will be 18,156 km and  the number of installed extensions will be 1,122, which means  that there has been an average 17-percent growth per year in  building networks and 20 percent growth in installing extension  lines.    Concerning export of gas to other countries, he said that  with the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the cut-off of  gas to that country, a similar contract was signed with  Azerbaijan, on the basis of which 8 m[.sup]3[/] of gas per  day was exported to Azerbaijan for a year. Because of  Azerbaijan's financial problems, there has not been any export  of gas to that country since last winter.    Mr. Salihi Faruz said that the joint partnership of the  Islamic Republic of Iran and France in the area of underwater  and overland production, in constructing pipelines, in planning  and building stations to increase pressure in the Sarakhs-Naka  gas-line, and in expansing the gas industry are among the  accomplishments of the National Iranian Gas Company. He added  that National Iranian Gas Company in partnership with Gas-tu  France signed a contract with a 50-percent share of $200,000,  which is currently in operation.    According to Mr. Salihi, for the purpose of exporting gas to  Europe, Iran and France together, with a 60-percent joint share,  are cooperating with five European countries: Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Germany, Austria, and Spain, with a total 40-percent  share, each with a share of 8 percent.    At the end, he mentioned the problem of cash (the decline of  gas prices), delay in opening credits, demands for funds for  drilling permit and asphalt, prevention of the company works by  municipalities and by some institutions, problems of acquiring  land for extending pipelines, and shortage of contractors--he  considered these to be among the executive problems of the  company. He mentioned that if a portion of the remark under  Article 25 of 1994 budget is to be left out, the National  Iranian Gas Company will be forced to cease operating.</p>

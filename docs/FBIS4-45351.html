			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Excerpt] Over eight tons of packed marijuana, distributed  in a railroad car, a tank truck, buckets, drums, and nine  vehicles equipped with special compartments, were seized  yesterday by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel detailed to  Sinaloa, Veracruz, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, and  Tamaulipas States, where 15 presumed public poisoners were  arrested. It is estimated that the drugs, intended to be sent to  the United States for sale and consumption, were worth  approximately 150 million new pesos.    According to a report submitted to the assistant attorney  for  local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, prominent  among the seizures made by the federal agents is the one that  occurred at the railroad terminal in the port of Mazatlan,  Sinaloa. There, three tons of pressed marijuana were confiscated.    It was noted that the PGR [Attorney General's Office]  representatives, in cooperation with the officials at that  station, made a routine inspection on the train that runs from  the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, to Mexicali, Baja California  (with a stop in Mazatlan). Upon discovering that the seals of  the freight car on which the drugs were being carried had been  tampered with, the police agents intensified the search. They  found the three tons of cannabis, bound for Baja California,  contained in hundreds of packages.    At the order of the PGR representative in that state, Luis  Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, PJF deputy commissioner Eduardo Salazar  Carillo continued the investigation at the aforementioned  railroad terminal. The local PGR offices in Jalisco and Baja  California were also advised to continue the probe, capture the  drug owners, determine whether any National Railroads employee  was implicated in the incident, and take the appropriate action.    Furthermore, as was reported to the PJF's general director,  Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Jose Braulio Salvador Campos Beltran,  Salvador Campos Beltran, Juan Manuel Espino Trejo, Juan Sergio  Espino Chan, and Jose Salvador Francisco Campos Beltran were  arrested in the municipality of Acayucan, Veracruz. They were  carrying approximately two tons of cannabis indica on a tank  truck, also bound for the country's northern border.    It was explained that the drugs in question had been packed  in 280 plastic buckets which, in turn, were distributed in the  tank of the vehicle. The latter is presumed to be owned by the  Felem Company, which is being investigated by agents under  orders from Deputy Commissioner Fernando Asiain Barriga.  [passage omitted]</p>

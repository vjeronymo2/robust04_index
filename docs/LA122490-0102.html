			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RUSHDIE MOVES TO SUPPRESS 'SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> Author Salman Rushdie has given up his campaign for a paperback version of "The  Satanic Verses" and will authorize no further translations so long as there is  any possibility of causing offense to Muslims.  </P> <P> An Islamic leader in Britain who met with Rushdie said today the author hopes  the statement will "make him a free man" after living in hiding for nearly two  years under a death threat.  </P> <P> In a statement released by Dr. Hesham Essawy, president of the Islamic Society  for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, Rushdie also declared he does not  agree with any statements uttered by characters in the book that cast  aspersions on Islam, question the authenticity of the Koran or reject the  divinity of Allah.  </P> <P> "I talked to Salman a couple of minutes ago. That is his statement, and he  signed it," said Frances D'Souza, who is chairman of Rushdie's defense  committee.  </P> <P> Without a paperback, Rushdie said in an interview with the Independent on  Sunday newspaper, "in a few years the book simply won't be there for anyone who  wants to read it. It will, in all practical terms, have been suppressed."  </P> <P> Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February, 1989, when  now-deceased Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said the writer  deserved death as a blasphemer. Iran offered a $1-million bounty for Rushdie's  death.  </P></p>

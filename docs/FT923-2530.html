			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar boost for oils THE LATEST collapse in the sterling/dollar rate, which has seen the UK currency slide from the Dollars 2 mark to Dollars 1.78 in less than a week, provoked a heavy burst of overseas buying of the oil sector. With oil priced in dollars, the sector was seen as a big beneficiary of recent currency moves. The big US institutions were said to have chased all the quality oil shares. A specialist at one of the big US investment banks said: 'At recent exchange rates it looked as if some big earnings downgrades would have to be implemented, but that no longer seems to be the case.' BP advanced 8 to 210 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 16m, although analysts made the point that the majority of the group's huge debts are in dollars. Shell raced up 16 to 492 1/2 p on 6.3m traded. Enterprise Oil shares remained in positive territory even during the market's darkest hour, with stories of big US buying interest noted throughout the day. The stock delivered the best individual performance in the Footsie, closing 29, or 8.6 per cent, higher at 365p. Around two weeks ago the shares dropped to 323p as a block of 9.6m was placed in the market by a UK institution. Lasmo, in which a hefty 6.5m shares were traded, was also aggressively sought by US investors, adding 7 1/2 at 132 1/2 p. Body Shop plunges Not even the wild swings in the market could hide the shock of a profits warning from health and beauty group Body Shop, one of the rapid growth stocks of the 1980s, and the shares retreated sharply to become the session's worst performing stock in percentage terms. The retailer, once regarded by some as one of the 'stars' of the stores sector, warned that first-half profits, expec-ted to be announced in mid-October, would be below previous market forecasts but would reach at least Pounds 8m, against last year's Pounds 9.1m. Dealers rushed to sell the stock, sending the price plunging 126 to 140p at one stage, its lowest point since December 1990. Analysts moved to cut full-year forecasts, and Ms Julie Ramshaw at Morgan Stanley reduced her estimate by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 25.5m for the year to February 1993 and shaved the following year's figure by Pounds 7m to Pounds 32m. Bargain hunting later in the day left the stock a net 108 down at 158p. Turnover amounted to 3m, the highest daily total for more than two years in the tightly held stock. Commenting on the day's fall Ms Ramshaw said: 'In the short term the worst is probably over, but investors will be cautious until the interims.' Fisons wanted Fisons, the pharmaceuticals/chemicals group, bucked the overall trend as marketmakers responded to revived hints that a takeover bid for the group could be in the offing. There have been numerous bouts of takeover speculation surrounding Fisons, especially since the group issued a profits warning in June, when the shares plunged more than 100p in a single session. At the close of trading, Fisons shares were 9, or 5.4 per cent, higher at 175p. Turnover came to a higher than usual 5.2m shares. Dealers said Boots had been mooted as a potential predator. Other possible bidders, according to dealers, included ICI and a number of overseas groups. ICI shares settled 4 higher at 1058p. The two successive rises in UK interest rates triggered several waves of selling pressure throughout the big banks, already suffering from the implications of the unprecedentedly high rate of customer bankruptcies inflicted by the prolonged recession in the UK. Barclays and National Westminster are seen by analysts as likely to suffer most from the fresh wave of corporate failures likely to be caused by yesterday's move to crisis-level interest rates. The former dropped to 281p before stabilising to close a volatile session 19 down at 291p after exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m shares. NatWest was finally 22 off at 306p, after 301p, with 10m traded. Abbey National, one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, plummeted to 249 1/2 p but embarked on a good rally which left the stock a net 7 off at 262p. The jump in interest rates caused dismay in the insurance sectors, especially among companies involved in mortgage indemnity business, one of the biggest business cas-ualties of the recession and the plunge in house prices. Fears that an imminent and probably large increase in mortgage costs, which would leave many mortgage holders unable to meet payments, and worries about the effects of higher interest rates on property values and equity market valuations impacted heavily on Sun Alliance, which retreated 15 to 239p. The shares were additionally unsettled by speculation that the group had lost a golden opportunity to place its near 15 per cent stake in Commercial Union on Tuesday. CU dipped 8 to 475p. Royal, heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity, fell 11 to 126p, while Legal &amp; General, due to announce interims today, ended 18 down at 299p. In the rest of the stores sector, the poor sentiment in Body Shop spilled over into Boots, the shares declining 8 to 454p on 3.1m traded. It was, however, news of higher interest rates that sent several of the stocks in the sector into retreat. Kingfisher, supported on Tuesday by the release of figures at the top end of expectations, receded 15 to 459p. Among brewers, investors focused on overseas earning stocks which offered some protection against interest rate pressures in the UK. These included Allied Lyons, 19 stronger at 564p, Grand Metropolitan, which gained 17 on balance at 409p, having fallen to 371p earlier in the day, and Guinness, up 13 at 529p ahead of today's interim figures. It was once again a sorry tale in Queens Moat Houses as financial worries continued to hang over the stock, and the shares finished 6 1/2 weaker at 27 1/2 p on high turnover of 7.9m.

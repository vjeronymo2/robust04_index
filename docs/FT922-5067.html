			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Western donors urged to ease aid conditions WESTERN donors seeking to encourage private investment in east Europe and ease transition to market-oriented democracies should relax aid conditions and streamline disbursements, says a report* on aid to central Europe by the New York and Prague-based Institute for East-West Studies. Aid commitment figures were often misleading. This was highlighted at a recent EC-sponsored conference on aid to the former Soviet Union. The EC estimated western donors had pledged Dollars 86bn (Pounds 48.5bn) to former Soviet republics, but only part has been disbursed. Group of 24 nations have pledged Dollars 27bn to central Europe but only 2 per cent of Czechoslovakia's share was disbursed in 1990; Hungary received 17 per cent, and Poland 27 per cent. Such gaps are partly because most aid was not available for discretionary spending or activated only when recipients met contractual obligations. Over SDR1.1bn set aside in 1990 to compensate for higher oil prices was not fully used because expected trigger prices were not maintained. Figures quoted for aid generally refer to pledges over the life of projects, often running several years. Credits or grants are often used to encourage companies or non-profit bodies to invest or provide services, but where recipients gain only a part of donors' spending. Except the EC's PHARE technical aid programme and UN funded programmes, credits were usually offered on commercial terms, ensuring many credit lines stay under-utilised. It was often impossible to distinguish between components of an aid package, but in most cases the concessional element was below the 25 per cent required to qualify technically as 'aid'. Slow disbursement of foreign aid was also a function of the low absorption capacity of countries with fledgling banking and credit systems and inexperienced, if fast-growing, private sectors. The report urges a more flexible approach to debt management, better aid co-ordination and more technical assistance to increase aid absorption. 'Conditionality should be re-defined in the light of recipient governments' commitment to political and market-oriented reforms if a deep financial crisis of a Latin American type is to be avoided.' * Beyond Assistance.

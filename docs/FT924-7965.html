			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Traders find little cause for satisfaction - Export financing BRITISH exporters seeking positive government support in the Autumn Statement were left unsated yesterday - pleased to have extra cover available, but still complaining that the cost of export credit insurance remains significantly higher for UK exporters than for most international competitors. The additional Pounds 700m of export credit guarantee cover is to be spread over the present financial year and 1993-94. Just Pounds 200m is to be added to cover this year, with Pounds 500m next year - amounting to about a quarter of the total exports guaranteed by the Export Credit Guarantees Department. The extra guarantees are to be focused on 11 markets - all of them countries in which exporters are heavily involved. These markets are China, Hong Kong, South Africa, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Turkey and Zimbabwe. The first five of these are defined by the ECGD as 'concentrated markets' - meaning that they account for such a large proportion of the ECGD's overall foreign exposure that new cover is unavailable. Exporters have frequently argued that this restraint prevents them from winning orders in some of their biggest markets.</p>

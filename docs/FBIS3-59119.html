News of the base will fuel criticism of Pergau, described  last week as an "abuse" of the aid system by Sir Tim Lankester,  a former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development  Administration. The National Audit Office, the public spending  watchdog, has condemned Pergau as uneconomic and a waste of  money.    John Laing International, the construction company, has  submitted plans for the site, at Mersing on the east coast, for  approval by the Malaysian government. The original  specification for the project comprised submarine docking  facilities, landing strip, reinforced hangars for Hercules  transport aircraft and accommodation for up to three battalions  of special forces. Laing's contract is thought to be worth about  200 million pounds.    As a signatory of the long-standing Five Power Defence  Arrangement -- with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and  Singapore -- Britain will be able to station troops and  equipment there during joint exercises. Mersing is also likely  to play a key strategic role in the region when Britain hands  Hong Kong back to China in 1997.    Details of the project, including the cost and who is paying  for it, remain confidential. Apart from confirming that a  report had recently gone to the Malaysian government, a John  Laing spokesman would say only that "the company has been  involved in it for several years." A Ministry of Defence  spokesman said: "We don't discuss special forces operations."    However, a former senior executive from Midland Bank, which  was involved in the financing of the accompanying 1.3 billion  pound sale of arms to Malaysia, said Mersing was raised at the  very outset of talks in 1988. "It was on a menu of transactions  drawn up by the Malaysians. They'd selected a site and they  wanted our help. It would be operated by the Malaysians but  would contain our troops when Hong Kong goes."    He said that Stephan Kock, a consultant to Midland who also  advised the Government's Joint Intelligence Committee, was  "architect of the different strands" of the deal. Mr Kock is  understood to have visited Malaysia with officials from the MoD  [Ministry of Defense] and members of the Special Air Services.    A defence spokesman at the Malaysian High Commission in  London was also unwilling to discuss Mersing. Asked if British  Special Air Services and Special Boat Squadron personnel would  be based there, he replied, "they could well be."    He did, however, confirm that Mersing "was raised in  discussion for the memorandum of understanding on the  procurement of defence equipment from Britain."    The Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee will decide  today whether to examine Pergau. Unlike the Public Accounts  Committee, which last week questioned Sir Tim and is confined to  quizzing officials, it has the power to call ministers. Douglas  Hurd and John Major, who over-ruled Sir Tim, are likely to be in  the firing line.    Last night the Government moved to defuse embarrassment by  claiming Lord Younger, the former Secretary of State for  Defence, was mistaken in linking aid with arms.    Replying to a parliamentary question from Jack Cunningham,  Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Hurd said the military  memorandum signed by Lord Younger "included a reference to `aid  in support of nonmilitary aspects under this programme.'"  However, Mr Hurd said, "after consultation with ministerial  colleagues in London, (Lord Younger) wrote to the Malaysian  Minister of Finance in June 1988 to say that aid could not be  linked to defence sales."    Mr Cunningham said it was plain that "Lord Younger, who is  no  longer in the Government, is being made a scapegoat." He  maintained the answer showed the governments did discuss linking  arms deals and aid.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Require principal operations inspectors to periodically review air carrier flight operations policies and practices concerning pilot tasks between flights to ensure that carriers provide pilots with adequate resources (such as time and personnel) to accomplish those tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations contained in 14 CFR Part 135 to require that pilot flight time accumulated in all company flying conducted after revenue operations *&blank;*&blank;* such as training and check flights, ferry flights and repositioning flights *&blank;*&blank;* be included in the crewmember's total flight time accrued during revenue operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Revise within 1 year the pilot training requirements for scheduled Part 135 operators such that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All pilot training for aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats be conducted in accordance with Subparts N and O of 14 CFR Part 121. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All pilots are provided mandatory crew resource management training that incorporates the principal components of effective CRM training, as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120&hyph;51A, ``Crew Resource Management Training.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All flightcrew members complete the initial operating experience currently required only of pilots-in-command under Part 135.244. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Issue within 6 months a final rule of 14 CFR Part 142 concerning the certification and operation of training centers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Revise the certification standards for Part 25 and for Part 23 (commuter category) aircraft to require that a flight simulator, suitable for flightcrew training under Appendix H of Part 121, be available concurrent with the certification of any new aircraft type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require all flight attendants to participate, during recurrent training, in emergency drills that allow them the opportunity to use emergency equipment and to practice procedures under simulated emergency conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require that all air carriers operating under Parts 121 and 135 establish a safety function, such as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120&hyph;59, ``Air Carrier Internal Evaluation Programs.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Establish a joint industry/government task force, such as an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC), comprising representatives from the FAA, air carriers, aircraft manufacturers, and the academic community to review the qualification standards and training curriculum of air carrier inspectors. The intent of the task force should be revisions to the qualifying and training standards for air carrier inspectors that will (a) increase their familiarity with air carrier operations and maintenance in general, as well as the specific operations of the air carriers they inspect; and (b) enhance their knowledge of the Federal Aviation Regulations and provide for more standardized interpretation and enforcement of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Enhance the level of safety at airports served by commuter airlines by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Seeking legislative action within 6 months to include in the Airport Certification Program all airports served by air carriers that provide scheduled passenger service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revising and expanding 14 CFR 135, following enactment of the legislative action described in Safety Recommendation A&hyph;94&hyph;203, to permit scheduled passenger operation only in airports certificated under the standards contained in Part 139, ``Certification and Operations: Land Airports Serving Certain Air Carriers.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA requests that commenters be as specific as possible and provide as much detail in comments as necessary to facilitate regulatory decisionmaking. The format that would be most useful to the FAA is a subpart by subpart analysis of the impact of possible rulemaking. Cost information is also particularly useful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the timeframe recommended by the NTSB, the FAA requests that commenters be timely in their response to this notice. The agency does not anticipate an extension of the comment period, so that regulatory changes may be proposed in a responsive timeframe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA anticipates that comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in adopting or modifying the NTSB recommendations to establish a regulatory framework that will enhance safety in the commuter airline industry while not being overly burdensome on that industry. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Anthony J.

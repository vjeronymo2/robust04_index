India has extensive documentation to prove  this point and the material has been presented to Western  governments as evidence of Pakistan's role in sponsoring  transborder terrorism.    There have been detailed reports filed by independent  journalists to further substantiate Pakistani complicity in  disturbing the peace in Kashmir. However, every time such  evidence is made public, either by the Government of India or  the national media, Pakistan has been prompt in denouncing it as  a propaganda. Ironically, it is the Pakistani media which has  now begun to publish reports that provide indisputable evidence  of Islamabad's support to terrorists. For instance, the FRONTIER  POST, a well-known newspaper published from Peshawar and Lahore,  has been publishing a series of articles and news reports which  reveal the extent to which fundamentalist religio-political  parties and organizations that enjoy official and quasi-official  patronage have been sending across trained young men to Kashmir.  The newspaper has also reported how some of these organizations  whose camps are attended by Pakistani Army officers have been  planning the kidnapping and killing of security personnel on  duty in the valley.    All this, of course, is not news as far as India is  concerned. There can be no doubt that the ISI [Inter Service  Intelligence] is not the only Pakistani outfit which has its  fingers firmly in the Kashmiri pie; so have the Jamaat-i-Islami  and its allied organizations. Yet, the Pakistani Government led  by Ms. Benazir Bhutto has have no compunction in trying to make  political capital out of the strife and violence that is a  handiwork of its agencies.    At the ongoing UN Human Rights Commission conference in  Geneva, Ms. Bhutto has sought to propagate the Pakistani  allegation of human rights violations resorting to the old  tactics of repeating a lie again and again so that it appears to  have a kernel of truth. But the propaganda blitz is unlikely to  cut much ice. Now that even the Pakistani media has begun to  divulge the truth, it is only a matter of time before the cat  leaps out of the bag. It will not be surprising if following  the spate of reports in the Pakistani newspapers Islamabad  decides to impose press censorship to suppress the cold facts.  But all this can only have a cosmetic effect for there is no  power which can suppress the truth for ever, and the truth is  that Pakistan driven by territorial greed is instigating and  fanning violence in Kashmir.  *</p>

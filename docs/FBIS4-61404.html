			<p>BFN     [Text] At the moment, Russia is sufficiently provided with  grain to enable it to give up centralized grain imports, Russian  Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha told a news conference  in Moscow Thursday.    Zaveryukha dismissed reports in the Western media of  projected purchases of grain in the USA saying no talks had been  held on this issue.    According to his information, enterprises of  Roskhleboprodukt  stored 17 million tons of grain, while another 1.5 million tons  may be purchased from domestic farmers. Therefore, given a  monthly consumption of 2.8 million tons, the stocks will last  for six months.    Zaveryukha pointed out that the minimum purchases of grain  would be made only for Russia's northern most regions and the  Far East due to a high cost of shipping grain to the regions  from Central Russia. However, these purchases, which have  already amounted to about 200,000 tonnes, will be made  exclusively on a commercial basis, without state participation.    Moreover, Russia has already exported three million tons of  last year's grain to neighboring republics.    Zaveryukha established the fact that given average harvests  of 100 million tons Russia was quite capable of providing itself  with grain. At the same time, he refrained from prognosticating  about the future harvest, because "much would depend on weather  conditions."    Over recent years, Russia has traditionally imported grain.  In 1992, as many as 26 million tons were delivered to Russia,  while in 1993 grain imports exceeded 10 million tons.</p>

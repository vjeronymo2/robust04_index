			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / MPs hear of missing Gulf war equipment AMMUNITION and other military supplies shipped out for British troops in the Gulf may have been sold off by profiteers, the Commons public accounts committee heard yesterday. However, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, chief of defence procurement, said he would be 'very surprised' if large high technology equipment had found its way on to the black market. He was referring to 80 containers of supplies which were unaccounted for after the 1991 Gulf war. Dr McIntosh said the loss rate, just over 1 per cent, was 'about the commercial average'. A recent National Audit Office report revealed that 228 metal aircraft pallets, worth Pounds 680,000, were also lost. Dr McIntosh told the committee these were often used to build troop shelters and were now 'probably just sitting in the sand.' The committee's inquiry into Gulf shipments coincided with police investigations into possible fraud in the arrangements of charter shipping for the British military operation. Dr McIntosh contested the NAO's estimate that the Ministry of Defence overpaid shippers by Pounds 38m. He said the figure was unrealistically based on rates for normal peace time activities. The MoD believes the premium it paid for shipping supplies was 'closer to zero', Dr McIntosh said. He agreed, however, that brokerage fees of up to 8 per cent were excessive and that the ministry would not normally be expected to pay more than 5 per cent. 'That's not something we would like to see again at all.' The reason British ships made up only 3 per cent of the vessels used was that many were already engaged on contracts and others were com-paratively expensive, he said.</p>

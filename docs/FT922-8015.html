			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: Carbon tax a dead duck for EC Sir, Your article 'Carbon tax faces Europe with steep cost rises' (May 14) raises a number of key issues. By making the proposed tax conditional on the US and Japan following suit, the EC tax is in fact a massive dead duck with no chance of being implemented. The US has resisted any proposal to reduce its own emissions, and is certain to ignore this. In reaching this 'achievement', the EC has abandoned plans for Europe-wide renewable energy and efficiency initiatives. These initiatives, like the carbon tax, are necessary to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 to 1990 levels. The net result of this massive compromise to the fossil fuel lobby will, according to the EC's own analysis, result in a 12 per cent increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide by 2000. The conditionality of this announcement has effectively handed over EC decision making on global warming to a former oil company head: George Bush. The best the EC can offer in the build up to the Earth Summit is to do nothing. But by doing nothing the EC has taken a determined step: to increase its contribution to global warming.

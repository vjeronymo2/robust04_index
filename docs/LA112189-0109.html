			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: 3RD PERIOD PROFIT DOWN 18% FOR MEDICAL PROPERTIES  </P> <P> Medical Properties of Encino, a real estate investment trust, reported net  income of $423,000 in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, an 18% decline  from its $517,000 in profits a year earlier. Revenues, consisting mainly of  rents on its properties, fell 5% to $1.3 million from $1.4 million.  </P> <P> The company said its earnings declined because part of its rents are based on a  percentage of the revenues generated by the companies that lease its  properties. It said income from that part of its rent formula declined in the  latest quarter.  </P> <P> In the nine months that ended in September, Medical Properties earned $1.5  million, up 4% from $1.4 million a year earlier. Revenues rose less than 1% to  $4.1 million from $4 million.  </P></p>

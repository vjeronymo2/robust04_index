During his talks with the president of the Czech Republic,  Walesa noted that what counted to him and to Poland, above all  else, were facts rather than declarations. The most important  issue facing us now is to translate declarations into facts.  Declarations by themselves are not enough; they are often  reminiscent of "wearing a necktie in a coffin", the president of  the Polish Republic said.    It was agreed during the talks that NATO could have done  more  for our countries than it has. Speaking about both countries'  efforts to enter NATO, President Havel added that he has been  doing through diplomatic means the exact same things President  Walesa has been doing at full volume. It was also agreed during  the talks that the latest Russian actions had the  characteristics of blackmail against Europe and the world.    Speaking about the "Partnership for Peace", the president of  the Polish Republic remarked that it was a road to NATO that  would, however, need to materialize very quickly. We should  already be working on "clarifying" our relations with NATO. We  can also count on each another in the event of external danger,  Walesa said, summing up the talks.    The talks between Walesa and U.S. President Bill Clinton,  which took place in a very good and relaxed atmosphere, mainly  concerned issues connected with security, NATO, and the economy,  the BPP statement reports.    President Clinton said that security issues also depend on  economic issues. America is opening up to Poland, he added.  Some had interpreted the "Partnership for Peace" as a  compromise between doing nothing and NATO membership. For me,  this plan is a way of reaching the North Atlantic pact. We need  time for this to happen, however. Poland's security is in the  interests of the United States, President Clinton noted. He  also emphasized that he did not want to create new divisions.    Walesa emphasized the role of the United States as a  superpower responsible for what is happening in the world.  Speaking about declarations, he drew attention to our country's  negative historical experiences. He recalled, among other  things, President Yeltsin's declaration made during his official  visit to Poland last year. It has become no more than a paper  declaration, the Polish president added.    "We are not anti-Russian. It is not Poland, it is Europe  that should be afraid of Russia." We merely want Europe to  integrate with our area as quickly as possible, Walesa  concluded. Walesa invited the president of the United States to  pay a visit to our country in May this year.    Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who took part in the  meeting, raised economic problems first and foremost, drawing  attention to the need for a "partnership for development", the  BPP told PAP.    "On the path toward making the Partnership for Peace a  reality, we need a partnership for development." The BPP  statement reports that this was one of the main arguments in  Prime Minister Pawlak's address during the Prague talks between  the Polish delegation led by President Lech Walesa and President  Clinton.    The prime minister noted that he actually interprets the  term  of "Partnership for Development" as a stimulation of economic  development with the United States and Western Europe. He  stressed that there are still too many barriers in this respect.    "Now that the Uruguay round of GATT talks has been closed,  we now have to concentrate on eliminating many restrictions that  remain outside the tariff. Their place must be taken by offers  of mutually complimentary projects", the prime minister said.  He spoke with approval about the statement by President  Clinton, who spoke in Brussels about a need for greater openness  by the West toward economic cooperation with Central and Eastern  Europe.    Pawlak stated that economic cooperation constitutes a  condition for genuine integration of Europe and for its  security. During the meeting, a full unanimity with President  Clinton with regard to views on this subject was noted. The  U.S. President recalled his speeches calling upon the leaders of  Western European countries to eliminate barriers in trade and  appeals to businessmen to invest in Central and Eastern European  countries.    Economic matters were also a subject at Prime Minister  Pawlak's meeting with Czech Republic Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus. The Polish prime minister stated that achieving NATO  membership must be linked with economic development, and  cooperation between the two countries has a significant role to  play. Pawlak declared readiness to intensify concrete working  contacts that would produce, for instance, the abolition of  barriers in trade exchange, would ensure the fluidity of mutual  trade clearing, or would bring about the intensification of  cross-border cooperation, the BPP reported.    "It is not guarantees that create facts but facts that make  guarantees possible" was the leitmotif of all of President  Walesa's meetings in Prague today. The BPP reported that the  issue of the future of the Visegrad Group countries in the  system of European security was raised.    In the afternoon, Walesa met Hungarian President Arpad Goncz  and Slovak President Michal Kovac [words indistinct]. The main  subject of both meetings was cooperation, both bilateral and  regional, between our countries, and the future of all countries  of the group in NATO structures.    According to President Goncz, Hungary, which feels "war  breathing down its neck" in view of the proximity of the Balkan  conflict, is anxious for quick ties with NATO, although it is  aware that the speed of our march toward the pact depends on the  development of the situation in Russia. President Walesa again  stressed that the most important thing is an overall vision of  the future, while individual interests are less important, the  BPP statement says.    Appraising cooperation between Poland and Hungary, President  Goncz admitted that it is inadequate today. There is a chance  to stimulate cooperation, especially within the Carpathian  region. Primarily this concerns economic, including trade,  cooperation. "The free-trade skeleton should be fleshed out  somewhat," President Goncz said.    It was established that Polish-Hungarian talks will be  continued during an official visit to Poland by the president of  the Hungarian Republic, who is going to be a guest of the  president of the Polish Republic.    Poland is also expecting a visit by Slovak President Kovac,  who during today's Prague meeting with President Walesa thought  cooperation in the Visegrad Group needs new stimuli and a new  driving force, although there is no need to build institutions.  With regard to our relations with NATO, he noted there will  still be a need for talks and contacts between the ministers of  defense, foreign affairs, and the economic departments of the  Group's states. They will map out the next stages of our  activities on this issue.    President Kovac sought reasons for the weak bilateral  cooperation between Poland and Slovakia. First and foremost, he  attributed it to the short period of existence of an independent  Slovakia and in the stereotypes from the previous era of  thinking only about yourself. We are linked by many things,  however. "An important element linking our countries is  Catholicism," said President Kovac. Today there is a chance for  our cooperation to become authentic, rather than being conferred  by Moscow. Both regional and bilateral cooperation is  necessary. This was also mentioned by President Walesa, who  said that NATO will come to us itself if we show that we are  strong through the strength of our economy, the strength of our  stability."    The presidents' meeting in Prague ended with a ceremonial  dinner given by President Havel, attended by the heads of state  of the Visegrad Group states, writes the BPP.</p>

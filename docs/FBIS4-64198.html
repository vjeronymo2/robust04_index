			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["pso" report: "Siemens Corporation Sticks to Cautious </F> Prediction of Result"]    [Text] Siemens AG, Munich/Berlin -- The leading German  electronics corporation has slightly increased its profits  during the first half of the current business year (30  September). According to an interim report, during the first six  months Siemens achieved a yield after taxes of 879 million  German marks [DM] (previous year DM877 million). A spokesman  for the corporation said, however, upon inquiry, that Siemens  still expects a declining annual profit for the 1993-94 business  year. During the latest shareholders' meeting Financial  Director Karl-Hermann Baumann announced a probably constant  operational pretax profit (previous year DM1.055 billion) and a  lower financial yield before taxes (previous year DM1.855  billion). The fact that this development of profits has not yet  had an effect in the course of this year was justified by the  spokesman by good financial results during the first quarter of  the business year.    As the interim report further shows, foreign business has  particularly revived for Siemens. Orders received rose by 8.6  percent to DM44.4 billion during the period under review  compared with the same period last year. Orders received from  aboard even rose by 21 percent to DM26.9 billion, while domestic  demand declined by 6.4 percent to DM17.5 billion. As one reason  for the increase in foreign orders, Siemens cites the first  consolidation of the U.S. lamp producer Osram Sylvania, but also  a strong foreign demand for products of drive, switching, and  wiring technology, automobile technology, medical technology,  private communications technology, as well as facilities for  energy production. Weak domestic demand primarily affected  installation and automatization technology, public communication  networks, as well as the transfer and distribution of energy.    Turnover also developed more favorably for the corporation  abroad. During the period under review, overall turnover rose  by 3 percent to DM38 billion, with turnover abroad going up 13  percent to DM22.4 billion, while domestic turnover declined by  9.3 percent to DM15.6 billion. However, Siemens points out  that, without including Osram Sylvania, corporation turnover  would have remained constant. Siemens says that business with  modular units and transportation technology are the "supporters  of growth." Even though Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems  increased turnover abroad, it has not compensated for the weak  domestic business with that.    In the development of personnel, a clear shift across  borders  can be seen. At the end of March 397,000 people were employed,  which is about 6,000 more than a year ago. The inclusion of new  corporation companies for the first time, above all Osram  Sylvania, with 14,000 employees, however, disguises the  simultaneous personnel reduction of 8,000 people. The number of  employees in Germany was reduced by 5,000 to 233,000, while  staff abroad increased by 11,000 to 164,000.    In conclusion, Siemens reports on a decline of investment  during the period under review to DM2.4 (3.5) billion, which is  mainly due to lower purchases of shares. According to  unconfirmed reports, Siemens transferred about DM1.36 billion  for Sylvania to the U.S. GTE Corporation during the period under  review.</p>

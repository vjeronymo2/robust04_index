			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> d. Prohibition of Bypass <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (1) Bypass is prohibited and the Permit Issuing Authority may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, unless:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe and extensive property damage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as maintenance of sufficient reserve holding capacity, the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, waste hauling, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The permittee submitted notices as required under Paragraph c. of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Permit Issuing Authority may, within its authority, approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Permit Issuing Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in Paragraph d.(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 4. Upsets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the control of the permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit limitation if the requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(n)(3) are met. (Note that this provision does not apply to water quality requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 5. Removed Substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This permit does not authorize discharge of solids, sludge, filter backwash, or other pollutants removed in the course of treatment or control of wastewaters to waters of the United States unless specifically limited in Part 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Section C. Monitoring and Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Representative Sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Samples and measurements taken as required herein shall be representative of the volume and nature of the monitored discharge. All samples shall be taken at the monitoring points specified in this permit and, unless otherwise specified, before the effluent joins or is diluted by any other wastestream, body of water, or substance. Monitoring points shall not be changed without notification to and the approval of the Permit Issuing Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Flow Measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Appropriate flow measurement devices and methods consistent with accepted scientific practices shall be selected and used to insure the accuracy and reliability of measurements of the volume of monitored discharges. The devices shall be installed, calibrated and maintained to insure that the accuracy of the measurements are consistent with the accepted capability of that type of device. Devices selected shall be capable of measuring flows with a maximum deviation of less than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  10% from the true discharge rates throughout the range of expected discharge volumes.

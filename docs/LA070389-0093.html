			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENGLISH AS OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OKD  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by Latinos challenging Florida's  designation of English as the state's official language.  </P> <P> The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that an election giving  official-language status to English did not violate the federal Voting Rights  Act.  </P> <P> Florida voters last Nov. 8 approved the proposal by an 84% to 16% margin. The  initiative amended the state Constitution and left it up to the Florida  Legislature to implement the change.  </P> <P> Voters in Colorado and Arizona approved similar measures the same day, bringing  to at least 17 the number of states that have passed laws or adopted  constitutional amendments designating English as the official language.  </P> <P> The other states are Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,  Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina,  Tennessee and Virginia.  </P></p>

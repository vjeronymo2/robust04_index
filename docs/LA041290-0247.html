			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY'S MASUR TO TAKE OVER N.Y. PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> East German conductor Kurt Masur was named to a five-year term as music  director of the New York Philharmonic, effective with the 1992-1993 season.  </P> <P> Masur, music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, replaces Zubin  Mehta, whose last season with the Philharmonic is 1990-91. When he assumes his  post, Masur will conduct a minimum of 14 subscription weeks with four weeks of  other work. As a member of New Forum, the East German pro-democracy movement,  he was hailed as a hero in his country for averting bloodshed during last  year's anti-communist revolution.  </P> <P> During the 1990-91 season, Masur will conduct two subscription weeks, and will  provide an overview of artistic matters, which will include guiding the  planning of the 1991-92 season and orchestra auditions.  </P> <P> Stephan Stamas, chairman of the N.Y. Philharmonic, said that Masur will remain  with the Gewandhaus Orchestra through the 1993-94 season, its 200th anniversary  season. After that, Masur will maintain some association with the Leipzig  orchestra.  </P> <P> Stamas said that it will be a difficult transition, "but we are confident" that  whatever relationship evolves "his focus and interest will be on his life with  the Philharmonic."  </P> <P> Masur, who was in Paris rehearsing with the Orchestre National de France for  Bach's "St. Matthew" Passion, issued a statement: "I believe very strongly that  after all we have talked about regarding the future of the N.Y. Philharmonic  that we will succeed together in building up a close relationship between the  audience, the orchestra members and the leadership of the orchestra.  </P> <P> "I have always been very attracted by the musical life and the audiences of New  York City. I promise everyone that I will work as honestly as I have with my  Gewandhaus Orchestra for the past 20 years."  </P> <P> Leonard Bernstein, N.Y. Philharmonic conductor laureate, said in a statement:  "I couldn't be happier. I have nothing but esteem and affection for maestro  Masur as a musician and as a human being. I congratulate all sides."  </P> <P> In a statement, Mehta said he welcomes the appointment. "I've admired his work  as a guest conductor for many years and he has created a wonderful, world-class  orchestra in the Gewandhaus."  </P> <P> Mehta took over the directorship of the N.Y. Philharmonic in 1978, after  leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic for 16 seasons.  </P> <P> The Bombay-born conductor has declined to announce his future plans, other than  to say, as he did in November, 1988, that, "having held the position of music  director with various North American organizations since 1961, I must at this  juncture pursue other artistic endeavors which have to do with less  administrative activity than that with which a music director is usually  involved."  </P> <P> Masur was one of the earliest figures in East Germany to speak out against the  government. He was hailed as a hero for averting bloodshed during last year's  anti-Communist revolution in East Germany, but he said recently that he wanted  to keep his distance from politics.  </P> <P> "I am not a professional politician and have no wish to get involved in petty  party politics," he said last month at a news conference in Leipzig.  </P> <P> Though he ruled out full-time politics, Masur stressed he would continue to  speak out if he felt it necessary -- and he did so, lambasting West German  politicians for interfering in the recent East German elections.  </P> <P> In April, 1991, Masur is scheduled to bring his Gewandhaus Orchestra to the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and to San Diego during a U.S. tour. No repertory has  been announced.  </P> <P> Daniel Cariaga contributed to this report.  </P></p>

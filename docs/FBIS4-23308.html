			<p>BFN     [Text] The agenda for the forthcoming constitutional  conference was today in Abuja submitted to the Federal  Government by the Constitutional Conference Commission [CCC].  State House correspondent, Ogboji Ogbonaya Ogi, reports that  the agenda also contains a detailed timetable for the conference.    [Begin recording] [Ogi] Presenting the report to the head of  state, General Sani Abacha, the chairman of the CCC, retired  Justice (Sayibu Sayi), said the agenda was drawn on major issues  and includes over 1,000 memoranda received from individuals and  (?groups) from across the country. The memoranda, Justice  (Sayi) explained, were collated and analyzed to formulate the 30  items contained in the conference agenda. The chairman added  that the agenda was designed to fit into the four-month duration  of the conference under the first phase of the political program.    Receiving the agenda, Gen. Abacha commended the commitment  of  the commission in keeping faith with government's resolve and  anxiety to ensure that the conference was a success. Gen.  Abacha described the conduct of the last election of delegates  for the conference as most encouraging and congratulated both  the winners and losers for their maturity and spirit of  sportsmanship. The head of state commented on the reactions of  the international community on the outcome of the election, as  well as his administration's determination to pursue its  transition program to a successful conclusion.    [Abacha] (?On) the outcome of the delegates' election, the  attention of government has been drawn to favorable comments by  some foreign governments and media which now believe that this  administration is sincere and fully committed to putting this  country on a sound democratic footing. We appreciate this show  of understanding. We however continue to solicit their  cooperation in their reporting and commenting fairly and  positively about our nation. They should also highly appreciate  the enormity of our problems and give support to our courage and  determination to grapple with them. Let me reiterate,  unequivocally, that this administration will not renege on her  stated objective. The administration [words indistinct]  confidence placed on her to (?lead) our country [words  indistinct]. The pursuit of a vibrant democracy for our people  (?ignores) incoherent, emotional, and idle (?views) of  self-seeking individuals. [passage indistinct] Make no mistake  about it.    [Ogi] Gen. Abacha said that the resolve of the  administration  to return the country to democratic rule was total and will  never succumb to what he described as the whims and caprices of  a small minority. The CCC, inaugurated on 18 January, had  earlier submitted an interim report on 9 March. With the  submission of the agenda, the commission is now expected to  commence preparations for the commencement of the conference on  the 27th of this month. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the chief of general staff [CGS], Lieutenant  General Oladipo Diya, has given the assurance that a decree to  regulate the conference will be out before its commencement. He  gave the assurance while speaking with State House  correspondents shortly after the conference committee presented  its agenda to government. State House correspondent Haruna  Idriss has the details.    [Begin recording] [Idriss] The CGS said the decree, which  was  almost ready, will be released before the head of state  inaugurates the conference. Gen. Diya stated that the content  of the decree had already formed a part of the regulations  governing the recent elections held into the conference. He  assured Nigerians that the Federal Government would respect the  agenda of this conference which, he said, was based on the  memoranda collected from various parts of the country. The CGS  said government was working on the composition of its nominees  to the conference and gave the assurance that their names would  soon be made public. On the problem of accommodation for the  conference delegates, Gen. Diya said housing units earmarked for  the delegates would be ready before the commencement date of the  conference.    Also speaking to newsmen, the chairman of the Conference  Publicity Committee, Dr. (Wesse Ofalago), announced that the  committee, which submitted a 30-item agenda to government, will  put in place adequate logistic arrangements for the conference  to ensure hitch-free deliberations. Dr. (Ofalago) expressed  appreciation to some foreign governments for the support  extended to the committee. He announced that the British  Government had shown confidence in the conference and undertaken  to contribute funds towards the setting up of the conference  library. The library, he said, would contain all the memoranda  submitted to the committee, copies of previous constitutions,  and other deliberations of the conference. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev and Abish Kekilbayev have  arrived in Mangistay Oblast. The same day, on Monday [13 June]  afternoon, they had a meeting with representatives of different  national cultural associations. They were briefed on the work,  which is being carried out by them, and which is aimed at  strengthening friendship and peace between representatives of  different ethnic groups of the region. The head of state  assured them that he will do everything so that peace, civil  accord, and understanding prevailed in the area. Without this  the republic would not be able to achieve success in its market  reforms and raise the living standards of Kazakhstanis.    The next day Nazarbayev and the speaker of the parliament  familiarized themselves with the work of the chemical and  hydro-metallurgical works and the produce that it manufactures.  This is the unique enterprises and it manufactures mineral  fertilizers which are quite popular in the local market. The  works have recently started the production of scandium which is  in great demand both in the CIS and other foreign countries. It  also intends to manufacture some other rare earth metals. The  head of state stressed that their main task is to meet our  country's needs in these produce and only then to think about  selling surpluses to foreign partners. There are many orders  from foreign partners at the moment.    Nazarbayev and Kekilbayev held a meeting at the works with  leaders of industrial enterprises of Aktau and the region. The  chairman of the council of directors Marabayev briefed them on  the situation in the region and the problems that cannot be  tackled on their own. In particular, he said that with all this  oil and gas condensate, and other minerals that the region is  extracting and making an essential contribution to the  republican economy with, Mangistay still cannot create  appropriate social and housing conditions for its citizens.    Nazarbayev promised his support in tackling these issues and  at the same time he said that this depends mainly on the efforts  and efficiency of the works. Mangistau is a sort of a nature  monument with monuments from the paleolithic age up to the  present day. No other region of the Republic can be compared to  it. There are more than 20,000 archeological and architectural  monuments. Each of them is extremely valuable. Some of them  were visited by the leaders of the Republic. Nazarabyev noted  that what has been created by our ancestors and by nature is  irreplaceable. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is we  should find resources to protect them and pass them over to the  next generations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Pierre </F> Lefevre; place and date not given: "Algirdas Brazauskas on  Partnership For Peace, Russian Designs, the Baltic Countries,  and Instability in Belarus"]    [Text] [Lefevre] By signing your membership in the  Partnership for Peace this Thursday at NATO, you expressed your  wish to become a full member of the Atlantic organization. Do  you not fear that this will give rise to a feeling of isolation  in Russia?    [Brazauskas] I thought of that, and while expressing this  wish I clearly underlined that our approach was in no way an act  of hostility or enmity toward Russia -- especially since the  Partnership for Peace program allows anyone to participate who  wants to. This possibility is valid for Russia and for all the  other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It is  a peace program which aims to establish peace by any means  possible. It is a concrete formula of collaboration that is not  restricted to statements in favor of peace, but which offers  concrete collaboration with a view to building up this peace.  Those who think, on the other hand, in terms of blocs, of  hostility, of creating dissent, are those who are expressing  relics of the Cold War.    [Lefevre] Have you not gotten the impression that Moscow was  vetoing the membership of the countries of Central and Eastern  Europe in NATO?    [Brazauskas] To veto something you must first be entitled to  do so. Moscow has certainly expressed clear opinions on this  matter, but I think that this partnership program is going to  continue developing, that a growing number of countries are  going to join it, and that even Moscow will come around to it  little by little -- especially since the partnership program is  in no way an offensive system. Indeed, it is a system of  exchange, of consultation, of common learning, and of jointly  perfecting a number of mechanisms that must work on behalf of  peace.  <H5>  Kozyrev: Rhetoric that Harms Relations Between Countries </H5>   [Lefevre] Do you think that the United States will one day  give Lithuania and the Baltic countries the full security  guarantee of the North Atlantic Treaty, and by when?    [Brazauskas] It would be incredibly thoughtless of me to  suggest confirmation of this or any dates. All I can say is  that this partnership and consultation mechanism will develop  and will mature on its own.    [Lefevre] What do you think of the recent rhetoric of  Russian  Minister Kozyrev, who called the Baltic countries areas of  special interest for Russia?    [Brazauskas] This kind of abstract rhetoric never  contributes  anything. All it does is create confusion and damage relations  between countries. We are a sovereign, independent country and  a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. We  also hope to enter the European Union. What does this kind of  rhetoric mean? What gives them the right to make it and what  might its scope be? We signed agreements with Russia on a whole  series of problems. Take, for example, the withdrawal of the  Russian Army, which has now left Lithuanian territory, or the  matter of ethnic minorities. We have a Russian minority, the  vast majority of which, took Lithuanian citizenship when it was  given the opportunity to do so.    Of course there are still some major problems to be resolved  and we are continuing the negotiations with the hope that we can  resolve them one by one. Naturally, there is the matter of the  territory of Kalingrad, which is part of Russia, but which is  cut off from it. We understand that Russia has interests there  and we are continuing the negotiations with the Russians with  regard to this territory. As for Mr. Kozyrev's rhetoric, he did  not say what interests they were. If there are Russian  interests in Lithuania, they must be defined and we will carry  out negotiations on them like we are doing with the other  issues. Whether it is a big or a small country, we must all  live according to the same legal rules and apply them in all  circumstances.    [Lefevre] After the December elections in Russia, and the  recomposition of the Moscow Government, should we expect a  tougher line in Russian foreign policy?    [Brazauskas] I do not think so. Anyway, relations between  countries are never a constant. They change; there are ups and  downs.    [Lefevre] The Estonian prime minister recently wrote that  the  Russians must not be treated like spoiled children by sheltering  them from blame. Otherwise they will grow up into arrogant and  tyrannical adults. Do you share this point of view?    [Brazauskas] It is for similar reasons that I say that the  legal rules and their application must be the same for all the  countries, whether it is Lithuania, the United States,  Luxembourg, or Russia.    [Lefevre] In view of recent developments in Russia, do you  think that it needs less shock and more therapy, as Mr. Strobe  Talbott said?    [Brazauskas] The therapy is still needed. I think that the  negotiations between the countries and the way of fixing their  relations via these negotiations are actually therapeutic acts.  I do not believe in shock therapy or in therapeutic shocks,  neither in international relations nor in the domestic policy of  a country.   <H3>    Belarus: Something To Do with the Extradition of  Communists </H3>   [Lefevre] How do you interpret the dismissal of Belarus  President Shushkevich by a communist dominated parliament?    [Brazauskas] Every country has its own problems. The  situation in Belarus took a long time to come to fruition. This  also has something to do with the agreement concluded between  Belarus and Lithuania, which led to the extradition of the  leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who are now accused  of serious crimes and being tried. We have a legal cooperation  treaty with Belarus and, in accordance with this treaty, we have  handed over a number of Belarus citizens who were killers and we  have asked for the extradition on criminal charges of Mr.  Burokevicius, who was the first secretary of the Communist Party  faithful to Moscow as well as Mr. Jermalavicius, who was the  party ideologue (these two officials, who were hostile to  Lithuanian independence, are considered by Vilnius to be  responsible for confrontations during which Soviet troops killed  14 people near the radio and television building in January 1991  -- LE SOIR editor's note). We are entitled to demand that these  criminals be handed over to us and that is what was done. The  Belarus Parliament expressed a different opinion and contested  the extradition. Nevertheless, as a neighboring state, we  intend to continue maintaining good relations with Belarus.    [Lefevre] Does this mean we are witnessing a sort of  pro-communist revanchism in Belarus?    [Brazauskas] No. I would not use those terms. However,  political relations in Parliament are indeed different in our  country.  <H5>  Europe: Our Wish Is Obvious </H5>   [Lefevre] How do you assess the welcome which the European  Union has given to Lithuania?    [Brazauskas] We were welcomed very well indeed. Our wish is  obvious. We want to draw closer to the European Union as fast  as possible.    [Lefevre] Are you satisfied following the talks you recently  had with [European Commission President] Jacques Delors?    [Brazauskas] For the moment we are demanding to join the  European Union so it is hard for us to ask questions. We can  only express our wishes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 16 (CTK) -- The new government  programme is confrontational and internally unbalanced, Sergej  Kozlik, deputy chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) and former Slovak ex-premier for economic  questions, told journalists after an HZDS Presidium meeting  today.    He said that the government had only restricted space for  the  realization of its programme.    HZDS leaders are concerned over the government concessions  to  the Hungarian minority parties which expressed great  satisfaction with an ethnic minority programme which concerns  them, Kozlik said.    Former Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the 167  days would not be sufficient for the government to prepare early  parliamentary elections and that the behavior of the coalition  parties did not testify that the elections are being prepared.    The HZDS intends to come back with the idea of a referendum  to decide on early elections as "laws had been violated," Kozlik  said, adding that the petition lists had not yet been returned  to the HZDS from the Presidential Office. Kozlik was referring  to the petition campaign to support calling a referendum on  early election which was organized by the HZDS shortly before  its fall in early March. President Michal Kovac rejected calling  a referendum as the organizers failed to collect 350,000  signatures needed.</p>

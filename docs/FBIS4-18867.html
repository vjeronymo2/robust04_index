			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael White report: "Poll Suggests Fatal Blow to Major </F> Regime"]    [Text] The Conservatives intensified their strident spring  election offensive yesterday in the face of growing evidence  that Labour and the Liberal Democrats are poised to inflict  potentially fatal humiliations on John Major's embattled regime.    While the Prime Minister endured a bumpy ride in Birmingham,  which the Tories see as their best hope of municipal victory on  May 5, a Mori poll for today's Times suggests that they could  win as few as eight seats in European elections a month later,  against 66 for Labour and 10 for the Liberal Democrats. Such an  outcome on June 9 might trigger a crisis of confidence that  could topple Mr Major.    But the Mori poll is highly tentative with even Labour  treating it with scepticism. "We cannot win 66 seats," said a  senior official.    On overall voting intentions, Mori places Labour at 48 per  cent, the Tories at 28, and the Lib Dems at 21.    Yesterday Mr Major and his cabinet lieutenants struggled to  make the local elections a referendum on their opponents,  municipal records, and tried to undo the offence caused in  Labour-controlled Birmingham by an abrasive Tory election  broadcast last week. After being accused of "throwing muck," at  the whole city, Mr Major felt obliged to explain "I'm not  bashing Brum [Birmingham]."    As Labour hammered away at this week's higher council tax  rates and joined the Liberal Democrats in urging voters to "cast  a verdict on the Prime Minister and his policies," Tory  headquarters reinforced its high-risk strategy of taking the war  into the enemy camp.    It dispatched Michael Portillo to trumpet the cost-cutting  achievements of Westminster council, the flagship authority  whose 245 pound Band D council tax is Britain's lowest and whose  housing policies are under financial investigation.    "It is no coincidence that the council which has produced  the  lowest council tax in the country is also the one which has led  the way in contracting out its services to the private sector,"  the Treasury's Chief Secretary declared as Westminster  councillors brushed aside questions about gerrymandering and  issued a 32-page manifesto.    Westminster, the symbol of Thatcherism in the 1990 local  elections, would go Labour for the first time on an unlikely 10  per cent swing. In a BBC Radio interview, Mr Portillo praised  the council's clean streets and smart estates. But Labour's  Frank Dobson said it was quite extraordinary that a minister  should identify with such a controversial regime whose  achievements rested on financial favouritism from Whitehall.    After a run of disastrous local election results, the Tory  strategy in 1994 is emerging as a rerun of their 1992 general  election campaign: to neutralise criticism by hurling similar  charges back at their critics. It points to a dirty contest.    The Times poll represents an aggregated analysis of voting  intentions among 11,841 adults interviewed between January and  March. The figures exclude undecided voters (7 per cent) and  those not planning to vote (9 per cent).</p>

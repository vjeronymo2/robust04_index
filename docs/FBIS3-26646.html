There are thousands of newspapers, tens of thousands of  magazines and journals, and hundreds of television and radio  stations in our country covering extensive areas, wielding great  influence, in touch with the masses every day, and swaying  people's minds and behavior. As "water can keep boats afloat as  well as sink them," correct guidance of public opinion can  cohere people's hearts, invigorate spirits, raise the fighting  spirit, and promote unity; while wrong guidance of public  opinion fwill confuse opinions, dissipate hearts and minds, sap  the fighting spirit, and result in the serious consequence of  political, economic, and social destabilization. Ours is a  country of 1.1 billion population and a party of 50 million  members in pursuit of a socialist market economic system to  achieve the unprecedented objective of the "three-step"  development strategy. The international situation which  confronts us is complicated and volatile and the domestic  situation contains radical differences. Given the  circumstances, it becomes much more important to insist on  correctly guiding public opinion; maintaining a stable, unified,  active, and lively political situation; and creating a good  social and opinion climate for the pursuit of reform and  construction by people throughout the whole country and the  party, under leadership and in an orderly fashion.    Both positive and negative experiences since the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee show us that  it is of vital importance to correctly exercise the functions of  media opinion, so far as leading people's thought and behavior  in the direction of pursuing socialism with Chinese  characteristics is concerned. Leading cadres of party  committees, propaganda departments, and press and publication  units at all levels must tackle the job of guiding public  opinion with a high sense of responsibility and must not take it  lightly.    Correctly guiding public opinion is ultimately and  fundamentally determined by successfully clinging firmly and  unwaveringly to the party's basic line and unifying the thinking  of the people of the whole party and country with it through  vigorous propaganda and ideological mobilization. We must  correctly grasp the situation amid the kaleidoscopic,  complicated, and confusing social phenomena; strengthen the  awareness of the whole situation; propagate practically and  graphically the party's line, principles, and policies, so that  people can understand, as quickly as possible, momentous party  and government reformist and opening up measures and transform  this understanding into voluntary actions; and, in this way,  mobilize and encourage as much as possible people to devote  themselves to the cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    This year will be most critical for deepening reforms and  promoting development and will see the unveiling of many  reformist measures for building a socialist market economic  system. The breadth, depth, intensity, and degree of difficulty  of reforms this year will be greater and harder than in any  previous year. This means that press and propaganda work must  be closely coordinated; investigations and studies of social  climate and trends in people's views must be strengthened;  personnel must keep themselves updated on the latest changes in  concepts of value, thoughts, moods, and mentality, so that they  can detect trends from small rumblings, deal with things in  advance, dissolve contradictions, straighten out grievances,  guide people with a clear-cut stand toward reforms and to  support and participate in reforms in order to ensure victory  for this year's initial battle of deepening reforms. They must  uphold materialistic dialectics, prevent partiality and  simplification, and properly handle relations between reforms  and development, those between reforms, development, and  stability; and those between the local and overall situations.  They must look out for the possibility that one trend may lie  hidden another, prevent rushing headlong into mass actions or  uniform and indiscriminate administrative measures, and the  situation where everyone jumps on the bandwagon. They must  concentrate their energy on showing the rapid progress of the  cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics;  enthusiastically eulogize people's shining achievements and  their noble character reflected in transforming the world and  creating a new life; review the situation and judge the times  well, and be good at providing guidance; take and present their  clear-cut position on significant issues concerning principles  and the entire situation, instead of being wishy washy about  them; promptly defuse sensitive and hot issues instead of  "hyping them up"; refrain from fruitless debate; determine the  "amount" of coverage and propaganda on issues of immediate  concern to the masses; explain and allay their doubts and  anxieties incisively; and be the voice of the people.    One of the important channels through which the people  exercise their democratic rights is the media reflection of  people's views and demands and the monitoring of party and  government organs and their workers. It helps make our  decisions scientific and improves our work. Strengthening the  media's watchdog role also represents the need to correctly  guide public opinion. The key to properly exercising the  media's watchdog role lies in critical reportage and the  reflection of the masses' opinions. The media must deal  seriously with their work, from selecting typical events, ways  and methods adopted, to timing. They must do everything with an  eye on promoting work, solving problems, enhancing unity,  maintaining stability, and boosting people's confidence in  pushing ahead.    In guiding public opinion, they must strictly observe  propaganda disciplines. Party newspapers, party journals, and  radio and television stations from central to local levels must  all actively propagate the party's beliefs and political outlook  and play a leading example. Meanwhile, they must be innovative,  encourage variety in their newspaper, radio, and television  broadcasting reporting styles with a view to forming a unique  style.    In short, guiding people with correct public opinion means  guiding people with public opinions that are conducive to  further deepening reform and opening up; creating a socialist  market economic system; developing socialism with Chinese  characteristics; strengthening socialist spiritual civilization  and socialist democratic and legal system; encouraging people to  work arduously and explore and innovate for national wealth and  strength, the people's happiness, and social progress; telling  truth from falsity, upholding truth, good, and beauty, and  resisting falsity, evil, and baseness; and helping the  unification of the country and national unity, political,  economic, and social stability. That way, we will definitely  guide, protect, and develop the energy of the people and various  circles; encourage and stimulate the people to be confident,  unified in mind and heart, to be mindful of the overall  situation, strive forward, tackle the key problems in this  year's deepening reforms, and score greater achievements in  economic development.</p>

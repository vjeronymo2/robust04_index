The finding, by researchers at St. Mary's hospital medical  school in London, challenges the view that prostitutes are a key  point from which the virus can spread into the heterosexual  population.    Researchers interviewed 280 women living in London who  attended a special women's clinic at the medical school. They  also interviewed women on prostitution charges at magistrates'  courts and women at a special drop-in centre and other places  where prostitutes are known to gather.    Dr. Sophie Day, senior research fellow at the school and a  member of the team, said most of the questionnaires were backed  up with blood or saliva tests to compare answers with HIV  infection rates.    Eighty percent of the women were white, 25 or 9 percent were  Afro-Caribbean and the rest were of mainly Asian or Middle  Eastern background. The tests disclosed that about 1 percent, or  just two women, had the virus which can cause AIDS. Both  reported a history of drug abuse involving injections.    Most of the women, aged between 14 and 51, claimed to be  using condoms in nearly all liaisons.</p>

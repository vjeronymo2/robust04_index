			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'IGNORANCE IS NO BLISS'  </P> <P> Your editorial suggests that teaching core cultural subjects should begin  before college. You are right, of course. However, you don't go far enough.  </P> <P> Children spend much more time watching TV than they do in school. We seem to  forget the lessons that the success of "Sesame Street" taught us. Very young  children love to learn from that program. Public broadcasting should be  adequately funded to operate without corporate support and without having to  beg for private donations. The amount of funding each station receives should  provide incentives based on educational success.  </P> <P> RICHARD FOY  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

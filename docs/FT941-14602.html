			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warranties fear Electrical retailers Dixons and Kingfisher fell heavily as the market took stock of implications of a potentially damaging official inquiry into extended warranties. It is the second official probe in a week to hit the two groups, and follows news that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the pricing of video games, one of the biggest selling items for the two companies. But stores analysts said this latest inquiry is more worrying in view of the proportion of profits made from extended warranties - guarantees sold with electrical appliances. If the issue is referred to the MMC, and it rules against the retailers, BZW estimates that Dixons' entire profits - forecast at around Pounds 75m for this year - could be wiped out. Dixons shares, hit badly two weeks ago by a profits warning, fell a further 16 to 212p in hefty turnover of 15m. Kingfisher, which owns the Comet chain, lost 16 1/2 at 706 1/2 p.</p>

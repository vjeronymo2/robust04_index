			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAIDERS JUGGLE SQUAD FOR KEY FINAL GAME OF REGULAR SEASON  </P> <P> The Raiders made a move today to bolster their special teams in advance of  Sunday's playoffs-deciding game against the New York Giants.  </P> <P> Backup safety Russell Carter is hobbled by a hamstring pull, so they placed him  on injured reserve.  </P> <P> To replace him on special teams, they waived, then re-signed backup wide  receiver Timmie Ware, who had been on injured reserve. Ware was ineligible for  activation unless he cleared waivers.  </P> <P> To fill Carter's role in the six-back defensive scheme on passing downs, they  will use 14-year veteran Mike Haynes, who has not played since November.  </P> <P> Additionally, the Raiders plan to start backup Steve Wright at left tackle in  place of Rory Graves, who has a sprained foot and turf toe. Graves has started  all 15 games for the Raiders this year, while Wright has been the primary  offensive line backup at three positions.  </P> <P> In recognition of the importance of the final game on any possible entrance  into the playoffs, the Raiders also have told backup quarterback Jay Schroeder  they might go to him for quick relief if starter Steve Beuerlein struggles.  </P> <P> "We won't start him, but I can't say he won't play," said Coach Art Shell.  "Steve Beuerlein is our starting quarterback, but we're going to do everything  we can to win this ball game."  </P> <P> Schroeder had a history of big cold-weather games when he was the Washington  starter in 1985-87, including a couple of big games against the Giants.  </P></p>

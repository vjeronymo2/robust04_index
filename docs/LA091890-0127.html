Jobs and his Next Inc. today will unveil a more powerful,  color-screen version of the Next computer as well as an entry-level, $5,000  model -- half the cost of the current machine. Software developers also are  expected to announce new applications programs for the Next. Jobs hopes the new  products will salvage his fledgling company, struggling from slow sales of its  initial model.  </P></p>

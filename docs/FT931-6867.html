			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell probe set for delay A COMMONS committee is today expected to announce that it is postponing part of its inquiry into the theft of funds from Maxwell company pension schemes after a clash with the Serious Fraud Office. At a private meeting last night the cross-party committee decided that the SFO's fears about possible prejudicing of criminal trials and the Commons' sub judice rules meant that they should not proceed with taking evidence from witnesses who may be called in trials. Their report will raise questions over the right of the Commons' select committees, set up in 1979, to conduct inquiries independently of the judiciary. The MPs are expected to call for a wider debate into the issue. The committee could still call for written evidence from witnesses, however, possibly in the form of answers to questions posed by the committee members. The replies could then be kept securely to prevent leaks. The MPs decided against taking oral evidence in private. Members of the committee are anxious to put pressure on the Serious Fraud Office to make sure it carries out its investigation speedily and efficiently - and that the committee's inquiries should not be delayed more than 18 months. Meanwhile, the committee is to continue with its inquiries into other matters arising from the Maxwell affair, including the immediate needs of pensioner victims and the regulatory framework in which pension funds operate. Trustees of pension funds and insolvency practitioners may be among those called to give evidence. The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, has had considerable success in persuading the government to consider pension reforms, and the companies and financial institutions involved into helping the Maxwell pensioners.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Open Letter to the Russian Federation President, adopted in </F> Kirov at a meeting of the Union of Cities of Northwest Russia,  carried under the headline: "Oh, the Governors Are Stern!"; date  of letter not given]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    In the past three-four months the heads of administration of  such big Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivistok and  Nizhniy Novgorod have been removed from office. The  circumstances of their removal were various, but in every case  it took place under pressure from the oblast governor. A  standard set of accusations was made against practically every  one of them: attacks on the oblast administration, the collapse  of Russian statehood, links with the opponents of reform,  corruption, a one-time flagrant violation of job duties, etc.    The same sort of situation is emerging today in a number of  other cities.    We are very much concerned by the fact that the people  leaving their work are honest, decent people who are deeply  concerned over the interests of their cities and have actively  defended the rights of local government established by the  Russian Constitution and guaranteed by your edicts.    The main thing is that the dismissals were not preceded by  objective checkups on the work of the heads of city  administrations, they received no written explanations, the  grounds for their removal were not examined in any commissions,  and some of them were denied the right to the personal meeting  with the Russian president that is guaranteed by your edicts.    Today most governors are doing everything they can to  subordinate local government to themselves, which is directly  contrary with Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Russian  Constitution. Those who resist this are either dismissed or  leave on their own accord.    One gets the impression that local government is a fiction  and is not needed by the federal authorities, although we are  convinced that local government is, in an objective sense, an  ally of the Russian president and the central authorities in the  political and economic reform of our country and protection of  the public's interests.    Esteemed president! We propose that you:    1. Take local government under your protection and  guardianship.    2. Meet with the representatives of the unions and  associations of Russia's cities.    3. Speed up the drafting of normative acts delimiting the  jurisdiction of the bodies of state authority of the  Federation's components, on the one hand, and of local  government, on the other.    4. When heads of administration are removed from office,  schedule elections for heads of local government with  multiple-candidates.    5. On the basis of petitions by heads of administration who  have been removed from office, carry out checkups and publish  their results.    Adopted at a meeting of the Union of Cities of  Northwest Russia in Kirov.  <H8>  From the Editors </H8>   V. Pyshkin, executive director of the Union of Cities of  Northwest Russia, asked us to publish this letter to the RF  president. In satisfying his request, we refrain from any  commentary on the positions of the letter's authors and their  assessment of the cases of the removal of the heads of  administration of big Russian cities, which really have become  more frequent. Here it is necessary, as the saying goes, to look  into each specific case. We would like only to recall the  article of the Constitution that is cited by the participants in  the meeting of the cities of Northwest Russia: "... Local  government is autonomous within the limits of its powers. Bodies  of local government do not belong to the system of bodies of  state authority." And while it is in the embryonic stage, as it  were, it would probably make a lot of sense for the president to  take it "under his protection and guardianship.</p>

Lambeck report: "Bonn Considering Involvement"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government is considering ways  to become involved in the peace process in Bosnia. Although the  Chancellor's Office denied reports that it was planning to send  Bundeswehr medical staff and pioneers to Mostar, Chancellor Kohl  said that for Bosnia one would "go to the bounds of possibility."    The Chancellor expressly promised logistic help for the NATO  countries involved in the peacekeeping operations, if this is  required. This would involve air lifts and logistic measures in  Italy and the Adriatic.    In Bosnia itself, civilian relief organizations might become  active. Together with the idea of having Mostar, besieged by  the Croats, administrated by a German, plans have been published  that Bundeswehr medical officers are to put the local hospital  in order and German pioneers are to repair roads and bridges.    On these allegations, the Chancellor's Office says: "We do  not have any such plans." The prompt denial has a good reason:  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and government experts are afraid  of a Serbian hunt for German helpers in Bosnia. "Only officials  at conference tables could plan something like that," the  Chancellor's Office said -- a discreet dig at the Foreign  Ministry.    After all, the Defense Ministry also has a plan for German  soldiers to be made available in the former Yugoslavia: Once  the peace process is finally under way and no more shots are  fired in Bosnia, Volker Ruehe might consider establishing a  field hospital in Croatia where the injured could be treated and  UN peacekeeping troops supplied.</p>

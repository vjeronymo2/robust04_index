			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- According to Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, with the election of Roman Herzog, Germany has chosen a  "good federal president." Following Herzog's election, Kohl  said on ZDF [Second German Television] that Herzog, as a man who  believes in a state based on the rule of law, will be able to  fulfill his duties well. Kohl stressed he was completely  convinced that the Free Democratic Party [FDP] would also vote  for Herzog in the end. The FDP made a decision which is also  important for the future. He saw the election of Herzog as a  "good omen" for the outcome of the Bundestag elections.</p>

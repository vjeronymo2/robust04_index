			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Feng Yingbing (7458 3841 0393): "The </F> Positive and Negative Sides of Cultural Market Development"]    [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- People have begun to  pay closer attention to China's cultural market, which has  experienced great development propelled by the great tide of  reform and opening up.    Strictly speaking, the expression cultural market can be  defined in a broad as well as a narrow sense. In a broad sense,  cultural market refers to the performing arts, cinema, painting,  audio-visual products, entertainment, books, newspapers, and  magazines. In a narrow sense, cultural market mainly refers to  books, newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, and  entertainment. At present, the narrow-sense cultural market has  been the subject of discussions by an increasing number of  people because of the existence of many salient problems related  to books and other publications, audio-visual products, and  entertainment.    China's cultural market has enjoyed rapid and full-bloom  development over the last decade. The cultural market as a  whole is brisk, orderly, healthy, and thriving. An expert in  the area of culture summed up the Chinese cultural market at  present in the following manner. He said a brisk, orderly,  healthy, and thriving cultural market broadens investment  opportunities. A pattern marked by state, collective,  individual, and foreign investment has begun to take shape in  China. A consumption structure that is rich and varied in form  and conditions not only greatly enriches urban and rural  citizens' cultural lives, satisfies the masses' different  cultural tastes and demands, but also promotes the further  development of cultural undertakings. In conclusion, he said a  booming cultural market helps culture to play its aesthetic,  educational, and cognitive functions, as well as create a very  flexible environment for economic construction.    However, one should also see to the serious loss of balance  that is plaguing the cultural market. The loss of balance can  be seen in the following areas. The regional imbalance involves  a large gap which is developing between economically-developed  and undeveloped regions and between urban and rural areas. The  lack of balance in overall arrangements involves performance  market shortages and oversupply on the entertainment market.  The lack of balance in the quality of performance is  characterized by a reversal of the pyramid of first, second, and  third-rate performances and by a situation wherein entertainment  spots for the general public have turned into the preserve of a  few. The loss of balance in cultural content is characterized  by the predominance of outside over indigenous culture.  Although the aforementioned phenomena are still developing, we  need to pay close attention to them and correct them through  working out quick macro-control measures.    Particularly worth pointing out is the negative side of the  cultural market. People in some localities are engaged in the  illegal production and marketing of pornographic books,  newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, of providing sex  services on the entertainment market, and of using video-game  machines for gambling purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to  adopt a more forceful and effective measure to thoroughly  cleanse these negative phenomena from the cultural market.    Of course, it is not right to close the windows just because  a few flies have flown into the room. The proper thing to do is  to install screens on the windows to prevent the flies from  coming into the room and to build a tight management network.  Relevant departments have done a lot of work in this regard and  they are now working toward the goal of establishing a rational  cultural structure and of improving cultural laws and  regulations. As the adoption of the abovementioned measures are  far from enough, we need to adopt further measures to plug all  the loopholes. What is needed most now is to energetically and  strictly enforce the law and to deal with the "flies" without  mercy. While going all out to "cleanse" the cultural market, we  should also devote great efforts to promote the culture, to help  create conditions for great works that eulogize the main trend  of the times, as well as to use creative works that are popular  with the masses to throw away dirty mud, to cleanse muddied  water, and to occupy the high ground of the cultural market.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: City gloomy on fallout from political turmoil The City reacted positively to yesterday's base rate rise, with most analysts agreeing that there were good reasons for the increase on economic, rather than political, grounds. Yet many traders took a gloomy view of the turmoil engulfing the government, fearing that continued political uncertainty could command a higher risk premium on UK assets. Most economists had been predicting an imminent rate increase, but they were divided on whether it would occur in December or January. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, said: 'The chancellor's decision to raise base rates immediately following the government's Commons defeat is wholly justified by economic conditions.' Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'The economic case for a rise in rates is compelling. The economy is growing at well above its sustainable rate, and inflationary pressures are increasing.' Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'I don't think anyone can quibble with the basic view that a base rate rise was justified.' But Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said that, in the approach to Christmas, 'the impact on consumer confidence of a base rate rise may be quite severe. If you really do think the retail sector is weak, this could deal it a pretty serious blow'. While the base rate news was welcome, and helped the pound and gilts to rally, the government's Commons defeat over value added tax had a more sobering effect. A City professional said: 'The headlines this will generate internationally will emphasise the degree of political risk surrounding UK assets and probably deter some overseas investors from investing in them. In recent months the markets have become highly sensitised to political risk - for instance in countries like Italy, Sweden or France - and in terms of risk candidates, the last 24 hours have pushed the UK up the league table.' One dealer said he had received a string of phone calls in recent weeks from US investors worried about the political outlook in the UK. He said: 'They see politics as a real risk.' Another said that in coming months UK financial markets would be caught between two opposing forces, Britain's healthy economic fundamentals and the fragile political situation. He said: 'Politics will be a negative influence on the markets for the remainder of this government's life. In the battle between politics and economics, the latter will probably win - but the pendulum will swing back and forth between the two, leaving the markets vulnerable.' Another dealer said: 'The markets are quite content with how the government is managing the economy in the short term. Of more concern is the longer term and how long the government can go on like this, stumbling from one crisis to another.' He added: 'The erosion of power that has been seen over the last few months may mean that the government will become so weak that it will begin to make concessions to different interest groups. This may mean greater spending and wage inflation.' A pessimistic UK equity dealer said: 'I don't think this government will even make it to April 1997. As it is, the Conservatives have a very small majority, and if they lose another few by-elections that majority could get squeezed further.' But, he said, after 15 years of Tory rule, most market participants could not overcome the psychological barrier of contemplating a Labour government. He added: 'The majority of the market still believes the Conservatives can't lose the next election, but I think there's a good chance they might.'</p>

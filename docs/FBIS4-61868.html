			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- The State Duma has refused a move  by deputy Sergey Baburin to call into question the conduct of  State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin over his signing of the Treaty on  Social Accord. At today's Duma plenary session, Sergey Baburin  proposed adding to the agenda Ivan Rybkin's performance as  chairman, but he failed to attract the necessary number of votes.    In a brief speech from the floor, Sergey Baburin told his  fellow deputies that the Duma chairman's act of signing the  Treaty on Social Accord represents a distortion of the chamber's  opinion.</p>

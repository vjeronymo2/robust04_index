			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Pakistan bombs leave 24 dead PAKISTANI security forces in the southern province of Sindh were last night investigating two bomb blasts in the city of Hyderabad, north of Karachi, which left 24 people dead and at least 60 injured. The blasts are seen as a setback to the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif in its efforts to restore order in Sindh, whose capital, Karachi, is Pakistan's commercial centre. The government sent troops to the province last summer, after a crime wave shattered business confidence. Since then there has been a marked improvement in security. Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, Sindh's chief minister, said the blasts were 'meant to sabotage efforts by the federal and provincial governments to restore peace'. He did not attribute responsibility for the blasts.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Why you should take asthma seriously Do you suspect you have asthma? If you experience shortness of breath or persistent coughing or wheezing, the first thing is to seek medical advice on begining diagnostic tests. If your doctor has eliminated other potential reasons for the symptoms - for example heart and vascular causes, lung disease or bronchial obstruction - and has said you have asthma, the diagnosis should be taken seriously. The condition, which is caused by mucus build-up, bronchospasm and inflammation, is potentially life-threatening. You need not forego an active lifestyle just because of asthma, as many top-flight athletes with asthmatic conditions have demonstrated. With care, you should be able to enjoy normal sleep and normal activity. If your asthma is related to exercise, Professor Bryant Stamford, writing in the journal, The Physician and Sportsmedecine, offers some sound advice: exercise in warm humidified air (such as swimming pools); breathe through your nose; control breathing to avoid hyperventilation; and follow daily and pre-exercise prescriptions as laid down by your doctor. Find out what exactly is triggering your attacks. While respiratory infections are among the most common causes of asthma attacks, allergens may include: ambient smoke and dust, mold, cold dry air, perfumes, certain food ingredients, enzymes in household cleaners, environmental pollution and pollen. Working closely with your doctor, controlling the necessary environmental conditions and learning as much as possible about your condition will enable you and your family to expect a full and active life.

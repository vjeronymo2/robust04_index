Narasimha Rao and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, to further intensify  their bilateral, cooperative interaction for mutual benefit. The  five MOUs related to joint ventures under private sector,  investments, railway construction, telecommunications, rubber  industry, professional education and airconditioning industry  and the agreement related to technical cooperation.    Earlier in the day, the two Prime Ministers had a 40-minute  exchange of views agreed and underlined the need for cooperation  among developing countries in the context of the recent G-15 (at  all levels) meetings to consult together with a view to find  ways to fulfil their aspirations.    Such cooperation, Mr Rao pointed out, was of great  importance  in a changing world which often had the habit of marginalising  developing countries. He also welcomed the close interaction  with countries like Malaysia.    Agreeing with Mr. Rao, the Malaysian Prime Minister stated  that in a world situation like the current one it was important  that countries like India and Malaysia should consult each other  regularly. They should exchange views on the developments in  their region, he added.    Both the leaders emphasised the need to develop bilateral  political and economic cooperation.    Dr. Mahathir Mohamed wanted that specific areas to be  identified for infrastructural requirements and cooperation.    Both leaders noted that India and Malaysia were countries  with strong historical and cultural background. Such countries  had their own ways of looking at things, based on their own  ethos and some times their national genius could provide  solutions to present day problems more effectively rather than  simply trying to graft solutions from the developed world.    This one-to-one meet was followed by a full delegation level  meet where the two Prime Ministers led their respective teams,  Indian delegation included, apart from senior officials, the  External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, the Commerce  Minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee and the Minister of State, Mr  Buvanesh Chaturvedi.    The Malaysian Prime Minister was assisted by his Foreign  Minister and a high level team of officials.    Mr Rao said there had been satisfactory and comprehensive  discussions at the recent G-15 meetings of the personal  representatives and Foreign Ministers. It was necessary to  follow up bilaterally to see that the outcome is not neglected  through a lack of high level attention. He also pointed out that  the present bilateral relations between India and Malaysia is an  example of how countries could keep in very close touch to  further their cooperation.    Dr Mahathir Mohamed agreed with these views and said that  Malaysia had the same perception and concerns.    Mr Rao said that in South Asian region's SAARC [South Asian  Association for Regional Cooperation] had made a slow but steady  progress. "It has come of age," he added. He made inquiries  about the ASEAN.    Malaysian Prime Minister mentioned that though the G-15  summit had to be postponed, he said, he was happy to be in India  as his country attached great importance to its relationship  with India.</p>

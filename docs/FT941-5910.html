			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Seoul suspends military exercise South Korea yesterday announced a conditional suspension of its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US in response to North Korea's acceptance of international nuclear inspections. Team Spirit, which has taken place almost annually since 1976 in South Korea, will not be held this year if the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections of the North's seven declared nuclear facilities prove satisfactory. In Washington, the administration said it would resume high-level talks with North Korea following the arrival of experts in Pyongyang to begin nuclear site inspections. 'The talks will aim at a thorough and broad resolution of the nuclear and other issues that separate North Korea from the US and the rest of the international community,' Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said. Team Spirit has been a bone of contention with North Korea, which has criticised the exercise as a preparation for an attack by the US. Last week in New York, North Korea agreed to allow the long-sought IAEA inspections to go ahead and to resume the North-South dialogue. In Vienna, IAEA officials said yesterday they had carried out inspections at nuclear sites at Yongbyon, 90 miles north of Pyongyang. The US has also asked Pyongyang to agree to an exchange of presidential envoys with South Korea to discuss the nuclear problem and other inter-Korean issues. The two Koreas yesterday had a working-level meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom to prepare for the proposed exchange this month. It was the first inter-Korean contact since October. The negotiations are expected to focus on possible US diplomatic recognition and economic aid. But North Korea tabled new conditions for the envoy exchange, raising doubts whether the deal to resolve suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear programme will proceed smoothly. The North demanded that the proposed deployment of US Patriot missiles in South Korea be stopped and that South Korea's President Kim Young-sam apologise for remarks last year criticising Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader.</p>

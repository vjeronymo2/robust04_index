			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the category-specific section of the guideline, existing categories were modified, new categories were added, and many infections were reassigned to different categories. The old category of Blood Precautions, primarily directed toward patients with chronic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), was renamed Blood and Body Fluid Precautions and expanded to include (1) patients with AIDS and (2) body fluids other than blood. The old category of Protective Isolation was deleted because of studies demonstrating its lack of efficacy in general clinical practice in preventing the acquisition of infection by the immunocompromised patient for whom it had originally been described. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11&hyph;12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The 1983 guideline contained the following categories of isolation: Strict Isolation, Contact Isolation, Respiratory Isolation, Tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) Isolation, Enteric Precautions, Drainage/Secretion Precautions, and Blood and Body Fluid Precautions. As with the category approach in the former CDC isolation manuals, these categories tended to over-isolate some patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the disease-specific section of the guideline, the epidemiology of each infectious disease was considered individually by advocating only those precautions (e.g., private room, mask, gown, and gloves) needed to interrupt transmission of the infection. In place of the categories and signs of the category-specific approach, a chart listed all diseases posing the threat of in-hospital transmission with checks in columns indicating which precautions were required for each. Because precautions were individualized for each disease, hospitals using the system were encouraged to provide more initial training and in-service education and to encourage a much higher level of attention from patient-care personnel. Although disease-specific isolation precautions eliminated ``over-isolation,'' personnel might be prone to mistakes in applying the precautions, especially if the disease was not regularly seen in the hospital, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9&hyph;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  if there was a delay in diagnosis, or if there was a misdiagnosis. Placing disease-specific isolation precautions in a hospital computerized information system resulted in more accurate use of the system.13 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since gaps existed in the knowledge of the epidemiology of some diseases, disagreement was expected, and occurred, regarding the placement of individual diseases within given categories, especially diseases with a respiratory component of transmission.14 Placing measles in Respiratory Isolation (designed to prevent transmission of large-particle droplets) rather than in a category that had provisions for preventing transmission by airborne droplet nuclei and placing rubella and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Contact Isolation were controversial.15 There was also disagreement about the lack of a recommendation for adult patients with influenza, the need for a private room for pediatric patients with RSV infections, and the length of time that precautions should be maintained.15 The lack of empiric studies on the efficacy and costs of implementing the recommendations contributed to the disagreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As new epidemiologic data became available, several subsequent CDC reports <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16&hyph;18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  updated portions of the isolation guideline. Updated recommendations for management of patients with suspected hemorrhagic fever were published in 1988.16 The recommendation for Respiratory Isolation for acute erythema infectiosum was superseded by a 1989 report that recommended Respiratory Isolation for human parvovirus B19 (the causative agent for erythema infectiosum) only when infected patients were in transient aplastic crisis or had immunodeficiency and chronic human parvovirus B19 infection.17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations for Tuberculosis (AFB) Isolation were updated in 199018 because of heightened concern about nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19&hyph;20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  particularly in settings where persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were receiving care. The 1990 tuberculosis guidelines emphasized (1) placing a hospital patient with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis in a private room that has lower, or negative, air pressure compared with surrounding areas, (2) reducing mycobacterial contamination of air by dilution and removal of airborne contaminants, and (3) wearing particulate respirators, rather than standard surgical masks, when hospital personnel shared air space with an infectious tuberculosis patient. Subsequent recommendations reemphasized the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.21 In 1993, a second edition of the guidelines for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis in health care facilities was published in draft for public comment.22 After review of written comments, the guidelines were modified and published.23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Universal Precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1985, largely because of the HIV epidemic, isolation practices in the United States were dramatically altered by the introduction of a new strategy for isolation precautions, which became known as Universal Precautions (UP). Following the initial reports of hospital personnel becoming infected with HIV through needlesticks and skin contamination with patients' blood, a widespread outcry created the urgent need for new isolation strategies to protect hospital personnel from bloodborne infections. The subsequent modification of isolation precautions in some hospitals produced several major strategic changes and sacrificed some measures of protection against patient-to-patient transmission in the process of adding protection against patient-to-personnel transmission. In acknowledgment of the fact that many patients with bloodborne infections are not recognized, the new UP approach placed emphasis for the first time to applying Blood and Body Fluid Precautions universally to all persons regardless of their presumed infection status.24 Until this time, most patients placed on isolation precautions were those for whom a diagnosis of an infectious disease had been made or was suspected. This provision led to the new name of Universal Precautions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to emphasizing prevention of needlestick injuries and the use of traditional barriers such as gloves and gowns, UP expanded Blood and Body Fluid Precautions to include use of masks and eye-coverings to prevent mucous membrane exposures during certain procedures and the use of individual ventilation devices when the need for resuscitation was predictable. This approach, and particularly the techniques for preventing mucous membrane exposures, was reemphasized in subsequent CDC reports that contained recommendations for prevention of HIV transmission in health care settings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25&hyph;28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1987, one of these reports27 stated that implementation of UP for all patients eliminated the need for the isolation category of Blood and Body Fluid Precautions for patients known or suspected to be infected with bloodborne pathogens; however, the report stated that other category- or disease-specific isolation precautions recommended in the CDC isolation guideline4 should be used as necessary if infections other than bloodborne infections were diagnosed or suspected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1987 report was updated by a 1988 report28 that emphasized two important points: (1) blood was the single most important source of HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens in the occupational setting, and (2) infection control efforts for preventing transmission of bloodborne pathogens in health care settings must focus on preventing exposures to blood as well as on delivery of HBV immunization. The report stated that UP applied to blood, body fluids that had been implicated in the transmission of bloodborne infections (semen and vaginal secretions), body fluids from which the risk of transmission was unknown (amniotic, cerebrospinal, pericardial, peritoneal, pleural, and synovial fluids), and to any other body fluid visibly contaminated with blood, but not to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomitus unless they contained visible blood. Although HIV and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) had been found in some of the fluids, secretions, or excretions to which UP did not apply, epidemiologic studies in the health care and community setting had not implicated these substances in the transmission of HIV and HBV infections. However, the report noted that some of the fluids, secretions, and excretions not covered under UP represented a potential source for nosocomial and community-acquired infections with other pathogens and referred readers to the CDC isolation guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Body Substance Isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

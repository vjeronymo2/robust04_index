			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Rondan] </F>   [Text] Mercedes -- General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in  chief, held a news conference here. Asked about the Army  position if the Broad Front won the election, he said: Uruguay  "will have absolutely clear elections and the winner will be  able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes  without any type of limitations."    Gen. Garcia was born and attended school in Dolores, Soriano  Department. A son, his grandchildren, and his parents still live  here. He is visiting Mercedes with General Staff Chief General  Juan A. Lezama; General Juan Curuchet, 2d Army Division  commander; and Colonel Carlos Silva, 2d Infantry Brigade  commander. He is on a routine tour of the area.    During a news conference, the Army commander in chief talked  about many issues, including military personnel salaries and  peace missions abroad.    Asked about the draft bill presented by the executive branch  in Congress that will allow the Armed Forces to eventually  participate in public security activities, Garcia said: "It is  an issue that will demand the attention of legislators. They  consider it a national priority."    Regarding the possibility of sending Uruguayan soldiers to  other countries, Garcia said: "In the case of Georgia, so far we  only have a request to say whether Uruguay would be willing to  participate with a battalion in a peace mission in that country.  The government authorized an answer saying that if our  participation is requested, we would acquiesce. But the United  Nations still has not decided whether it will intervene in  Georgia. The only UN personnel there are observers."    Regarding the situation of military personnel salaries,  Garcia said there has always been a great distance between needs  and possibilities, adding, however, that the last budget  contemplated a substantial improvement of military salaries,  "the most important increase since 1985." The country's economic  situation does not permit better salaries, which would be  desirable, Garcia said. The commander believes the increase has  brought salary levels closer to actual needs.    Asked about President Luis Alberto Lacalle's remarks that he  had to deal with the internal military crisis alone, Garcia  said: "That is a political problem and I think the person who  can best answer your question is the president himself. I am not  the right person to judge the president's remarks. We have  always tried to serve the institution and the country as best as  we could from the Army command as well as from all our previous  positions."    The Batlleist Forum [Colorado Party faction] is opposed to  the designation of General Mario Aguerrondo as military attache  to the United States. Gen. Garcia said: "It is a political  expression. I do not think it is quite like that, but it is  within the rules of the game. Gen. Aguerrondo is fulfilling a  service mission. He was appointed by the executive branch. There  are no legal problems. There might be objections from a  political point of view. But they do not belong to the commander  in chief's sphere of action. It is beyond his responsibilities."    Regarding the so-called "Berrios case" [Chilean security  agent Eugenio Berrios kidnapped in Uruguay in 1993], Garcia said  the Army finished its own investigation of the case. "The  Berrios case is now being handled by the courts. All individuals  involved testified. So far no one has been indicted. This is a  good indication because it means the court has not found enough  evidence to try anyone. I hope the case will be definitively  closed, at this level, in the near future."    Asked about the possible consequences if the Broad Front won  the elections, the Army commander in chief said: "I hope our  country will have absolutely clean elections and the winner will  be able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes  without any type of limitations. That is my hope and that is  what I expect it will happen."</p>

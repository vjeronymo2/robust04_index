			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gifts from income My 80-year-old widowed mother has an estate which will be liable to inheritance tax, which we are seeking to reduce. Advantage is already being taken of the annual gifts allowance but we would welcome clarification of the gifts from income arrangements. She has a building society account to which interest has been accruing for at least 18 months untouched. What is the situation if this was paid monthly into an account held by my sister and myself (we are her beneficiaries). For tax purposes, would these monthly payments be treated as income for my sister and myself? To take advantage of the gifts out of income exemption, the amount being gifted must be made regularly out of income and must not result in a drop in the donor's standard of living. I understand your mother has enough income after tax to meet her normal needs without touching the interest you mention. Therefore, it would be possible for the interest to be credited to her account and then immediately transferred into an account for yourself and your sister. The income would still be taxable upon your mother but I assume that she is a basic-rate taxpayer. Thus, the interest is paid after deduction of basic-rate tax so that no more is payable. The regular payments from the building society account to the account for yourself and your sister would be gifts out of income and you would not have to pay further tax.

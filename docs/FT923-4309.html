			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Electoral jostling likely to distract US legislators THE US Congress reconvenes in Washington today for a final session that is likely to see more jockeying for political position than efforts to enact legislation. With a fiercely fought presidential election entering its closing stages - a last flurry of campaigning traditionally launched during yesterday's Labor Day holiday - the tussle between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican President George Bush has already assumed a central role in the contest. Mr Bush yesterday continued his campaign attack on the 'gridlocked Democratic Congress', which he blames for not passing his legislative proposals. The topics on which he and Congress are likely to clash in the next few weeks include the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which some leading Democrats fear could cost US jobs; the mismanagement of federal disaster relief to Florida and Louisiana in the wake of last month's Hurricane Andrew; and a bill to guarantee the same rights to choose an abortion as are currently protected by the Supreme Court's Roe vs Wade decision. In his battle against Congress, Mr Bush has sought to don the mantle of President Harry Truman, whose come-from-behind victory in 1948, with a campaign against the 'do-nothing Congress', has become his favourite reference. But Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate who in recent opinion polls leads the incumbent president by a margin of between 6 and 15 percentage points, yesterday hit back with a visit to President Truman's hometown of Independence, Missouri. The visit was designed to remind voters that Mr Truman was a Democrat and that the Congress he railed against was controlled by Republicans. Dream teams, Page 22</p>

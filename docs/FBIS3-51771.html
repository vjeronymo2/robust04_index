			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by J.M.C.: "No Way Out"] </F>   [Text] The recent promotion of Armed Forces officers close  to General [Nicolas de Bari] Hermoza and Vladimiro Montesinos is  proof of what everyone has been saying for the past few weeks:  President Fujimori is being threatened by the military  leadership and the SIN [National Intelligence Service]. The  political autonomy Fujimori enjoyed until just before the  referendum has been curtailed.    The truth is that Gen. Hermoza has positioned himself in the  government and together with Vladimiro Montesinos, presidential  adviser for intelligence affairs, is making decisions about the  country's Armed Forces from the top of the pyramid. The two have  decided that the three general commanders -- from the Army  (Hermoza himself), the Navy, and Air Force -- cannot be removed  from their posts. The police director also was included in this  decision.    This decision has deeply irritated officers in each military  branch because it bars the normal development of officers'  professional careers and their promotion to the highest military  positions. It is well known that within military circles there  is a principle called "the cart principle" by which those in  higher positions drag behind them those they trust. It seems  that the commanders now want this cart to remain still without  changing wheels annually, as occurred in the past.    The generals who were approaching the post of commander or  chief of the various military institutions today are considered  dangerous. For this reason, they have been assigned duties  abroad or placed in posts called "bones" because they are not  operational or trusted administrative posts (defense minister,  CCFFAA [Joint Command of the Armed Forces], and CAEM [Advanced  Military Studies Center]).    "The manipulation" still continues within the Army because  Gen. Hermoza's command had been planning to replace some  important division generals by sending them into retirement,  among them General Valdivia (currently a military attache in  far-away Ukraine). This high-ranking officer has been strongly  criticized for his performance as military-political chief in  Ayacucho, but he enjoys sound prestige within the Army,  especially in the promotion of Vladimiro Montesinos, whom he  instructed.    The plan to send more than 10 division generals into  retirement had to be ruled out, at least until the middle of the  year, because it might have caused too many problems within the  Army. The situation of General Robles has caused sufficient  problems. According to military sources, Robles might report to  the nation another irregular military operation in the central  region. We should not forget that Robles was the Army's  third-in-command before they tried to get rid of him by sending  him abroad; in his post he handled a large volume of secret  information.    Another hot issue is the case of General Salinas Sedo, who  is  the best candidate according to many people. It will be  possible to close ranks behind him in case of a possible attempt  to reelect President Fujimori. Many people have demanded his  release through presidential pardon, but so far there are no  indications this will happen. The risk is that if he stays in  jail, an adverse process might emerge in the middle of the  elections because political parties might decide to abstain on  the grounds that elections are not free because a citizen who  might be the winner is imprisoned.    This is how things are in our Army. There is still another  issue: Ten division generals have just been promoted, and  irregularities have continued because among the promoted  generals is Guido Guevara Guerra, who is a brigade general in  the Army Legal Service and may not -- by law -- be promoted to  division general, because his rank has been adjusted. However,  now he is a division general.    Do you know why? Guevara was designated president of the  Military Court Supreme Council because he is the top-ranking  general (division general), and considering that the other  council members will never reach that rank, he will always be  (at least until July 1995) the council president. Last week he  announced a life imprisonment penalty for four Chileans on "high  treason" charges. Can a Chilean commit "high treason" against  the fatherland, that is, against Peru, which is not his  fatherland? We will comment on this penalty later.</p>

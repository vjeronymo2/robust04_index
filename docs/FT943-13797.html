			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Reform and a new union The results of the elections in Ukraine and Belarus, where broadly pro-Russian politicians were elected to the presidencies of both countries, pose more sharply than before a choice for Russia: should it seek to capitalise on the new presidents' preferences for integration of their economies into Russia? Or continue to treat them as separate countries? The temptation of the first way is large. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is continually under fire for destroying the Soviet Union. To bring Ukraine and Belarus back within the Russian fold would, at a stroke, give half of the expatriated Russians a 'home' again. It would, in short, be a marvellous diplomatic coup. Most Russians believe, in any case, that these countries cannot construct their own statehoods. Belarus has evidently failed. The politicians who stood for a (mildly) independent and democratic path for the state gathered little more than 20 per cent of the votes in the presidential elections: the front runners were those who offered a variant of national abnegation. In his first appearance, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarus president-elect, went out of his way to stress his country's dependence on - almost prostration before - Russia. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new Ukrainian president, has given significantly different signals. He revealed, for example, that his first meeting was with the US ambassador rather than the Russian. He does not wish to introduce a separate currency, neither will he neuter the central bank, nor welcome back Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Though he won on a pro-Russian ticket, his role may be to disappoint his supporters - by making them face up to the hard fact that, once the Soviet Union has been pulled asunder, it is very hard to reassemble it without the help of the Communist party, Gosplan and the KGB Mr Kuchma knows, and Mr Lukashenko will discover, that the arguments against a tripartite Slav Union are strong - especially for Russia, which would be landed with two of the largest industrial restructuring problems in the world, beside its own. Belarus, especially, believes that once back in the Russian fold it would be taken care of as before: but those days have gone. No Russian government can afford such a burden. It is conceiv able that Belarus would assent to become a north-western province of Russia again. But it would still be subjecting its industries to the colder winds of Russian reform, which is far in advance of its own. Ukraine will not accept a similar status. And it would, in any case, have to face the reforms it has avoided for three years. There is much that can and should be done on tariffs, customs and payment arrangements. But these are as much part of the needed market reforms in each country as the subject of special treaties. A union cannot be viewed as a substitute for reform, either for Russia, or for the other two. Once that is realised, much of the enthusiasm for it may also vanish.</p>

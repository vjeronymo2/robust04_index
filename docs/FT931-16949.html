			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Long-term savings in danger of tax discrimination within EC Sir, Although the EC single market has now arrived and regulatory barriers to trade in financial services between member states have disappeared, it seems that trade in long-term retail savings will continue to be restricted by discriminatory tax. Thus the benefits of the single market will not extend to the long-term savings of the Community's households. Long-term savings are a big part of the financial services sector. It has been estimated that there may be Ecu700bn of assets in the balance sheets of pension funds within the EC, and a further Ecu850bn in the funds of life assurance companies. According to the Cecchini Report, about one third of benefits arising from the single market were expected to come from the liberalisation of financial services. When the single market was launched in 1986 the retail savings industry was tightly enclosed within each state's own markets. In rare cases where cross-border trade was not explicitly prohibited by statute or by exchange control, it was ruled out by discriminatory tax provisions. For example, in the UK the benefits of long-term savings contracts issued to UK residents by non-resident insurance companies are more heavily taxed than are the benefits of similar policies issued by UK insurance companies. Most member states of the Community have similar discriminatory taxation. While differences in tax rates between countries do not create barriers to trade, discriminatory rates do. Yet, while the single market programme has removed regulatory barriers, nothing has been done to tackle the continuing existence of the discriminatory tax barriers to trade in long-term retail savings. Indeed, a European Court decision in February (Bachmann decision) appears to uphold the right of member states to discriminate against foreign savings contracts. Worse, an amendment to the Treaty of Rome - article 73D - introduced at Maastricht appears further to legitimise such discrimination. Unless the Council of Ministers is prepared to act, the Community will be seen to have failed to complete an important part of the single market programme. Such a failure will not be marginal: it was precisely from the liberalisation of the long-term retail savings sector that a large part of the benefit of the single market was expected to arise.

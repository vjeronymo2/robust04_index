			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock ahead to record Pounds 5.1m at operating level RECORD OPERATING profits of Pounds 5.1m for the year to September 25 were announced yesterday by Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer which is coming to the market next month. Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the results justified the group's 'belief that flotation is the right option for Hozelock.' The profits, 34 per cent ahead of last time's Pounds 3.8m, were struck on turnover of Pounds 32.3m, up 18 per cent. After net interest payable of Pounds 1.3m, profits after tax were Pounds 2.45m, giving earnings per share of 12.7p. According to the pathfinder prospectus, the flotation will be 50 per cent placed and 50 per cent offered through intermediaries. The group is expected to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 50m, and net proceeds of Pounds 18m after expenses. Mr Codling said Pounds 5.4m of the money would be used to redeem existing preference shares, and Pounds 8.5m would repay bank and shareholder loans. The remainder would be added to working capital. Hozelock, founded in 1959, underwent a Pounds 24m management buy-out from Ropner in 1990. It has more than 300 products, including watering and spraying equipment, pond equipment, garden lighting and outdoor driers. The group is now 14 per cent owned by just over 20 managers, and 86 per cent owned by institutions. Mr Codling said the institutions and management would be holding on to the majority of their shares, and would hold about 50 per cent of the company after the flotation. Since the buy-out Hozelock has introduced 100 new products, and now claims 66 per cent of the UK garden watering market - five times ahead of its nearest competitor. Mr Codling said Hozelock, which has 40 per cent of the total UK market in its sectors, saw opportunities for expansion in Europe, where it has a 2 per cent market share. It is also investing Pounds 8.5m in a new Birmingham factory which is due to open next autumn. 'We have shown we can grow both organically and geographically,' said Mr Codling. 'This business has been managed for the future.' The flotation is sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and James Capel are brokers.</p>

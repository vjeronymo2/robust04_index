It is indicated that each of the 54 gathering systems (1) operates at low-gathering-line pressure, (2) consists of discrete sections of generally small-diameter pipe, (3) is in a typical ``spider-web'' or ``rib-like'' gathering configuration in appearance, (4) has wells along its length, (5) is located behind compression which boosts pressures from low, wellhead pressures so that the gas can enter Panhandle's mainline transmission system, or (6) is located behind a processing plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Services states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle. Field Services describes the facilities to be transferred as the West End Systems of Panhandle in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Field Services indicates that these facilities are the subject of Panhandle's companion abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 and Panhandle's application in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 to further amend its pending application in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;000,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  January 27, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should, on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.

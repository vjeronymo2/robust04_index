			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist </F> Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee, by  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Chief Editor Valentin Chikin; place and date  not given: "Our Cause Is Right"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Chikin] Left-wing  politicians and patriotic movements are now groundlessly  accusing ordinary people: The people could not care less, they  claim, the people are silently observing events. Even those who  came under fire at the House of Soviets last October are also  complaining about the people -- they did not rise, they did not  defend. Yet you are saying that they have awaked, and shifted  to the left.... Have you felt this during your tours, has this  awakening reached a sufficient depth?    [Zyuganov] Valentin Vasilyevich, I have the benefit of quite  extensive personal observations. Following the party congress,  I made 25 tours covering 45 of the largest centers. Essentially  they covered the entire social spectrum. Furthermore, the  contacts took the most diverse forms, right up to and including  open-door meetings which could have been attended by any voter  walking in from the street. Only very recently we counted more  than 30,000 persons in the halls where I had occasion to speak.  I can confirm the following: People wish to know what is  actually happening, how they are being duped, which forces are  in opposition. Let me be frank: There was a watershed on 3-4  October. Meetings are different nowadays. The stupor has worn  off. Everyone realizes that they are being deprived of  everything -- jobs, social guarantees, leave entitlement,  medical treatment, even the possibility to move away from  Vorkuta.... I first encountered this in Vorkuta -- elderly  passersby stopping in the streets and crying their eyes out  about the state to which they have been reduced. You have  someone who has spent 25 years working in the polar regions, and  everything he has ever earned has been reduced to nothing, he  has no opportunity to move away or send away his children or  elderly parents.... [passage omitted]    At the same time, there is no longer any room to maneuver.  Misfortune is already affecting not just the elderly but also  the children. Mentally, whenever a Russian sees that misfortune  is affecting children, he behaves more energetically and becomes  stauncher. The opposition is now living through an  exceptionally important period, a time when it has to analyze  developments, regroup, and accurately define the main lines of  action. A weighty word can be spoken here by the "Accord for  Russia" movement. Real cooperation must be achieved between all  patriotic forces on a broad platform of preserving the country's  integrity, peace in it, and prosperity in each home. There must  a structural preparation of the movement in all Russian regions.  Therefore, special importance attaches to regular visits to the  provinces, meetings with the aktiv, consolidation of ties with  it, and support for it. Especially since, in 70 out of the 88  regions, representative organs have been joined by people who  are perfectly well aware of the meaning and spirit of the  patriotic movement, reflecting the interests of broad strata of  voters, and capable of collective actions for the sake of their  people and their fatherland.    It is perfectly obvious that now there are two trends  developing somewhat in parallel; the question is which one will  take the lead -- the destroyers and annihilators of Russia or  the people's patriotic forces which are already perfectly well  aware of what is happening.    [Chikin] In this context, we have the question of State  Duma deputies' responsibility to the people for the country's  future. Last December all parties contested a single federal  district -- so, whose is it now, how confident do Communists and  their allies feel in the Duma?    [Zyuganov] On the whole I am satisfied with the position,  composition, and abilities of my colleagues from the deputies'  faction. The faction now has a highly representative  professional and national composition, the voters' instructions  have been used to compile a sound package of draft laws, and  many of them are already in the works. Even our opponents have  been forced to admit that the Communist Party faction has a  strong collective potential and is capable of working with all  sectors of the Duma, attracting many allies whenever necessary.  We are grateful to the Agrarians with whom we share complete  mutual understanding, we act jointly with the women's faction  and the Democratic Party of Russia on a whole series of issues,  and regional deputies quite attentively heed our position.  Whenever a question of principle has been at stake, we have  garnered 230-260 votes.    On the other hand, all-out attempts are being made to depict  the Duma's activity as being limited only to the radical  position of "Russia's Choice" and some of its allies. Any  proposal for stabilization is either boycotted or rejected by  them. Everything to do with stabilizing the economy, halting  the disintegration, safeguarding security, or struggling against  crime -- everything is boycotted.... Even the Law on Struggle  Against Corruption, which demands the establishment of  elementary norms adopted in practice by the West a long time ago  -- like declaration of income and the impossibility of combining  state service with trade or commercial activity -- even this is  being boycotted by these people because they have chosen the  position of hindering the Duma's work as much as possible. We  can see that a mighty and concerted march has been launched  against the representative power as such. This takes the form  of loathsome articles and insinuations about individual  factions, of attempts to denigrate opponents. Nonetheless, the  healthy nucleus in the Duma is getting stronger.    As regards our own faction, each month the deputies spend  one  week in their electoral districts and report back to their  voters. Let me say that the last round of visits showed that our  deputies had visited at least five to seven labor collectives  and received a powerful charge of fresh ideas and interesting  proposals.    We initiated the introduction of proposals to urgently  examine the question of the emergency in the country's  socioeconomic situation jointly with Federation Council  deputies, and invitations were issued to the government and the  president's representatives. Work is now under way to prepare  this meeting, and I assume that it could prove exceptionally  fruitful and could lead to serious and impartial assessments of  the president's course in today's conditions. I can foresee a  very powerful opposition to this sitting.    On the other hand, we have planned a meeting between the  faction and voters from the capital at the Parliamentary Center  so that we could report back to them, and then to travel across  the Russian Federation's regions, submit joint reports with the  party aktiv on the results of our work over the last six months,  and define our strategy and tactics for the immediate future.    [Chikin] It goes without saying that, for the chairman of  the Central Executive Committee, all these routes also lead  right across the party structures. How is the party's  organizational development progressing now? What features are  more noticeable in its image: those of Zhukov and Korolev,  those of Brezhnev and Gorbachev, or some others?...    [Zyuganov] The past 15 months have brought radical changes  to the party's life. Here are just the statistics of major  events. We held one congress, two party conferences, six  plenums, eight zonal conferences (and a whole series of new ones  is about to begin), and five major scientific-practical  conferences on key questions concerning the economy, stable  development, the party's organizational development, activity  with workers collectives and trade unions, and so on. The  party's entire vertical structure was restored during this  period. We now have party organizations in all major  settlements, cities, republics, krays, and oblasts. The  following result was summed up at the party conference: Now we  have 550,000 party members concentrated in more than 20,000  party organizations. The leadership structure was rejuvenated  during the last report and election campaign by 10 years on  average, and ties have been restored with more than 100  left-wing parties and movements all over the world.    We held several meetings with our colleagues from communist  parties revived on the territory of the former USSR which,  incidentally, already count more than 1 million Communists in  their ranks. Meetings were held in Orel, Minsk, and the Moscow  region. Leaders of 19 parties gathered recently at Lenin Hills  and adopted what I believe to be some very important documents:  On the concept of restoring a renewed union state, which was  adopted unanimously; on the 50th anniversary of victory in the  Great Patriotic War and on Zhukov's 100th birth anniversary; on  Lenin's 125th birth anniversary; on protection of our associates  languishing behind bars, primarily in the Baltic countries....  On the whole, we succeeded in reviving a union of sufficiently  combat-capable organizations.    At the same time, a renewal of the philosophy of ideology is  also under way. Unless our ideology is backed by the ideas of  great power status, statehood, and patriotism -- in addition to  the ideas of social justice, brotherhood of people, and  friendship among peoples -- the party will hardly be able to  perform its historic mission, because the main crisis today is  the crisis of patriotic awareness. It is, after all, no secret  that the country and the CPSU produced an unbelievably large  number of traitors and turncoats. People like Zhukov and  Korolev were brought up on the spirit of the feats by Aleksandr  Nevskiy, Dmitriy Donskoy, Suvorov, and Kutuzov -- those who gave  unsparingly of themselves for the fatherland's sake.    [Chikin] But these new ideological acquisitions can also be  interpreted as a repudiation of the classical dogmas of Marxism  -- proletarian internationalism, class struggle, revolutionary  aims....    [Zyuganov] People are trying to oversimplify the situation  and reduce it to primitivism.... On the subject of proletarian  internationalism. Look at the situation: Virtually the entire  machine building industry is at a standstill. ZIL and  Rosselmash, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and Kirovskiy Zavod  are up in arms.... What was the response by workers in Kharkov  and Minsk, by the proletariat of the Ruhr and Detroit? Did they  go out in the streets in protest against growing unemployment in  Chelyabinsk and Rostov? Did they halt the trainloads of  Snickers being shipped to our country?... Did they, indeed!  The current regime is skillfully dividing professionals and  workers even within the same specialized field.... A driver in  one place earns 70,000 rubles, another driver somewhere else  earns 700,000 -- a 10-fold discrepancy, which is absolutely  impermissible in principle. A stratification, a destruction of  professional ties is under way. You cannot apply the same class  yardstick to everyone. The class approach is exceptionally  important when analyzing social phenomena but, in today's  conditions, it must unfailingly be combined with a  cultural-historical, a sociopsychological approach. Only then  can objective conclusions be drawn.    I would like to say that all our scientific research centers  are now working on the elaboration of new parameters -- in  Moscow, in Leningrad, in Novosibirsk.... Many contemporary  questions would be impossible to answer by applying only the  class approach. This is why all parties, movements, and streams  find it so difficult to produce new programs. Programs must  reflect the qualitatively new realities which have emerged both  in our own country and all over the world.    Incidentally, our adversaries are not so hampered by tunnel  vision. For example, following a careful study of the entire  psychological profile of Russian man as manifested since the  times of Batu Khan, Napoleon, and Hitler, they conclude:  Russian man cannot be defeated in open face-to-face battle.  They start seeking different methods. We found ourselves  unprotected from above. The absolute majority of people were  unable to believe, for example, Gorbachev's treason: How could  the supreme statesman betray allies, friends, the Army, the  party, all and sundry.... Apparently he could.... A ramified  fifth-column structure was created, which fragmented our entire  nationwide organism. The split followed not straightforward  social lines but a more complex path.    There were times when Rus was being split along religious  lines; nowadays we not only have preachers from overseas  attacking our faith, but also attempts to effect splits along  national and territorial lines. And if they succeed in  splitting Russia and Ukraine or the Orthodox and the Muslim  beyond all reconciliation, it will be virtually impossible to  bring society together again.    With all this information in our possession, my colleagues  and I spoke on television, asking people to refrain from  provocative actions in any direction, I spoke on several  occasions to an audience of many thousands at the House of  Soviets in an attempt to persuade them: Any move from here  could be used by the authorities as a pretext to open fire and  finally destroy the Soviet power. The regime was eagerly  seeking a pretext to open fire for effect. The majority  accepted my point of view. Many people, by the way, did not  know that the state of emergency had already been introduced at  1600 on 3 October, at a time when the demonstrators had not yet  marched on City Hall and had no plans to move to Ostankino. Nor  did people know, of course, that several hundred Spetsnaz troops  were already in place along the approaches to Ostankino, lying  in wait for the demonstrators. Had the regime not wanted a  bloodbath, it would have been enough to get one armored  personnel carrier out in the road, fire a few blank rounds, and  avoid mass murder. Many people do not know that the snipers,  who were shown every day on television being rounded up,  suddenly vanished from our side and disappeared whence they had  come. Thus, the absence of full information gives some people  an opportunity to interpret this address today any way they  fancy. Would it not be better to admit that this warning saved  hundreds of innocent people?    [Chikin] How do you feel now in the circle of Communist  opponents and oppositionists? Can you reach mutual  understanding? Are personal sympathies maintained?    [Zyuganov] It is obvious that everyone has reassessed his  values and relationships over these years. I am grateful that I  was not betrayed by my friends -- whether people from my native  region who supported me during the difficult year, fellow  journalists, or my friends from the alliance of people's  patriotic forces. Even though I was frequently the target of  critical fire -- sometime deservedly, sometime not. But I am an  advocate of pooling the efforts of the broadest and most diverse  political streams and of all my comrades from the left-wing bloc  for the creation of a mighty state-patriotic organization. I  maintain weekly contacts with friends and close associates from  Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus, and  Central Asia and, as a rule, we reach complete mutual  understanding on all main issues.    There is a narrow group of individuals here in Moscow, who  are trying to imply that they hold the ultimate truth and they  alone are ardent revolutionaries. But the number of their  supporters is dwindling day by day. For the simple reason that  it is virtually impossible to succeed just with bombastic  phrases and speeches, without powerful structures, without  coordinated policy, and without soundly considered tactics.    [Chikin] The situation in the country is extremely  difficult. Each hour is precious when it comes to turning the  helm and avoiding disaster. Say an opportunity to join the  government were to arise tomorrow, would you accept? On what  conditions?    [Zyuganov] I believe that, from the viewpoint of  administration, the main evil is the new pyramid of power. The  incumbent presidency is rule by general secretary and czar  rolled into one. The general secretary feared the congress, the  czar feared God's anger, but the power here is neither  accountable to nor monitored by anyone. There is no government  in the normal sense of the word. You could even say that there  are four governments. There is a government which works around  Yeltsin, which decides everything and is in command of those  bearing arms. There is Chernomyrdin's government which runs the  Gazprom and another two or three economic structures. There is  Kozyrev's government which, basically speaking, is guided by  instructions from the U.S. Department of State. There is also  the mass media government controlled by "Russia's Choice" -- the  democrats will hold onto this mighty power, which orchestrates  Russia's troubles, until the very last....    Thus, I would like to say that if these governments continue  to function in the same way, no one -- not even the most  talented person -- will be able to resolve a single issue.  Generally speaking, this is not a question of who should join  the administration, but rather of changing the structure and  nature of power, of subordinating this power to the interests of  the people, to the national-state interests. In my report to  the conference of the "Accord for Russia" movement I actually  spoke of the nature of state power and submitted a whole series  of specific proposals which, it seems to me, could transform the  way the country is being run.

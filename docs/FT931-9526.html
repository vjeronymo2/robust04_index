			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin talks continue TALKS between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aimed at reaching a peace deal in the wake of BA's 'dirty tricks campaign' are expected to continue throughout the weekend. Discussions between the two sides continued yesterday and it appears unlikely that they will be concluded until early next week. Progress on reaching an agreement is reported to have been slow. Virgin is still threatening to pursue action against its competitor unless it is satisfied with BA proposals to compensate it for the commercial damage it claims was inflicted upon its business by BA.</p>

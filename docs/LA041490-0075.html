			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRANCE;  </P> <P> KADAFI HELD 3 FREED HOSTAGES, PAPER SAYS  </P> <P> Three European hostages freed this week in Beirut were captured by Col. Moammar  Kadafi's government and held in Libya, not Lebanon, the Paris daily Le Figaro  said.  </P> <P> The French government said it could not confirm or deny the report. The  newspaper cited unnamed sources in Paris, Brussels and Beirut as saying the  government of Algeria -- and not Kadafi -- served as the principal mediator in  negotiations to free the hostages, Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 32, Belgian  Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their daughter, Sophie, 2. France's Socialist  government has come under international criticism for commending Kadafi for his  role in freeing the captives.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernard Estrade] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, April 26 (AFP) -- Humanitarian  organisations overstated the number of victims caused by Bosnian  Serb shelling of the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, UN and aid  groups said here Tuesday. The office of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] had earlier spoken of 715  killed and 1,970 wounded. Of these, 600 were said to be  seriously hurt and required immediate evacuation. But UN and  humanitarian organisation officials here said the toll should  probably be divided by three. The actual number of those killed  in the three-week Serb offensive against the eastern Bosnian  enclave was at most 250 and the number of those wounded 600 to  700, they said.    Monday evening, some 200 seriously wounded patients had been  helicoptered out of the Gorazde hospital which was now "empty",  officials said. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler acknowledged on  Tuesday that casualty figures earlier given should be "scaled  down" and "are perhaps not all serious." Obviously embarrassed,  he said that it was impossible for the time being to say by how  much figures had been exaggerated. "We are in a war situation  and in a war everybody uses propaganda," he said. "All the  figures we gave were based on reports from our representatives  in the field," a UNHCR official, who wished to remain anonymous,  said. "What we did not know, and what they did not tell us, was  that information given originated with Bosnian authorities in  Gorazde and that they had not checked it themselves," he added.    The UNHCR team and that of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors  Without Borders) were in shelters and had little opportunity to  move around town, notably during the last week. "It was the  same for UN military observers," according to an officer at the  headquarters of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) here. The  first doubts regarding the reported number of casualties emerged  on Sunday when UN troops first arrived in the town after NATO  had threatened to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they did not stop their  bombardment and withdraw from around the city.    Those evacuated, according to officials here, have been  mainly soldiers. Monday evening, a senior UNPROFOR officer was  busy asking: "Where are the wounded? We're looking for them..."</p>

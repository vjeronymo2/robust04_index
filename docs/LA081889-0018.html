			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> A TROUBLING FLIGHT PLAN;  </P> <P> TORRANCE AIRPORT TAKES FLAK FOR RENOVATION PROJECT THAT IS FORCING OLDER  BUSINESSES OUT  </P> <P> Roger Keeney is an old-timer at Torrance Municipal Airport.  </P> <P> A 78-year-old pilot and businessman, Keeney has operated Acme Aircraft Co. at  the airport since 1945. In its early years the company occupied 2 1/2 acres,  employed about 50 workers and provided maintenance and fuel service for dozens  of aircraft each week.  </P> <P> But time and the city's redevelopment plans for the airport have closed in on  Keeney.  </P> <P> Now he works by himself out of a small, single-story, white stucco building  hidden within a row of new city-built hangars. The only service he offers is  weighing planes so that pilots can meet federal certification standards.  </P> <P> When Keeney's lease on his original site expired several years ago, the city  built hangars on most of that land and sold Keeney a five-year lease to the  tiny lot from which he now works.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Told to Move  </P> <P> About a year and a half ago, his lease to that lot expired, and the city told  him to move out to make room for two more city hangars.  </P> <P> The hangars -- 72 of which already have been built -- are part of the city's  airport redevelopment project, which also will include a 9,681-square-foot  General Aviation Center and two or three large aviation-related businesses.  </P> <P> In order to stay at the airport, the city told Keeney he must either build  himself a new facility or incorporate his operations with another airport  business.  </P> <P> But Keeney says he can't afford to relocate or build a new facility.  </P> <P> He said many of his friends have told him to give up his business and retire.  But he said he knows no other life outside of the airport.  </P> <P> "What the hell am I going to do, pull the cork?" he said, referring to  retirement. "What am I going to do, go home and mow the lawn?"  </P> <P> The redevelopment project that is forcing Keeney out of businesses is at the  center of a debate between city officials and some business operators at the  airport.  </P> <P> Representatives of the city say the project will breathe new life into the  airport and draw aviation-related companies to build businesses there.  </P> <P> Brian Raber, the airport's program specialist, said the city does not want to  run Keeney and other airport companies out of business. But most of the  airport's buildings are dilapidated, he said, and if airport business owners  are unable to renovate or build facilities, the city will lease their land to a  company that will.  </P> <P> "We've got to get rid of the old stuff and put up the new stuff. . . . The  whole intention is to renovate the airport," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Business Owners Pessimistic  </P> <P> But several business owners at the airport are pessimistic about the project,  which they say will drive away longtime operators who cannot afford new  facilities but do little to attract new businesses.  </P> <P> "It's not going to do a damn bit of difference," said Bob Hamilton, owner of G  &amp; S Industries, an aircraft repair shop he has operated at the airport for  15 years.  </P> <P> Hamilton and some other airport business owners say the airport will continue  to struggle because the city has created a climate that discourages pilots from  using the Torrance facility.  </P> <P> As examples, they cite the city's restrictions on aircraft noise, its ban on  the sale of jet fuel and limits on the number of tie-down spaces.  </P> <P> Raber said the city has implemented such restrictions in order to curtail the  noise that spills into adjoining neighborhoods, and he said city officials  believe it is possible to have a viable airport and continue to enforce such  noise-limiting restrictions.  </P> <P> Last month, however, the project met with disappointment when only one firm  responded after the city contacted dozens of aviation companies throughout  Southern California, asking them to submit proposals for constructing new  aviation-related businesses at the airport.  </P> <P> Albert Ng, the assistant city manager, said the city has since extended the  deadline indefinitely and sought more proposals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Needs a Face Lift'  </P> <P> Ng said he thinks it has been difficult to attract proposals because "the  airport needs a face lift." Many buildings at the airport were built during  World War II and are now dilapidated, he said.  </P> <P> But Hamilton contends that the city's own short-term lease policies have helped  to foster that dilapidation. Without the security of longer leases, he said,  business owners have no incentive to maintain or modernize their facilities.  </P> <P> Ng said that almost all businesses at the airport are on a month-to-month lease  because the city wants to be able to take over a lease on short notice to make  room for a new business.  </P> <P> Despite the lack of bids, Ng said the city is still optimistic about the  project, but Hamilton said he believes applicants may be discouraged by the  city's requirements.  </P> <P> For example, Hamilton said he did not submit a proposal to build a new facility  at the airport because he could not afford to pay both the nonrefundable  $25,000 deposit and the cost of constructing a new building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Unusual  </P> <P> Ng said the deposit, which would be returned after a lease is signed, is  required to make sure the developer goes through with its plans. He said such a  deposit is not unusual for redevelopment projects in Torrance and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Mickey Bodell, manager and part-owner of Nagel Aircraft Co., an aircraft parts  supplier, said that his company is going out of business this month because its  30-year lease expired in June and he also could not afford to build new a  facility. He said another factor in his decision was the city's insistence on  limiting him to a one-year renewal on his lease.  </P> <P> Bodell said that would make it difficult for him to maintain the huge inventory  his shop requires. He said that when he buys an aircraft for salvage, it takes  at least two years before he sees a profit from selling the parts.  </P> <P> "In our type of business you just can't run for one year at a time," he said.  </P> <P> Bodell said that he will auction off his inventory this weekend and prepare for  retirement.  </P> <P> Larry Wilcox, a Torrance homeowner and pilot for 20 years, agrees that the  airport needs renovations. But he said that if city officials continue limiting  airport operations, they should consider giving airport businesses financial  aid to help them modernize their buildings or build new facilities.  </P> <P> The airport's businesses "can't afford to maintain their buildings, pay rent  and renovate," he said. "The city is going to have to make some  considerations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 15 Companies  </P> <P> But Raber said the city does not have the money to help airport businesses  build new facilities. He said each company must pay for its own maintenance and  renovation cost. "That's just part of business," he said.  </P> <P> There are 15 companies doing business at Torrance airport. Acme Aircraft Co.  and Nagel Aircraft Co. are the only companies going out of business to make way  for the redevelopment project, Raber said.  </P> <P> As part of the project, the city will build a new $1.5-million General Aviation  Center next to the airport control tower. It will house the airport's  administration offices, operations center, a flight planning office, a noise  monitoring center, a pilot's lounge and a community meeting room.  </P> <P> The city has already spent about $1.5 million for the hangars and is renting  them out for $300, $400 and $1,000 a month, depending on their size. Over the  next 30 years the city expects to make about $7 million from the hangars.  </P> <P> Funding for the hangars and the general aviation center -- which should be  completed within two years -- is coming from the airport budget and the sale of  a bond, city officials said.  </P> <P> Each of the new aviation-related businesses will cost its owner between $1.5  million and $2 million to build. They will be located on a 10-acre vacant  parcel just west of the airport control tower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cure for Problems  </P> <P> Although city officials are pitching the redevelopment project as a cure for  many of the airport's problems, nearby residents, pilots and business owners at  the airport still express concern about the airport's finances.  </P> <P> The airport, which was once a World War II flight training center for the Army  Air Corps, totals about 500 acres. About 140 acres are leased for  non-aeronautical uses, such as shopping centers and auto dealerships.  </P> <P> Since 1979, the aeronautical operations of the airport have lost a total of  about $2.5 million, according to past city budget reports. However, revenues  from commercial leases regularly put the total airport budget in the black.  </P> <P> There has been a "dramatic reduction" in the number of flights at the airport,  said Raber, who attributes most of the reduction to a decline in general  aviation throughout the country.  </P> <P> In 1976, when the airport was at its busiest, there were about 439,000  departures and landings. Last year, there were about 249,000, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Noise Control  </P> <P> However, Raber acknowledged that the city also limits operations at the airport  as a means of controlling noise. He said the airport has enough tie-down space  for about 1,050 airplanes, but the city has limited that number to 825, by  allowing some tie-downs to remain unused. Depending on the size of the  aircraft, the airport receives between $80 and $125 per month for a tie-down.  </P> <P> Eli Alexander, manager of ALEXAIR, which rents and services helicopters at the  airport, said he thinks the airport would attract more businesses if the city  eased up on its noise and aircraft restrictions.  </P> <P> Alexander said that increasing the number of airplanes at the airport will not  necessarily increase noise because many pilots only fly once or twice a year.  </P> <P> "They are like yachts," he said. "People won't use them every day."  </P> <P> According to Raber, the airport has a ban on 39 types of aircraft -- mostly  older jets that violate the airport's noise limits. No other airport in the  area, including the Long Beach, Hawthorne and Santa Monica municipal airports,  has such a ban, he said.  </P> <P> "I guess we are kind of unique," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airport Curfew  </P> <P> In 1977, the city passed an ordinance that limits aircraft noise to 82 decibels  -- equivalent to the sound of a vacuum cleaner operating in a closed room.  </P> <P> The airport also has a curfew between 11 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. Only emergency  flights and pilots with exemptions can fly in and out of the airport during  those hours.  </P> <P> Although airport business operators claim that Torrance's noise restrictions  are the most drastic in the area, Raber said it is difficult to compare the  noise restrictions at Torrance with those at other airports.  </P> <P> He said different airports limit noise in different ways. Some airports are  larger and farther away from populated areas and therefore have fewer  restrictions, he said. "It's like comparing apples and oranges," he said.  </P> <P> At Santa Monica Airport, where residents have often complained about noise,  airport Director Hank Dittmar said the maximum allowable noise level is 95  decibels. Santa Monica also has a list of 22 restricted aircraft that are  allowed to operate there only if pilots can demonstrate that they can land or  take off without violating the noise limit, Dittmar said.  </P> <P> Santa Monica also enforces a ban on takeoffs and landings after 11 p.m. and  before 7 p.m., he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Limits, Bans  </P> <P> By contrast, Hawthorne Municipal Airport has no noise limits and no banned  aircraft, according to Robert Trimborn, the airport's administrator. He said  the city only asks that pilots not practice takeoffs and landings after 10 p.m.  and before 7 a.m.  </P> <P> The city gets very few noise complaints from residents, he said, and most  pilots voluntarily try to limit airport noise.  </P> <P> Despite the concerns of business owners at the Torrance airport, Raber said  city officials are unlikely to ease restrictions on noise and operations there.  </P> <P> That is bad news for Keeney, who is reluctantly packing his equipment and  preparing to move out of the airport.  </P> <P> Keeney mourns having to leave his friends and the life he has known for 44  years.  </P> <P> "I'm 78 years old," he said. "I'm not going to be here forever. . . . I just  want to hang on a little longer."  </P></p>

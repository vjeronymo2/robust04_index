Duran-Ballen, speaking to reporters at the Japan National  Press Club, said Ecuador hopes Japan will allow it to defer  payment of its debts to Japan totaling 6.9 billion yen as of  August 1992.    He also said Ecuador will not return to the 12-member  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).    Ecuador, citing dissatisfaction with oil production quotas  set by OPEC, withdrew from the organization in November 1992.    Duran arrived in Japan on Monday on his first leg of a  two-nation tour. He met Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday. He will leave for  China on Friday.</p>

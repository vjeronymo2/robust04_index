			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from correspondent Larry Jagan in Rangoon] </F>   [Excerpt] The National Convention, which is drawing up  guidelines for drafting Burma's constitution, is continuing with  its closed-door sessions. Work committees concerned are  preparing to submit reports on the three chapters -- the state,  the state structure, and the head of state.    Even before the National Convention was convened, the SLORC  had told the delegates they were to guarantee a leading role for  the military in Burmese politics. However, the military may not  get all their demands, says Larry Jagan, who is currently in  Rangoon.    There are reports that, as the closed-door meetings of the  work committees continue, more differences over the state  structure are emerging. Deliberations are being made as to  which zones, areas, and divisions should be granted the right of  self-administration. There has been no decision on the states  with the right of self-administration and the Wa are reported to  be distraught over the matter as they had demanded a separate  independent state. They had said that they would not give up  arms if they were not given statehood. It is not clear whether  they will be satisfied with an offer of the status of a  self-administered area.    The issue of self-administered areas would involve a  division  of the Shan State, and the SNLD, the Shan Nationalities League  for Democracy, had strongly protested over the matter.  Well-informed sources say that they are expected to raise the  problem when they present a report early this month. The  problem is expected to become more complicated when the delegate  representing Kachin [Kachin Independence Army] 4th Battalion at  the National Convention discusses the matter of granting it a  self-administered zone within the Shan State. According to  well-informed sources, the Kachin delegate is expected to demand  a separate and independent self-administered zone within the  Shan State. The SNLD is not expected to accept such a demand.  As the Kachins have been given a state with the right of  self-administration, the organizers of the National Convention  are duty-bound to reject the demand.    The Burmese military authorities want to avoid direct  criticism against them at the National Convention and they  certainly do not like publicity for the main opposition party,  the National League for Democracy [NLD]. Both the SNLD and the  NLD severely criticized the military administration in their  submissions last year. The reports prepared by them have to be  submitted to the authorities before their submission to the  convention. Each delegate group has to submit its suggestions  for approval before submission to the convention.    According to reports in Rangoon, there was a reference  during  the discussion in the conference hall to the NLD in describing  the democratic forces as a spent force of the past; however, the  NLD was able to rebut it, saying they are not a spent force of  the past. The military authorities were reported to be  embarrassed by the incident. It is clear that the military  authorities are (?taking measures) to prevent such incidents.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The virtue of consistency - Investment trusts, Why TR City has proved popular with private investors Private investors are often being urged to buy shares in investment trusts. But the names of many trusts are obscure, making it hard for the small investor to choose the right stock / A look at TR City of London CONSISTENCY is a much-prized virtue in investment trusts and TR City of London has certainly delivered it. The annual dividend has been increased in each of the last 25 years and over ten years, its share price total return has been the fourth best of all investment trusts, with growth of 702.6 per cent. This success has made the UK income trust very popular with private investors. The number of shareholders has quadrupled from 6,000 to nearly 24,000 over the last five years, and increased by more than 50 per cent in 1991-92 alone. TR estimates that institutional investors now own less than 20 per cent of the trust. But success can bring problems. The trust's shares are now standing at a 3 per cent premium to net assets, which means that private investors might be attracted to other trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial, which are standing at a discount. And the 25-year record of dividend increases may well be broken this year; the trust is forecasting a maintained payout. Like many trusts, the name of TR City of London dates back to the company's 19th century origins. The City of London Brewery business was founded in 1860, and carried on brewing until 1932. Although the company became an investment trust at that date, City of London still owned pubs until 1970. Then Touche Remnant took over the management and the company's name was changed to TR City of London in 1982. The city tag does not mean that the group's investments are concentrated on the square mile. The investment objectives are threefold: to have a higher yield than the FT-A All-Share Index, to get long term growth of capital and income in excess of the All-Share, and to invest predominantly in the shares of large companies. A list of the 10 biggest stocks in TR City's portfolio would contain names with which the small investor will be familiar: BT, BAT, Shell, BP, British Gas, BTR, Smithkline Beecham, Allied-Lyons, ICI and Grand Met. The breakdown by sectors, as of June 30, was capital goods (16.4 per cent), consumer groups (33 per cent), oil &amp; gas (9.4 per cent), financial groups (14.2 per cent) and others (27 per cent). Around 75 per cent of the assets are in FT-SE 100 constituents; a further 23 per cent is in the recently-formed FT-SE Mid-Cap index; and only 2 per cent in smaller companies. Although the trust has a portfolio yield around 20-25 per cent above the All-Share (which means it is currently about 5.4 per cent), it does not concentrate exclusively on the 'high yield' area of the market. Income is boosted by a 5.5 per cent holding in convertibles and 1.5 per cent in fixed interest securities. The current dividend yield of 5 per cent is one of the main reasons why many investors pick the trust for their personal equity plans, since it offers some real tax benefits even after allowing for the charges. The trust's long term performance also helps, although this has been boosted by the narrowing of the discount. Over five years, growth has been 138.97 per cent, according to Micropal (mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested), placing TR City top of the UK income growth sector. In the short term, relative performance has dropped a bit with the trust, seventh out of ten in the sector over the year to January 1993. Could there be any reason for this? A change of manager is always a potential source of concern for investors and this might especially be the case with TR City, since Michael Moule (one of the doyens of the sector) stopped managing the trust in July 1991. The new manager Job Curtis, aged 31, was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford (where he studied PPE) before joining the broker Grieveson Grant as a graduate trainee in 1983. A short spell at Cornhill Insurance followed, before he joined TR in 1987. He took over the management of the trust in July 1991, having been deputy for the previous three years. However, Moule is still part of the investment trust management team at TR. And Lewis Aaron, senior investment trust analyst at S G Warburg Securities, is not concerned at the change. 'At most of the big houses, it is not just the individual fund manager's view, it's the house view on stocks' he says. 'Job Curtis has been involved with the trust before and I see no reason at all for the performance to deteriorate' adds Aaron. Curtis says the trust's investment approach has three strands. The first is to be risk-averse and wary of companies with poor corporate governance. 'The directors do have a small 'black list' on which companies such as Maxwell appeared' says Curtis. The second strand is value investing - the aim of buying shares for less than their intrinsic worth. Curtis looks for companies with undervalued assets such as land, mineral rights or brand names. He also wants companies with high free cash flow, high return on assets and high research &amp; development spending. 'Value eventually gets recognised' says Curtis 'either by investors generally, by the management in running the company better or by a takeover'. TR City claims a high 'strike rate' in selecting takeover targets recently. The third strand of the approach is income investing, given the need to maintain the higher than average yield. With 125 shares in the portfolio, the trust certainly has a broad spread of investments, although its larger company emphasis means one might expect some underperformance if the long-awaited 'smaller companies revival' actually occurs. But Lewis Aaron of SG Warburg says 'It's a good long term investment, not one for short term capital gains, but a good steady core holding. If, as a private investor, you wanted a UK trust, you would probably pick this one.' Key facts The trust has gross assets of Pounds 260m and a market capitalisation of Pounds 243m, as of January 13. The dividend yield is 5 per cent. TR's annual management charge is 0.39 per cent, based on a 3 year rolling average of assets. There is a modest amount of gearing, with Pounds 16m of debenture stock. Net asset value per share on January 13 was 123p, when the share price was 127p. Board All board members are independent.

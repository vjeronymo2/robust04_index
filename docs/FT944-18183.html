			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Left academic finds right stuff: From 'dependency' theorist to reluctant neo-liberal / Profile of Cardoso Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, likely to be Brazil's next president, is a former left-wing professor turned politician who has moved steadily towards the right in the last 10 years. Many Brazilians are now asking how much further he will move to govern a country still controlled by conservative elites. Mr Cardoso, 63, is a popular and respected figure in Brazilian politics, whose charm and a relaxed style with the media helped win the election. He speaks several foreign languages and is reputed to have a liking for French cooking and poker. His experience of government is limited to brief spells at the foreign and finance ministries, where he sometimes appeared excessively cautious. Given the size of the economic and social problems he will inherit, a tendency to be indecisive could damage his presidency. Born into a wealthy military family, he is one of the outstanding Brazilians of his generation. He trained as a sociologist and later taught at the University of California at Berkeley and Cambridge. His best known works explored 'dependency', a theory which sought to explain Latin America's 'underdevelopment' as a consequence of the continent's dependence on capital and technology from the US and Europe. His understanding of Brazil's social problems will be important because the country has one of the biggest gaps between rich and poor with millions living in shanty towns, often without health and education services. Mr Cardoso, whose anthropologist wife Ruth has strong views on social issues, says the country needs to become 'more humanitarian' and to end its 'social injustice'. His links with the left led to trouble with Brazil's military rulers in the 1970s and he was banned from teaching at the University of Sao Paulo. When democracy returned to Brazil in 1985, Mr Cardoso switched to politics and was elected a senator for Sao Paulo in 1986. He helped form a new political party, the Social Democrats (PSDB), which has gained a reputation for good - and clean - government in several Brazilian states. Mr Cardoso joined the government of President Itamar Franco in 1992 after the ousting of former President Fernando Collor on corruption charges. In May last year, against his instincts and the advice of friends who thought the job a poisoned chalice, he was persuaded by President Franco to become Brazil's fourth finance minister in less than a year. Once appointed, Mr Cardoso often reminded interviewers that he was not an economist. But his political skills allowed him to negotiate through congress a package of economic measures in preparation for the launch of a new currency, the Real. It worked, and monthly inflation fell from 50 per cent in June to less than 2 per cent in September. It was this that won Mr Cardoso the election, helped by an alliance with the right-wing Liberal Front (PFL) party that delivered him votes in Brazil's poor north-east. The alliance was unpopular with some of Mr Cardoso's supporters because the PFL is controlled by the same old-style politicians Mr Cardoso used to criticise and blame for Brazil's social problems. Advisers say he needed the alliance to win the election. But critics say it showed Mr Cardoso was too ready to compromise his principals for politics. They worry that his commitment to tackling social problems, such as promoting fairer land ownership, will be shelved if reform threatens the entrenched interests of conservative politicians and business groups. Mr Cardoso says he is a social democrat and bridles when described as a 'neo-liberal' who expects market forces to solve Brazil's problems. 'The market cannot solve problems of poverty,' he said, adding that the state should remain an active provider of social services. In his election manifesto, he said the state should remain involved in certain undefined 'strategic' areas of the economy. But, in the short term at least, it seems he will have to follow policies that have been described as 'neo-liberal' elsewhere in Latin America. To balance the government's budget it is likely he will have to privatise state-owned companies faster than he might like. He has said the state's monopoly on telecommunications and mineral extraction can be lifted, but has so far rejected a full-scale privatisation of Petrobras, the state-owned oil monopoly. To guarantee the continued success of the Real currency, he will also have to overhaul the federal government's budget and its social security system. This will require increasing the tax take and government spending cuts. State pensions may be frozen and stricter rules introduced to stop workers retiring early. Economists agree such changes are needed as Brazil modernises its economy and government. They say that the fact that it is a former left-wing sociologist proposing the reforms shows there is now a consensus in Brazil for a smaller, more efficient state in a market economy, in line with other countries in the region. Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, leader of the PFL and one of the old-style politicians Mr Cardoso used to rail against, said there was another possible explanation. 'Fernando Henrique Cardoso was always politically further to the right of centre than we had thought,' he said.</p>

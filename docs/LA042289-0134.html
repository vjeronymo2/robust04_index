			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIT-RUN DRIVER CLAIMS PRISON RAPE, LOSES PLEA  </P> <P> Despite tearful testimony in which Gary Alan Haw described being raped twice in  prison, an Orange County Superior Court judge Friday rejected the hit-and-run  driver's plea to serve his sentence elsewhere.  </P> <P> Haw, who struck and killed a bicyclist in Laguna Hills in 1987, told Judge  James K. Turner that he had been sexually assaulted twice during his first 3  months in prison. Haw, 26, said he had been afraid to call for help or report  the incidents because his life was threatened.  </P> <P> "They put me in Chino Central and they placed me in a cell with another man  just for 1 night," Haw said, describing his first night in prison. "He raped me  and when he got done he urinated on me."  </P> <P> On Sept. 30, Haw was sentenced to 2 years in state prison for hit-and-run  driving and conspiracy to obstruct justice.  </P> <P> Haw was driving his father's 1986 Porsche 911 on Alicia Parkway on Sept. 8,  1987, when he passed a van that had slowed down for bicyclist Jason Klein, 17.  Haw stuck Klein, throwing him more that 300 feet and killing him on impact.  </P> <P> Haw, who was 24 at the time, and his father, Ronald Haw, concocted a story that  put the senior Haw behind the wheel because the insurance on the car did not  cover drivers under 25. According to police reports, the front end of the  $80,000 Porsche was shattered in the accident.  </P> <P> However, when officers talked to a witness who identified the younger Haw as  the driver, the Haws admitted that they made up the story. Ronald Haw was  convicted and sentenced to 1 year in a halfway house in Buena Park.  </P> <P> Gary Haw also testified Friday that both a nurse and a prison doctor failed to  examine him when he complained of bleeding.  </P> <P> The judge, citing reports that stated there were no visible physical injuries  to Haw and a prison report recommending that his sentence remain the same, also  questioned Haw's story that he was denied proper medical attention. He said he  found it difficult to believe that the nurse and doctor took "this cavalier,  don't-give-a-damn attitude."  </P> <P> Haw has been out of prison on $50,000 bail and living with friends since Jan.  5. He remains free but under court order not to drive pending appeal on his  case.  </P></p>

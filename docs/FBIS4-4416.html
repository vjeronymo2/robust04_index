			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- An overseas South Korean  clergyman's plan to visit the home country is doomed to fail due  to objection by government authorities.    The government is loath to allow the home visit of Rev. Yi  Yong-pin, 68, active in Germany, on the ground that he had  engaged in pro-North Korean activities abroad.    Yi, an outspoken critic of the past authoritarian regimes,  had not been allowed into the country for decades in the past.    An official of the "committee for the promotion of Rev. Yi  Yong-pin's return home" in Seoul said his committee on Thursday  received a notification that the government would not allow Rev.  Yi's return home unless he repents in writing of the "seditious  activities" he made while visiting North Korea.    "The government notification is something unexpected. But,  we will go ahead with the plan to have Rev. Yi come to Seoul on  April 4," he said.    Rev. Yi who went to West Germany in 1955 for study, is noted  for his struggles against the authoritarian governments of the  past, and also for arranging talks between South and North  Korean Christian leaders since early 1980s, in the course of  which he visited Pyongyang in 1980.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Toyota predicts exports boost TOYOTA said yesterday that it expected its UK carmaking operations to contribute between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m a year to Britain's external trade balance when production reaches 200,000 cars a year after the mid 1990s. At a ceremony yesterday to mark the arrival of the first production car off the line at Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK's Pounds 700m plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, company executives also made clear that production and the use of 'local' - European - content programmes had been accelerated. The UK-built cars, a Ford Sierra-sized range of vehicles called Carina E, will start production with the 60 per cent 'local' content originally targeted for mid 1993. Although the company expects to build only 100 cars between now and the end of the year - as it continues to test processes and double-check quality standards - its scheduled output for next year has been raised to 36,000 from 30,000. It expects to reach output of 100,000 cars a year, the maximum on a single shift, by the end of 1994, six months earlier than expected. By then, the European content of the cars should be 80 per cent. When 200,000 units a year is reached, Toyota will employ 3,000 people at Burnaston and a further 300 at its Pounds 140m engine manufacturing plant at Deeside, north Wales. Burnaston now employs just under 1,100 people, with a further 84 at Deeside. An additional 600 will be taken on at Burnaston over the next year. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, said the plant did not contribute to overall overcapacity in the car industry. Although Toyota has also just finished bringing on stream new plants in Japan and Kentucky - and has no immediate plans for more - Mr Toyoda also gave the clearest, albeit reluctant, indication yet that Toyota will be prepared to consider expanding Burnaston to 400,000 cars a year about the end of the decade if demand warrants - although a continental European option is not ruled out. 'In the long term, if customers in Europe show that they wish to buy Toyotas, then we would increase capacity,' he said. 'That is much better than importing from Japan, and whether it is in the UK or continental Europe doesn't really matter.' The 580-acre Burnaston site could easily accommodate an extra unit of identical size. Toyota executives acknowledge that if one were built, Toyota's spending with European suppliers would rise from an annual rate of Pounds 700m a year at 200,000 units a year to more than Pounds 1.2bn. Toyota intends to export 70 per cent of Burnaston's output to continental Europe from early next year.</p>

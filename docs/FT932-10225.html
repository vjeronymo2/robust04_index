			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / UK's late-payment culture attacked UK BUSINESSES face greater delays in the payment of bills than many of their Continental European counterparts as companies put short-term financial advantage before contractual obligations, according to a study released today. The UK's record for paying bills between 15 and 60 days late is 'notably worse' than in France, Italy, Belgium or the Netherlands, says the study undertaken by Manchester Business School for National Westminster Bank. The research underlined the problems for small businesses from late payment, which have intensified during the recession. Late payment, says the study, 'is a demonstration that the business culture ranks monetary gain above ethical behaviour.' The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 58,000 members, said last night that late payment of bills had taken a serious toll on companies across the country. Mr Tony Miller, the federation's financial affairs chairman, said: 'Clients are constantly having to chase accounts and we are now seeing companies being paid in instalments to spread the cost. It has grown much worse during the recession.' The report cast doubt on the assumption that the problem of late payment is inflicted by large companies on small suppliers. Although the finances of small companies suffer disproportionately from late payment, they are no better than large companies in paying bills promptly. 'Large companies may well be late payers, but small and medium-sized enterprises are at least as bad and probably worse,' the report says. The study supported a proposal, which has been backed by the Forum of Private Business, a small business lobby group, for legislation to give companies a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills. It also called for a reduction in credit periods, which it said would improve the cashflow of many UK companies. It said that small manufacturers and wholesalers would gain from shorter credit periods.

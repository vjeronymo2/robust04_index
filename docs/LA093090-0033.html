			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEIR RETIREMENT EDEN  </P> <P> The articles "Having it All" and "In Full Pursuit of the Good Life" (Sept. 23)  were of great interest to me.  </P> <P> My wife and I found our perfect retirement home at Rancho Monserate Country  Club in Fallbrook.  </P> <P> It is a 232-unit manufactured-home community with ownership similar to that of  a condominium. You own your home, the lot which it is located on and equal  share of all common area.  </P> <P> The common grounds include private streets a nine-hole golf course, putting  green, two tennis courts, swimming pool, spa, horse shoe court, a club house  with card rooms, exercise rooms, library and entertainment area.  </P> <P> Homeowners have their own golf carts, no green fees for golf or tennis, no  starting times needed for either. We have found the life style we had always  hoped for on retirement. We have peace, security, beautiful surroundings,  entertainment, climate, clean air and people around us who care at a budget  price we can afford.  </P> <P> RICHARD and BETH BUCK  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

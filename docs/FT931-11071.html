			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Kuwaitis seek end to secrecy on fraud probe: Government accused of cover-up KUWAITI parliamentarians and journalists said yesterday they would defy a ban imposed by the Gulf state's public prosecutor on issuing any unsanctioned information concerning alleged fraud in the management of Kuwait's overseas investments and at the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tankers Company. Mr Mohammed al-Banai, who is leading the government's investigations of the two affairs, announced the ban on Monday, into a torrent of criticism that he was party to a government cover-up. He forbade any public statement on either matter without his written permission. Members of the opposition-dominated national assembly said yesterday parliament would study the ban to see if it was constitutional. But Mr Hamad al-Jouan, who chairs the assembly's legislative committee, said the prohibition in his view was 'against the law as I know it'. He added: 'For my part, I will say whatever I know about these things - it is in the public interest and the interests of Kuwait.' The ban also angered local journalists, who have enjoyed considerable freedom since the end of the Gulf war and have led in making public disclosures of alleged corruption at KOTC. Many said the ban was an attempt by the government to block potentially embarrassing revelations. Mr Ghanim al-Najjar, a columnist at al-Wattan newspaper, said: 'The press is a vital force in opening this issue up. Without the press, investigations by the government would not have reached this stage.' The curb muddies the government's stated intention not to obstruct parliamentary or press freedom in connection with the investigations, which are the focus of considerable interest in the Gulf state. Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, information minister, said last week that Kuwait's press was entirely free and that the government would give an 'open door' to the national assembly's efforts to look into alleged scandals. Mr Mohammed al-Sagr, editor of al-Qabbas, said he would continue to publish information on both affairs, though without naming names. Mr al-Banai has refused any comment on his investigations into the Kuwait Investment Office's loss-making Spanish investments and into an alleged multi-million dollar fraud at KOTC. But he said on Monday that any information spread by Kuwaitis risked damaging the 'public interest'. The public prosecutor is understood to have detained for questioning at least one former top official at KOTC over an alleged fraud said by Mr Ali al-Baghli, the oil minister, to amount to at least Dollars 13m (Pounds 8.6m). Al-Qabbas newspaper has already named two former KOTC officials in connection with the investigation. According to local media reports, and some senior Kuwaitis, Mr al-Banai is looking into claims that some senior officials at KOTC chartered oil storage tankers to the government at a profit, pocketing the difference. Mr al-Banai is also understood to have frozen the Kuwaiti assets of three ex-employees of KIO and their direct relatives, although no charges against them have been brought in the Gulf state. Spain's senior monetary court last week rejected a criminal lawsuit brought by Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company, against seven of its former executives. Torras is appealing the decision.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Brittan to stay on in Brussels: Decision by disappointed Sir Leon averts damaging row over Europe Sir Leon Brittan averted another damaging political row over Europe yesterday by announcing his intention to stay on as the UK's senior commissioner in Brussels. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Sir Leon said he was 'disappointed' he had lost responsibility for relations with east and central Europe. But he said his diminished portfolio - responsibility for multilateral trade and relations with developed countries  -was an 'important' challenge. He pledged to remain in Brussels to argue for a Europe that was 'open, free-trading and non-interventionist, and for a Britain that is at the heart of that Europe'. Coincidentally, Sir Leon was attending a meeting between EU foreign ministers and their counterparts from six countries seeking membership of the Union - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. He was speaking two days after he narrowly lost a battle to retain responsibility for western Europe's former communist neighbours in the carve-up of Commission portfolios announced by Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming Commission president. The task of organising the early admission of former communist countries to the Union - a central plank of UK strategy towards the development of the EU  -went to Mr Hans Van den Broek of the Netherlands. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said he was 'extremely glad' that Sir Leon had chosen to stay in the Commission. He was clearly relieved that Mr John Major's government would not have to contemplate disputes over a successor. 'The portfolio Sir Leon has will continue to be essential and it is therefore very good that this important job should continue to be in sound and strong hands in the Commission,' Mr Hurd said. Yesterday's meeting was the first in which eastern Europe was able to influence debate on EU policy, putting views on topics from justice and home affairs, to the environment, education and training. Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, said: 'This was a very important meeting. For the first time we had the chance to have a certain influence on discussions. It helped EU ministers to understand our priorities and aspirations.' Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, reassured the east European ministers that progress towards full Union membership was not moving too slowly. 'What we require is a realistic and sober approach to bringing them into the EU,' he said. 'Economic aid at the end of the day can only help the countries to help themselves.' Ministers discussed ideas for an accession strategy, in particular bringing east European laws into line with those in the west to allow the six to operate within the EU's single market. Changes to the Phare aid programme, a main source of EU financial assistance to the former communist countries, were also discussed. The six countries want to see the limit on infrastructure spending lifted from 15 per cent of the total budget. Brittan finds solace in past achievement, Page 3</p>

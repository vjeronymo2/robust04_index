			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Anheuser posts record sales and earnings Surging beer sales helped Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, achieve record sales and earnings in the second quarter and first half of the year. The St Louis-based group yesterday said beer sales to wholesalers jumped 3.3 per cent, to 23.4m barrels, in second three months of 1994. By the end of June, the Budweiser family of beers commanded 43.7 per cent of the brewing industry's total US sales, up 1.2 percentage points from last year's level. The volume gains translated into a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter revenues, to Dollars 3.6bn, against Dollars 3.42bn in the corresponding period of 1993. Operating income jumped 7.5 per cent to Dollars 576.6m, primarily as a result of the performance of the US brewing business. Profits at Campbell Taggart, the company's baking division, declined as higher commodity prices put pressure on margins. Net income reached an all-time high of Dollars 322.5m, 4.5 per cent higher than the year-earlier figure of Dollars 308.6m. Earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, were Dollars 1.20, against Dollars 1.11 last time . For the first six months of the year, Anheuser Busch posted net income of Dollars 527m, or Dollars 1.96 a share, on revenues of Dollars 6.62bn. The results compare with earnings of Dollars 502.7m, or Dollars 1.80, on Dollars 6.3bn in sales in the 1993 half.</p>

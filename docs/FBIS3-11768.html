[Rodriguez] Look, it is rather difficult to talk about who  has the money, because everyone says: Well, who has it, because  I do not have it. And there are those who even question whether  there is an excess of currency. I believe some colleagues are  still thinking that this issue of the 14 salaries, or the 14  months of pay cannot be true, that there must be an error.    However, when you make an analysis of the bank  accounts....[pauses] I recently had access to some data, to some  research made by some banks and some economic research centers,  and they said that 10 percent of those people having savings  accounts accrue almost 60 percent of all the money saved by  savings account owners in the People's Savings Bank. If we  analyze the fact that the money can be kept by society in the  same manner, we are saying that approximately 10 percent of the  active population, 10 percent of the people who are actively  working, must have accrued that high percentage of money.    [Roque] But this is only a supposition.    [Rodriguez] A supposition in the case of the money on the  street, but there are precise data about the money kept in the  bank. I believe that...    [Roque, interrupting] Are you trying to establish a parallel  line between the number of people who have money in the bank and  those who might have that excess money on the street?    [Rodriguez] Yes, I base this on the argument used by the  economists as well. I agree with them in this point: If you  analyze that 10 percent of the people with savings accounts have  60 percent of all the money, and that the remaining 90 percent  of savers have only 40 percent of the money, well then we can  transfer that to the remaining money which is circulating  outside and we can say, not categorically, but we can logically  say that 10 percent of the working people have most of the money  which is circulating today.    [Roque] You said you would delve deeper into this subject.    [Rodriguez] Yes. Let us delve deeper. I believe that in  order  to reach certain conclusions regarding the highly complex issue  of who has the excess currency... [pauses] because we cannot  know since we cannot conduct a door to door search because that  would be a violation of everyone's right to keep money at home.  Thus we have to conduct an anlysis in an effort to get an  approximation of the truth.    For example, underground market prices...    [Roque, interrupting] The black market, so that everyone  understands clearly.    [Rodriguez] What happens is that according to economists,  the  term black market does not encompass everything. The black  market is only that part of the market based on illegal  merchandise. However, when you and I exchange our rations of  cigarettes or rum, that is also the underground economy and this  we are seeing more of this. When I render a service and charge  you a lot, that is the underground economy. It is not precisely  the black market. Thus, the term underground economy is broader.    [Roque] I am glad you clarified this because in a recent  program we were left with doubts about the underground economy  and the black market.    [Rodriguez] The black market falls within the underground  economy.    [Roque] Let us return to our subject.    [Rodriguez] When we analyze the underground economy and its  prices, undoubtely it is clear that most people participating in  the underground economy have gone from purely buyers to sellers.  Why, if this did not happen before, is it taking place now? When  you speak with the people you hear: I have to sell something in  order to buy something.    The high prices are not set by the money in circulation  money  or the lack of supply alone, but because there are people with  plenty of money capable of affording that merchandise because  they have money in abundance. You and I, perhaps, who live off  our salaries alone, who do not have another source of income but  our slaries, find it hard to fully participate in that market  because that is a market which has become smaller.    [Roque] The truth be told, we frequently have no choice but  to access that market.    [Rodriguez] We have to because, as everyone knows, the  official market does not guarantee all the basic needs of the  Cuban family nowadays. Therefore, we have to access that  informal, underground economy to meet a number of needs,  merchandise as well as services.    [Roque] Particularly, essential needs.    [Rodriguez] The most necessary. For example, food. That is  one of the things for which most people have to access that  market. However, when you access this market you are not in a  position to do this at any price because you are not well off.  Undoubtedly, there is someone who sets the prices. That someone  is the people who have a lot of money.    In a study....[pauses] There are several studies on the  underground economy; this has not escaped study by specialists.  They have studied the underground economy thoroughly in terms of  research and polls. Although there is no data, because is it  highly difficult to determine the percentage of merchandise  moved, there are estimates. It is known that at the same level  that the national economy experienced a shortage of supplies,  the underground economy experienced the same crisis, in the same  proportion. The movement of merchandise within the underground  economy for 1992 was estimated at 15 billion pesos. This does  not mean 15 billion in the hands of the underground economy but  that the same peso that you give someone is given to someone  else and the money circulates.    [Roque] What should be understood clearly is that the  phenomenon of the underground economy is not a trait of the  special period alone. It is something that has been there all  along and it happens in other societies. Capitalism also has an  underground economy.    [Rodriguez] Capitalism is the seed. The origin of the  underground economy origin lies in capitalism.    When you analyze the underground economy and the way it  operates in a capitalist country, and the way it operates in our  country, the characteristics are very different.    [Roque] Well, I think we are moving away from the objective  we have set for today, which is to learn who has the excess  currency.    [Rodriguez] I want to return to that part when we got into  the disquisitions about the way the underground economy  operates. We must clearly understand that the merchandise  circulating within the underground economy comes from the state  companies or from the state stores.    [Roque] And this is caused by the lack of control and leads  to theft, etc.    [Rodriguez] Of course, theft is fostered by the lack of  control, and this lack of economic control is what gives an  injection of merchandise to the underground economy. Many people  often ask: And if that merchandise is found in the black market,  why is it not controlled and returned to the state stores?    I think this is a question asked by everyone, even by the  company directors. They ask: Well, what happened to my  merchandise? It was taken from my store. Well, when you make an  inventory at the end of the year, it is reported as a loss, and  often not even as loss because it involves products not yet paid  for, and this is what unleashes all these problems we are  experiencing in our own homes.    [Roque] It is time now to arrive at a conclusion on this  subject.    [Rodriguez] Well, to conclude this idea, it is obvious that  a  small group of citizens have most of that excess of currency,  more than 11 billion pesos -- well, it was 11 billion by  December. We are now deep into 1994, and perhaps it must have  already increased to almost 12 billion, or perhaps to 11.5 or  11.6 billion, because I have no idea of the rate of increase in  the excess currency. But it is known that only a small number of  citizens have it. It is known that this small group of citizens  are today called money hoarders [macetas]. We know that these  people are the ones who are today affecting the tranquillity and  the development of this society. But the workers in the  workplaces are loudly demanding firm action against these  people. I believe that when action is taken against them, and  when measures are adopted to make a financial balance, when  there is control, and when production supplies the markets  again, then we will talk about other subjects, but no longer  about excess currency or who has the money, or what problems are  there to increase the black market.    [Roque] I am happy that you concluded your statement in this  manner, but I want to make it clear to you that there is more  need to make people aware of this problem, and that they must be  willing to solve it.    [Rodriguez] Of course. I think we must say that this will  not  be solved by collecting all the money, because money is not a  problem in itself, but something that serves to barter, a means  of barter, but it is nothing materially important.    [Roque] I want to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez for being with us  to answer this question: Who has the excess currency?</p>

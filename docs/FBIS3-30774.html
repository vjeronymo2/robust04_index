He was referring to the statement made by Slovak Premier  Vladimir Meciar at the Wednesday [2 February] meeting of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which he is  chairman, announcing protective measures against imports even  from the Czech Republic.    Ducky said the intention was to protect the Slovak currency.  The instability of the Slovak crown could cause problems with  the exchange of goods. He stressed there was no contradiction  between Meciar's statement and his own participation in talks on  trade liberalisation.    The individual partners of the Central European Free Trade  Agreement (CEFTA) do not agree on the timing of steps towards  liberalisation. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic are  progressing towards it, Poland and Hungary are moving "more  slowly," he said.    Ducky said the idea of expanding CEFTA, possibly by the  inclusion of Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, was good because,  given the competition, the free trade zone needed about 200  million people. The present CEFTA countries have a total  population of 65 million.    The reason why mutual trade within CEFTA was developing only  slowly was the fact that the member states were first of all  attempting to try out independent policies, he explained. What  is more, since their economies were all bogged down with heavy  industry, the countries experienced the same shortages and  surpluses.</p>

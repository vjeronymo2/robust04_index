There are  fluctuations caused by nonuniform precipitation due to  medium)scale (several hundred meters) atmospheric turbulence.  Thereafter such statistical phenomena are called intermediate  statistics. Local fluctuations of contamination density due to  heterogeneous migration of radio nuclides (caused first of all  by microrelief of the terrain) when the size of the studied  territory is under 10 m are called local statistics. The  objective of the work was to determine the character of  statistical distributions caused by local and intermediate  statistics, the number of soil samples necessary for determining  the surface density of radioactive contamination with required  accuracy, and parameters and structures of statistical  regularities of the entire set of available data on soil  pollution in Bryansk oblast settlements (selected because the  largest volume of information is available for the oblast). At  the local statistics level the distribution of radioactivity of  soil samples is lognormal. At the intermediate statistics level  the distribution is also lognormal, but with a larger standard  deviation. Figures 8, references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

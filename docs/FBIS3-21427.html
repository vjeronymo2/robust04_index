			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bonn, February 3--The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut  Kohl, today assured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao,  that his country would do everything in its power to boost  industrial and technological co-operation with India and  announced that a high-level Indo-German commission on science  and technology would be set up soon, report PTI and UNI.    Addressing the Indo-German economic conference along with Mr  Rao, the German Chancellor said India's economic development was  on the "right course" and acknowledged that there was scope for  further increasing German investments in India.    Mr Rao, declaring there was "absolutely no hesitation or  dilution in the commitment to liberalisation," urged German  industrialists to take "one more determined step" to increase  the flow of investments, in view of the "ideal opportunity"  provided by the reforms process in India.    The Prime Minister assured both Indian and German  industrialists at the conference that he and Dr Kohl would solve  "any problem, if it comes to our level."    The two leaders told the delegates that both India and  Germany were aware of the vast and untapped potential for  further deepening and strengthening bilateral economic relations.    The federal government and German industry were following  India's policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and  "modern India, with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at  liberalisation, is one of our most important partners on the  Asian continent," the German leader told Mr Rao.    Mr Rao said further liberalisation to cover some more items  was on the anvil. The items to be liberalised were those which  one could think of, he said and added that he could not say a  syllable more because the Union budget was only three weeks away.    Mr Rao welcomed the Asia offensive of the German  industrialists who are increasingly turning towards the  Asia-Pacific region for investments. India, Japan and China have  been identified as major thrust areas by the newly-launched  Asia-Pacific Association (APA).    In his observations, the president of the Confederation of  Indian Industry (CII), Mr Jamshed N. Godrej, announced the  signing of a memorandum of understanding between CII and BDI  (the German federation of industry).    Mr Godrej said India, Germany and Singapore could enter into  trilateral partnership to exploit the complimentaries and  individual advantages in areas of skilled manpower, technology  and industrial sophistication.    Meanwhile, Germany has told India that it would continue to  adopt a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and avoid making any  value judgment in the matter.    The issue figured prominently during the talks Mr Rao had  with German leaders, during which he voiced serious concern over  the problems his country faced with regard to Pakistan's aid to  terrorists in the Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir and  Punjab.    The issue also figured during the foreign secretary-level  talks where the Indian foreign secretary, Mr K. Srinivasan,  briefed his German counterpart on the outcome of the recent  foreign secretary level talks in Islamabad and the subsequent  six proposals mooted by New Delhi."    Germany urged India to sign the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty (NPT), which New Delhi has refused to comply with,  arguing that the existing global non-proliferation regimes were  discriminatory against the developing countries.    The German Chancellor reiterated his strong commitment to  nuclear non-proliferation which he has been consistently and  resolutely pursuing at all international fora.    The German leader told Mr Rao that strengthening the  existing  global non-proliferation regimes must take "absolute priority"  and reiterated his government's resolve for an indefinite  unconditional extension of the NPT in 1995.    The two countries have been engaged in a comprehensive  dialogue on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and other  political matters of mutual concept at the foreign office-level  talks for quite some time. The two sides have already held three  rounds and the fourth round is due to commence shortly.    Three high-level ministerial delegations from Germany will  visit India in the first half of the current year.    An official spokesman today said these high-level visits,  which will follow Mr Rao's current visit, were in line with  Germany's "new-look" Asia concept unfolded by the Chancellor, Dr  Helmut Kohl.    The spokesman said the German development co-operation  minister would visit India next month, followed by the visit of  the German economic co-operation minister in April.    The German vice-chancellor and foreign affairs minister, Mr  Klaus Kinkel, is expected to come in May.    The new German perception was that it had put too many eggs  in the European basket. It now wanted to expand its influence in  Asia as well and had identified India, Japan and China for  cementing ties, the spokesman said.    Mr Rao's visit, his second to Germany in less than three  years, was extremely important because Germany had already  declared India "a partner of choice in Asia." Germany had also  described its relationship with India as a "strategic" one.    Germany, Europe's number one and the world's third largest  economy, till recently used to be the second largest investor in  India, after the United States, but had gone down to the tenth  position after 1990.    However, trade volume between India and Germany had been  growing steadily and touched nearly 5.5 billion Deutsche Mark  (DM) in 1992. It was anticipated to cross the DM 6 billion mark  in the current financial year.    Indian exports to Germany have been getting more and more  sophisticated and diversified.</p>

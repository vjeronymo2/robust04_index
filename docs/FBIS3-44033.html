Diplomats  attributed the lull in the fighting to heavy overnight rains,  but said they believed the factions were still holding their  positions.    Meanwhile South Africa's foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha,  has  ruled out his country's immediate military intervention in  Lesotho, where rival army groups have been engaging in sporadic  fighting for the past 10 days. This follows an appeal by  Lesotho's prime minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, to President  Frederick de Klerk to send in a peace keeping force to help  stabilize Lesotho. But in a radio interview in Johannesburg  today Mr. Botha said while South African troops had been asked  to keep a close watch on the border in case of a spill over  effect, there were no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho. He  said the sending of troops to Lesotho would reduce the number of  security forces which are needed more inside South Africa. He  said in the meantime he had sent reports to the secretary  generals of the United Nations, the Commonwealth, and  Organization of African Unity to make sure they realize the  situation may deteriorate and may eventually end up as another  Somalia.</p>

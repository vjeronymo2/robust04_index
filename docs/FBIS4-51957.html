			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hanminjon on Development of Fast Breeder Reactor in S. </F> Korea"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published  a white paper on May 2 denouncing the South Korean puppet clique  for stepping up nuclear armament through the development of the  fast breeder reactor, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice  of National Salvation.    The South Korean rulers' design to develop the fast breeder  reactor began in the `80s and they started the development of a  prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan at the beginning of  the `90s, the white paper said, and continued:    The "government" authorities signed an agreement on  cooperation in the field of atomic energy with Japan on May 25,  1990, and agreed with it to "promote the exchange and joint  study of atomic technologies." It discussed with Japan "the  joint promotion of the development of technologies of the  next-generation atomic reactor" at the "South Korea-Japan  consultative meeting on atomic energy" held on November 9, 1990.    At the tete-a-tete between Kim Yong-sam and Morihiro  Hosokawa  in Kyongju on November 6, 1993, they agreed in secrecy to  proceed with the joint development of nuclear weapons on  condition that South Korea makes a clean sheet of Japan's past  crimes.    The "government" authorities decided to invest about 2,000  billion won in the researches and development of atomic energy  including the development of the fast breeder reactor and began  developing a prototype reactor in 1992.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now running about to get  the international community to recognize the "legality" of the  development of the fast breeder reactor. They hosted an  "international symposium on the reactors of next generation" in  October 1993, in Seoul at which they wrested a promise from  some officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to  "cooperate in the development of the next-generation reactor in  South Korea."    Noting that the development of the fast breeder reactor  accelerated by South Korea with desperate efforts together with  Japan, though its economic advantage and stability are not  guaranteed in the world, is motivated by their design of nuclear  arms development, the white paper explained the following  reasons:    Firstly, the development of the fast breeder reactor makes  it  possible to breed large quantities of plutonium necessary for  nuclear bombs.    Secondly, it offers a ground for justifying the purchase of  plutonium from other countries.    Thirdly, the fast breeder reactor must be accompanied by  reprocessing facilities. This fully explains why the Kim  Yong-sam group is trying so desperately to possess reprocessing  facilities through the development of the fast breeder reactor.    Fourthly, the development of the fast breeder reactor itself  is a process of nuclear bomb development. The designing of the  fast breeder reactor is identical with that of nuclear bombs  from the technical point of view.    This stark fact clearly proves that it is none other than  the  South Korean ruling group of traitors that reduced to a piece of  waste paper long ago the joint declaration on denuclearization  agreed on between the North and the South and have been hell  bent on nuclear arms development on the Korean peninsula.    The white paper demanded that the South Korean authorities  eliminate the pressurized heavy water reactor and the  multi-purpose research reactor and, at the same time, promptly  stop the development of the fast breeder reactor and that the  international reactionary forces including Japan discontinue  working hand in glove with the Kim Yong-sam group in the  development of the fast breeder reactor directly linked to the  production of nuclear bombs.    It expressed the hope that the unbiased opinion of the world  will persistently keep tabs on the development of the fast  breeder reactor and nuclear weapons by the South Korean rulers  and invigorate the activities for checking it.</p>

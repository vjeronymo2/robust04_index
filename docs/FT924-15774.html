			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Jardine group's Hong Kong plodder takes a surprise step - The company that launched a dawn raid on Trafalgar House HONGKONG Land may be the plodder in Jardine's portfolio of Hong Kong-based companies, but its capacity to surprise cannot be questioned. In May, it stunned the colony's financial community when it sold one of its prime office and retail properties to a group of mainland Chinese investors for HKDollars 3.8bn (USDollars 492m). The terms of the sale underlined what a superb deal it was. The Chinese buyers paid HKDollars 400m up front, with the balance payable in three instalments by March 1993. Until the last payment, Hongkong Land keeps rental income from the property plus title. The move hardly dented the company's hold on the best properties in the central business district of Victoria Island - it still owns 4.9m square feet of prime office and retail space - but it did lead property analysts to re-rate the sector. Most importantly, in light of yesterday's raid on Trafalgar House, it promised to eradicate outstanding debt on Hongkong Land's balance sheet by the end of 1993. The local financial community has been expecting the company to use its virtually debt-free balance sheet to make a major acquisition. Given the nature of the company, the most talked of acquisitions were properties in the portfolio of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company. This was given added credence by the presence of O&amp;Y executives in Hong Kong in the past year. Trafalgar House is well known to Jardine. Both companies operate a joint venture civil engineering and construction company in the colony, Gammon. Over the past year, however, there have been signs that Hongkong Land wanted to diversify away from its core property, construction and management business. This year, it is leading a consortium of companies in bidding for the right to develop the ninth container terminal at Kwai Chung, the colony's state-of-the-art container port. The tilt at Trafalgar House is another sign that Hongkong Land seeks a broader canvas. But its bid to acquire 29.9 per cent of the UK builder will prompt a number of concerns in Hong Kong. Jardine led the exodus from Hong Kong in 1984 when it moved its domicile to Bermuda and, more recently, pricked the thin skins of the establishment with its unsuccessful attempt to escape the local regulatory environment for London. Yesterday's bid will reinforce local cynicism that this is another example of a British Hong Kong company 'going home', like HSBC Holding's acquisition of Midland Bank. More seriously, those with a sense of history will remember that it was Hongkong Land's diversification in the 1970s, together with the collapse in property prices in Hong Kong in 1982-83, that nearly brought Jardine to its knees. The Keswick family's grasp on the empire was regained only after a major restructuring of Hongkong Land which saw: the creation of a separately-listed Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental; the sale of Hongkong Electric - to Li Ka-shing - together with a fire sale of some of the company's better residential holdings; and, the creation of Jardine Pacific to hold the company's traditional trading businesses. The difference this time is that in both its bid for a slice of Terminal 9 and its bid for a significant minority in Trafalgar House, the Keswicks are not betting the empire. The Trafalgar investment represents around 9 per cent of the company's net assets of HKDollars 34bn; its potential stake in Terminal 9 a little less. In both ventures the company is seeking board representation but not full operational control.</p>

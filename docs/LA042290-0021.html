			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOR KIDS;  </P> <P> A HAVEN FOR LITTLE BOOKWORMS  </P> <P> CHILDREN CAN FIND themselves -- or lose themselves -- at Quinby's for the  Curious Child, which carries books about inner and outer exploration, from  self-awarness-focused stories to travel adventures. Not that Quinby's is stuffy  or reeks of good-for-you wholesomeness.  </P> <P> Children are welcome to grab volumes off the shelves, station themselves  wherever they please -- on the floor or in the aisles -- and read, unmindful to  the adults stepping over and around them.  </P> <P> The selection ranges from sturdy infant/toddler volumes designed to survive  gumming and gnawing to an excellent collection of books for the advanced junior  reader. Non-fiction topics include science and nature, biography, arts and  history.  </P> <P> Quinby's also stocks hard-to-find foreign-language books, children's sing-along  tapes, book-and-audio-tape gift sets and classic children's films on video. The  cartoon tie-in products so prevalent in larger shops are avoided -- mercifully,  there's not a Smurf or a Mutant Ninja Turtle in sight.  </P> <P>  Quinby's for the Curious Child, 1109 Montana Ave., Santa Monica; (213)  394-1141.  </P> <P> KAY DIEHL  </P></p>

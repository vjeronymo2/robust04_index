			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / MMI stops new policy sales after rescue fails MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the stricken local authority-owned insurance company, yesterday ceased to sell new policies or renew existing ones after acknowledging that rescue talks with a French insurer had broken down. Existing policies will remain in force, although MMI is placing a seven-day moratorium on claims payments while it explores arrangements which would allow it to meet claims arising from existing policies. The announcement led to fresh criticism last night of the Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the insurance industry. Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said: 'The ninth largest insurance group in the country is creeping towards insolvency without sight or sound of the Department of Trade and Industry. Why have we not heard from the president of the Board of Trade? Where is he?' It ends a confusing few days in which MMI insisted that talks with Paris-based Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires would take place despite statements to the press by the French company on Monday that it was no longer interested in acquiring MMI's business. MMI originally reached agreement in principle to transfer its business to GMF in July. Its future has been in doubt since it reported net assets down to Pounds 4.9m in May, well below solvency margins generally accepted as adequate in the industry. Local authorities will press creditors to accept a 'scheme of arrangement' which would avert a full-scale liquidation of Municipal Mutual. Last night, Jardine Insurance Brokers notified councils of a temporary Lloyd's of London facility for many risks. Mr Geoff Filkin, secretary of the Association of District Councils, said local authorities associations would meet MMI today to 'see the best ways of dealing with the company's assets and liabilities.' MMI is in talks with leading insurers to transfer some parts of its business, including its portfolio of home and motor policies, to other insurers. Its Prime Health health insurance subsidiary will continue to write new business, while its life assurance subsidiary, Prosperity Life, will write renewals but not issue new policies. Cheltenham and Gloucester building society said yesterday that it had agreed to transfer all 216,000 MMI policies which it had already sold to its mortgage borrowers to General Accident, the Perth-based insurer. GA is also to write C&amp;G's new business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Felix Soh] </F>   [Text] Malaysia has proposed that workers involved in  Growth Triangle projects should be allowed easier movement  between the three countries.    Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said  yesterday that he raised this matter during talks with Singapore  leaders.    Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day  official visit here, he said he had also suggested that  arrangements be made to facilitate the speedy crossing of the  Causeway for tourists from Malaysia and Singapore.    Datuk Abdullah, who was here at the invitation of his  Singapore counterpart Professor S.Jayakumar, yesterday met Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong and had a two-hour informal dialogue with  Young PAP [People's Action Party] members. On Monday, he called  on President Ong Teng Cheong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew,  Deputy Prime Minister BG [Brigadier General] Lee Hsien Loong and  Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng.    He said that these meetings provided an "excellent  opportunity" for him to discuss bilateral matters as well as  forthcoming events like the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional  Forum in July.    At the press conference, Datuk Abdullah said that there  should be closer contact between the young people of Singapore  and Malaysia to improve their understanding of each other.    He disclosed that he had mooted proposals for the easier  flow  of the labour force working on specific projects in the three  Growth Triangle countries, and between Singapore and Malaysia  during his talks with Singapore ministers.    He said: "We want to see more projects which are established  on the basis of bilateral and trilateral collaboration, not just  individual country projects."    He elaborated: "In other words, we will have Singaporeans,  Indonesians and Malaysians working together and experiencing a  new cooperative effort to cultivate projects successfully. We  can optimise the labour and skill resources and consultancy  services available.    "In my view, this is the sort of modality that can become  the  catalyst for future closer relations between the three  countries."    He said Singapore leaders had told him that they would look  into the matter.    He stressed that he was not advocating a general opening of  immigration doors.    Said Datuk Abdullah: "I don't want to create the  misunderstanding that I am suggesting to my brother countries --  please open your doors wide and allow anyone to enter and ask  for jobs.    "I am talking in terms of specific projects which have been  set up under the name of the Southern Triangle venture so that  those who are involved in these projects should be given the  facility to move in and out.    "For example, if some Johoreans want to work in Batam or  Singapore, then they should be allowed to move there quickly and  come out."    On implementing measures to facilitate the crossing of the  Causeway for tourists, he said the recently-completed  North-South Highway had made it more attractive to travel by  road to Singapore and vice-versa. "Why can't we make some  arrangement to allow tourists to cross the border very quickly  and not get caught at the Causeway for hours?" he asked. "The  Causeway check-point has become a choke-point."    One measure, he suggested, could be prior checking in the  city. With a special permit, passengers on a tourist bus can be  cleared without their having to disembark for immigration checks.    "The point is, if you want to encourage tourism in Malaysia  and Singapore, let's have such an arrangement so that both  countries can benefit," he said.</p>

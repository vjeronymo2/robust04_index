			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Rukina, deputy in the Moscow City Duma, </F> under the rubric "Point of View": "Bankruptcy Is Too Harsh a  Measure"]    [Text] We waited a long time for the appearance of a  military doctrine, linking to it the solution to many problems  of the defense industry. Now the basic principles of the  doctrine have been approved, but this has not removed any of the  defense industry's concerns. And it will hardly provide any  relief until priorities are defined for the development of  enterprises of the defense complex, a state policy toward these  enterprises is formed and an appropriate legal situation is  established.    What do I consider especially important in this area? First  of all, there must be a flexible approach to the defense NII  [scientific research institutes], KB [design offices] and  plants. Some of them must unquestionably remain state, or  "public," entities, while the rest must be told unequivocally  that they are now "free" and have the authority to decide on  their own how they want to continue to operate.    The designation "public" certainly does not mean any  constriction of rights, however. On the contrary, they should be  given as much independence as possible, even to the point of  allowing them to act as responsible state clients. That is, not  just the right to fill state orders but also to develop and  establish a program for the production, sale and servicing of  this or that combat equipment or weapon system.    If the enterprises are to act as a state clients, this will  require that they set up an entire infrastructure around  themselves for development, research, production, servicing and  operation, the training of specialists, and so forth. In short,  for the functioning of an entire area of the defense industry.  These will be fairly efficacious structures. Take the Moscow  Aviation Production Association, for example. During the past  year and a half it has succeeded to some degree in setting up  such a structure. It has learned how to set up new relations  with its subcontractors, learned how not just to turn out  products but how to sell them, and offered new approaches to the  servicing of its products. Despite economic and financial  difficulties, last year the association invested more than a  billion rubles in science and as far as possible supported the  design offices of its main subcontractors. Thanks in great part  to this approach the enterprises retained its cooperative ties,  its personnel and its capacity for producing extremely complex  aviation systems. And this was despite the fact that it actually  received no financing.    Prominent economists and politicians of ours assert that a  market economy presupposes certain bankruptcy for many  enterprises and, they say, this should be regarded as something  necessary. The budget today is indeed so small that it cannot  lift up the entire defense industry. But does this mean that the  process should be left to take its own course?    We can and should point out that most of the enterprises  have  survived. There is no need to invest funds in and attempt to  revive clearly unprofitable enterprises. We need to help the  thriving, strong firms, but with the stipulation that they  assume patronage over those which will not be able to survive on  their own.    For what reason should a thriving enterprise concern itself  with a clearly unprofitable one, you will ask. And are there any  thriving enterprises today? There are. I am not certain that  they are known, to be sure. There is a universal cry, after all,  that everyone today is engaged in commerce and no one is  producing anything. Things are being produced. The fact that  these producers are frequently stuck in rented space, do not  have their own funds and bear an enormous tax burden is another  matter.    It is very important today to find people in a firm who have  actually demonstrated that it is profitable to produce things. I  have no doubt that others will follow in their footsteps. Only  he who has made an enterprise profitable can teach others  rapidly how to do so.    If we want to revive Russia's economy, we should not  anticipate large-scale bankruptcies--that is too harsh a  measure--but orient ourselves toward the producer. This will not  require much: Just to make the tax system not a hindrance but a  production regulator. One approach should be taken to the  producers, another to the commercial structures. That does not  mean that the commercial structures should be pressured. It is  perhaps no less important today to learn civilized trade than to  learn civilized production. In order to develop trade, however,  we must have goods. The producer must therefore still be in the  front.    The second problem which must be solved is that of improving  the banking system. The banks today are actually over industry.  Nowhere else in the world are people living with loan rates like  ours, more than 200 percent. If the situation does reach the  point of large-scale bankruptcies, the banks will find  themselves the owners of those very unprofitable enterprises.  Will they be capable of running them? I doubt it. It will most  likely result in the collapse of the Russian economy, and we  will have to go through the process of industrializing the  nation once again.    I am certainly not calling for state regulation of the  economy. If we begin regulating prices, that will be the end of  the market economy, since regulation is the jurisdiction of  officials, and we already have more than enough of them. When I  began studying marketing, I liked very much the principle of  producing what is advantageous to the consumer and not producing  what is not. What could be more simple? In Russia's situation,  however, it has assumed some absolutely terrible forms.    Essentially only two things are required of the state to  make  production advantageous. I would put in first place the  principle: Do not interfere and do not do any harm. The second  thing would be to set up a legal playing field in which all of  the rules of the game are precisely defined. If we do not help  ourselves, no one else is going to do so. And something has to  be done rapidly. Rapidly and correctly. Otherwise, we risk  losing the defense complex as such. Without creating anything to  take its place.</p>

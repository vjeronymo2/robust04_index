			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (3): In place of the west - Trade links with Asia are increasingly important To declare that Kansai has important commercial ties with Asia - as Kansai officials and businessmen often do - is something of a truism: Japan's whole economy is dependent on Asia, and Kansai is no exception. Like other Japanese companies, Kansai-based corporations such as Matsushita Electric and Sharp have invested and traded heavily in Asia. Like other regions of Japan, Kansai has been affected by the strength of the yen, and its industries are embarking on a new round of factory relocations from Japan to cheaper sites in south-east Asia and China. But Kansai boasts that its trade links with other Asian countries go back to the eighth century, when Nara was a terminus of the silk road; and even to the fifth century, when Osaka is said to have thrived as one of Japan's first sea ports. Today Kansai collectively continues to emphasise the importance of Asia and Asia's fast-growing economies. Businessmen, disappointed by the performance of their investments in Europe and America, sometimes take it for granted that the west is in decline and therefore rely on Asia more than ever. About 47 per cent of exports from Kansai go to Asia - more than to North America and Europe combined. (Asia takes only 34 per cent of Japanese exports as a whole). Asia also provides the biggest share of Kansai's imports (43 per cent, compared with 32 per cent for the whole of Japan). Traditionally, most of these imports to Japan have been raw materials or agricultural and seafood products - logs from Asia's dwindling tropical forests can be seen floating in the big lumber pools at Osaka's port - but they now include electronic goods and vehicle components made by Japanese factories in south-east Asia. 'We still serve as the gateway for south-east Asian products, and also we've made large-scale investments in practically all countries in Asia,' says Mr Michio Sugimoto, managing director of the Osaka chamber of commerce and industry. In the lobby of the chamber's building, a digital sign keeps track of the rise of the yen against the dollar, an obsession for Japanese companies which are finding it harder and harder to compete in international markets. 'Lots of small companies in Osaka are now thinking of investing in Asia, including China and Vietnam,' says Mr Kazuo Ishii, director general of the Japan External Trade Organisation's Osaka branch. The potential of China's domestic market of 1.2bn people and the size of its labour force have attracted intense interest - and investments - from local businesses; the ports of Kobe and Osaka handle some 40 per cent of Japan's growing trade with China. 'One of our staff in Osaka who came from Beijing is now very busy giving lectures on China,' says Mr Ishii. Kansai's reputation as a centre of commerce is enhanced by the large number of foreigners living in the region. They include half of Japan's 700,000 Koreans (who provide links to both South and North Korea), Indians based in Kobe (who trade with Africa and the Indian subcontinent), and Chinese residents. Both the Osaka Foreign Trade Association and the Kansai Economic Federation (Kankeiren) are seeking to strengthen their links with the overseas Chinese, who dominate commerce and distribution throughout much of Asia. Japanese government organisations, along with local authorities and businesses in Kansai, have also promoted several big projects to improve Kansai's standing as an Asian and international commercial centre. These include the new airport, whose 24-hour operation will be particularly useful for regional air freight services used for everything from seafood and cut flowers to microchips, and the Asia and Pacific Trade Centre (ATC) opened in Osaka in April. One of the ATC's principal aims is to promote imports from Asia, to deflect criticism of Japan's trade surpluses and the difficulty of selling goods in the Japanese market. 'We'd like to energise transport links between Japan and the rest of the world, and traditionally this area has strong ties with east Asia,' says Mr Tetsuro Kawakami, chairman of Kankeiren and of Sumitomo Electric Industries. In the future increasingly high-level technology will be transferred from Japan to other countries in Asia, he believes. 'We can't survive without our east Asian partners,' says Mr Kawakami. 'We have to divide our work with them.'</p>

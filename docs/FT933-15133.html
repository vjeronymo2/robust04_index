			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Plans for Scottish water attacked MR Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of 'going halfway down the road to water privatisation' with his plans for restructuring the Scottish water industry. In Thurday's white paper on reorganising local government in Scotland, Mr Lang said that water and sewerage services would remain under public ownership and operation. They would, however, be transferred from the 12 regional and island authorities which own them to three new water authorities. The white paper says the private sector will have a major role in providing and financing 'much of the essential and large capital investment programme over the next decade' under the Treasury's new policy on private finance for public investments. Mr Charles Gray, convener of the Labour-controlled Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said yesterday that the government was taking the same path as that followed in the approach to the privatisation of the water industry in England and Wales. But Mr Lang said: 'There is absolutely no need to move any further on water than we are going at the moment.' He gave few details on how the private sector would be involved with the Scottish water industry, which needs Pounds 5bn of upgrading over the next 15 years. But he hinted that water treatment plants could be developed through schemes under which private-sector companies would build, operate and own the plants, transferring the treated water to the water authori-ties. Water industry analysts believe there will be a lot of interest among English and Welsh water companies in co-operating with the new Scottish water authorities. Provided the investment in new plant was recouped through charges to the customer, it would be outside the public sector borrowing requirement, analysts believe. Mr Lang said the Scottish Office's plans were 'still at an embryonic stage' and there would be further consultation.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Prices at factory gates up by 0.4% THE CORE rate of inflation remained 4.4 per cent in February even though the rate rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4 per cent during the month. The core rate is a measure of the year-on-year rise in prices at factory gates. The year-on-year rate of 4.4 per cent was the lowest since mid 1988. The City had expected a rise of only 0.3 per cent for the month, but economists said underlying inflation was still on a declining trend. The latest figures suggest that many manufacturers are avoiding price increases in an attempt to maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand. Excluding volatile items such as food, drink and tobacco, the index rose by only 2.8 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with a 3.1 per cent rise in the year to January. The CSO said the February figure was the lowest since June 1969 when it was 2.7 per cent. It compares with a high of 6.4 per cent in February last year. The cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry jumped by 1.6 per cent between January and February, bringing the annual rate of increase to 0.5 per cent after a fall of 1.1 per cent in the 12 months to January.</p>

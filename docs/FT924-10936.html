			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Edgars up 5% on static growth EDGARS, the fashion retailer belonging to South African Breweries, raised sales and earnings in the six months to the end of September but failed to achieve real growth. Sales rose 9 per cent to R1.4bn (Dollars 482m) from R1.3bn a year earlier, while operating profits rose 7 per cent to R194.4m from R181.9m. Attributable earnings rose 5 per cent to R82.4m from R78.6m. The low growth in earnings testifies to the extremely tough operating environment, with private consumption expenditure expected to drop this year for the first time since 1985. In the five years to 1992, Edgars increased attributable earnings per share at a compound rate of 27.4 per cent per annum. In the half-year under review, earnings per share rose by only 5 per cent to 162 cents from 155 cents. But the dividend is being raised by 6 per cent to 38 cents per share from 36 cents. Mr George Beeton, chief executive, said the weaker consumer demand was reflected in the estimated 8 per cent growth in clothing, footwear and textiles turnover - well below inflation. He said, however, that the group had managed to outperform the market with sales rising by 9 per cent. He said costs and markdowns had been well contained, which was helped by inflation in the sector declining to an average 7 per cent. Looking at the group's divisional performance, Mr Beeton said the Edgars chain had matched its 1991 interim earnings, while Sales House gained market share and enhanced its profitability. Jet improved its results, despite the depressed state of the cash market. The group is not anticipating an upturn in retail sales in the second half of the financial year, and hence predicts sales and profit growth for the full year will be in line with the first-half performance.</p>

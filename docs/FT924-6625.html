			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pollution ruling favours generators POWER stations should be allowed to keep secret some details of pollution they emit on grounds of commercial confidentiality, according to the first government decisions under new environmental legislation, Bronwen Maddox writes. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, yesterday accepted an appeal by National Power that details of future emissions at 18 of its power stations should not be made public because they would reveal future needs for fuel and choice of fuel to its commercial disadvantage. However, at the same time he dismissed an appeal by PowerGen to keep 'different information' confidential because it was central to the process of licensing power stations. Mr Howard's decision on National Power applies only to projections of future emissions.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (2): Growth rate slips below target - The Economy NOT many countries would be dissatisfied with real output growth of 6 per cent a year and inflation below 4 per cent. Add to that a government deficit and official debt which account for just 1.6 per cent and 8 per cent of the economy respectively and most European finance ministers would be lining up to receive the William Gladstone prize for fiscal rectitude. Not so in Taiwan. A sluggish world economy has caused the island's growth rate to slip below the government's target of a 7 per cent annual expansion for most of this decade. The economy's under-performance, relative to expectations, has meant the deferral of an ambitious plan to rebuild and extend Taiwan's industrial and social infrastructure. The government now puts Taiwan's long-term potential growth at 6.5 per cent. Private economic forecasters have also revised downwards their predictions for the economy's short-term economic outlook. In July, Baring Securities, a British brokerage, expected growth in excess of 7 per cent next year. Now it is looking for 6.5 per cent in 1994 and has deferred until 1995 its hope for even faster expansion. Mr Peter Kurz, head of Baring in Taipei, says: 'Taiwan is an investment, supply-side-led economy. We expect 6 per cent growth this year and see it picking up to 6.5 per cent in 1994. If exports also pick up - and a lot depends on the US economy and China - then we could be looking for 7 per cent in 1995.' Growth in company profits, he says, tends to be sluggish, below 7 per cent growth in gross national product (GNP), Taiwan's favoured measure of output which includes net income earned abroad. 'Above that, corporate earnings rise by 20 per cent to 30 per cent,' he says. Taiwan's economic development has been one the great success stories of the post-Second World War era. The island's economic planners have pulled off a rare feat in economic management: rapid growth in output, full employment and price stability. From 1984 to 1991 the island chalked up a growth in real GNP of 8.6 per cent a year, while consumer prices inflated by just 1.8 per cent a year. The average unemployment rate during the same period was 2.1 per cent. This performance is made all the more remarkable given that Taiwan, along with the rest of the capitalist world economy, participated fully in the asset price inflation of the 1980s. Mr Lee Kao Chao, director of economic research department, Council for Economic Planning and Development, says: 'The result of our economic success has been sweet but the problems created by the trade surplus have been more bitter. The trade surplus of the 1980s created excess monetary growth and an asset bubble. The stock market index rose from 650 in 1985 to 12,650 by 1990. Land prices rose by four times. The bubble has now burst, but we have been left with high land prices and high wage levels. The 'money game' has produced a poor climate for investment.' Official figures underline the impact that the 'money game' has had on Taiwan's manufacturing sector. Since 1986 average earnings in manufacturing have nearly doubled. Employment in manufacturing peaked at 2.8m workers in 1989 since when more than 300,000 jobs have been shed. Yet the story of manufacturing on Taiwan is not all gloomy. Productivity has grown nearly 60 per cent between 1986 and the end of last year, keeping the rise in manufacturers' unit labour costs to 26 per cent over the seven-year period. In some industries, notably electronics, productivity has risen by more than 80 per cent, while the rise in unit costs has been negligible: just 13 per cent. 'Taiwan is an economy of small companies,' says Mr Kurz. 'If you are dedicated to making one product then you make sure you are the most competitive.' The government can do little directly to affect wages but where it can have an impact is in land prices. Since the summer it has announced plans to sell state-owned land at reduced prices for existing and new-entrant manufacturers, especially those engaged in high technology. Those parts of the production process where Taiwan's manufacturers have lost competitiveness are at the labour-intensive end of the manufacturing process. These jobs have migrated to mainland China where, since 1989, Taiwanese industry has made great inroads, especially in footwear and food. The government is particularly concerned that investment on the mainland will lead to a shortage of capital for investment on Taiwan. Another concern is that wholesale migration of industry will lead to a 'hollowing out' of the manufacturing base on Taiwan and a compensatory increase in the island's dependency on the mainland economy. Elements of dependency have already become a reality - Taiwan's trade surplus is sustained by its trade, via Hong Kong, with the mainland - but Taiwan is a long way from being hollowed out, or from being totally reliant on the mainland for its economic well being. A lot of 'investment' has been speculative property investment. It has been estimated that more than Dollars 5bn has been pumped into China's property market, mainly in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou (Canton). With the tightening of economic policy in China since the summer, many believe that these investors may get their fingers burnt. The tightening in monetary policy in China and a corresponding easing of monetary policy on Taiwan is expected to give a fillip to private investment on the island. After a recovery in growth last year, private investment is expected to rise by nearly 13 per cent this year and about 10 per cent in 1994. In the meantime the government has taken a fresh sighting and is trying to chart a course for the Taiwanese economy which envisages becoming 'Asia-Pacific regional operations zone'. The government has promised NTDollars 3bn of tax credits for industry - to encourage investment - and earmarked a further NTDollars 20bn in state support for the island's high technology industries. Overhanging this strategy, however, is Taiwan's troubled relations with the mainland. Until both arrive at a modus vivendi it is debatable whether this latest chapter in Taiwan's economic development can be as successfully realised as past policies were.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippon Housing cuts interest payments NIPPON Housing Loan, Japan's largest home-loan company, has cut interest payments to leading banks to try to overcome a sharp rise in its non-performing loans. Seven Japanese housing loan companies have sought financial assistance from their leading banks, and Nippon Housing has sought the help of the nine banks which founded it in 1971. However, Nippon Housing is now in dispute with several of the banks, which oppose its unilateral decision to reduce the interest rate on its loans. The company had cut the rate to 3.75 per cent, the same as the official discount rate, and this week decided to reduce it to 3.25 per cent. Nippon Housing, now a listed company, has an estimated Y1,200bn (Dollars 9.43bn) in non-performing loans, and reported an 87 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to March. The company also said it had Y23.4bn in unrealised losses on securities holdings. The plight of the home-loan industry is indicative of the pressure on Japanese financial institutions, which have been forced to accept reduced or even no interest payments from clients bruised by the stock market crash and the property price slump. At the end of March, Sakura Bank had about Y226bn in loans outstanding to Nippon Housing, while Sanwa Bank had Y199bn in loans.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Viktor Metchikov under the </F> "Theme of the Day" rubric: "How to Feed the Country?"]    [Text] Orel--In Orel today, the government is holding a  conference with the heads of administration of 17 oblasts in  central Russia, their deputies responsible for agriculture, and  agrarian scientists. Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  government, has arrived to take part in this conference. He is  being accompanied on this working visit by Aleksandr Zaveryukha,  a vice premier; Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central  Bank of Russia Board; and Gennadiy Romanenko, president of the  Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.    Without anticipating speeches that have already been  prepared  but have yet to be delivered and a final document that has yet  to be adopted, let us note that the conference bears a clearly  marked "cardiological" character for Russia for two reasons.    First, no matter how the discussion turns out, the utmost  attention will be paid to the foundation of the state's  life--the agrarian sector.    Second, the 17 oblasts located in the river basins and on  the  watersheds of the Volga, the Don, the Oka, and the upper Dnieper  do indeed form Russia's heartland. They account for only around  4.8 percent of the country's territory, but in 1992, for  example, they produced 30.5 percent of gross agricultural  output. And, of course, the central region is suffering  greatly, as is our whole state.    The difference of opinion over the definition of the main  question on the agenda which preceded the conference--an  unexpected fuss for an event at this level--was awkward, however.    V. Shuteyev, the head of the Kursk Oblast Administration,  described his expectations on the eve of the trip in these terms:    "I want Viktor Stepanovich to confirm his recent promise to  settle accounts with country people in January for last year's  grain harvest."    I would like to note that even before that, during the  election campaign for the Agrarian Party, Vice Premier A.  Zaveryukha spoke in Kursk, where he gave the local agricultural  aktiv a cast-iron guarantee that the oblast would receive the  money for its grain in the next few days. There was a great  rush after those words--the cash-starved leaders of rayons and  farms really hammered on the doors of the oblast agricultural  administration, fearful that they would be too late for the  share-out. But so far there has been no sign of the grain  payment--around 21 billion rubles.    The miserable transfer of payments between partners on  Russia's territory and the lack of credit resources threaten to  wreck the spring sowing campaign. There is no money for seed or  spares, and 12,000 tonnes of fuel have been stockpiled in Kursk  Oblast as against the 182,000 tonnes that are needed. Nor is it  clear how the local budget is to provide advances or credit for  the purchase of agricultural produce under the new scheme if the  local budget does not include sources of finance for that  purpose. Furthermore, the long-term questions of the region's  development are foundering on the lack of resources. This is  what worries V. Shuteyev.    Meanwhile Orel was prepared for a fundamentally different  debate. In all the documents and studies prepared here the  conference's main idea was formulated thus: "A State Program  for the Revival of Central Russia." Ye. Stroyev, head of the  Orel Oblast administration, puts the argument like this:    "We are categorically opposed to an analysis which deals  with  the present-day and relates to the agrarian sector alone. A  narrow departmental approach will produce nothing but disaster  again. What is needed is not a departmental or technocratic  program, but a multisectoral state program that uses all the  historically accumulated potential, both economic and cultural.    The oblast leaders' views hardly conflict with one another;  some will focus attention on present-day problems, others on the  need to take a long-term view. Without sowing our daily bread  there will be no long-term progress. But unless we take a  long-term view we will, figuratively speaking, sow the wrong  thing in the wrong way.    I wonder what medicine will be prescribed in Orel for the  agrarian sector and for the entire economy of Russia? Will it  enable them to cease being a "black hole," swallowing up  financial and other resources and giving nothing in return?    Much depends, clearly, on whether there is at last a sober  and honest assessment of the present-day stage of the reforms.  Will it be said clearly that what we actually have achieved in  the countryside so far is progress of a psychological nature  alone: We have accepted private ownership, but that is all.  However, the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has not  actually turned the peasant into a landowner.    "The reforms have taken the path of the misappropriation of  property by the leadership" -- it was Igor Chukhrayev, deputy  chief of the Kursk Oblast Agricultural Administration, who let  that phrase slip. We shall be hearing similar opinions  increasingly often.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Warning on cost of water quality WATER BILLS may need to rise by 6 percentage points above annual inflation for the next five years, Ofwat, the water industry regulator, warned yesterday. The rises would be needed to bring water up to new environmental standards, water companies have told Ofwat. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, told a conference yesterday: 'Customers must come first. To tell them that water is good value may be true, but they do not want to see their disposable income squeezed.' Mr Byatt has argued frequently over the past year that some standards of water may be higher than those that are necessary on health grounds, and that they are pushing up customers' bills. He called yesterday for ministers to consider the 'trade-off between water quality and higher bills' when considering how stringently to set new standards. Their decisions, he said, would 'set the scene' for Ofwat's wide-ranging review of the industry's pricing structure next year that will set price rises for each company for the period 1995 to 2005. Mr Byatt welcomed recent water company surveys to find out what standards customers wanted. These confirmed customer anxiety about rising bills. But several companies found customers willing to pay for the removal of lead traces from drinking water, even though the cost could reach Pounds 8bn nationally.</p>

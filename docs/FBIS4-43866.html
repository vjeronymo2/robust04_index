			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] You have heard that Willy Claes spoke about the  position of Zaire and President Mobutu in the Rwandan conflict.  The main Zairean opposition party, the Union for Democracy and  Social Progress [UDPS], has also raised this issue. First, the  UDPS has strongly condemned the appointment of [Joseph] Kengo Wa  Dondo as prime minister a few days ago. The UDPS believes that  this appointment is illegal and points out that Kengo Wa Dondo  is a former prime minister of President Mobutu's and his name  has come up several times in files about corruption, a subject  which has been discussed at the Zairean national conference.    Justine Kasavubu, UDPS spokesperson in the Benelux  countries,  has especially criticized the role played by France in Central  Africa, both in Rwanda and Zaire. Jacqueline Pollack [name  phonetic] asked her what role Belgium could play:    [Begin Kasavubu recording] First and foremost, we call on  Belgium to have much more courage and to be much more ambitious  for its former colony, and not to yield to France's influence.    Moreover, we denounce French policy and we say to all the  friends of Zaire that they must unite so that the support of the  French regime for Mobutu and his whole system can be abandoned,  because we don't understand how a country of freedom can support  a nazi regime such as Mobutu's. France has economic ambitions  in Zaire and, among other things, it would like to lay its hand  on all the wealth of Shaba in order to offset the future South  African power. Then, in the name of a French-speaking community  which is badly understood, France would like to establish a new  kind of imperialism. We denounce the support for a nazi regime  from a country which styles itself as a country of freedom  because Mobutu has also carried out ethnic extermination at  home.

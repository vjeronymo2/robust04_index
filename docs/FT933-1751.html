			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Mucklow record ends with 11% fall A RECORD of 24 years of unbroken profit growth has ended at A&amp;J Mucklow Group, the West Midlands based property investor and developer, as it finally succumbed to recessionary pressures. The group reported pre-tax profits down 11 per cent from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 9.67m for the year ended June 30. Earnings per share slipped to 6.42p (7.72p) while the dividend is stepped up to 6.103p (5.925p) with a final of 3.14p. Net asset value per ordinary share had fallen from 155p to 144p by the end of the period. Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman, said that in spite of continued expansion, the group's investment portfolio 'could not escape the fall in property values generally throughout the UK.' The level of new lettings had failed to counteract the effect of tenant failures and non-renewal of leases. The group's vacant space increased from 1.16m sq ft to 1.32m sq ft during the year. However, there was 'considerable evidence' that the worst of the recession was now past, and he expected the vacancy level to start falling. A professional review had given the industrial and commercial property portfolio a value of Pounds 206.8m, which involved a reduction in the revaluation reserve of Pounds 11.1m. These figures have been incorporated in the accounts. A review of the group's other property, including its residential land bank, gave rise to a surplus of Pounds 8.51m above book value, which has not been incorporated in the accounts. Rental income and turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 20.1m, giving an operating profit of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.6m). Also there was Pounds 89,000 (Pounds 62,000) made from the disposal of properties. Net interest paid rose from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 5.8m.</p>

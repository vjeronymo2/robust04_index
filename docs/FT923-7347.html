			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Full employment promoted as Labour objective THE RESTORATION of full employment as one of the core aims of the Labour movement will take a further step forward next month at the annual Trades Union Congress conference in Blackpool. The slogan, Working For Full Employment, will be the rallying call of a TUC initiative to re-establish full employment as a central goal of economic policy. The idea has 'slipped down the agenda', a TUC official said. 'We want to reassert it  - it is a time when we are having to reassess our priorities.' Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, recently called for full employment to be put back at the heart of Labour policy. He said it would never be achieved again unless restored to 'its proper place in the political and economic ambitions of our country and the rest of the European Community'. Mr Dobson has twice returned to this theme, and has sought to broaden support for his stance by arguing that mass unemployment is 'bad for all of us' and not just for the unemployed. Doubts remain about Mr Dobson's precise definition of full employment and the full policy implications, but he is gathering some powerful allies in the party. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said recently he would 'very much share' Mr Dobson's sentiments. Mr Murray Elder, chief of staff for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said Mr Dobson's call to put full employment 'back at the top of the European agenda' was 'entirely consistent with our position'. Full employment was a Labour commitment for many years, but the party's general election manifesto this year confined itself to pledging 'a swift reduction in unemployment' and 'to prevent long-term unemployment, rather than just trying to cope with it after it has occurred'.</p>

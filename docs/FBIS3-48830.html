			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mak Ben, representative of the Party of Democratic  Kampuchea [PDK-Khmer Rouge], at the PDK office in Phnom Penh on  27 January talked to local and foreign reporters about the  situation concerning the national reconciliation policy in  accordance with the five-point initiative of Samdech Euv [prince  father] the king.    Mak Ben said that Samdech Euv the king thought that in order  to resolve the current serious situation there was only one  magic solution, which was to reconcile the nation by uniting all  our national forces around the king and the throne. On 21  November 1993, the king put forward a five-point political  initiative requiring that all national forces soften their  respective positions so that everyone can unite and move toward  genuine national reconciliation and peace.    The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported the king's  five-point political initiative. The entire Cambodian nation  and people in rural areas and cities and inside and outside the  country have assisted and supported this five-point initiative.  The world, particularly the ASEAN countries, are happy about  the proposal and have welcomed it because they want Cambodia to  have genuine peace and national reconciliation, which is  conducive to peace, security, and stability in the entire region.    Mak Ben said that on 22 January Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh sent his representative to inform the PDK  representative in Phnom Penh that Prince Krompreah and FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] fully accept the king's five-point  initiative and that all the points should be implemented  simultaneously. Furthermore, agreement was reached on setting  up a nameless technical group for talks based on the king's  five-point initiative.    Replying to the above clarification by Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, PDK  chairman, expressed his joy and thanks to Prince Krompreah and  noted that this is an important step, enabling the king's  five-point policy to move toward realization in accordance with  the king's lofty desire and the profound and sacred aspiration  of the entire Cambodian nation and people.    It should be noted that the PDK has not demanded that any  personalities or parties be excluded. The PDK wants to see all  national forces united, including FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist  Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP], the Cambodian People's Party  [CPP], the PDK, and other national forces, in order that there  might be genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and  peace.    Previously the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen repeatedly stated that  only three points were to be discussed. On 7 January 1994, and  later, the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen continued to demand that DK  accept and implement the three points first before they agree to  talk about other issues. This is offensive to the PDK and runs  counter to the spirit of national reconciliation and the  rallying of national forces.    We hope that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will reconsider this  issue, accept the royal five-point political guidance, and send  representatives to work in the technical group in accordance  with the united aim of Prince Krompreah and H.E. Khieu Samphan.  This is in order to move the king's five-point initiative  toward its realization. In the immediate future, H.E. Khieu  Samphan suggests that the technical group start its work  straightaway with representatives from FUNCINPEC and the PDK.  Once H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly announce acceptance of  the royal five-point initiative, then the CPP will also be  included.    Mak Ben recalled that the BLDP has also declared support for  the king's five-point initiative.</p>

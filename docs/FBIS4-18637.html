			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has  temporarily halted the already agreed deliveries within the  framework of NATO equipment aid to Turkey. DPA learned this  from government circles on Thursday [7 April]. This already  applies to the next batch, which would have been due on 15 April  and comprises optical gun sights and spare parts.    The decision was made in coordination between the  Chancellor's Office, the Defense Ministry, and the Foreign  Ministry. According to information provided by the responsible  government circles, the decisive factor was the current  examination of claims that Turkey is using materiel from German  armament deliveries against Kurdish guerrillas in the country,  which violates the NATO treaty.    NATO equipment aid, which is to be provided until the end of  the year and is not to be resumed as of 1995, includes, among  other things, 16 F4-F jets. This outdated photographic  reconnaissance version of the double-jet U.S. combat fighter is  being gradually discharged by the FRG Air Force.</p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Stranded Palestinians call for action by US PALESTINIAN deportees stranded in a south Lebanon no man's land demanded yesterday that the US pressure Israel to take them back, Reuter reports from Zahle, Lebanon. The nearly 400 deportees issued their demand before the arrival in eastern Lebanon of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, on the fourth leg of a mission to revive stalled 21-month-old Middle East peace talks. 'Eight months have passed and (UN) Security Council Resolution 799 has not been implemented. We demand Christopher to pressure Israel for our return,' said deportee leader Mr Abdul Aziz Rantisi. Resolution 799, passed a day after Israel expelled the men accusing them of being linked to hostile Islamic groups last December, demanded Israel allow them all back immediately. Israel refused to implement the resolution but cut the maximum term in exile for the men to one year. Mr Rantisi said about 80 sick deportees should be allowed back and said the men were waiting for the International Committee of the Red Cross to reveal the result of contacts with Israel. On Monday, Israel said some more deportees would be eligible to return in September, taking the total number who could go back to around 200. Mr Christopher arrived in the town of Zahle yesterday. Officials said his talks would focus on hopes to revive Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, which the US had feared would be derailed by Israel's assault on south Lebanon last week.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia seen pricing itself out of western aluminium market Aluminium production costs in the Commonwealth of Independent States moved above those in the western world last month, according to the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy organisation. It predicts: 'In time, the Russians will price themselves out of western markets as a result of this cost explosion'. CIS costs reached just over 50 cents a pound in March compared with an average in the west of 49.7 cents a pound, Bird estimates in its latest annual review of the aluminium industry. In 1990 CIS costs were only 3 per cent of the western world average, by mid-1993 were still only 60 per cent of the levels ruling in the west, 'but hyperinflation in the CIS has proceeded at a faster rate than the rouble has been falling,' says Bird. It suggests that, ironically, short-term pressure on the Russian producers has been reduced by the agreement recently reached by some of the major aluminium-producing countries to cut production. This has pushed up prices just in time to help the Russian industry. Nevertheless, Bird says that by 1995 the cost problem will be starting to restrain CIS supply to a greater extent than is foreseen in the international agreement - under the terms of which the Russians have undertaken to reduce output by an annual 500,000 tonnes. 'We expect further falls in net exports from the former socialist countries in 1996 and 1997.' Bird forecasts that, assuming exchange rates remain stable, the London Metal Exchange three-month price for aluminium will average 57.5 cents a pound this year and rise steadily to an average of 96.5 cents (in March, 1994, money) in the year 2004. This is because it predicts shortages of smelting capacity but says producers will want to see long-term prices well above 70 cents a pound before they will be willing to invest.

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMBER POLICY A 'FIASCO'  </P> <P> There are many, many women in America who stand ready to help save those  endangered trees in Alaska that you reported on. We wouldn't just be doing this  for the trees, either. We would be doing it for ourselves.  </P> <P> Why? We hate rayon! It should have been left in a time capsule, sealed in the  1930s, and forgotten. Rayon wrinkles, stretches and usually has to be  dry-cleaned after use. Generally speaking, it is a great big pain! After  decades of having the use of the miracle fabrics such as nylon, polyester and,  miracle of miracles, ultrasuede, now we are faced with expensive clothing made  from a fiber that is awful.  </P> <P> I and many friends have taken the pledge. No more rayon, ever! No matter how  attractive a garment may be, if it is made of rayon, it will stay in the shop.  Perhaps eventually the word will become strong enough that the manufacturers  will sit up and take notice. Then, if they cooperate, the trees will be saved.  Our wardrobes will not suffer, either.  </P> <P> CAROL M. WINN  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

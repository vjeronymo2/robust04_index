			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Japanese electronics groups in fresh cuts JAPAN'S big electronics companies - including Matsushita Electric Industrial, Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and Hitachi - yesterday cut capital spending plans further after reporting dismal interim results in the half year to September, with declines in parent-company pre-tax profits between 39 per cent and 87 per cent. On a consolidated basis, Fujitsu, the world's second biggest computer company, slipped into the red, posting a pre-tax loss of Y7.5bn (Pounds 37.87m), and a net after-tax loss of Y19.2bn, the first net loss in its history. The decline reflects the sharp slowdown of consumer spending in Japan, cuts to capital investment, manufacturing overcapacity which has led to intense price competition, and appreciation of the yen. Profits have also been undermined by heavy capital spending, which ended last year. Electronics companies are now having to make depreciation charges to pay for new manufacturing facilities. All the companies announced further cuts to current year capital spending yesterday, with the exception of Toshiba, which announced cuts earlier. Benefits of reduced spending will begin showing in the accounts next year, although they are likely to chill the economy further. Some companies have successfully cut costs, reduced overtime, and ended lines of slow-selling products. Matsushita said it would cut directors salaries by 10 per cent. The companies were pessimistic about prospects for recovery in the second half. Details, Page 29</p>

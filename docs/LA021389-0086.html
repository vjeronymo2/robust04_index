			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> BACKLASH AGAINST THE 'MODEL MINORITY';  </P> <P> ASIAN-AMERICANS FIND THEMSELVES RESISTING A 'DEMURE' STEREOTYPE  </P> <P> If there is any profession in which Asian-Americans seem to have made  tremendous strides, it is engineering. Asian-Americans abound in such  high-technology industries as aerospace, health care and electronics, leading  many to label them as part of a "model minority."  </P> <P> But talk to Asian-American engineers like Alice Lei and a story of frustration  emerges. Lei, a Chinese-American engineer at McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach,  has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  contending racial discrimination against her involving her rank at the company.  </P> <P> "They have certain stereotypes that (Asian women) are demure, not dynamic," Lei  said.  </P> <P> Lei is not alone. A growing number of Asian-Americans like her contend that  they are victims of systematic discrimination arising, ironically, from the  popular image of Asian-Americans as a model minority. That image of Asians  achieving success through quiet achievement -- while helping them to get hired  at bottom and middle levels -- works against them in promotions to senior  positions.  </P> <P> White managers "feel Asians just want to do technical work so they leave them  there and won't help train them" for management positions, said Stewart Kwoh,  executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern  California.  </P> <P> "There's a real big gap between the reality and the myth" of Asian-Americans as  successful minorities, said Don T. Nakanishi, a UCLA assistant professor of  education who has filed a grievance with the university claiming he was denied  tenure there due in part to racial bias.  </P> <P> The evidence indicates that at least some of the complaints may be justified.  Asian-Americans make up 8% of all professionals and technicians in the private  sector, but only 1.3% of all managers, according to the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded in a  recent report that Asian-Americans are under-represented in managerial  positions and called for further study of the issue.  </P> <P> As a result, frustrated Asians in such industries as electronics and aerospace  are leaving companies in growing numbers, moving to where they can start over  again or form their own firms. A growing number of Asians are also filing --  and winning -- employment discrimination complaints against employers.  </P> <P> The issue of discrimination based on the model minority stereotype is not  limited to employment, Asian community leaders contend. Among other examples,  they cite:  </P> <P> * Asian-American students, because of their academic success and growing  enrollments, have become victims of reverse quotas limiting their admission at  some major universities.  </P> <P> * Asian-American students are pushed into engineering and science -- and not  social sciences or humanities -- by teachers who believe the stereotype that  Asians are best-suited for technical professions and lack communication skills.  </P> <P> * Asian-Americans are appointed to few policy-making positions in government  despite their high level of campaign contributions.  </P> <P> * Immigrants from Southeast Asia who have problems adjusting to American  society receive limited government services and funding for language programs,  immigration-adjustment services and other programs.  </P> <P> "The perception is that Asians have made it so they don't need any assistance,"  Kwoh contended. "So it's very hard to convince (government officials or the  media) that Asians have immigration problems or civil rights problems."  </P> <P> But the problem is most evident in the workplace.  </P> <P> Asian-American leaders contend that management under-representation is  particularly noticeable in education, health care and engineering, where Asians  have made inroads at entry levels.  </P> <P> To be sure, Asians admit that they deserve part of the blame. Many Asians,  through cultural upbringing or other factors, work hard but quietly and may  also be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with office politics at white-owned  corporations. And few are willing to file formal complaints or lawsuits.  </P> <P> "Among groups of employees, Asians are the least active" in filing complaints,  said Kent Wong, staff attorney for Local 660 of the Service Employees  International Union, which represents 40,000 Los Angeles County public  employees, of which about 10% are Asian.  </P> <P> But that reluctance to speak up may be changing, Wong said.  </P> <P> He cites the case of Wallace Shishido and Tom Ohgi, two Los Angeles County  health inspectors who claimed they were denied promotions because of race.  Through filing a complaint in 1986 with the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, Shishido was promoted.  </P> <P> A group of Filipino-American public employees for Los Angeles County filed a  class-action complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  alleging systematic discrimination against Filipinos in promotions, noted  Cecile Ochoa, an equal employment opportunity investigator for the county who  has filed a grievance alleging she was denied a promotion due in part to racial  discrimination.  </P></p>

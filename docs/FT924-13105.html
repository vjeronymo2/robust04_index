			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Rate cut fails to calm coal storm: Major faces toughest crisis as Tory MPs threaten Commons revolt over pit closures MR JOHN MAJOR was strug-gling last night to weather the most severe crisis of his premiership after a 1 percentage point cut in interest rates to 8 per cent failed to calm the storm of protest against British Coal's drastic pit closure plan. With Conservative MPs threatening defeat for the government on the closures when the House of Commons returns next week, the prime minister offered a second olive branch to his critics by promising training for the 31,000 miners facing unemployment. The training measures, which will be detailed in the Commons on Monday by Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, will be channelled through employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils. Mr Major acknowledged also the growing concern among industrialists that the economic recession now threatens to turn into a slump. He promised an intensive dialogue between Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and business leaders to explore how the government could help industry to take advantage of the competitive edge provided by the devaluation of the pound. In a stark warning of the task the government faces to head off a revolt in Wednesday's coal debate, Sir Marcus Fox, a barometer of backbench opinion in his role as chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, had earlier said the plan's scale was 'unacceptable' and had 'incensed' colleagues. With their anxieties over the economy only partly relieved by the rate cut, the number of Tory MPs publicly questioning the coal proposals easily exceeds the 11 needed to overturn the government's Commons majority of 21 - and some rebels were predicting victory. A Yorkshire Post survey last night found 44 out of the 72 Tory MPs who responded said they did not support the government's handling of the pit closures. Speaking at the end of the European Community summit in Birmingham, Mr Major insisted that there could be no going back on the decision to close 31 of British Coal's 50 pits. He acknowledged the 'an-guish' which had been caused by the scale and speed of the programme. But insisting there was no prospect of finding a market for the stockpiles of coal building up at pitheads and generating stations, he added: 'The fact was that we simply could not ignore reality.' Financing the surplus production was costing the government Pounds 100m a month. He said the announcement had come after a detailed analysis of both the UK's strategic energy needs and of whether some of the 'marginal pits' could survive. Mr Heseltine will face the 1922 committee before Wednesday's debate in what could be a stormy confrontation. Labour plans to introduce a motion to attract maximum Tory support. 'We will be doing everything possible for those Tory MPs who believe that the government has got it wrong to record that view on Wednesday,' said Mr Robin Cook, the party's trade and industry spokesman. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have launched national campaigns to save pits. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said the prime minister had ordered 'a panic interest rate cut and a panic announcement of extra assistance for sacked miners'. The crisis of confidence over the handling of the decision to shut 31 of British Coal's 50 pits ahead of privatisation overshadowed the EC summit. Downing Street added to the confusion by issuing a third version of which cabinet members had been told in advance of the closures announcement. Betraying the apparent haste with which the plans were drawn up and agreed, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by British Coal's decision to close the Point of Ayr pit in Wales. He has asked for clarification and further information from the company. Mr Major said the interest rate cut was fully justified in terms of the government's commitment to bring down inflation. But his emphasis on his concern to help 'families and industry' was an acknowledgement of the damage done by the closures announcement. Despite the Treasury's justification of the rate cut, there was suspicion that its timing had been dictated by the mounting political crisis. Tory backbenchers publicly welcomed the move but it failed to stop private anxieties of many over the lack of a clear economic strategy since the UK's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The classification of category 2 IDBs was established by GSCC in 1993 in order to permit qualifying IDBs to engage in up to ten percent of their trading activity in eligible securities with non-netting members. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Each category 2 IDB must act exclusively as a broker and at least ninety percent of its business, measured based on the overall dollar volume of next day and forward settlement activity in eligible netting securities over the most recent twenty day period, must be with netting members. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In addition, Category 2 IDBs have clearing fund and margin requirements essentially the same as those of a category 1 dealer netting members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved category 2 IDBs in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32722 (August 12, 1993), 58 FR 42993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a temporary period established by GSCC's Board of Directors, the term netting members is defined to include certain specifically designated grandfathered non-netting members firms that currently have IDB screen access. This will temporarily allow category 2 IDBs to trade with nonmember dealers that historically have had access to the IDBs' screens. An IDB's trading activity with grandfathered dealers will not be included for purposes of determining when an IDB meets the ten percent scope of business limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to monitor compliance with their scope of business requirements, each category 2 IDB is obligated to provide GSCC in writing with a list of all of the legal entities that it acts on behalf of and must promptly inform GSCC of any change to such list. Each IDB also is required to submit daily to GSCC all of its next day and forward settling trades in eligible netting securities, including trades with non-grandfathered non-members and must indicate the buy and sell side of each transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSCC's rule do not, however, expressly require that a category 2 IDB provide to GSCC for every trade done involving an eligible netting security the identity of each buy side and sell side counterparty. This information is significant to GSCC for risk monitoring and surveillance purposes. In particular, it is important for GSCC to understand and to be able to assess the volume of and degree of concentration of trading done by a category 2 IDB with one or more specific non-members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change, therefore, will expressly require each category 2 IDB to disclose to GSCC for every trade done involving an eligible netting security, including trades done with non-members, the identity of each buy side and sell side counterparty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSCC believes that because the proposed rule change allows GSCC to ensure that it can appropriately monitory its existing netting members, it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to GSCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- French Trade and Industry  Minister Gerard Longuet on Thursday [10 March] harshly  criticized Washington's reinstatement of the Super 301 trade law  as an "unjustified attack" on Japan.    In an address to the Japanese-French Club, an official  bilateral discussion forum, Longuet also called for more  Japanese investment in France.    "The U.S. has used Japan's structural trade surplus as a  pretext for launching unjustified attacks against Japan and  making unilateral decisions," Longuet said, citing the  reinstatement of Super 301, which paves the way for trade  sanctions. France condemns such actions, he said.    The trade law gives the United States broad powers to impose  sanctions against countries it judges to have unfair trade  practices. Its reinstatement is widely seen as a move to  pressure Japan to reduce its more than 60 billion dollar trade  surplus with the U.S.    Referring to the U.S. Government's role in clinching a 6  billion dollar private-sector contract from Saudi Arabian  Airlines, Longuet said Washington's trade tactics run counter to  the philosophy of free trade.    A European consortium, Airbus Industrie, also submitted a  bid  for the aircraft deal, which is expected to save the  near-bankrupt U.S. aircraft industry.    Washington is exploiting its "almost exclusive political,  military and monetary trump cards" to safeguard commercial  interests, Longuet said. This is "not a very good solution."    Instead Japan's overall trade surplus should be addressed on  a multilateral basis, Longuet said.    Citing improved foreign access to public works bidding,  Longuet said Japan is "going in the right direction" with its  efforts to deregulate the economy.    Paris is satisfied with Tokyo's recent 15 billion yen  stimulus package, he said. He said he hoped that the  liberalization of Japan's economy will lead to closer bilateral  economic ties, and urged more bilateral investment and joint  ventures.    While France represents some 20 percent of the European  economy, only 7 percent of Japanese investment in Europe goes to  France, he said.    Longuet urged French companies to overcome their "lack of  courage" and set up business in Japan. Japanese investments in  France are 10 times higher than French investments in Japan.    He arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for talks with Japanese  Government and business leaders and to attend an international  conference on assistance to Cambodia.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Crimes and lies protected FATHERLAND by Robert Harris Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 372 pages THIS WELL-crafted thriller is based on an intriguing set of counter-factuals. What if Hitler had won the war in the east and realised that the Allies had cracked his signals code? What if the West could only guess at the fate of the Jews? Robert Harris, better known as a political journalist and biographer, has imagined the history of greater Germany, an undefeated Nazi state in which the fevered imaginations of its founders have been given free expression. Thus we find ourselves in 1964 Berlin as grandiosely re-built by Albert Speer, a capital resplendent with grotesquely impressive monumental architecture. The Fuhrer is alive and well, his Reich is in a state of perpetual war, and his people are paranoid worshippers of a refined and thoroughly brutal creed. Harris's grim picture is convincingly painted. The story tells the unravelling of the Reich's secret history. When a body is washed up on the shore of an exclusive lakeside retreat, the Kripo, or criminal police, are called in. Enter the standard outsider of the thriller genre. In this case, he is Xavier March, war hero, divorced, suspicious, disillusioned and an SS officer, but above all a detective, unable to suppress his instincts for loose ends even when he knows his career will suffer. March discovers that what looked like a routine accidental drowning is a murder in which the Gestapo is implicated. A massive art fraud is uncovered and that appears to be that. But then March connects the murdered man with a series of other apparent accidents in which senior and retired civil servants have died. All were involved in the mass transportation of Jews during the war. But who is bumping them off, and why? There are plenty of familiar twists to the plot, but Harris has done his research and the details freshen the narrative. It is his evocation of a totalitarian system struggling to hold itself together by protecting the crimes and lies on which it was built that makes the book a satisfying and slightly disturbing read.</p>

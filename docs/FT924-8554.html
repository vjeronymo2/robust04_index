			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (4): A multi-disciplinary field - Advisers must be chosen with care THE managing director in search of an environmental policy deserves some sympathy. Changing legislation, pressure from customers and from public opinion, and the company's own plans to expand - all these can suddenly put environmental management high in the board's priorities. Once environmental questions have caught the board's attention, the problems can seem worrying and urgent. Breaches of pollution regulation can bring high penalties, sometimes the threat of criminal proceedings against directors, and perhaps worst of all, hard-to-tackle hostility from public and pressure groups. Or long-planned acquisitions can be suddenly jeopardised by uncertainty about the liabilities they might bring. However, recognising a need for environmental planning is not the same as knowing how to go about it. The European eco-auditing proposals and the British standard BS7750 of environmental management offer some guidance to adopting a management system, but generalisation is hard as regulation, the risk of environmental disaster and competitive pressures vary enormously between industries. However, it is possible to give a few tips on the main questions to ask when setting up an environmental strategy, whether with outside help or not. First, how to pick an adviser. Many companies will lack in-house expertise on regulation or 'green' technology, or energy efficiency measures, but reaching for outside advice is now straightforward. Although environmental management is a new discipline, particularly in Europe, it has already spawned a horde of consultants, accountants, lawyers and bankers. UK industry directories alone list more than 2,000 consultants. Many advisers say they have identified environmental management and risk assessment as areas of fast expansion in the 1990s, perhaps compensating them for the shrunken financial and conveyancing markets. According to Mr Allan Rickmann, head of the environmental arm of Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, it is essential because of the subject's newness to find out the relevant experience of the company and the directors. Relevant experience is important - many are just beginning to build up client lists and the learning curve can be frustrating. Their expertise may well have been drawn from one of several categories: Skill in helping win local planning permission for new sites or production processes, which often depends on detailed plans for leaving surrounding areas - down to the last species of grass - in good condition. Scientific research, sometimes in government departments, which may have equipped them with highly specialised technical skills that may translate poorly to the wider industrial arena. Legal expertise. Many law firms have moved quickly to offer advice on the possible liability that could come with changes in legislation, such as the EC packaging directives, the UK's proposed register of contaminated land, legal requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments, or EC proposals on civil liability for waste. Engineering. Information about their previous clients in similar industries, particularly abroad, is important, as techniques change fast, both to comply with rules and to seize commercial opportunities from them. Companies in the US, with around a decade longer exposure to wide-ranging environmental legislation, may have already pinpointed the best techniques. Management consultancy. It is important to identify whether they have the legal or technical skills to solve specific problems, or whether they are more equipped to conduct an overall survey of production. A large part of environmental management is about assessing risks and minimising them, such as the risk of a tank rupturing, inadequate backup or warning systems that could lead to leakages or uncontrolled emissions. Even if managers think they are complying fully with rules, they need to be alert to outside sentiment - public criticism of a competitor and heightened public scrutiny of the industry, or simply whether a government minister lives nearby. Many advisers, particularly management consultants, urge a more wide-ranging approach to environmental management than simple compliance with regulation, however. Their mantras have become 'thinking proactively' and 'communicating the environmental strategy through all levels of the company', The arguments are similar to the now-familiar ones on the importance of high quality at every stage of production and distribution. Many of the benefits that companies and consultants say have been achieved from environmental management systems derive from improvements in efficiency and production of less waste, or from improvements to the product. But it is important to calculate the benefits as well as the cost to the company of investment in environmental techniques. Another principle much favoured by consultants is that 'it is cheaper to rethink production overall and reduce the level of emissions rather than to add end-of-pipe filters or scrubbers to clean up' are useful starting points for inquiry but that comparison will be different for every company. If there is one consolation for the troubled managing director it is that environmental management is likely to become easier even if the penalties for getting it wrong increase.</p>

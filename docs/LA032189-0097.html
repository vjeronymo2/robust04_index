			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG ABUSE IS IN OUR BACKYARDS;  </P> <P> THE REACTION IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE SABOTAGES THE FIGHT  </P> <P> America isn't winning the war against drugs because the nation has the same  problem its drug abusers do. Addicts aren't only hooked on drugs, they're  hooked on denial, too. And so are we. Addicts deny dependency. We deny  responsibility.  </P> <P> We want to battle drugs at the border and not at home. We'd rather pressure  Latin Americans to stop producing drugs than pressure our fellow Americans to  stop using them. And, while we believe in treatment for drug abusers, we'd like  it kept far away and out of sight.  </P> <P> "Not in my backyard" (the NIMBY reaction) is close to a conditioned community  response to drug treatment centers these days. So there's nothing unique about  the situation in the San Fernando Valley community of Lake View Terrace, where  some local homeowners are fighting to keep a drug rehabilitation center from  opening, in spite of a city zoning administrator's decision permitting the  center to open. What makes this conflict newsworthy is the name of the  particular facility -- the Nancy Reagan Center.  </P> <P> Center opponents have cast themselves as embattled homesteaders, fighting for  self-determination against Mrs. Reagan and Phoenix House, the national  nonprofit organization proposing the center. They see themselves as a band of  local Davids holding a gang of Goliaths at bay, protecting the peace, safety  and property values of Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> But this view of the dispute, which colors much news media coverage, obscures  harsher realities. It conceals the true nature of the opposition, the drug  problems of Lake View Terrace itself and the pressing need for drug treatment  in Greater Los Angeles. It ignores the victims of the controversy -- most of  them teen-agers -- who would be denied care while the center is kept from  opening. And it cloaks in civic virtue the kind of denial and indifference that  has allowed drug abuse to take root and flourish in this country.  </P> <P> I have been fighting drug abuse for more than a quarter of a century, and I  know that the most difficult enemies to overcome are not drugs themselves or  drug traffickers. Public attitudes are the toughest opponents -- tolerance for  drug use, ambivalance about drug laws and denial of drug problems. Communities,  like families, are too often reluctant to recognize and confront home-grown  drug problems and more willing to accept danger and loss than responsibility.  </P> <P> While communities throughout the country have managed to keep drug treatment  centers out, they have been less than successful in barring drug dealers. In  Los Angeles, the situation is critical. The Drug Enforcement Administration,  which seized 15 tons of cocaine here recently, has labeled the city "the  cocaine consumption capital of the country," and cocaine deaths in Los Angeles  have risen to more than 800 in 1987, from 176 in 1984.  </P> <P> Children are among the chief victims -- and not just the more than 2,500  drug-abusing runaways on the streets of Hollywood. All children are at risk.  But only a handful of youngsters are getting the kind of long-term residential  treatment many of them need to overcome dependency and the problems that are at  the root of drug abuse. According the Los Angeles County Department of Health  Services, only 93 teens in Los Angeles County now get publicly funded long-term  rehabilitation. And there is no other affordable, long-term care for  adolescents.  </P> <P> But such care is just what Phoenix House will provide at the Nancy Reagan  Center -- and in a community with its own drug problems. Last fall four persons  were killed in a drug shoot-out only blocks from the proposed center site, and  authorities seized a Lake View Terrace "crack house" earlier this year.  </P> <P> Yet, to opponents of the center, drugs aren't the problem, Phoenix House is.  The opposition exists even though there has not been a single incident that  would justify concern for community security during the 22 years Phoenix House  has operated more than two dozen anti-drug facilities. Indeed, the presence of  Phoenix House facilities has invariably reduced local drug traffic and crime.  Local property values, unaffected by the presence of Phoenix House facilities,  have reflected areawide trends, rising sharply, for example, in areas like  Manhattan's West Side.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, opponents are determined to block city approval of the center.  They threaten to hold up the process for as long as possible. But each day of  delay means one less day of treatment for the 150 teen-agers and 60 adults the  center will serve. By denying care to the victims of drug addiction -- the most  vicious problem threatening Los Angeles -- they make all Angelenos pay a harsh  price for their obstructionism.  </P> <P> What's going on in Lake View Terrace isn't a David-and-Goliath confrontation or  a battle over self-determination. It's a manifestation of social  irresponsibility and the kind of stubborn self-interest that makes drug abuse  so difficult to overcome everywhere in America.  </P> <P> Our nation cannot successfully fight drugs while we have tolerance for drug use  or misguided sympathy for those who abet the spread of drug abuse by denying  the problem or delaying the solution. The Lake View Terrace dispute is  everyone's fight. And it is newsworthy not because Mrs. Reagan's Center is  involved but because it so clearly shows how the NIMBY reaction sabotages the  war against drugs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sally Blyth] </F>   [Text] The Executive Council [Exco] has approved the  legislation needed for setting up of the controversial Court of  Final Appeal, paving the way for talks on the issue to reopen  with China within the next few weeks.    The draft bill is based on the 1991 Sino-British agreement  on  the Court of Final Appeal, which was vehemently opposed by the  legal profession and legislative councillors at the time. There  are also signs that China will not be entirely happy with the  legislation either. However, Exco's endorsement comes amid  renewed government warnings that legislators will be left with a  stark choice: "now or never" if the court is to be set up before  1997. [as published]    The Government has also revealed there are already signs of  international uncertainty over the territory's future legal  system.    Senior officials said a copy of the draft bill, together  with  an explanatory note, would be submitted to China within the next  "two to three weeks", and it is hoped the talks can begin with  Beijing as soon as possible after that, under the auspicies of  the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.    Britain always promised China would be consulted over  implementation of the 1991 agreement. That accord limits to one  the number of overseas judges who can sit on the five member  body. However, there are already indications from Beijing that  it wishes to put further restrictions on the composition of the  court by insisting that the Chief Justice, who will head it, and  the three local judges will be Chinese nationals with no right  of abode other than Hong Kong. Under the Basic Law, only the  Chief Justice has to meet this requirement and there has been no  previous mention of the nationality of the three judges. The  Government maintains there is no reason for Beijing to oppose  the new law since it has followed all previous accords on the  issue.    There remains the further hurdle of the bill then being  passed by the Legislative Council [Legco]. So far there has  been no sign that either the legal profession or legislators  have eased their opposition to the original Sino-British  agreement. Legco has vowed to fight the bill on the grounds  that the limit placed on the number of overseas judges who can  sit on the body is in breach of the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law.    Government sources have reiterated concern that time is  running out for the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal.  They say there is no hope of renegotiating the deal and unless  the court is set up in accordance with what has been agreed,  there is a grave danger that Beijing might establish a Court of  Final Appeal after 1997 which would be worse than the present  arrangements. The administration is also warning there are  signs the international community is already wary of the  uncertainty over Hong Kong's judicial system and this could get  worse in the run-up to 1997.</p>

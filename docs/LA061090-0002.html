			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH FIRST!  </P> <P> I read "The FBI vs. the Monkeywrenchers" and was impressed, as usual, with your  excellent journalism. We can't help but admire people who will lay their life  on the line, trying, usually in vain, to save what the government allows to be  systematically destroyed.  </P> <P> It left me wondering, what did this investigation cost me as a taxpayer?  Instead of wasting our tax dollars defending what we all know is wrong, they  should consider hiring Dave Foreman as a consultant. He has, as all of us on  this overpopulated planet, legitimate fear about its fate.  </P> <P> I think it is about time our government finally listens, and becomes our  leader, to make the changes to save our air, water and resources. If they do  not listen, eventually there will only be the silence of the "End of Nature."  </P> <P> KAREN BENZEL  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

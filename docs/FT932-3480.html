			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies The message from the money markets is that holding D-Marks is now more risky than holding French francs. While the ubiquitous Mr George Soros might be blamed for spreading the notion that the D-Mark is due for a period of weakness, other factors are at work. The dire state of the German economy undermines faith in the Bundesbank's ability to defend the D-Mark. Supportive statements from the authorities last week notably failed to lift the currency. With the D-Mark wounded, France has a chance to cut rates without worrying too much about strains within the ERM. Since recession in France is at least as painful as in Germany, it should make the most of the opportunity. The change in sentiment towards the franc this year is a reminder of how fickle the foreign exchange market can be. Should the German economic slide prove less protracted than the pessimists believe, or should France's good intentions on inflation be seen to waver, the D-Mark could start to impose again. It is far from clear that the D-Mark has been deposed as the anchor of the ERM. French bonds still yield more than German bonds at longer maturities. That reflects the short track record of the Bank of France as a paragon of monetary virtue. Until it can rival the credibility of the Bundesbank over a long-term horizon, D-Mark weakness looks more like a window of opportunity than the start of a new era. If 10-year French bond yields fall below German, it will be time to think again.</p>

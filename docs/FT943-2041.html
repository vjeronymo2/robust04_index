			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Servisair forecasts 31% increase to Pounds 4.2m Pre-tax profits at Servisair, Europe's largest independent ground handling company, are forecast to increase by 31 per cent to Pounds 4.2m in 1994, the company revealed in its pathfinder prospectus. Profits growth will be aided by the March 1994 acquisition of Ogden Aviation Services, although this will result in Pounds 1.4m of reorganisation costs, taken as an exceptional item. The management is confident that substantial cost benefits will follow next year. The company is expected to raise Pounds 9.5m from the sale of new shares from the placing and intermediaries offer, while its parent, Securum, will sell 60 per cent of its stake. The company will be valued at close to Pounds 60m. Servisair has been benefiting from an expected 6 per cent increase in passenger throughput in the UK this year as it operates in all the country's main airports, with the exception of Heathrow. Servisair accounted for around 37 per cent of passenger traffic within its network of 22 UK airports, and is confident of increasing its presence as airlines pass on peripheral services. Profit margins on aircraft handling are extremely low. Servisair achieved operating profit margins of around 4 per cent in 1993, making it unattractive for operators lacking critical mass. In addition, British Airports Authority has started to devolve some of its monopoly operations, such as baggage handling, and a limited number of independent companies are competing for the contracts. Servisair also plans to compete for contracts in Europe. In Spain, the government has committed to opening up 16 airports to competition, and other countries are likely to follow. The prospectus is expected to be published on October 5 and dealings should commence on October 18. The sponsor is Barclays de Zoete Wedd.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / EC-Japan copier row looms THE European Commission is to consider renewing duties on Japanese photocopiers imported into the EC, reopening one of the largest and most controversial anti-dumping cases of recent years. Brussels announced yesterday it would re-examine anti-dumping duties of up to 20 per cent first imposed in 1987. The duties are supposed to protect European copier manufacturers from imports allegedly sold at an artificially low price. The measures were due to expire this year, but Olivetti of Italy, Rank Xerox of Britain, and Oce of the Netherlands warned that if the duties are lifted their business will suffer. Investment, prices and sales are being depressed by cheap Japanese imports, according to European manufacturers. Since the mid-1980s, several original EC complainants have gone out of business or been taken over by Japan. The 1987 decision to penalise Japanese copier manufacturers led indirectly to introduction of controversial 'screwdriver' rules by the EC. These aimed to stop non-EC companies getting round anti-dumping duties on complete products by exporting parts to the EC or US and assembling them there. The screwdriver rules were introduced in 1989, after a Brussels investigation into a Ricoh photocopier plant in the US. They were outlawed by a Gatt panel in 1990. A Commission official said yesterday he did not expect the new inquiry into photocopiers to reopen the debate over screwdriver plants in the EC. Japanese manufacturers lost their European Court appeal against the original decision in March. Most of them are involved in the new inquiry. They are Canon, Copyer, Fuji Xerox, Konishiroku Photo Industry, Kyocera, Matsushita, Minolta Camera, Ricoh, Sanyo Electric, Sharp and Toshiba.</p>

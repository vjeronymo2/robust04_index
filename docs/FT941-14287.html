			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Red tape tangles up UN troops in Bosnia: Commanders believe the organisation is in danger of losing its credibility there UN troops in Bosnia have been so hamstrung by bureaucracy that their control room has been forced to hold whip-arounds to raise money for essential equipment. The military commander says that on one occasion he learned of his movements not from his superiors, but from CNN TV. Troops of more than eight nationalities are communicating in second languages within an inadequate military command structure. If Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, needs any further convincing about the deep frustrations felt by the UN troops on the ground in Bosnia, he could do worse than take note of this description of UN operations given recently by Brig Vere Hayes, former UN chief of staff in Bosnia. In the sixth months Brig Hayes served in Bosnia, between spring and autumn last year, he experienced a catalogue of difficulties that have now led many military commanders in Bosnia to believe the UN is in danger of completely losing its credibility there. Brig Hayes claimed the frustrations stemmed from the inadequacy of the UN command, which, he said, did not have a proper military control centre when the peacekeeping operation was first established. This has been partly rectified, but the command structure is still essentially devoted to peacekeeping rather than peace-creating operations. The result has been a structure ill-equipped to respond with speed. When Brig Hayes was embroiled in the delicate task of monitoring Serb positions on Mt Igman around Sarajevo last year, he was, at one point, told of his next movements by his press officer who had been watching CNN. With no independent UN intelligence-gathering structure in place, UN commanders depend on national battalions sharing intelligence to plan their operations - intelligence that the separate national commanders have often been unwilling to share. National commanders have also been increasingly reluctant to obey UN commands without complete authorisation from their governments; one reason for the delay in reaching Mostar this summer was that the Spanish commanders insisted on consulting with their national governments first. The essential factor behind these problems is the lack of any clear political mandate. Amid the flurry of UN resolutions, with over 60 relating to Bosnia in the past 18 months, most commanders are now convinced the political will does not exist among the allies for them to carry out the task demanded. Lt-Gen Francis Briquemont, Belgian commander of UN forces in Bosnia, commented recently he did not bother to read the UN mandates any more because he did not have the troops to carry them out. The result has been that the troops have faced almost daily humiliation at the hands of the combatants, amid a steadily-mounting death toll and growing doubts about their effectiveness. A report by the UN High Commission for Refugees has estimated only 20 per cent of last month's aid to central Bosnia was delivered; UK officials believe up to one-third across Bosnia falls into the hands of soldiers.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA: THE UN FORCES TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE  -------------------------------------------------------------------- SARAJEVO  -------------------------------------------------------------------- French: Two battalions comprising about 2,200 personnel Egyptians: Battalion of about 400 Ukrainians: Battalion of about 400  -------------------------------------------------------------------- JABLANICA, SPLIT, VITEZ  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Spanish: Battalion of about 1,200 British: Battalion of about 650 Canadians: Battalion of about 800  -------------------------------------------------------------------- KISELJAK  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Mostly west European: Mobile groups of soliders, auxillery forces, military observers, civilian police, etc, totalling about 1,500  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ELSEWHERE IN CENTRAL BOSNIA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- British: Mobile force of about 1,500  -------------------------------------------------------------------- TUZLA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Nordic coutries: Battalion of about 800, plus medical corps (225), aviation group (40)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- VELIKA KLADUSA AND BIHAC  -------------------------------------------------------------------- French: Battalion of about 1,300 Malaysians: Battalion of about 850  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CROATIA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Many nationalities North Sector:     2,800 South:            2,000 East:             1,600 West:             3,000  -------------------------------------------------------------------- MACEDONIA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Mainly nordic and US 1,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

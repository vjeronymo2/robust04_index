			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rashid Hilal] </F>   [Text] Ramallah -- Ghassan al-Khatib, former member of the  Palestinian negotiating delegation and a leading People's Party  personality, has said that the Cairo accord has shown many  differences and problems in each step of its implementation.  Al-Khatib attributed this to the accord's nature, which is  characterized in placing numerous restrictions on the work of  the Palestinian authority.    He explained that the most prominent example of that is  implementation of the clause relating to the prisoners whose  problem has now blown up in the face of everyone. This has  created a serious test for the new arrangements and for the  accord itself.    Al-Khatib referred to the danger of the continued separation  of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. He said that this  separation, which stems from the accord's division, will create  contrasting realities and harm the unity of the land and people  if it were to continue.    Al-Khatib criticized the Palestinian performance in  implementing the accord. He said that this performance actually  adds other restrictions to the accord. He noted that the  performance is still marked by chaos and lack of planning, which  in practice has affected the speed in decisionmaking and the  ability of the Palestinian Authority council to start its work.  Al-Khatib said that the meeting held yesterday by the national  authority lacked a quorum because less than half the members  were present.</p>

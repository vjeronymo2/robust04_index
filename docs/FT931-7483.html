			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / OFT may launch inquiry after 'improprieties' at copier group PRESSURE mounted yesterday on the Office of Fair Trading to launch an investigation into the activities of 'cost-per-copy' photocopier companies following the resignation of two executives and the dismissal of a sales support team from Southern Business Group. SBG, the publicly quoted photocopier supplier which has previously been criticised for some of its contractual and accounting practices yesterday confirmed that an internal investigation, started last August, had revealed 'a small number of improprieties' in its dealings with some customers. Mr David McErlain, SBG managing director, said that the company - which recorded 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m on a Pounds 54m turnover - had 'spent three years trying to build integrity in the marketplace'. It now had 'one big dent in it' because of justifiable criticism of some of its activities. Following the investigation and a board meeting on Monday, Mr Neil Redding, managing director of SBG's Benworth subsidiary and a group board director, and Mr Robert Dobereiner, a Benworth director, resigned. Mr McErlain stressed that neither man had knowledge or involvement in the improprieties. A London-based sales support team has also been sacked. Mr McErlaine said the team employed unique techniques not in force elsewhere within the group. He was satisfied that no further abuses would arise. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, last night called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to invoke powers under the 1988 Companies Act to investigate the company. One of the contracts at the centre of SBG's internal investigation involved the London borough of Tower Hamlets, which signed a Pounds 1.3m photocopier contract with Benworth. Last year, Mr Brian Pettitt, principal administration officer for the council, wrote to SBG saying an audit revealed 'many discrepancies' relating to accounts and agreements with Benworth and claimed misrepresentation. Charing Cross Hospital in London has also sought legal advice over a nine-year contract with Benworth. The Campaign to Clean up Copier Contracts, which was formed last year after complaints about high-pressure sales techniques and misrepresentation in the photocopier market, yesterday called on the OFT to investigate all SBG activities and the entire 'cost-per-copy' market. A spokesman said it would warn existing customers of SBG and other 'cost-per-copy' users to check the documentation on their monthly usage of photocopiers. Under 'cost-per-copy' contracts, the capital cost of photocopying equipment is merged with the running costs. Customers guarantee to pay for a minimum number of copies.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OVERHEATED WOODS IN 'TRUE BELIEVER'  </P> <P> "Eddie Dodd," sneers one of his well-heeled clients in "True Believer"  (citywide). "Everyone should own one." Considering that attorney Dodd has just  gotten this scum-sucking cocaine dealer off on a well-deserved drug rap, that's  hardly gratitude.  </P> <P> But flamed-out ex-'60s activist Dodd doesn't defend New York's every smack  dealer and amphetamine manufacturer for their thank-you notes. The chunky  packages of cash they send through the mail will do nicely.  </P> <P> Dodd is another in James Woods' dizzying catalogue of interchangeable  characterizations in which only his hairdos vary. (Unsurprisingly, hipster Dodd  wears a curly, graying pony-tail.) The sneer, the intensity, the percussive  delivery that flattens everything in sight -- fellow actors especially --  remains the same.  </P> <P> The reason to have hope for "True Believer" (language-rated R) was that  director Joseph Ruben had shown some style before with "The Stepfather."  However "The Stepfather" had Donald Westlake's gorgeous script. This one, by  Wesley Strick, piles coincidence onto improbability and cliche onto  unlikelihood until all our good will is used up. Ruben's stylistic devices, his  high angle shots and his black-and-white recountings of courtroom testimony,  become just so much cinematic corpse-rouging.  </P> <P> The story involves Eddie Dodd's redemption through his defense of one single  innocent client. He's a young Korean prisoner in Sing Sing, Shu Kai Kim (Yuji  Okumoto), whom we see kill a Neo-Nazi fellow-inmate within the prison, in what  might be called very well-prepared self-defense. Somehow, certainly not through  anything persuasive about his client, Dodd decides that Kim was innocent of the  crime which sent him to Sing Sing in the first place. And the scenario decides  that freeing Kim will cleanse Dodd's soul.  </P> <P> Robert Downey Jr., as Dodd's wildly idealistic new assistant, is along for a  good deal of the cleansing. The characters are a hilarious assortment of  tattooed Neo-Nazis, sweaty, corrupt cops and transparently evil lawmen in very  high places. Their goings-on are photographed as though the camera, too, was  wearing a green eyeshade.  </P> <P> Under Woods' almost felonious assault, there seems to be one point at which  Downey throws up his hands and quits, enlisting Margaret Colin, "private  detective Kitty Greer," in his defection. They move, they speak, but the stuff  that galvanizes them as actors seems to have evaporated. Take their hint.  SHEILA BENSON  </P></p>

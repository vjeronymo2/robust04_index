			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Doctors urged to maintain AZT HEALTH AGENCIES worldwide were yesterday advising doctors not to make immediate changes in the way they prescribe AZT, the leading Aids drug, even though an international study concluded that it failed to delay the onset of symptoms in people infected with HIV. Officials of Wellcome, AZT's manufacturer, talked to financial and medical institutions, stating alleged shortcomings in the analysis of the trial, published in The Lancet medical journal. Even so, Wellcome shares closed 51p down in London at 692p. Several well-known Aids specialists praised the study, known as Concorde, which was organised jointly by the UK Medical Research Council and France's National Aids Research Agency. They believed its conclusion that early AZT treatment did not produce long-term clinical benefits. The UK government pledged to maintain Aids research and treatment. Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister, said there would be a 'great deal of effort'. His department is expected to spend Pounds 200m on Aids in the coming year. In the US, Dr Daniel Hoth, director of the Aids division at the National Institutes of Health, said NIH officials would meet their British and French counterparts soon. Until then, NIH will maintain its advice that people with HIV should begin treatment if their count of CD4 immune cells falls below 500, whether or not they have any symptoms. Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's research director, said further analysis of the 1,749 patient records in the Concorde trial - taking account of the fact that many had opted to transfer from placebo to AZT - might show more favourable results. MRC researchers said: 'The results are certainly not overstated,' said Professor David Warrell of Oxford University, chairman of the MRC's Aids trials committee. 'We are confident that the full report will support the preliminary conclusions.' Aids research pledge, Page 4 London stocks, Page 17</p>

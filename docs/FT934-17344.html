			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Fight over a hill o' beans: Coffee farmers' attempts to raise prices The glamorous advertisements of the world's big coffee processors contrast sharply with the blunt tactics of the less wealthy farmers who grow the coffee beans. Today 40 coffee-producing countries, representing 90 per cent of world exports, will start withholding some supplies from the market in an attempt to force up prices. The fact that they are almost certain to lose revenue by their action underlines their frustration at the collapse of coffee prices in recent years. World bean prices have halved in the four years since the International Coffee Organisation's price support scheme collapsed in 1989, when buyers and suppliers failed to reach agreement on renewing the pact. The cost to farmers of the fall in prices, in terms of revenue foregone, has been Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year. But because the fall in coffee bean prices has not been reflected in the supermarkets, the international food companies such as Nestle, Sara Lee and Kraft General Foods have seen their earnings rise in the world retail coffee market, which is worth Dollars 30bn a year. Consumer prices have fallen by only 5 to 10 per cent since 1989. Twin Trading, the commodities trading company, estimates that the cost of coffee beans in a 100g jar of instant is 20p, compared with 40p in 1988, but the supermarket price has remained at about Pounds 1.60. In their defence, the big processors say they want to keep prices stable. But the effectiveness of brand loyalty has made demand for many of their products insensitive to price changes. They have spent heavily on marketing to promote brand names and defend market share; expensive adverts such as that for Nestle Gold Blend cost as much or more a jar than the coffee beans. A UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission report two years ago, though clearing Nestle of abusing its dominant market position in Britain, showed that its return, before interest, on sales of instant coffee was as high as 36 per cent. Such figures have convinced the bean producers that they have a case for taking action to boost their share of the profits in the coffee market. 'It annoys us that coffee consumption has not been increased because of the drop in price, but the roasters are just getting richer,' said Mr Nestor Osorio, who represents Colombia's coffee growers at the International Coffee Organisation in London. Mr Osorio admits the action planned by producing countries is a last resort, following the failure of an attempt in March, under the auspices of the coffee organisation, to revive the agreement between producers and buyers. Though they have since rebounded, average world prices fell to 44 cents per pound in August last year - the lowest level since 1974 - from levels of 120 to 140 cents per pound during most of the 1980s. 'Some of the countries in the scheme are heavily dependent on coffee for their revenues and they have been damaged by these low prices,' he says. Under the terms of the retention agreement, which Brazil has offered to administer, producers will reduce their exports by 20 per cent until the world price hits 75 cents a pound. If prices rise above that level, they will withhold 10 per cent of exports until the price reaches 85 cents per pound, when retention will stop. The plan has already had an impact on world markets. Prices have risen to about 70 cents a pound in anticipation of today's launch. But coffee brokers suspect that the producing countries will find it hard to hold the pact together if prices rise just a little above the current level, particularly as the short-term costs to producers of the agreement could be considerable. Past attempts to fix coffee prices have relied on the co-operation of governments of consuming countries monitoring imports to ensure that producers are sticking to their quotas. 'Without the support of the consumers, which have always monitored the pacts in the past, it makes it much more difficult to check the flow of coffee,' said Mr Peter Kettle, head of research at ED&amp;F Mann, the London trading house. Though some producing countries are still hopeful that agreement might be reached with the consuming countries, the latest pact has been drawn up without them. Indeed the US, the largest market for coffee, cancelled its membership of the International Coffee Organisation last week in protest at the producers' action. At the same time, coffee market observers are sceptical whether any kind of price fixing deal is possible in an increasingly sophisticated commodities market. The souring of relations between producers and consumers, stemming from the failure to reach agreement in March, has made the task still more difficult. Mr Osorio complains of the 'greed' of the marketing companies which wanted to boost their profit margins. But one US trade official and commodity negotiator, said it was the producers who expected too much. 'I used to think that these commodity pacts could work, but there's too much greed. As soon as producers get together with consumers, they expect prices to rise.' The difficulty in fixing prices at a level which suits buyers and suppliers is common to all commodities. Though often seen in the 1970s by developed countries as a means of channelling aid to the third world, such policies fell from favour in the 1980s when huge increases in output by producing countries made schemes costly to run. In 1985, for instance, the International Tin Council's support for prices collapsed, causing difficulties for many producers. Attempts to fix cocoa prices have also broken down. 'You need to set prices at a level that ensures demand carries on growing, but also that production is not excessive,' says Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at GNI, the London securities house. Even the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the world's most successful producers' club, has not achieved its price targets in recent years. The success of the coffee producers' latest attempt to raise coffee bean prices will be evident on the world's commodity futures exchanges in the next few weeks. Producers say that if the processors absorb the extra cost by cutting margins, any rise in world coffee prices should have little effect on consumers. But they may be wrong in assuming that the consequences of their attempt to force up prices will make processors face that dilemma.</p>

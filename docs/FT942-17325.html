			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / US stocks and bonds rise sharply: First significant advance in trading since Federal Reserve's move on interest rates US stocks and bonds rose sharply yesterday helped by stronger European markets, confounding some commentators' predictions of a widespread sell-off following Wall Street's steep fall on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 82.06 points higher at 3,675.41, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 9.36 to 448.28. The price of the benchmark 30- year US government long bond was also sharply higher late in the session, sending the yield down by nearly 17 basis points to 7.238 per cent, as buyers were coaxed back into the market. It was the first big advance by US stocks since before the Federal Reserve lifted short-term interest rates by a quarter point to 3.5 per cent on March 22. Analysts said the New York market was ripe for a rebound after losing about 276 points in the last seven sessions. The Dow lost more than 42 points on Monday in reaction to news of a sharp rise in the March employment figures, announced on Friday, fuelling worries that the Fed might raise rates again in a bid to prevent the economy from overheating. A small dip in February in the US Commerce Department's main economic forecasting index helped ease these fears yesterday, although forecasters predict a rebound in March's index as a result of warmer weather. The index of leading economic indicators dropped by 0.1 per cent after rising for six months in a row, the Commerce Department said. However, yesterday's Wall Street rally was driven mostly by bargain hunting, rather than any change in the fundamental economic outlook. 'It's a rally in a bear market,' said Mr Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co in New York. 'With the markets getting hammered nearly every day, they needed to take a rest yesterday,' said Mr Chris Moore, senior bond market analyst at Technical Data in Boston. He predicted the yield on the long bond, after briefly hovering at current levels, would soon begin rising again. The London market lived up to its recent reputation for volatility, with the FT-SE 100 index moving through a range of nearly 70 points before closing up 29.8 at 3,116.2. UK gilts finished lower on the day despite the recovery in the afternoon. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index closed up 25.18 at 2,158.29. In Tokyo, stocks earlier ended a quiet session just off the day's high. The Nikkei average closed up 440.99 points or 2.31 per cent at 19,563.21 points. In early trading today it had added about 275 points. The improved tone in the bond and equity markets spilled over into a firmer dollar. The US currency was trading at DM1.71445 in late activity in New York, up from an early low of DM1.6910 in London, and nearly 3 pfennigs up from DM1.6788 before the long weekend. Some of the strength reflected follow-on buying from Friday when European markets were closed and unable to respond to the strong employment figures. Analysts were cautious, however, to herald a turnround in the dollar's fortunes. 'Price activity in the last few weeks has been a case of two steps forward, three steps back,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan.

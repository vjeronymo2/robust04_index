			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tax change in Turkey cuts Akbank profit AKBANK, Turkey's leading retail bank, which is 87 per cent owned by the Sabanci industrial group, said 1992 profits fell 6 per cent to TL1,258bn (Dollars 134m) before accounting for 70 per cent inflation. Akbank, which floated 5 per cent of its capital on the Istanbul stock exchange in 1990, is one of Turkey's most conservative banks. But tax incentives for holders of Treasury bills and other government paper have been scrapped, forcing banks to reconsider asset strategy. Akbank's 1992 tax bill rose 140 per cent.</p>

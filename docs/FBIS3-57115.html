			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a press conference held today, Latvian President  Guntis Ulmanis announced that his telephone conversation on  Thursday with U.S. President Bill Clinton allows him to conclude  that Moscow and Washington have no secret agreements that could  threaten Latvia's sovereignty.    The U.S. President, in his 30-minute telephone conversation,  emphasized that the issues of human rights and citizenship are  not linked to the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops.  The United States, since the incident in Latvia on 10 January  and the events connected with it, has not changed its stance on  the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops and believes that  the issue of human rights and citizenship is to be settled by  the Latvian state itself, stressed Guntis Ulmanis.    Bill Clinton also informed Ulmanis about his visit to Moscow  last week. The U.S. President discussed with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin the issue of the Skrunda radar station. Clinton  recommended continuing talks at the level of the government  commissions on this issue and seeking a compromise solution.</p>

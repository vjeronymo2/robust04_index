			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Management: Laying traps for the poacher - Large corporations are increasingly enticing employees away from rival companies It has taken General Motors less than a month to introduce 'non-compete' clauses for key executives in the wake of the dramatic departure of J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua, its worldwide purchasing chief, to Volkswagen. The one-page agreements, which would normally preclude employees from working for a competitor for three years from the time of signing, were approved by the carmaker's board last week. Lopez's spectacular exit, followed by other less senior GM employees, and his systematic drive on behalf of his new employer to sign up as many as 40 managers from German rival Opel - a GM subsidiary - will have sent a shudder down many corporate spines. VW's tactics may have run into opposition in the German courts - but defences against corporate poaching in other countries may not be sufficient to discourage an apparently growing practice. The question in the US is whether GM's efforts to bolster executive loyalty by legal means will encourage other US corporations to follow suit. Labour lawyers are sceptical. The basic problem, they say, is that US courts are supportive of the free flow of labour and that making a 'poaching' case stick is an uphill legal task. A second problem has more to do with image. It is not easy to demand anti-trust enforcement and free trade practices on one hand and then corner personnel on the other. This is not to say that US companies do not try to tie executives in by legal as well as financial incentives. 'Non-compete' clauses have been around for years. But such clauses cannot be overly onerous - in terms of the length of the non-compete period, or even geography. One lawyer cites an ongoing legal battle between two Wall Street investment banks. Action could only be brought, he says, because the executive in question moved from one New York office to another. Had he joined a Los Angeles or London office, the case would have been untenable. That leads on to the thorny issue of what constitutes a 'competing' situation. Some eyebrows were raised in the airline industry when Frank Lorenzo, the former boss of Continental Airlines, turned up as an adviser to MarkAir, a small regional carrier. As part of his deal on leaving Continental in 1989, Lorenzo had agreed not to work in the airline business for seven years. Lorenzo's company, Savoy Capital, maintained it was only 'a consultant' to the newer carrier. Trade secret suits, or the threat of them, have been a powerful weapon employed by established high-tech companies ever since Intel initiated such a move against a rival semiconductor company - Seeq Technology - founded by 10 of its engineers in 1981. For a start-up company, such a legal challenge can be a serious distraction, eating up management time and limited financial resources. Rather than risk such suits from their former employees, would-be entrepreneurs usually try to reach 'gentleman's agreements' not to compete directly and not to raid their former employer for staff. In reality, according to US recruitment consultants, matters such as poaching tend to be resolved behind the scenes - whatever the formal legal safeguards. 'There are situations which result in informal conversations, one CEO to a rival CEO - where one will say cease and desist before I do something dramatic,' says one Manhattan recruitment professional. 'Dramatic', she adds, non-attributedly, does not mean legal action; between Wall Street firms it is likely to involve cold-shouldering on syndication deals. British employers, meanwhile, use the promise of future rewards and clauses in employment contracts, to discourage poaching. But in the end neither method is fail-safe, as no company has a legal right to force anyone to work for them. Moreover even the heaviest gold handcuffs can be unlocked. The most generous use of golden handcuffs was to buy the loyalty of television executives bidding for the ITV franchises in 1991. The estimated Pounds 60m the companies paid, mainly through share options, was a one-off. The companies reasoned that to have their top people leave during the bidding would be disastrous, as it would damage their claims to offer good programmes. In addition to share options, companies are increasingly looking to other long-term incentives, with bonus payments staggered over several years, or shares in special accounts which are cancelled if the employee leaves the company. Companies are increasingly resorting to 'gardening leave' clauses, which allow them to state that an employee must spend a few months at home before taking up a new job. The idea is that any confidential information will be out of date by the time an employee joins a competitor. Other standard clauses include non-solicitation provisions which prevent departing employees from taking their colleagues and clients with them when they go. As none of these clauses have yet been tested in law, it is not clear how well they will stand up. In Germany, however, extraordinary precedents are now being set. VW's Lopez was told earlier this month he could face six months behind bars if he continued trying 'systematically to recruit' Opel managers. According to a temporary injunction issued last week, after an appeal by David Herman, Opel's new chief executive, VW could also be fined up to DM500,000 (Pounds 208,000). VW started picking off a select group of new managers last year. The fruits of the early harvest, brought in at the command of Ferdinand Piech, VW's boss-elect at the time, include a new CEO at Audi, courtesy of Mercedes and a production director from Opel's showpiece low-cost works in Eisenach. Competitors say, Piech was living up to his reputation as a determined manager with a keen eye for quality people. His recruitment drive was more wide-reaching than 'normal', but then VW - which scored a DM1.25bn loss in the three months to April - had more than the normal range of difficulties. According to Jorg Zauber of Eurosearch Consultants, a Dusseldorf headhunter with 20 years' experience, the Lopez offensive was 'highly unusual'. But not as unusual as Opel's bringing its complaints into the public arena and then to court. It was more common for chief executives to settle their differences personally in a 'gentlemanly' manner, he says. However, Herman points out, calls to Piech from Jack Smith, GM's chief executive had proved fruitless. Opel turned instead to laws forbidding headhunting which go so far as to 'endanger the existence' of a target company. The common practice of locking management board directors into five-year contracts is normally enough to protect the top layer. But as Zauber points out, the usual one-year notice period required of non-board management is hardly effective. It makes little sense to hold on to a person who wants to leave. Herman is unflattered by the tribute, implied in VW's actions, that Opel's buying and production people are the best in Germany. He is disappointed that VW, the industry leader, tried to solve its problems at Opel's expense. The sort of friendly competition among industry leaders for which Herman evidently yearns created an environment in which poaching traditionally was not permitted in Japan. But changing economic circumstances have put increasing pressure on that country's rigid corporate hierarchies, making Japanese executives more willing to listen to headhunters. Indeed foreign securities companies have been able to lure senior managers from Japanese brokerages. Larger Japanese companies, though, are still reluctant to court their competitors' employees. The hierarchy remains a formidable obstacle, as employees look forward to a slow, steady passage up the ladder. Loyalty is still lauded and the suggestion that a departing executive could take a roomful of his most trusted aides to a competitor prompts disbelief among Japanese executives.</p>

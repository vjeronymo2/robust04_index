			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Marion Barry's comeback gets primary boost Mr Marion Barry's resounding victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary ballot puts him just one step away from reclaiming the office of mayor of Washington, which he lost four years ago when the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested him on cocaine charges. Mr Barry's campaign has seemed at times to be less a political comeback than a personal resurrection, but he won 47 per cent of the primary votes, seeing off Councilman John Ray, his principal rival, and crushing Mrs Sharon Pratt Kelly, the incumbent mayor. In overwhelmingly Democratic Washington, Mr Barry's primary victory is expected to guarantee him victory in the November election, even though his Republican and independent opponents are expected to reap an unusually large number of 'anyone but Barry' votes. Barry promised that God's power, which had redeemed him from sin, would 'lift the city of Washington off its knees'. But his comeback seems likely to place Washington, which as the US capital remains under Congress supervision and has enjoyed limited self-rule for the last 20 years, under tighter scrutiny. The congressional committees overseeing Washington's spending forced Ms Kelly to cut her budget this year, and they are expected to keep Mr Barry, who spent freely in his 12 year tenure as mayor, on a very short financial rein. In other closely fought primaries on Tuesday, Governor Arne Carlson of Minnesota won the Republican nomination, fending off a challenge from a candidate backed by the evangelical Christian right. Three other incumbent governors - Republicans Fife Symington of Arizona and Steve Merrill of New Hampshire and Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York - also won primaries. But Democratic Governor Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island was defeated by state senator Myrth York. Revolt against Washington, Page 19</p>

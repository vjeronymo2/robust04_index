			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: European drugs market sickly - N America bucks world trend with 7% growth this year The European drugs market, badly battered by healthcare reform in Germany during 1993, continued to perform poorly during the first two months of the year. Cost-cutting measures in France, Italy, Spain and the UK led to a 1 per cent drop in pharmaceuticals sales during January and February compared with the same period in 1993. Sales in the top seven European markets reached Dollars 6.88bn. Meanwhile the North American pharmacy market, which grew only 5 per cent during 1993, appears to be recovering. It posted sales growth of 7 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 8.063bn, according to IMS International, the London-based market research company. US sales were up 7 per cent at Dollars 7.49bn. The Japanese market, excluding hospital sales, dropped 6 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 2.873bn. The market will fall still further this year following an average 6.6 per cent price cut implemented at the beginning of this month. The top ten pharmaceuticals markets in the world registered growth of only 1 per cent to Dollars 17.8bn during the first two months in spite of relatively healthy growth in the US. The collapse of the German market, Europe's largest, appears to be at an end, but sales have not yet recovered to pre-reform levels. Sales in Germany dropped 13 per cent during the first quarter last year. During the first two months this year they rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn. The French market, Europe's second largest and until now one of the most robust, registered its first fall during the present wave of healthcare reform. Sales in January and February dropped 4 per cent from last year to Dollars 1.867bn. The decline followed the introduction of cost-cutting measures at the beginning of the year. Sales in Italy continued to suffer from reforms introduced last year. The market dropped 16 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 1.17bn. The UK market, which expanded 11 per cent during 1993, increased only 8 per cent this year. Sales in Spain were up 3 per cent at Dollars 601m, in the Netherlands up 4 per cent at Dollars 244m, and in Belgium up 1 per cent at Dollars 239m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 (USDOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      North America     Japan*    Germany   France  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular           1,303          448        454      442 Alimentary/Metabolism    1,271          539        346      324 Cen Nervous System       1,304          145        214      215 Respiratory                884          383        130      228 Anti-infectives            900          222        215      162 Musculo-Skeletal           360          273        105       81 Blood/Organs               499           60        117       89 Others                   1,542          803        373      326 Total                    8,063        2,873      1,954    1,867 % Change**                   7           -6          7       -4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           Italy   UK   Spain   Netherlands   Belgium  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular             266   137    113         46         46 Alimentary/Metabolism      211   159     94         56         38 Cen Nervous System         105   111     68         30         38 Respiratory                175    62     88         15         29 Anti-infectives             80   121     72         33         25 Musculo-Skeletal            62    54     31         11         13 Blood/Organs                47    48     16         15         11 Others                     225   120    119         38         39 Total                    1,171   812    601        244        239 % Change**                 -16     8      3          4          1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only **Increase excluding currencies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

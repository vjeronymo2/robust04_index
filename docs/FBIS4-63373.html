			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Zlodorev and Andrey </F> Lvov]    [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- The Dalai Lama said he will  find means and ways to hold a referendum on the future of Tibet.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday before his  departure from Moscow where he was on a three-day visit, the  Dalai Lama said he remains hopeful that he will return to China  one day and step into the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and the  Potala, the former palace of the Dalai Lama.    The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after bloody clashes between the  Tibetan population and Chinese police in 1959 and has been  living in India ever since.    He said that Tibetan culture is on the verge of extinction  and confirmed his readiness to hold talks with China on the  basis of the principle "one country -- two systems" proposed by  architect of chinese reform Deng Xiaoping for Taiwan and Hong  Kong. He believes this principle could also be applied to Tibet.    The Dalai Lama was in Moscow at the invitation of the  Russian  Academy of Sciences and the International Foundation for the  Survival and Development of Mankind. He held informal meetings  with Russian parliamentarians and Moscow officials and public  figures, and took part in a seminar on global security and  conflict settlement.    On Friday [20 May], the Dalai Lama attended an international  prayer for peace which he served together with representatives  of the Russian Orthodox, Islamic, Judaic and Buddhist clergy.    Kindness is the basis of human being and people of Russia  must remember this, the Dalai Lama said. He called on the  citizens of Russia to believe in themselves and not to abandon  their hope for a better future.    The Dalai Lama said he was impressed by changes in Russia  and  the greater openness of society and people who eagerly joined in  conversation with him in the street, asked questions and did not  try to hide their opinion and emotions.    He believes Russia should come up with something new in the  economic sphere in order to avoid the flaws of Western economies.    The Dalai Lama flew back to India today.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 38. Congress mandated that the Commission ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.'' <FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>  To achieve this goal, the statute requires the Commission to ``consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' Thus, while providing that we may charge for licenses, Congress has ordered that the Commission design its auction procedures to ensure that designated entities have opportunities to obtain licenses and provide service. For that purpose, the law does not mandate the use of any particular procedure but it specifically approves the use of ``tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' The use of any such procedure is, in our view, mandated where necessary to achieve Congress's objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 39. In addition to this mandate, the statute sets forth various congressional objectives. For example, it provides that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall ``promot[e] economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' <FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>  Further, Section 309(j)(4)(A) provides that to promote the statute's objectives the Commission shall ``consider alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;and combinations of such schedules and methods.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(3)(B);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see also id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . &sect;309(j)(4)(C) (requiring the Commission when prescribing area designations and bandwidth assignments, to promote ``economic opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women). As noted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the statute also requires the Commission to promote the purposes specified in Section 1 of the Communications Act, which include, among other things, ``to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;151;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at n.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40. To satisfy these statutory mandates and objectives, we established in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  eligibility criteria and general rules to govern the special measures for small businesses, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we employed several measures, including installment payments, bidding credits and tax certificates, to enhance opportunities for designated entities bidding on certain narrowband PCS licenses. We stated that we believed that narrowband PCS would provide significant opportunities for all designated entities to provide a wide variety of new services including advanced paging and messaging services. In adopting the particular measures for designated entities, however, we assumed that narrowband PCS would involve relatively low capital entry requirements, and would therefore be well-suited to small entities, which lack access to large amounts of capital. <FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, we found that the measures we selected for narrowband PCS auctions were appropriately tailored to the unique characteristics of narrowband PCS and would therefore ``create meaningful incentives for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and/or women to both bid successfully for available licenses and provide innovative and expeditious service to the public. <FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>  In this regard we indicated that installment payments would provide a significant means for small businesses to overcome their main barrier to entry: lack of access of financing. And, a 25 percent bidding credit for minority and women-owned businesses together with a tax certificate program would address the additional obstacles faced by those designated entities. We noted, however, that we would continue to assess the effectiveness of the measures adopted for narrowband PCS, and would apply any knowledge gained to subsequent auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;69. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;70. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 41. Our goal in the narrowband personal communications service is to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section 309(j)(4)(D), as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive concentration of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. As explained more fully below, we believe that it is necessary in some respects to do more to ensure that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we are concerned that a 25 percent bidding credit and installment payments may not be sufficient to ensure the opportunity of these businesses to compete against the larger, deep pocketed incumbent firms. Therefore, we have decided to expand the provisions for designated entities as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

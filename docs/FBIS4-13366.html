			<p>BFN     [Text] The army command's units in the al-Sulaymaniyah  governorate have arrested a woman agent of the Iraqi regime's  intelligence service. At a news conference held by the army  command in al-Sulaymaniyah, the criminal, 37-year-old Hajar,  confessed that in December 1993 she detonated an explosive  device in the hospital for handicapped people run by Handicap  International. One citizen was martyred and 10 others were  injured in that explosion, for which she was paid 50,000 dinars  by the Iraqi regime.    The criminal added that she was arrested while she was  returning to al-Sulaymaniyah from Baghdad on the night of 13-14  April. She said that she intended to plant time bombs in the  hospitals run by international humanitarian aid organizations or  where foreign doctors work in return for $10,000 from the Iraqi  regime.    In other developments, the army command in Irbil has  announced that yesterday afternoon its units defused a time bomb  planted in a downtown park.</p>

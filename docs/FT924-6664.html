			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Steel dumping duties upset E Europe - Critics say the EC is using outdated criteria to hobble the most promising industries THE European Commission's decision to impose anti-dumping duties on seamless steel tube imports from Croatia and the three central European countries with which it has signed association agreements has aroused predictable anger in the affected countries. By imposing the highest duty, 30.4 per cent, on Czechoslovakia the commission clearly identified what it perceives as the main offender. But Mr Vladimir Petr, director of the metallurgical department of the Czech Ministry of Industry, questioned the Commission's figures and said the case for dumping was 'not proven'. The point was made more forcibly by Mr Philip Toor, managing director of Future Steel trading, a principal UK importer of Czechoslovak steel. 'Prices on west European markets are determined by EC producers undercutting each other against the backdrop of a 19m-26m ton surplus steel capacity among EC producers. East European exporters are still far too small to be market makers. They are just a soft target for EC producers anxious to cut down the competition.' Producers and traders are not alone, however, in criticising the latest protectionist move against steel products, one of the most sensitive of the trilogy of east European products, with textiles and foodstuffs, subject to special treatment in deference to EC sensibilities. 'The latest dumping duties appear to have been imposed using the old criteria, applied when all prices in the former centrally planned economies were artificial and judgments about the degree of dumping were formed by comparison with prices from third countries. Eight months after the the EC signed association agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland which apparently liberalised the steel trade we see the Community being bloody-minded at the first hurdle,' says Mr Jim Rollo, an east-west trade specialist at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. 'If they do this for steel now what will they do for electronics imports in future?' According to the Commission, east European pipe exports have risen from 7.8 per cent of the market in 1988 to 18 per cent this year, contributing to the closure of 11 EC tube mills over the last two years. Czechoslovakia has three steel plants with tube-making capacity at Vitkovice, Ostrava and Chomutov. The value of its tube exports to EC markets rose from Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.2m) in 1989 to Dollars 45m last year and Dollars 59m over the first nine months of this year. While most exports have come from Czechoslovakia and Poland, Hungary, a relatively small producer, incurred the second highest duty, at 21.7 per cent. The Hungarians are particularly incensed at this latest example of what is widely seen as the EC's tendency to talk grandly about helping central Europe while hobbling those industries with the greatest trade potential. Hungarian officials say the local industry enforced a self-imposed reduction in pipe exports to around 22,000 tons this year compared with 40,000 tons in 1991, precisely in order to ward off damaging EC protectionist measures. Hungary has only one seamless tube producer, the Csepel Steel Mill, which traditionally exported 90 per cent of its products to the former Soviet Union. According to Mr Bela Simon, the managing director, Csepel has managed to regain much of that market in recent months, ironically, against competition from cheap Czechoslovak products both at home and abroad. The penetration of western markets by private traders has been assisted by under-valued currencies. Czechoslovakia in particular argues its competitiveness in western markets is not a function of dumping but of a currency whose value is depressed in part because of uncertainty ahead of January's expected separation of Czech and Slovak republics. Currency factors are less important in the Polish and Hungarian cases, while Poland, like Czechoslovakia, still provides an element of subsidy to the steel industry through low energy prices. Such subsidies are being rapidly phased out. At the root of east European competitiveness is a cocktail of factors - cheap labour at wage rates around 10 per cent of western levels, undervalued currencies, cheap energy and raw materials from the former Soviet Union, and the collapse of domestic demand and inter-Comecon trade. But circumstances are changing fast. Ukraine is one of the main sources of iron ore for steel mills in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. It also produced 7m of the 22m tons of steel tubes made before the former Soviet Union collapsed. Since Ukraine decided this month to withdraw from the rouble zone, however, Russia has indicated that future oil and other energy deliveries to the Ukraine will be at world market prices. This will force Kiev to raise the price of iron pellets to central European plants whose own energy cost advantages are also fast disappearing. This leaves cheap labour and a desperate need for higher exports as the main driving force behind higher sales to a European Community whose own future exports to the region depend on an export-led recovery in east and central Europe - which the latest anti-dumping measures contradict.</p>

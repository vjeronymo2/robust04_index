			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MANY VIEWS OF 'DAYS OF RAGE'  </P> <P> On every other issue of concern to Americans, no matter how controversial, both  sides have been publicly presented: pro-life vs. pro-choice; hawks vs. doves  over Vietnam; pro-glasnost vs. anti-communists, to name but a few. Why must the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict be the exception? Those who have protested against  "Days of Rage" on the ground of bias should consider that sometimes the facts  are biased.  </P> <P> MOHAMMED BARAKAT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

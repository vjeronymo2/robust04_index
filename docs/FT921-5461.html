			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland gets green light for Steetley bid REDLAND has been given permission by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary, to proceed with its contested Pounds 600m bid for Steetley, its rival UK building materials group. Mr Lilley said that he had accepted undertakings by Redland that it would dispose of two brick plants in south-east England and Steetley's clay roof tile business if the bid succeeded. The undertakings were sought because a takeover of Steetley would have left the merged group with 46 per cent of the national clay roof tile market and 23 per cent of brick production capacity in south-east England. The brick plants at Cranleigh and Tilmanstone and clay tile plants at Keele and Knutton in Staffordshire must be sold within 18 months of the bid succeeding. Steetley, which must publish its defence document within two days of Mr Lilley's clearance of Redland's offer, said that it would defend itself vigorously against a bid which substantially under-valued its business. Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, said:'The undertakings they have been required to give undermines the commercial logic of their offer. 'They are going to have to sell our two most modern brickworks, the country's leading clay manufacturers and our best clay reserves. They will now have to work very hard to demonstrate where they are going to make the Pounds 30m of savings they have been saying they will achieve from buying Steetley.' Redland said that the businesses it would be selling accounted for less than 5 per cent Steetley's turnover and that it would achieve savings of Pounds 30m even after the undertakings. Redland's share price yesterday fell 10p to 450p. The group is offering 85 of its shares for every 100 Steetley valuing its 156.5m ordinary shares at Pounds 598.6m or 382 1/2 p apiece. This compared with Steetley's closing price of 380p last night.</p>

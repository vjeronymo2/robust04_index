			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Consultants and 'hazy' reputation Sir, Andrew Jack, in his objective overview of the present management consultancy scene (FT Survey, 'Focus has to sharpen', October 21), comments that some larger firms see professional associations as 'a waste of time'. I am bound to accept that his comment is accurate. And that is regrettable because, without the involvement of the large-firm consultants, the profession can number only one in four of practitioners in the UK. There are at least 6,000 consultants practising ethically and competently beneath the banner of their firm's commercial reputation. If those consultants were to join their independent professional body, clients would benefit from a strong profession that would, in time, draw in all ethical and competent practitioners - and would exclude all those who were not. The terms 'qualified' and 'unqualified' would then take on real meaning; and management consultants would no longer have to be concerned that, as Mr Jack so well expresses it, 'their reputation as professionals remains hazy'. Adrian Williams, president, Institute of Management Consultants, 32/33 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8DL</p>

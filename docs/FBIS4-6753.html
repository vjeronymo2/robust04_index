			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong says his visits to  Europe should be seen as a tying up of two ends of a ribbon. At  one end are the prospects in the Asian economies and at the  other end are prospective investors in Western Europe and  elsewhere. Summing up his visits to Germany and Britain, Mr.  Goh said Singapore wants to act as an intermediary to tie the  knot. This is part of Singapore's overall strategy of going  regional. The Singapore delegation's spokesman said Mr. Goh's  trip to Germany had brought bilateral relations to a higher  level. This is because of new steps being taken such as the  formation of the Singapore-German Business Forum, the GSBF.    On Britain, the spokesman said the level of Singapore's  relations with the country has been high. British leaders  shared Mr. Goh's concern on the need to build on this  relationship. One concrete way to assert the strengthened ties  is through the setting up of the Singapore-British Business  Council to be ready in about one to two months' time.    Mr. Goh returned home this evening after his official visits  to Germany and Britain.</p>

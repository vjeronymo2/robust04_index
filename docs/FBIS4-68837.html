			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Novomlinskaya: "Russian Cities Want More </F> Independence"]    [Text] Economic changes have hardly yet affected the  interrelationship between federal and local budgets. Handing  over the major portion of their tax revenues to the federal  budget, cities are virtually in no condition right now to carry  out investment activity or implement social programs. A four-day  seminar on the topic "Problems of Investment-Construction Policy  in Russia," organized by the Union of Russian Cities and  dedicated to a discussion of this problem, completed its  activity yesterday.    The seminar was attended by an array of the most diverse  organizations. In addition to representatives of the structures  of power--the presidential staff, Ministry of Finance, Ministry  of Economics, State Committee on Construction, and Moscow  Committee on Land--Russian and foreign scholars were also  invited, as were the commercial organizations SAVVA R.E., RAIN  [not further identified], and Housing Initiative. The  representatives of 20 major cities of Russia tried to generalize  the information provided by those who spoke and present the real  state of affairs in the investment-construction complex  throughout Russia as a whole and in the localities as well.    The results turned out to be disappointing. It was clear  from  the presentations of representatives of the federal authority  that the municipalities can rely only on themselves in resolving  the housing problem. The government is presently able to finance  only the program for provision of housing to military servicemen  and (partially) to inhabitants of the North who have resettled  in the central regions. Nor can local authorities rely on  assistance from commercial structures in the financing of  housing construction, although the experience of many firms  using a contributory-construction arrangement tapping funds of  the populace may find application in the regions.    In the opinion of representatives of the municipalities, the  relationship between powers of the central and local levels of  authority must be changed. The government has stopped financing  regional programs but has not reduced its control over the  activity of city authorities. As a result, the municipalities  are left one on one with their problems, left with a mass of  directives and statutes regulating their activities. In  addition, effective this year a significantly greater share of  tax revenues is going to the federal budget. Seminar  participants believe the only way out is to diminish control by  the center and expand the powers of local organs of authority in  the use of tax revenues.    Results of the seminar will be generalized and reported in  the conclusion of a group of experts, which will be provided to  the committees on matters of local self-government under the  federal legislative and executive authorities. These committees  are presently drawing up proposals aimed at amending legislation  on local self-government.</p>

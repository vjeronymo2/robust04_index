			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: GM to alter AGM rules to curb disruption General Motors of the US, the world's biggest industrial company, is to make drastic changes in the way it conducts annual meetings in an attempt to quell the disruption caused by dissident shareholders and hecklers. It plans to limit the amount of speaking time allotted to each shareholder and focus the annual meeting on formal business such as the election of directors and votes on company and stockholder proposals. GM, which has recently held its annual meetings in cities where it has plants, will also eliminate ancillary events such as shareholder lunches, plant tours and a chance to test drive new GM cars and trucks. Mr John Smale, GM chairman, said the de-emphasis of the annual meeting would be accompanied by the creation of new regional forums that would be held in 13 cities between now and March next year. These forums would coincide with local motor shows and would be attended by GM executives who would be on hand to answer shareholders' questions. In a speech to the National Association of Corporate Directors in Washington DC, Mr Smale said surveys showed that GM shareholders felt the company's annual meetings were not an effective method of communicating with them. 'A principal reason, they tell us, is the disproportionate and disruptive impact of a small number of shareholders who take an unreasonable amount of the time to pursue largely personal agendas,' Mr Smale said. At each year's annual meeting, GM has to contend with several shareholders who consume much of the meeting's question-and-answer period.</p>

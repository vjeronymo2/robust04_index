			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Structural reforms key to economic revival - Impediments to growth FINANCE ministers from the Group of Seven countries will today deliver a blunt warning to their heads of state that the world's leading economies face a gloomy future. A confidential finance ministers' report on structural impediments to growth says average G7 growth rates have fallen from 4.8 per cent in the 1960s to 3.3 per cent in the 1970s and 2.6 per cent in the 1980s. Since 1990 growth in the G7 economies has averaged just 1.3 per cent. Meanwhile, unemployment has more than doubled from 3 per cent in the 1960s to about 7.2 per cent. The report, agreed yesterday in Tokyo, warns that unless deeply rooted obstacles are dealt with by structural reforms, economic growth will remain depressed, unemployment will become a chronic problem and the threat of trade protectionism will grow. The report says a stable macroeconomic environment is needed to promote growth. 'It is essential for our countries to strengthen their efforts for fiscal consolidation at all levels of government to create room for private investment and keep the stock of public debt manageable.' Monetary policies, supported in some countries by wages and incomes policies, should help keep long-term interest rates low enough to promote investment. Efforts to make exchange rates more stable will be most successful with close co-ordination of economic policies. 'Structural unemployment has grown while economic growth has decelerated. Macroeconomic policies alone will not be effective in reducing the structural elements in unemployment.' However, in contrast to G7 statements in the 1980s this report does not call for sweeping deregulation to free up markets. Instead it acknowledges an important role for public policy in improving economic performance. It says 'well-targeted structural policies' are needed to raise growth. The report's recommendations include: The G7 economies need greater wage flexibility. They should move away from income support programmes for the unemployed towards more active policies to strengthen incentives for education, training and job search by the unemployed, particularly the young. Elements of social insurance schemes and regulations which unduly discourage employment creation should be re-examined. Fiscal deficits must be reduced over the medium term to generate higher savings and investment, particularly in the light of the costs of pensions and welfare for ageing populations. Free trade should be encouraged with the completion of the Gatt trade liberalisation talks. The ageing of populations in the G7 countries will require measures to control medical costs, public pensions and other welfare programmes. Labour market reforms to promote work by older workers will also be needed to improve the incomes of the elderly. Better control over healthcare costs is needed through direct government control over fees paid to hospitals or budget systems which limit overall outlays. The report is cautious about the benefits of financial deregulation. It says this should continue because it has benefited consumers, but policies should also address the risk that deregulation will increase consumer indebtedness and cause wild swings in share and land prices. Efforts are urged to reduce subsidies, particularly for producers of traded goods and in export credit systems must be intensified. On the environment it calls for the implementation of decisions taken at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit last summer.</p>

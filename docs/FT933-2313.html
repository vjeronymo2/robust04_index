			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Farmers make sure French government gets message MR CLAUDE CARRE was yesterday back on his farm in Gatelles some 100km from Paris, weary but satisfied. He was weary after spending the past four days helping to orchestrate Co-ordination Rurale's 'blockade' of the French capital. But he was satisfied that although the campaign only resulted in marginal disruption - 'we never wanted to lay siege to Paris,' says Mr Carre - the French government yesterday restated its threat to veto Europe's farm deal with the US if European Community ministers meeting in Brussels today show no willingness to revise the deal's terms. If any one organisation is responsible for pushing France to the brink of a veto, it is Co-ordination Rurale, says Mr Carre, who is the movement's deputy secretary general. Formed in 1991 in protest at what it saw as the passiveness of other French farm unions in opposing farm reform in the EC as well as in Gatt, CR has spread its membership to 75 of France's 96 departments. The government continues to give CR the cold shoulder, partly because of its occasionally violent tactics and partly in deference to the mainstream FNSEA union which fears CR eating away at its membership. For his part, Mr Carre says the FNSEA is the government's lackey and the FNSEA's nationwide demonstration, planned for today, will just be the equivalent of 'taking tea with the local (government) prefect'. Mr Carre is quite clear that, if France fails to get satisfaction from its EC partners today, it should veto the so-called Blair House with the US. But what if, as may well happen for reasons of Euro-procedure, there is no motion to attach a veto to today? Mr Carre and many others in France are puzzled by this possibility, having been led by their government to believe that today's Brussels meeting was a showdown. 'If that happens, France should leave its EC chair empty,' Mr Carre concludes. Despite years of support from the unreformed Common Agricultural Policy his village of Gatelles is now left with no shops and nine farms among a population of 180. Yet, these broad wheatlands around Chartres are the Kansas of Europe, and those who farm them ought to be Europe's best equipped to compete with the most competitive in the rest of the world. True, says Mr Carre, in the sense that the average wheat yield in his department of Eure et Loir is 75 quintals a hectare. This is triple the average US yield. But so, adds Mr Carre, are French investment in fertiliser, interest rates and social welfare charges. 'We can't produce at world prices, with French social charges,' he insists. Taking out the accounts ledger of the 250 ha cereal spread he farms with his two sons, Mr Carre estimates his charges for the coming year at around FFr8,300 (Pounds 945) per hectare, for which he will probably get a return of FFr6,000-6,500 per hectare (because of the EC's cereal price cut), compared to FFr9,300 last year. By far, the biggest charge - a total of FFr 488,000 - is what he will have to pay Credit Agricole on his borrowings of around FFr5m. He admits that if he and others in France's naturally-blessed wheat belt had not long ago been enticed by high CAP support prices into heavy investment and borrowing, they could have become less indebted, less intensive and equally competitive farmers. But that would require running the film of history backwards. 'It's a bit late for that,' says Mr Carre. And in the meantime, France has become the world's second largest farm exporter, a perch it does not want to lose.</p>

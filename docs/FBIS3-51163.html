During his stay in Angola, Robaina will be  received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He also  will meet with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and the president  of the parliament, Franca Van Dunem. Also on the agenda is a  meeting with the Cuban community in Angola, which numbers some  300 people.    Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio da Moura said in Luanda  today that it is a privilege for his country to have, as its  first visitor in 1994, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina.  Upon beginning the official talks between the two leaders today,  da Moura stressed that Robaina's presence comes at a moment  particularly difficult for the Angolan people because of the war  led by the opposition group UNITA. Speaking of relations with  Cuba, the Angolan foreign minister said that despite these  difficulties, his country intends to work to strengthen the ties  of cooperation that Angola has historically had with Cuba.    For his part, Robaina said that his visit to Angola is part  of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world in which the Cuban  authorities are searching for the appropriate milieu for Cuba.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Treuhand's final debt to total DM270bn Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency will have accumulated debts of DM270bn (Pounds 110.6bn) when it ceases operations at the end of this year. Then, its financial requirements will be met directly by the federal budget, Mr Heinrich Hornef, the agency's financial officer, said yesterday. The debt, DM5bn lower than recently forecast, will be financed from next year by bank loans and government guaranteed medium-term notes. Mr Hornef said it will take 'another generation to pay off' the deficit. Total receipts from privatisation sales since June 1990 would exceed DM53.2bn. It was believed originally that the sale of some 13,000 eastern German enterprises through the agency would raise more than DM600bn but these early estimates were rapidly hammered by the cost of German unification and collapsing eastern European markets. The Treuhand was provided with DM7bn start-up capital in June 1990 and this was supplemented by DM10bn the following year. Once the ruinous state of east German industry became clear, the ceiling for new borrowing in 1990 and 1991 was raised to DM25bn. In 1992, the agency was granted a credit line of DM38bn annually. These have all been consumed. Until now, the deficit has been financed through three different channels: bank credits, bonds, and medium-term notes. The agency has already issued DM160bn in long-term debt, and expects to do the same with an additional DM50bn. The remaining DM60bn of the total deficit will be broken down, with DM23bn financed through debt rescheduling, DM25bn through the capital markets, and the remainder carried over to the federal budget next year. Since the Treuhand will no longer exist after this year, its total debts, along with all other debts of the former east Germany, will be assumed by the Unwelcome Legacy Repayment Fund set up after German unification in 1990. The agency's financial requirements for 1995 onwards will total DM45bn. The government has made provisions in the federal budget for annual expenditure of about DM6bn. Treuhand contributions to next year's budget are expected to total DM5.4bn, rising to DM6.5bn in 1996. Nevertheless, the Treuhand has still to privatise some key elements of the east German economy, which may increase its debt and financial requirements. These include: Laubag, the region's largest brown coal field. A consortium led by Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE, Germany's largest utility, is expected to make a down-payment of DM2.1bn for Laubag, and a further commitment of DM6bn over the next 20 years. However, it is still unclear how much the Treuhand will have to pay in redundancy payments for restoration of brown coal fields to be closed. Veag, eastern Germany's largest electricity utility, which will be sold to a consortium led by RWE, and including PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. The consortium is expected to pay DM8bn for Veag and invest DM40bn over the next two decades. The sale of Buna, the chemical works in Saxony-Anhalt, and the modernisation and privatisation of Leuna, the other chemical and oil refinery complex. Eko Stahl, the loss-making steel mill in Brandenburg which the agency had hoped to sell to Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel manufacturer. until Riva pulled out in May. According to a recent Bundesbank report, the main part of the Treuhand financial legacy will impose a 'pro rata burden of DM17bn per annum on the federal budget, which will arise from the Unwelcome Legacy Repayment Fund'. It added that 'the envisaged debt itself will only be redeemable in the course of a generation.'</p>

Ya. Blank, F. K. Kasimov, A. Ya. Sharshanov; </F> UDC 537.874.6:621.317.794]    [Abstract] This article examines the absorption of infrared  radiation in a periodic structure, a thin corrugated metal film  on a dielectric substrate.  Absorption in this structure increases sharply, reaching unity.  The increase in absorption is due to resonant excitation in a  system of surface electromagnetic waves. The amount of  absorption depends significantly on the ratio of intrinsic and  radiative attenuation. The substrate is necessary to reach high  absorption values. The substrate parameters and the angle of  incid ence of the external wave are determined. The scattering  of a plane p-polarized monochromatic wave incident  from vacuum at an angle on a metal-dielectric film is studied.  Figure 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

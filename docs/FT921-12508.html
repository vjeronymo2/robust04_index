			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / BBC staff to protest at job losses BROADCASTING unions at the BBC are planning a 'day of action' in the spring to protest about increasing job losses at the corporation. Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, the broadcasting production union, described the move yesterday as a vote of no confidence in Mr John Birt, the BBC deputy director-general who has been chosen to succeed Sir Michael Checkland as director-general. The BBC has announced more than 300 job losses this week. It says 3,000 jobs are due to go before the end of 1993 as part of the programme of cutting costs and improving efficiency, and reflecting the move to independent production. Two thousand BBC jobs have been lost in the past four years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on Japan's decision to postpone the plutonium utility  program.    The news analyst says:    Japan's measure does not mean abandoning the plutonium  utility program but postponing the construction of a new  plutonium production facility.    Japan's abrupt decision to postpone the program is a crafty  ruse to convince the world public of its non-nuclear will, avoid  international criticism and isolation and create a favorable  climate for holding a permanent membership in the U.N. Security  Council.    The decision came in the wake of Japan's calculation that  the  postponement of the construction of a new plutonium production  facility will do no harm to its nuclear arms development.    Japan's efforts to convert itself into a military power and  arm itself with nuclear weapons are based on revanchism.    The Japanese ruling quarters obsessed with the ambition to  lord it over in the international arena as a military and  political power regard nuclear armament as an inevitable means  to carry into practice their ambition.    With no trick can the Japanese authorities conceal their  ambition for nuclear armament.    Japan must give up nuclear armament, mindful that this will  lead to its own destruction.</p>

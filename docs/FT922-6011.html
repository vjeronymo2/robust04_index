			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y bank creditors post gains BANK of Montreal (BMO) and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth biggest banks respectively, lifted second-quarter earnings despite their sizeable exposures to troubled property developer Olympia &amp; York. BMO, which disclosed CDollars 318m (USDollars 267.2m) in loans to O&amp;Y, boosted net earnings to CDollars 143.5m, or CDollars 1.07 a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 128.4m, or CDollars 1.01, a year earlier. The improvement was due largely to a slower rise in expenses than in revenues, and to a substantial growth in lending volumes, especially to small and mid-sized businesses. Total assets have jumped by almost 8 per cent in the past year to CDollars 104.2bn. BNS's earnings advanced to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, from CDollars 163.3m, or 73 cents, in the same period last year. The bank ascribed the rise to wider margins as interest rates continued to decline. BNS has lifted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by CDollars 200m, or 45 per cent, to reflect its exposure to O&amp;Y and to other troubled borrowers. Its exposure to O&amp;Y stands at CDollars 630m. Its second-quarter provision of CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous three months. The provision in the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m. Non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on April 30 from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier. The bank did not disclose how much of this increase was accounted for by O&amp;Y loans. BMO has classified its entire O&amp;Y portfolio as non-performing, but has left its forecast for fiscal 1992 loan losses unchanged at CDollars 500m. The bank said that its loans to O&amp;Y were secured by specific office buildings, which continue to generate cash flow, and by listed marketable securities. It is not involved in the Canary Wharf project in London or in any of O&amp;Y's large syndicated financings. Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BMO reported that its risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the second quarter to 9.1 per cent from 8.5 per cent three months earlier. BNS's capital ratio has edged up to 8.6 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Olympia &amp; York's creditors are gradually stripping away the secrecy that was once the property developer's hallmark. The Toronto-based company, whose Canadian operations were placed under court protection two weeks ago, has made public for the first time the cash flows of its Canadian properties. The data is contained in a 26-page affidavit submitted in response to a court order which was granted last week at the request of the creditors. The company was also due to provide various groups of lenders with more detailed information by late yesterday, including projections of future cash flows.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Marginalisation of Mediterranean countries Sir, Your assessment of Europe's future challenge in your editorial, 'Europe's big challenge' (November 9), is accurate in indicating that the EU 1996 intergovernmental conference must contend with the assignment of furthering the integration experiment in the west and simultaneously spell out a plan for integrating the states of eastern and central Europe. But it surprisingly makes no mention of Europe's challenges on its southern flank. An analysis of the EU's recent document, Strengthening the Mediterranean Policy of the EU: Establishing a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which proposes the creation of a free trade zone in the area, and a review of EU enlargement to include either Malta, Cyprus or Turkey, are absent. For the record, the EU now gives twice as much aid to eastern Europe as to the Mediterranean. In the period 1990-1994, the EU spent Ecu 1.626bn (Dollars 2.07bn) on the Mediterranean and Ecu 3.781bn on eastern Europe. Is this an indication of gradual marginalisation by Brussels of the Mediterranean, despite lip-service to the contrary?

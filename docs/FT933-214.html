			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Press white paper set for further delays THE GOVERNMENT has delayed a white paper on privacy and the press amid disagreements among ministers and a growing realisation of the complexity of issues involved. The National Heritage Department first promised a white paper before the summer recess, then suggested that the document, expected to propose a 'voluntary' ombudsman in addition to the industry's Press Complaints Commission, would come during the recess. The most recent hope was that Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, would make an announcement at next week's Conservative conference in Blackpool where a number of motions on the press have been submitted. The heritage department said Mr Brooke had written to Mr Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the Commons national heritage committee admitting the government response to its report on the subject would be delayed. It is likely there will not be a white paper until next year. Mr Brooke has decided to wait until responses to the Lord Chancellor's privacy green paper have been assessed. Responses must be in by October 15. Ms Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the World and a former complaints commission member, said: 'I think the truth is that there are no complaints about newspapers. The commission is hard-pressed to find complaints from readers, and really it's politicians who are concerned about privacy and the press, not the ordinary public.' The Lord Chancellor's office has proposed a law giving citizens the right to sue for up to Pounds 10,000 in damages for invasion of privacy. The delay also means that new criminal offences covering electronic eavesdropping and the taking of pictures on private property are unlikely to be included in the Criminal Justice Bill. There have been problems of definition and arguments over whether there should be a defence of public interest in the offences. Lord McGregor, chairman of the complaints commission, and other commission members have said they will resign if an ombudsman is appointed.</p>

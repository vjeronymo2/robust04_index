			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US duties 'broke fair trade rules' The US last year breached international fair trade rules in levying anti-subsidy duties on imports of hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel from France, Germany and Britain, a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade panel has decided. Though the amount of trade involved is small - about Dollars 19m a year - the judgment corroborates repeated allegations by Washington's trading partners that US anti-subsidy (and anti-dumping) rules are unfairly biased against imports. It also suggests that the US could be found in breach of Gatt rules in a second panel case, this time involving countervailing duties imposed on carbon steel flat-rolled products from six European Union states. The Gatt panels arise from a wave of anti-dumping and countervailing duty suits brought by US steel producers in 1992 following the expiry of voluntary export restraint arrangements. Though most of the 70-odd suits were later dismissed by the US International Trade Commission, some definitive duties were imposed. The first panel report, which went to Washington and Brussels last Friday, broadly upholds the EU complaint that US methods of calculating countervailing duties artificially inflate the level of alleged steel subsidies. However, the panel did not accept every aspect of the EU case. The report says the US commerce department failed to give the steel exporters involved sufficient opportunity to present evidence. It was also wrong to treat debt forgiveness by private banks as a subsidy and to assume subsidies to a state-owned company were 'passed through' on privatisation. The panel nevertheless ruled that the US was entitled to average subsidies over a 15-year period and to include a risk premium in the discount rate it applied to calculate the benefit of certain subsidies.</p>

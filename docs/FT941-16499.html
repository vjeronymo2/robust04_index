			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Allied-Lyons gives RSC Pounds 3.3m - Sponsorship The sponsorship year got off to the best possible start with the confirmation on Friday that the Royal Shakespeare Company had found a much needed corporate backer. Allied-Lyons, the foods to drinks company, is giving the RSC Pounds 3.3m over the next three years, the largest arts sponsorship in the UK. It was wonderful news for the RSC which in December said goodbye to Royal Insurance, its main corporate prop, which had contributed Pounds 3.5m over six years. Allied-Lyons has decided to concentrate its arts and community expenditure behind one venture, and asked consultants Scope Communications to come up with alternatives. Of its three suggestions the RSC was the obvious choice for chief executive Tony Hales. 'It's one of the best international brands in the UK,' he says. Allied-Lyons money will support four productions a year in the UK, educational work, and, of vital importance to the sponsor, international tours. Most of Allied-Lyons' profits come from overseas and the first fruits of the link will be harvested in an imminent RSC tour of the Far East, including Japan, where the company works closely with Suntory. Hales intends to lock the company in tightly with the RSC. It will involve its 70,000 employees, and its shareholders, with discounted seats, and help to promote RSC tours through its pub outlets. It may also back individual productions with its brand names and use the RSC in advertising. For the RSC the sponsorship is vital. Although director Adrian Noble has lopped Pounds 600,000 off the overdraft since his arrival, it still stands at Pounds 2.4m, and the windfall royalties from its production of Les Miserables are now slackening. This valuable new commitment to the RSC increases confidence all round. * Researching the effectiveness of sponsorship is a costly business, so few supporters of the arts, and even fewer arts organisations, contemplate doing it. However the Tate Gallery has set in motion a long-term evaluation of the impact of sponsorship on its exhibitions. It is conducted by MORI, and is costing the Tate over Pounds 20,000. MORI is questioning visitors to the Gallery; past, present, and potential sponsors; and MPs and opinion formers, and gaining their reactions to sponsorships at the Tate. Or whether, indeed, there are any reactions. Favourable results will contribute towards a marketing package to offer potential sponsors. If there are criticisms, the Tate's business development department, under Fay Ballard, will try and remedy them. Since 1990 the Tate has raised Pounds 4.25m in corporate sponsorship. As well as regular backers, like BP, which has just paid for another annual rehang, and Tate &amp; Lyle, which has renewed its funding for the Friends of the Tate, in 1994 Ernst &amp; Young is involved in its first major sponsorship by putting a substantial six-figure sum behind a Picasso show, and Reed-Elsevier comes in later in the year, helping to stage a Whistler exhibition. Award ceremonies in the arts stimulate attention, reward performers, and appeal to sponsors. Classical music has never really succeeded in getting a prize-giving off the ground to match the Booker, the Whitbread, the Olivier, or the Prudential, partly because its scope is so international. The Classical Music Awards sponsored by Kenwood, the Japanese electronics company, seems to have plugged the gap. The 14 prizes, bronze sculptures by Dhruva Mistry, will be distributed at the Albert Hall on January 21 to category winners - singer (male and female); orchestra; composition; etc. - from eight countries. The international spread of the awards makes it costly  -Kenwood invests Pounds 350,000 in organising the event, plus another Pounds 150,000 on promotion - but is happy enough with the results to have signed up for another two years. * In theory sponsorship was to be the icing on the cake for major arts companies, with the cake being well fruited with state support through the Arts Council. Events are changing that, most strikingly in the financing of the London orchestras. The contribution of grants to their financial viability has fallen steadily, with sponsorship making up much of the shortfall. This is especially true of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which on December 15 discovered that its Arts Council grant for 1994-95 was to be cut by 25 per cent to Pounds 300,000, or around 5 per cent of its turnover, and, on the same day, finalised a Pounds 500,000 a year sponsorship with Classic FM. The RPO becomes the station's national orchestra, taking concerts from its London platform around the UK. The RPO hopes that its success in forging such a substantial sponsorship, the largest in the UK classical music scene, will prod the Arts Council into raising its grant, at least for its touring activities. * What's in a name? Around Pounds 20,000 for the Blackheath Concert Hall. It was planning a Christmas production of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. One of the board was great friends with Peter Wolff, who runs S. R. Gent, a clothing supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer. Peter Wolff liked the idea of backing his opera. As a first time sponsor the BSIS gave the concert halls a matching Pounds 20,000, which helped support a Victorian Circus. And Wolff is so happy that he wants to make Peter and the Wolf an annual event. * Mobil is one sponsor which sticks in there and positively relishes backing the controversial. It has just announced another Mobil Playwriting Competition. Scripts should be in by next August and there is Pounds 40,000 in prize money. In contrast, Mobil also backs a popular play which tours the country, offering its regional offices opportunities to entertain clients, its staff discounted seats, and the wider public the chance to see a production which is more lavish than most theatres can hope to present these days. Alan Ayckbourn's Absurd Person Singular is just starting the rounds.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Kuwaiti firefighters in row TEAMS fighting Kuwait's oil fires yesterday dismissed as impractical a government claim that the task could be accomplished in seven months, amid signs of growing tension between the firefighters and the Kuwait authorities. Mr Rasheed al Almeeri, the Kuwait oil minister, said at the weekend the government had decided to invite companies from across the world to help fight the fires under a 'new strategy' to cap all the wells in seven months. However, Mr Mike Miller, president of Safety Boss, the Canadian blow-out company, said yesterday the task would take two to three years, however many companies became involved. 'Some of the bigger wells will take several weeks each to douse, if not a few months,' he said. The government announcement followed offers from European and other oil and construction companies to sell Kuwait their equipment and technical aid to help solve the problem. Representatives from Agip, Petrofina and Elf Acquitaine are in Kuwait this week to meet ministers. Mr al Almeeri said the government was negotiating with companies from Britain, China, France, Germany and Iran. Mr al Almeeri's decision to bring in more contractors was made without consulting the four US and Canadian companies so far taken on. 'It will be a surprise to them,' he said. 'Perhaps it will make them work faster.' However, leaders of the four companies bridle at the suggestion that the slow progress - only three fires have been put out so far - is their fault. 'We still haven't been able to get the equipment into the country,' said Mr Brian Krause of Red Adair Co. 'I'd guess we have about 20 per cent of what we need to do the job.' The companies say the larger fires cannot be tackled until the arrival of several more 85,000 pound earthmovers - now being flown into Kuwait airport  -and until water can be either piped or trucked to wellheads in quantities of up to 1m gallons a day. Iraq will soon be producing sufficient oil products to meet its needs, the Iraqi news agency said yesterday.</p>

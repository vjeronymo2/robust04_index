			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SENATOR SEES VIETNAM OPENING  </P> <P> Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said today that Vietnam's moves toward a market  economy had opened the door for possible U.S. investment if Washington and  Hanoi can end lingering differences.  </P> <P> Lugar, the highest-ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit Vietnam since the end of the  Vietnam War in 1975, met with Vietnamese Premier Doi Muoi and Foreign Minister  Nguyen Co Thach over the weekend.  </P> <P> "We will report back to Washington that considerable progress has been made in  moving toward market economics in Vietnam, that there are opportunities clearly  for American businesses and that the United States should carefully consider  whether that business opportunity situation should progress," Lugar told  reporters.  </P> <P> The United States has maintained a total trade, investment and aid embargo  against Hanoi since it defeated South Vietnam in 1975. Vietnam, unable to  obtain World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans, has been devastated  economically by the embargo.  </P></p>

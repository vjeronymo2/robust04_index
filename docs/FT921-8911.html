			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment increase largest in the south THE RATE of job losses appears to be increasing, according to unemployment figures released yesterday. Last month more than half the people losing their jobs were in the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia - the regions hardest hit by unemployment in the past two years. That has largely been due to cuts in service industries - the dominant employers in the three regions. Seasonally adjusted un-employment last month stood at 2,604,000, a rise of 53,000 from December. That followed a revised unemployment rise in December of 36,200, and came after several months in which job losses appeared to have slowed. In the three months to January the average monthly rise in the jobless total was 43,300, the highest figure since September last year. In the three months to December the comparable number was 31,300. The headline, or unadjusted, figure in January was 2,673,864, which is 122,000 above the previous month. Since March 1990, when unemployment started rising at around the start of the recession, 1,027,299 people have lost their jobs. Adjusted for seasonal variations, the figure is 997,500. The south-east including London suffered 20,700 job losses in December. That increased the unemployment rate, measured as a proportion of the workforce, by 0.2 of a percentage point to 8.3 per cent. The rates in the south-west and East Anglia both rose by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 8.7 per cent and 7.0 per cent respectively. Since March 1990 unemployment in the south-east has increased by 128 per cent. The other two regions have each seen jobless totals more than double. Over the same period other parts of Britain - which suffered big increases in un-employment in the early 1980s and have relatively large concentrations of manufacturing industry - have suffered less from unemployment. Northern Ireland, which has 14.3 per cent of its workforce unemployed, has seen its unemployment total increase by just 5 per cent since March 1990. Over the 22 months the difference between the unemployment rates in the south-east and Northern Ireland has narrowed from 10.5 percentage points to 6 percentage points. In line with the reduction in inflationary pressures across the economy, the index of average earnings for manufacturing rose in the 12 months to December by 7 3/4 per cent on an underlying basis. In November the rise was 8 per cent. The comparable increase for service industries was 7 per cent, down from 7 1/4 per cent in November. Last month's large increase in joblessness appears to have been partly due to a slackening in recruitment. That may have been reflected by the 229,800 people leaving the government's unemployment register in January, the lowest monthly figure for a year. Parliament, Page 8</p>

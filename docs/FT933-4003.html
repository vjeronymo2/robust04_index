For the previous 14 months there were restated losses of Pounds 755,000. Mr Ian Orrock, chairman, said the fall in turnover from Pounds 5.46m to Pounds 4.18m reflected the uncertainty surrounding the future of the group during the first half, together with the scale of the recession, competitive conditions and the uncertainty in the local authority sector of the group's market. The pre-tax result was after exceptional cost of sales of Pounds 180,000 relating to works required to correct a substantial number of manufacturing and installation problems and an exceptional Pounds 60,000 for rationalisation and reorganisation costs. Losses per share fell to 0.9p (13.6p).</p>

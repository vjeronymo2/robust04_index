			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- A top White House  official indicated Friday [24 June] the United States has no  intention of pressing Japan for a settlement of trade disputes  prior to the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit meeting at Naples just  two weeks away.    "We have discussions going on, and there is a Naples Summit.  Those are two interesting but unrelated events," said Robert  Rubin, director of the White House National Economic Council.    Officials from the two countries have been negotiating  almost  continuously over the past month in an effort to mend their  strained trade ties, which have roiled financial and currency  markets.    They have expressed hope of hammering out a deal prior to  the  Naples Summit, which is scheduled for July 8-10. The prospect,  however, has become murky in view of the political turmoil in  Tokyo that has engulfed the minority government of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Rubin, who briefed reporters on the agenda of the G-7  summit,  sought to steer away from any comment on the prospect of a trade  agreement with Japan, saying it would "not be fruitful, useful  or productive" to comment on prospects while negotiations are in  progress.    The so-called "framework" trade negotiations focus on how to  measure progress of imports to Japan as part of a Japanese  commitment to improve the access of foreign products in the  Japanese market.    Rubin, who serves as the top economic aide to President Bill  Clinton, also declined to make any comment on the turbulence in  the currency markets following a sharp fall of the dollar.    "In our view, we should have a single person commenting (on  exchange rates). The single person clearly should be the  secretary of treasury," Rubin said.    The currency upheaval, which Clinton described as  "puzzling,"  prompted the monetary authorities of the major industrial  countries to launch a massive operation Friday to support the  dollar by direct intervention in currency markets.    In a statement that acknowledged the concerted dollar-buying  operation, estimated at 2-3 billion dollars, U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the turbulence in currency markets  has become a matter of "shared concern" among monetary  authorities in the G-7 and other developed countries.    Commenting on the dollar's fall during a trip to Missouri,  Clinton said, "this is a development that is puzzling a lot of  economists."    Stressing that the U.S. economy "is performing so well,"  Clinton said that "in a funny way the currency values are  running in the opposite direction of economic strength."    Rubin said he expects the G-7 leaders to discuss policy  coordination on both macro and microeconomic issues at the  Naples Summit but declined to say whether exchange-rate issues  will be on the agenda.    The Naples Summit will bring together government leaders  from  Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and  Russia.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been invited to join the  G-7 leaders as a "full participant" after the summit leaders  complete the economic part of their agenda and move on to  political issues, a senior U.S. official said.</p>

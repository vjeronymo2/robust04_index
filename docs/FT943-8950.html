			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Proposals drawn up for 'spot' market on gas prices The gas industry regulator Ofgas is taking further steps towards creating a US-style 'spot' market for setting daily prices when Britain's household supply business is opened to competition in 1996. Proposals for the system, which would operate on similar lines to the UK electricity industry's pool, have been drawn up by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, with the aim of ensuring balanced supplies when British Gas loses its monopoly and broadening competition among suppliers. Ofgas is keen to see the development of such a market and will issue a consultation paper on the proposals by the end of this month. 'We'd like to see the creation of a daily 'spot' market, but if it's to be successful it must be what people want. We can't impose it on the industry,' said Mr Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas. Morgan Stanley's proposal, which was formulated jointly with regional electricity companies Eastern Electricity and ManWeb, both of which have gas supply arms, would set up a daily commodity market for gas sales and purchases. Almost half the gas used in the US is traded on this daily spot basis following the deregulation of gas distribution more than 10 years ago. A natural gas futures contract also trades on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Independent gas companies already trade small amounts of gas with each other on the telephone, but once the household market is opened up, there will be a need for larger quantities to change hands in a more formal marketplace. By the end of this month, Ofgas will ask gas companies to give their views on Morgan Stanley's proposal and how this would operate with British Gas's suggestions on how to balance supply and demand on a daily basis. The need for a daily spot market arises from the necessity to iron out fluctuations in the amount of gas in the national pipelines network when British Gas's monopoly over domestic supply is removed in April 1996. If an imbalance is created by rival suppliers putting too much or too little gas into the national network, households could find they are cut off. In the worst case, an explosion could be caused. Since it is difficult for suppliers to find out whether they are providing an adequate amount of gas to the system each day, British Gas has suggested it makes emergency purchases of gas and later charges those companies which were not balanced. Morgan Stanley's approach envisages a much wider market where all participants will be able to buy and sell gas at a centrally-cleared price. 'The advantage of this system is that it could provide a liquid market with a transparent pricing structure,' said Mr Higson. Spot gas futures, Page 7</p>

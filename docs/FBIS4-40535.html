			<p>BFN     [Text] The Inter-Tajik negotiations will be conducted in a  difficult situation due to a wave of terroristic acts which have  been conducted by the armed opposition in the Republic, believes  leader of the governmental delegation Shukurjon Zuhurov,  Tajikistan's Labor and Employment Minister.    In an interview with INTERFAX Thursday [16 June] he said  that  Dushanbe hopes for a favorable outcome of the next round of  negotiations with the opposition which was started on 18 June in  Teheran. Zuhurov said the governmental delegation intends to  discuss three packages of issues at the negotiations -- on  peaceful settlement of the political situation in the Republic,  complete return of refugees, and on the constitutional system  and consolidation of the state.    According to Zuhurov, the issues related to the return of  refugees are already at the stage "of active implementation" in  accordance with the agreements reached at the first round of the  negotiations on 5-19 April in Moscow. Zuhurov reported that as  many as 3,500 refugees from Afghanistan and about 10,000 people  from CIS countries have returned over this period of time. An  official commission to render aid and assistance to the forced  migrants and refugees has started its work in Moscow to help  them to return to their homeland. It consists both of  representatives of Dushanbe and the Tajik opposition.    The governmental delegation is due to fly to Tehran on 17  June.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> The industrial purity of Jill Giegerich's constructions is giving way to a  startlingly baroque sensibility. At first, you may long for the clean-cut  simplicity of the old pieces, so tactile and elegant in such unlikely materials  as rubber, asphalt emulsion and cork. But with one overwrought exception, the  recent work of this major young Los Angeles artist has acquired an intelligent  complexity that has as much to do with an obsession with unlikely symbols as  with the masterful -- and now often aggressively three-dimensional -- use of  homely materials.  </P> <P> The brain of Russian revolutionary V.I. Lenin -- of all things -- has been on  Giegerich's mind lately. In a series of 24 drawings, collectively called  "Lenin's Brain," she plays with a broad vocabulary of images that reappear in  her untitled full-scale pieces. The sculptural head wedged into a shelf-like  construction, the cerebellum-like clotted mass, the stylized clouds of smoke,  the floating numerals, the rope-bound column and the grand apotheosis of  airborne forms all add an inscrutable mythic element to Giegerich's basic  vocabulary of Constructivist shapes.  </P> <P> In the three-dimensional pieces, she continues to orchestrate flat and  three-dimensional materials into rich formal arrangements, dwelling on the  glassy, Turkish-slipper outlines of a squat bottle or the stabbing lines of  double pick-ax shapes or the tactile rightness of wafer-thin flying cork discs.  Xerox blowups that reduce images to atomized black marks resembling wood-grain  or snakeskin are other persistent features of these works.  </P> <P> But the plywood surfaces also hold real vases with peeling paint, burnt  industrial-sized spools of thread and -- in one immense and overly turgid  end-of-civilization extravaganza -- dripping lighted candelabra, burned wreaths  and tumbling architectural elements. Absurdly grandiose even as an ironic  gesture, this piece is just about the only dubious element in a dazzlingly  fecund body of work. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to April  22.)

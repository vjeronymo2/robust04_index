			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Folly in a privatised railway Sir, Charles Batchelor's article 'Obstacles on the mainline' (March 7) on BR's privatisation is timely in illuminating the intrinsic difficulties associated with this nonsensical policy. It is difficult to see how an adequately capitalised railway can emerge from the application of the framework laid down in the Railways Act 1993 without changes which will be massively detrimental to the travelling public. Recent reports in your newspaper have indicated that annual rates of return on their equity investments of up to 20 per cent are sought by capital markets in the UK. These are significantly above the low rates of return which those profitable parts of the rail business generate now (in 1992 InterCity was calculated as making a return of only 1 per cent on its capital assets). BR operates one of the leanest railways in Europe and scope for internal efficiency savings is small. Returns on capital investment will therefore likely be increased by cutting services, closing lines and increasing fares leading to big falls in usage. The same has occurred with bus deregulation and privatisation since 1985, where ministers have acknowledged the follies of the policy by backtracking on their manifesto commitment to deregulate bus provision in London. It is hoped BR privatisation will be similarly reconsidered before irreparable damage is inflicted on the national railways. Owen Simon, 106 Elborough Street, London SW18 5DL</p>

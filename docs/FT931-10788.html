			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Tory party sheds staff to curb debt A SHAKE-UP of Conservative organisation including 61 job losses was announced yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. The losses will include 42 compulsory redundancies. The move comes as the party's debts approach Pounds 20m and after widespread internal criticism of its management. Sir Norman's action followed a rapid increase in spending by the party in the run-up to last year's general election. Conservative MPs, constituencies and staff had complained of weak financial control, no clear lines of authority, a Byzantine management structure, and poor co-ordination and communications. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'We are rationalising, as are many companies around the country.' The deficit is expected to reach Pounds 19m this year. Spending last year was Pounds 28m compared with an income of Pounds 22m. Recent refurbishment of Conservative Central Office cost about Pounds 4m. Sir Norman, who described the package as 'the most comprehensive set of reforms for the last 60 years', said he wanted to eliminate the deficit by 1996 and to cut expenditure to Pounds 7m this year. Sir Norman appeared yesterday to rule himself out as a possible replacement for Mr Norman Lamont, as chancellor. He said he wanted to see through reforms at Conservative Central Office. About half the job losses will be at Central Office in London and the rest in area offices. Some staff will leave voluntarily or on early retirement. By the end of this year the number of employees will have fallen to 228 from more than 350 at the time of the general election. Separately, a 'board of treasurers' will launch an appeal to tackle the deficit. Ten areas offices will be reduced to six. However, Sir Norman has not responded to calls from the 'Charter Group' within the party which wants more elected posts. He promised to release more financial information but had no specific proposals at this stage. The main management reform is the setting up of a board of management, chaired by Sir Norman, and bringing together representatives from the parliamentary party, the European parliamentary party, local government and the National Union - which represents the constituency associations. Sir Norman emphasised how the European party would be drawn closer into the central organisation. Sir Norman wants a greater proportion of funds to come from constituency associations, which account for only about 10 per cent of income. They will have to produce annual reports, but will remain largely autonomous of Central Office.</p>

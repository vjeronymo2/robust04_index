			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (43): An honourable profession - In the age of the washing machine India's dhobis carry on scrubbing Tillan Prasad, who is 72, has been washing clothes with his hands for 61 years. Like thousands of other washermen throughout India, he beats the dirt out of the laundry by smashing it against stone. His grandfather was a washerman and his father and two of his four sons have joined him in his trade. Like others born into the traditional caste of dhobis (washermen), Mr Prasad never thought of doing anything else. He says: 'Dhobis have lots of work. I've never been short of money.' Mr Prasad lives with about 30 other dhobis and their families in a collection of huts in central Delhi. All around are piles of washing brought from middle-class homes. Each load is carefully kept separate from others to make sure the laundry does not get mixed up. The dhobis' work looks as if it has not changed in hundreds of years. Yet, modernisation is slowly creeping into Mr Prasad's life. New-fangled soaps, washing powders, irons and even washing machines are steadily changing the lives of India's dhobis. For some dhobis, India's economic modernisation has brought a loss of business as their customers have bought washing machines and dispensed with the dhobis' services. Last year alone, 500,000 washing machines were sold in India. But most washermen have easily found other clients as the growth which has made some families rich enough to buy a washing machine has enabled others to afford a dhobi for the first time. Also, says Mr Prasad, no washing machine is as good as a dhobi. He waves his wiry brown arms in the air saying: 'This is how a washing machine washes. It cannot rub the clothes very hard.' Then he presses his calloused hands together and says: 'This is how we rub. Very hard.' Mr Prasad says that his customers too have washing machines. But they use them only for delicate clothes. A washing machine is no good for laundering sheets, curtains and dhurries. Besides, he says, some people buy washing machines only for show. Mr Prasad says that over the decades his work has become easier. When he started he could use only poorly-made laundry soap. Today, he has a choice of international-brand powders. 'I use Tide and Surf,' he says. He is also one of the few dhobis among his friends to own an electric iron. Most of the others still use irons heated from the inside by hot coals. His son Vijay Prasad says he believes he has a good future in the laundry business. Even if many more customers have washing machines, they will still need dhobis for the heavy work. Also, factories, hotels and restaurants are growing throughout Delhi and use dhobis for their laundry. Vijay Prasad says he and his friends would take on more work if only they had space to hang out the washing. 'There is not enough room here for big sheets.' Tillan Prasad and his two dhobi sons live together with their wives and the sons' children. Their hut has only two rooms, but it has electric lights, fan and a television, which is switched on whether someone is watching it or not. Tillan Prasad is very proud of it, not least because it was a present from a client - Chandra Shekhar, a former prime minister.</p>

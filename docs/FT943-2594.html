			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Hurd takes trade plea to Tokyo Britain will today urge Japan not to cut it, or any other nation, out of a trade deal between Tokyo and the US. The UK's concern, shared by other European Union member states, will be voiced by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in meetings with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime minister, and with the ministers responsible for trade, finance and foreign affairs. Mr Hurd's three-day visit, ending tonight, is the latest annual high-level political consultation between Japan and the UK. It is his first personal contact with the new three-party coalition government, which took power in June. Trade matters, including the role of the future World Trade Organisation, are at the top of his agenda. But Mr Hurd is also aiming to range widely over foreign policy issues important to both countries. He is expected to register gratitude for Japan's discreet diplomatic advice to China to try to be calm in the bumpy lead-up to the transfer of power in Hong Kong. Japan's bid for membership of the United Nations security council, now supported by a previously wary Britain, and North Korea's nuclear ambitions may also crop up. On trade, Mr Hurd is expected to remind his hosts of British support for Japan's opposition to US demands for numerically targeted increases in its share of Japan's domestic market. Tokyo and Washington are struggling, with little success, to reach a framework trade and economic accord before the September 30 deadline after which the US has threatened to start sanctions proceedings. At the same time, Mr Hurd will voice UK concern that Japan and the US will be tempted to strike a purely private deal, a serious worry to exporters of car components. Overall British exports to Japan rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn in the first half of this year. There are long-standing bilateral trade disputes, on which Mr Hurd is expected to remind Japan that Britain is dissatisfied with the small progress made in recent years. These include tax on imported whisky, still much higher than Japanese spirits, the continued ban on foreign law firms hiring Japanese partners, and barriers to competition in insurance and other financial services.</p>

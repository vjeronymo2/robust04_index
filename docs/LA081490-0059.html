			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> BOARD TO CONSIDER TEACHER DELEGATE  </P> <P> The Moorpark Unified School District board will consider today whether to allow  a teacher representative to the board during all discussions except those  involving employee relations.  </P> <P> District officials said no school board in Ventura County has a teacher  representative.  </P> <P> Board member Tom Baldwin said the idea was suggested two years ago during an  unsuccessful recall campaign against him and three others. Charges were made  that the board was unresponsive to the community and teachers.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel the time was right to suggest a teacher representative because  it would have been too self-serving," Baldwin said. "But I filed the idea away  and felt this was the time since we now have a two-year contract with the  teachers union."  </P> <P> Larry McDermott, president of the Moorpark Educators Assn., said he backs the  idea.

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Constitutional challenge to Rostenkowski charges Lawyers acting for Mr Dan Rostenkowski are seeking to mount a constitutional challenge to corruption charges against the Democratic congressman, writes Ken Warn from Washington. Mr Rostenkowski faces a 17-count corruption indictment covering his activities over the past 20 years. The charges include putting 'ghost' employees on his payroll, converting federal money for personal and family use, and trading stamps for cash at the House post office. In a hearing this week to review progress on the case, Mr Rostenkowski's lawyers argued the alleged offences concerned House rules and only Congress has jurisdiction over its own legislation. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson gave the defence until August 5 to file its challenges. She said she was 'a bit disheartened' by the slow start in the case and would brook no further delay. Mr Rostenkowski, formerly a key ally of President Bill Clinton in the battle over healthcare reform, was forced to stand down as chairman of the powerful House ways and means committee as a result of the corruption charges.</p>

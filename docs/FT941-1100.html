			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Boost for building societies from fuel payment windfall Windfall funds received by some regional electricity companies from customers seeking to avoid value added tax are to be deposited in building societies. The utilities hope the move will deflect criticism that mortgage rates could be driven up as householders draw heavily from their societies to pay power bills in advance. Bills paid before next Thursday will not be liable to VAT. Seeboard, based in Hove, which has received Pounds 51m in the last few days, said yesterday it was aware of a heavy outflow from the societies as householders sought to beat the VAT deadline. Southern Electric, which has taken in Pounds 48m from customers, will also redeposit a portion of these funds, as will Midlands Electricity, according to Mr Peter Chapman, its finance director. The Building Societies Association has reported heavy withdrawals from members this month. It attributed this largely to householders trying to avoid VAT. From April 1 home fuel bills will be subject to 8 per cent VAT. Next year, the rate will be 17.5 per cent. By last night, householders had paid in more than Pounds 400m, depriving the Treasury of about Pounds 40m in tax revenues. But the money is still flowing in, and most electricity companies said they would accept last-minute payments, provided they were made at their shops and offices. However, it emerged yesterday that British Gas passed over an opportunity to save its 18.5m domestic customers part of the new tax. Earlier this year Customs and Excise allowed British Gas to assume, when next billing its customers, that they used 2.5 units of gas each day before April 1 for every one after that date, reflecting the fact that the earlier part of the billing period was colder. But British Gas will count all days the same. The Gas Consumers Council estimated this would cost customers Pounds 23m in extra tax in the two-year transition to full VAT, and accused the company of 'meanly taking the easy way out'. British Gas confirmed that Customs had allowed the more generous weighting, but said it had come too late to be included in its preparations for the changeover to VAT. The GCC advised householders to read their meters on March 31 to ensure that VAT would not be charged on gas used before then. London stocks, Page 15 Briefcase, Weekend, Page X</p>

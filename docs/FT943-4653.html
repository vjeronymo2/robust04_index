			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / French heavyweights beat the bell: Right-wing rivals for presidential nomination are locked in undeclared battle Civil wars are often nastier than other conflicts - and the battle now joined between Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac to be the governing RPR Gaullist party's nominee for president next year promises to be no exception. The contest looks like providing the main political excitement of 1995. It also looks set to cover so much ground, as both men try to outdo each other in trying to be seen to do their utmost to create jobs, as to leave little terrain free for other candidacies. Like, for instance, a possible Socialist run at the Elysee by Mr Jacques Delors. Neither Mr Balladur nor Mr Chirac has yet formally thrown down the gauntlet in public. Both know the French voters want them to stay their hand. Two-thirds say in opinion polls they do not want the campaign to start before January - less than four months before the first round of voting on April 23 (to be followed by the final round on May 7). None of France's political parties has US-style primaries to select presidential candidates, despite repeated suggestions by the interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, that the governing parties of the RPR and centre-right UDF federation, adopt such a system for 1995. What France does have, in excess, is opinion polls. These put Mr Balladur way ahead of Mr Chirac. A recent Ifop survey, for example, gives the prime minister 60 per cent against 30 per cent for Mr Chirac in a two-man contest for the Elysee. No wonder therefore that Mr Balladur feels he is sitting pretty. The periodic indisposition of President Francois Mitterrand, suffering from prostate cancer, has given him a 'vice-presidential' aura and far more of a headline-catching role in governing the country than normally falls to a French premier. At the same time, the rumours surrounding Mr Mitterrand's health, which shook the markets a bit yesterday, mean that no one can rule out an earlier presidential election. In these circumstances, it is no surprise that Mr Chirac is so nervy. He himself is determined to try not to jump the gun. At a congress of young Gaullists cheering 'Chi-rac President' last weekend, he appealed for loyalty from his erstwhile protege, and declared himself a candidate 'in the great national debate' on the presidency, but not actually for the presidency itself. But his supporters went ahead and fired the starting gun anyway. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who is the RPR's secretary general, openly put himself in the Chirac camp. Each camp is now going on to a war footing, led by talented young politicians - Mr Juppe in the Chirac corner, and Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister and government spokesman, in the Balladur corner - who are staking their careers on the outcome. There is no question that Mr Chirac has a lock hold on the RPR party machine, which he built and has run for the past 20 years. He inspires great affection among close supporters, and there is a real possibility of the party splitting if Mr Balladur eventually prevails. The bitterness, typical of every civil war, arises out of the fact that Mr Balladur now turns a deaf ear to Mr Chirac's appeals for loyalty. Mr Balladur's supporters flatly deny any deal in 1993 whereby Mr Chirac let Mr Balladur get the prime ministership in return for giving the RPR leader a free run at the presidency. 'Balladur got the Matignon (the prime minister's office), because no one else wanted it,' says a key Balladur strategist. Mr Chirac had occupied the Matignon twice previously, and even if he had wanted it a third time he would probably not have been nominated by President Mitterrand. He says there is no loyalty in the track record of Mr Chirac, who led an intra-Gaullist revolt against former prime minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas in 1974 that allowed Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing to win the presidency in that year. He then showed his gratitude for being made prime minister by Mr Giscard d'Estaing by running against the latter in 1981. Mr Balladur may lack the party machine, but an increasing number of individual RPR deputies are attending presidential strategy sessions at the Matignon every Friday. In addition, he can count on most of the UDF, who prefer him to their nominal leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing. The long-term result of a Balladur presidency could be the fusion of most of the RPR and UDF into a united French conservative party. Even the present vacuum in the Socialist party plays in Mr Balladur's favour. 'Whether Jacques Delors decides in the end to run or not does not matter,' says a Balladur supporter. 'What is important is the prospect that Delors might run,' because the polls show the retiring Commission president might run Mr Chirac very close, but would be clearly outdistanced by Mr Balladur. There is, however, a chance that Mr Balladur could find himself tripped up by the economy in which he specialised as Mr Chirac's finance minister in 1986-88. For the moment, the prime minister dismisses the possibility that the recovery in the economy - yesterday reported to have grown by 1 per cent in the second quarter alone - could be choked off by recent rises in long-term interest rates or by his austere budget plans for 1995. With rises of 4 per cent in revenue and less than 2 per cent in spending, he plans a budget deficit of FFr275bn (Pounds 33.5bn) next year, down from this year's FFr300bn level. This will please the international markets. But there is a danger point, an adviser acknowledges. This could come after Germany 'rediscovers a certain tranquillity' with the probable re-election of Chancellor Helmut Kohl next month, and 'just as we go into the turmoil of our presidential election'.</p>

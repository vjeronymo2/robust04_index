			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Dutch merger faces probe THE European Commission has decided to open an in-depth investigation into the proposed merger between the Netherlands' three biggest paper and packaging companies, focusing specifically on their dominance of the Benelux print press market, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The merger of KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG would create Europe's second-largest paper and packaging group, after Stora of Sweden. Two of the prospective partners are agents for two rival German producers of printing presses - Buhrmann for Heidelberg, and VRG for MAN-Roland. Together, they account for between 60 and 70 per cent of the Benelux market.</p>

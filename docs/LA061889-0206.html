			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> "Objets Vend'art," currently in the "A Forest of Signs" exhibit at the Museum  of Contemporary Art, is the work of artist Ona Lindquist. Because of erroneous  information given by the museum, it was incorrectly attributed to Jeff Koons in  William Wilson's May 7 review.  </P></p>

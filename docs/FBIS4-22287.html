			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Shchipanov: "The Russian-Japanese </F> Distinctive Mark"]    [Text] It is formed rather simply: If the Japanese minister  of foreign affairs hurries to Moscow, the Russian president for  sure will leave the capital. At first, having encountered the  natural materialization of such a distinctive (moreover,  correct) mark, the Japanese tried somehow to publicly express  their dissatisfaction. Having arrived in Moscow 2 years ago to  participate in an international conference on a Mideast  settlement, Watanabe was unspeakably disappointed by the sad  circumstance that, regardless of the importance of  Russo-Japanese relations, B. Yeltsin will not be able to receive  him. Today, already the successor of Watanabe, Tsutomu Hata,  having found out that his long-ago planned visit coincided with  the improvised departure of the president of Russia for Sochi,  did not begin to display rude disapproval, although the Japanese  side in mild form did reserve strictly surprise about such an  unfortunate coincidence.    Moreover, evidently, there is no such anti-Japanese  intention  in the actions of our president. Now the administration is  encountering much more serious problems than the fate of four  points on the map--the Kurile Islands. And, therefore, the visit  of a Japanese looks sooner like a tribute to general diplomatic  routine: It was simply impossible for any "territorial  break-throughs" to occur in the talks. The situation of the  present patriotic rise is such that even to publicly hint at the  return of the islands to Japan in the near historical future is  dangerous. Even on Smolenskaya Ploshchad servility before the  West is not in favor now. Even the transparent Japanese hints at  the direct link between the territorial question and the  extension of massive economic assistance to Russia do not  produce the former impression on the Kremlin.    But since no Japanese spy was discovered in Moscow in recent  weeks, the talks proceeded calmly. Both Kozyrev and Hata gently  remained in their positions, not skimping on general diplomatic  assurances of the highest respect for one another.    Moreover, Russia and Japan also have other points of mutual  interests, in particular, the Japanese are ready to take upon  themselves the burden of permanent members of the UN Security  Council, and Russians would prefer to have a membership card of  the club of the greatest industrial powers that is now called  the "Great Seven." The Japanese have thus far not expressed  special enthusiasm in regard to the transformation of the  "Seven" into the "Eight." Even in the purely political sphere.  But, one must suppose, bargaining is entirely appropriate here.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has reaffirmed Moscow's  position saying that Kiev and Simferopol must refrain from the  use of force to settle their differences -- in line with CSCE  principles. His statement came during talks in Moscow on  Tuesday [24 May] with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd who raised the issue.    Other issues discussed include European security and  Russia's  cooperation with the West including the NATO-sponsored  Partnership for Peace program. Yeltsin said that both Russia  and NATO wanted to cooperate with each other, but that this  cooperation must account for Russia's uniqueness as a great  power.    He is hopeful for a breakthrough in Moscow's talks with the  European Union and Russia's entry into the world trade  organization, GATT.    Bilateral relations were also discussed by the two men.    The Secretary handed Yeltsin a message from Queen Elizabeth  II saying she accepted an earlier invitation to visit Russia in  autumn, it is to be the first such visit to Russia by a British  monarch.    On Tuesday morning, Viktor Chernomyrdin and British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd discussed relations between Russia and  Ukraine in light of the situation in Crimea.    Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who took  part in the talks, told reporters that Chernomyrdin had  expressed the conviction that there were no insoluble problems  in Russian-Ukrainian relations. He also said that the two  states could reach agreement on the basis of the accord on the  division of the Black Sea Fleet, signed by Boris Yeltsin and  Leonid Kravchuk last March.    Chernomyrdin also confirmed that Crimea was part of Ukraine  and that Russia respected Ukraine's territorial integrity.    To quote Churkin, Chernomyrdin assured Hurd that no force  would be used in tackling political problems.    "Confrontation with Ukraine is unthinkable," said  Chernomyrdin. "All problems that have arisen or will arise will  be tackled in the spirit of cooperation," he added.    Russia insists only on political settlement between Kiev and  Simferopol, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information  and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated at a briefing in  Moscow Tuesday.    He confirmed that the position of Russia towards the  sovereign Republic of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine  remained the same and was well known to the Ukrainian  leadership. He stressed that it was necessary to observe  territorial integrity and inviolability of the existing borders.  Karasin said it was also very important to respect the  sovereign will of nations. He emphasized that the parties must  refrain from the use of force.    He said Russia was concerned over tension in bilateral  relations which might emerge due to Crimea. He emphasized that  the discord between Kiev and Simferopol was a domestic Ukrainian  affair. "However, certain Ukrainian politicians are trying to  lay all responsibility at the door of `some external forces'  meaning Russia," Karasin pointed out.    The situation in Crimea once again proves that the  key-issues  of Russian-Ukrainian relations must be solved urgently, he said.    Karasin added that the current Russian-Ukrainian talks in  Moscow were focusing on these issues rather than on Crimea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The relations between  Japan and the United States have not yet become matured as  evidenced by last week's failure to reach a bilateral trade  agreement, the Japanese ambassador to Washington said Tuesday  [15 February].    Takakazu Kuriyama told a press conference that mutual  distrust over setting objective criteria to measure progress in  opening Japan's markets led to the collapse of the Japan-U.S.  trade talks last Friday in Washington.    "As long as we could not reach an agreement due to a lack of  trust, it cannot be said that (the relationship) has become one  of adults," Kuriyama said.    Kuriyama said Japan needs to make its markets more open and  transparent to raise the level of trust in trade "to the same as  that of politics and securities."    Asked what course the two nations are likely to take on the  trade problems, he said "both sides should make efforts to sit  down at the negotiating table seriously."    Kuriyama also said it is "not appropriate" for the U.S. to  think of imposing sanctions against Japan only because Japan  does not make a compromise.    The two nations have remained at loggerheads over the  interpretation of the application of "objective criteria."    Washington says such criteria are necessary to measure how  much Japan's markets will be actually opened to U.S. products.    Japan, whose huge trade surplus has long frustrated U.S.  Governments, rejects setting numerical targets, on the grounds  that it would go against the principle of free trade and result  in managed trade.    Although the trade talks broke down without agreement on the  criteria, some Japanese media praised Japan's government's  stance of rejecting the U.S. demand, saying the two nations'  relations had "matured" because Japan could finally say "no."    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said at a press  conference after the talks with President Bill Clinton that "I  believe and hope that (the U.S.) will not resort to unilateral  actions that would contravene GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade) rules."    U.S. officials have warned, however, of retaliation against  Japan, such as reviving the "Super 301" provision, before the  Group of Seven industrial countries convenes its annual summit  in Naples in early July.</p>

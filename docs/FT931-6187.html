			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Private sector may run juvenile centres NEW SECURE training centres for offenders aged 12 to 15 may be run by the private sector or voluntary organisations under proposals announced by the government yesterday. The two sectors will be invited to bid along with the public sector to operate the centres which Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said would be 'different from anything that has been offered before'. Yesterday's announcement - part of a government response to mounting public concern about juvenile crime - extends the potential role of the private sector in the criminal justice system. Two prisons are already privately managed, and competitive bids to run a third are being prepared. The government will act as purchaser of services from the new centres. About six - providing accommodation for a total of 250-300 young people - are likely to be developed initially. The centres, for a minority of persistent re-offenders, will be designed to offer constructive training and education that tackles the causes of a young person's behaviour. Young people will be locked up if necessary to prevent them absconding. Courts would be able to impose secure training orders on 12-15-year-olds convicted of three imprisonable offences who had failed to comply with community supervision. Organisations working with young offenders accused the government of repeating past mistakes with its proposals. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said secure institutions for young people increased the chances of re-offending. Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'The graduates from Mr Clarke's mini-prisons will be filling the adult jails for years to come.' Addressing a crowded Commons, Mr Clarke acknowledged the two main parties were moving closer together on crime but one big difference was the government had some 'solid proposals'. 'Our proposals are far in advance of anything the other side has to hand,' he said. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, attacked the lack of coherence in the government's proposals and the likely delay in their implementation. 'It is now people require action against the tide of rising crime,' he said.</p>

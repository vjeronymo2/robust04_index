			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada at the Presidente Hotel in San </F> Salvador; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast -- live relay]    [Text] We are at the Presidente Hotel where the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] vote counting center is located. There  was apparently little activity this morning. Nevertheless,  President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Ruben Zamora, the  leftist coalition candidate, held a meeting which was attended  by TSE magistrates. They also received a delegation led by U.S.  Ambassador Alan Flanigan, Mrs. Ann Patterson of the Latin  American division of the State Department, and AID officials in  the country, with whom they exchanged viewpoints on El  Salvador's future, the continuation of economic aid, and other  aspects of our country's economic and political situation. At  the end of this morning's meeting, Dr. Ruben Zamora spoke to the  media about some of the points discussed during the more than  two-hour-long meeting here at the Presidente Hotel. Here is an  excerpt of his remarks:    [Begin recording] [Zamora] The first step was this  conversation we just had. It was a general exploration in which  we perhaps insisted more about the issue of electoral reform.  This is one of the immediate issues that must be addressed in  the next few months. We also discussed other points such as the  decentralization of the government, the single registry of  citizens, and so forth. I would say that in the next few days  we will be announcing the agenda and how this will be done.    [Unidentified reporter] How much is Calderon Sol willing to  work on this?    [Zamora] He expressed willingness to work and he agreed with  me that in order for the country to move forward, the government  and the opposition must agree on such points and work together.    [Reporter] Do you think [words indistinct] and that the  opposition, which you make up, is being taken into account?    [Zamora] I think that both for the government and the  opposition, these are two elements that are absolutely  essential. Today's meeting was due to an initiative taken  yesterday. When we talked with Dr. Calderon Sol yesterday he  said: Why don't we meet a while? I said fine. That is what we  did this morning. We agreed that we will remain in touch to  deal with this problem. I think this is part of democracy.  There will be a government; there must always be a government,  but there must also be an opposition. When there is a  government without opposition, there tends to be a dictatorship.  A characteristic of democracy is the existence of a government  and opposition.    [Reporter] Any commitments [words indistinct]?    [Zamora] This was an initial conversation. The commitment  was that we have to structure this agenda of concerted efforts.  Some ideas were expressed about how we can do this. But since  we have not agreed on this yet, we are going to see how things  develop. [end recording]    Jorge Shafik Handal, general coordinator of the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], and other members of the  leftist coalition formed by the MNR [National Revolutionary  Movement], the Democratic Convergence, and the FMLN, were also  present at the meeting. Dr. Armando Calderon Sol remains on the  second floor of the hotel, where he is meeting with TSE members  to complete some minor details about the documents for his  inauguration.</p>

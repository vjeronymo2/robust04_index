			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: The African Company presents Richard III - Theatre in Washington One of the three theatres of Washington's adventurous Arena Stage complex, the fan-shaped, 500-seat Kreeger is currently drawing capacity audiences with a new play by Carlyle Brown entitled The African Company Presents Richard III. This is a lively and moving drama based on a historical situation: the existence in New York, around 1821, of a troupe of black players led by a retired steward named William Henry Brown. First in a tea garden, behind Brown's house, and then in a larger site, this company played before large, chiefly black audiences and one of the staples of the African Company's repertory was Shakespeare. But in the autumn of 1821, the eminent English tragedion Junius Brutus Booth paid a visit to the prestigious 'white' Park Theatre, - and both houses simultaneously announced new productions of Richard III, in direct if somewhat unequal competition. The Park was operated by the canny, unscrupulous impresario Stephen Price (known to actors, because of his avarice, as 'Half Price'). Determined to destroy his black rivals, the manager used his political influence to have their theatre closed and their company arrested. The company, however, survived this setback and, a few years later, produced a new play called The Drama of King Shotaway based on the story of the black Carib chieftain Chatoyer, killed in an insurrection. In reconstructing these events Carlyle Brown first did considerable scholarship; but, inevitably, since black history in America is full of tantalising gaps, he rightly made effective use of his own poetic imagination. The actors of the African Company - waiters or domestics by day  -had their private stories, which Brown reinvents with insight and wit. But their stories fit also into the larger history of the US and of racial conflict there. The chief black actor of the 19th century company was a waiter named James Hewlett (movingly played by Leon Addison Brown), whom the playwright makes a mercurial, moody, mordant victim. In an early scene, Hewlett says 'Coloured people act all the time.' Their submission, their obedience, the persona they offer their white masters is all a performance. Later, the same Hewlett does an ironic imitation of the white man's cliche black man, dancing and singing with searing pain. Carlyle Brown is fortunate in his cast and in his director, Tazewell Thompson, who has carefully gauged the behaviour of the characters according to whether they are alone, among themselves, or in a racial confrontation. In addition to Leon Addison Brown, the young actor Jonathan Earl Peck provides a full length, three-dimensional portrait of the black impresario William Henry Brown; mettlesome, resourceful, human. And, dominating the stage at his every appearance, Wendell Wright offers a generous, irresistible Papa Shakespeare, a Falstaffian figure still close to his African roots, a man wise in ancient lore and sharp in his witty, compassionate guile. It is a part that could easily have lapsed into the quaint, into clownerie. Instead, it has an impressive nobility. Gail Grate is totally convincing, both as the alert maidservant Ann and, in her other costume, as Richard III's queen. David Marks is a sinister yet entertaining Constable-Man (a clever touch of the director to give him an Irish accent, indicating the complex ethnic mixture of 19th century New York). A simple wooden construction by Douglas Stein suggests a port warehouse or the backstage of a theatre, with the hint of a garden beyond; Paul Tazewell's costumes - whether for Carlyle Brown's characters or for Shakespeare's - are convincing: simple, deliberately uncolourful streetclothes and makeshift velvet, beplumed regality. The lighting devised by Allen Lee Hughes is subtle and, particularly in the final, gaol scene, poetic. Concurrently with The African Company, in its smaller theatre in the round, Arena Stage is presenting a new production (and new translation) of Pirandello's Cosi e (se vi pare), now called It's the Truth (If you think it is) staged by the Romanian Livlu Ciulei. It is a confidant, competent staging, though the acting is uneven. Following the Italian dramatist's clues, Ciulei sees all the characters except the three principals as grotesques, a chorus representing public opinion, received ideas, and he has some delightful accomplices in Halo Wines (as Amalia) and Trazana Beverley (Signora Sirelli). Richard Bauer plays Pirandello's alter ego Lamberto Laudisi with the proper cynicism end detachment, but there is a sameness in his drawling delivery that becomes finally tiresome. In the crucial 'mad' roles, Tana Hicken (Signora Frola) and Henry Strozier (her son-in-law Ponza) strike just the right note of reasoning desperation. In the small role of the butler, Teagle F Bougere invents a brief comic turn that affords on amusing variation on Pirandello's theme of appearances versus subjectivity.</p>

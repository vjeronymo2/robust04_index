			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Railtrack warns of cut in subsidies Private operators running trains will be forced to make big efficiency gains as subsidies are reduced, a director of Railtrack, the state-owned company set up to take over responsibility for British Rail's track and signalling, will warn today. Although the government has promised to increase subsidies in line with higher track charges, Sir Christopher Foster, a Railtrack director, says the operators' ability to make efficiency gains will reduce the need for big rail subsidies. In a speech to be delivered today to the University of Leeds, Sir Christopher will say that a commitment by the government to provide a subsidy to sustain rail services 'is not the same as saying that the current level of real subsidy should be maintained'. He believes that after the first year the government will reduce the Pounds 930m annual subsidy as the new train operators will be expected to make improvements to BR's 'old-established working practices'. Sir Christopher, who helped shape railway privatisation as a special adviser to the Department of Transport, says some of the potential entrants have put forward ideas on how to improve working practices. He believes railway timetables - which at present take BR up to 18 months to change - and scheduling of trains could be radically altered. He says this could save private operators significant amounts of money. He says that in the long term rolling stock companies, which are to be sold off separately, may find the government cutting the subsidy. Sir Christopher adds that it would not be in the taxpayers' interest if companies bidding for the rolling stock companies did not think that the government was planning to cut back demand through reduced subsidy. While the government's plan is to open up rail franchises to competition, Sir Christopher confirms that it is likely to be controlled in the short-term. Ministers are anxious to avoid the open competition triggered by bus privatisation, where fierce rivalry erupted on city-centre routes, clogging traffic and leading to a poorer service. Sir Christopher says that in the long term rail operators wanting to run trains on lucrative routes may have to pay the franchisee a fee towards the operation of unremunerative services. Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract to build the underground stations and tunnels for the Heathrow Express project, Paul Betts writes. The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and BR is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the centre of London. The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington Station in 16 minutes.</p>

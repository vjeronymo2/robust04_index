			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION;  </P> <P> 'BO BELIEVED' -- IN HIMSELF  </P> <P> On the afternoon of Friday, May 11, I met with Bo Kimble to discuss his role in  the delicate situation of awarding Hank Gathers' diploma, which would be done  posthumously. Bo, as usual, was calm and confident that everything would go  well.  </P> <P> Having settled his responsibilities and the arrangements for the award, talk  turned to the one-on-one contest, in which eight of the best college basketball  players who would turn pro compete. He had just been named one of the  competitors. Where did he think he might finish? His response was  matter-of-fact: He would be ready; he would do exactly what was necessary to  win. He would win. His response did not surprise me.  </P> <P> I first met Bo, along with his best friend Hank, about five years ago in my  office. Basketball Coach Paul Westhead had brought me to be interviewed as the  last stage of their possible admittance to Loyola Marymount University. They  were in their second semester at USC. Kimble and Gathers brought first-semester  transcripts with them and a list of the courses they were taking then, their  second semester. Both were somewhat confused, obviously hurting and a little  defensive. They had decided to transfer after their coach at USC was replaced.  </P> <P> Hank, as was his nature, was more evidently emotional and upset. Bo, however,  was very calm and deliberate, not overly talkative, but willing to answer any  and all questions. Yes, LMU was his first choice for a transfer. Yes, he wished  to earn a degree, expected to earn a degree. Yes, he definitely was interested  in a television and film career. He understood that there would be no more  physical-education credits. He needed philosophy, theology and basic courses  before he would be able to take communications classes. No problem. He was  confident that he could take and pass the courses necessary to receive a  diploma. He never doubted that he would graduate. He believed.  </P> <P> We accepted him on the basis of his USC work and received the high-school  transcript later. There wasn't a great deal in his high school records that  would predict success for him in college. That element was not evident in  anything we had on paper, but was very evident in the interview. He had  tremendous confidence. He was spectacularly motivated in the sense that he  believed he could accomplish whatever he wished. And, more important, he was  willing to do what was necessary to achieve his goals.  </P> <P> Earning his degree, overcoming a knee injury, winning the one-on-one, dealing  with the death of his best friend and bringing together a team after the  tragedy of Gathers' death are both testimony and tribute to his belief in his  own self-determination.  </P> <P> "Bo believed" is a significant element in the success story of Bo in the  classroom and on the court. A second element, namely the system -- that is, the  university -- must also come into play. First, the system has to function  properly, right from the beginning. Universities must develop ways to evaluate,  to judge this intangible of "believing." Universities now look at courses, at  grades, at SAT scores, at teachers' and counselors' recommendations.  </P> <P> High school athletic stars are brought to campuses, interviewed by coaches, by  faculty members, by learning-resource people and even occasionally by academic  vice presidents. But are we asking the right questions? Are we looking for the  right information? How are we evaluating the likelihood of success for this  young person? Does he wish to develop his talents and skills so that he can be  a contributing person to society, not just to a basketball player? Does he want  to read better, write better, communicate better? Is he interested in questions  and problems, not just his own, but others? Is searching for answers more  important than just being given answers?  </P> <P> These are not easy questions to ask, not easy questions for an 18-year-old high  school basketball star to answer. As a matter of fact, they are probably not  the easiest questions for any 18-year-old to answer. But these may be the  questions we need to address when we interview scholarship athletes. I am not  sure SAT scores tell us very much. The high school curriculum and grades offer  a view of the past, but if the past is an inner-city environment these things  may not tell us much about a possible future. What Bo proved is that believing  in himself may be the most important ingredient for success in a college  education. Universities need to understand and develop ways of evaluating this  belief in young athletes, not just belief in themselves as athletes, but also  as student athletes.  </P> <P> One additional thought on assessing this most difficult character trait or  attitude in a young athlete: If we are unable to determine its presence or  absence in the interview process, perhaps we need a full year to assess  students. Perhaps we need to ask these young people to come to college and go  to school, to learn, to prove to themselves and to others that they can and  want to learn. Often their backgrounds do not automatically qualify them to  believe that they can succeed. A year of learning, with minimal basketball,  might accomplish wonders.  </P> <P> In the case of Bo and Hank, they had one year in which they were not permitted  to compete, which helped create perspective and stability. Of all the selfish  and self-serving rules that the NCAA continues to promulgate, freshman  eligibility is at the top of the list. I will never understand why university  presidents have not stood up to the system and said that all freshmen come to  school first, play basketball or football second. Then, by the end of a true  freshman experience, a true college experience, the student athlete may well  believe that he can complete his education, earn a degree and contribute to  society in many, many ways other than sports.  </P> <P> If belief is there, the system can and will work. It worked for Bo and Hank. It  can work for others. Paul Westhead refers to his style of basketball coaching  as "run the system." Bo proved that you can "run the system" off the court,  too. Lots of people need to be committed to making the system work: coaches,  faculty, support people, family, friends. Just as in basketball, the system  will fail unless everyone is playing together and supporting one another. The  system should work for far, far more of our student athletes than it is doing,  whether at LMU or hundreds of other institutions of higher learning.  </P> <P> On May 12, 1990, we presented Bo Kimble with a Bachelor of Arts degree in  communications. We presented a degree to an educated young adult, a young man  who is able to think, to reflect, to understand and to communicate. He has  dealt with pain, in himself and in others. He has seen suffering, even death,  and moved forward. He has rallied his friends, faced his competitors, won and  lost, and moved on. Bo learned because Bo believed in himself. Bo ran the  system on and off the court. I do not know whether Bo will be a star in the  National Basketball Assn. What's more important, he is ready and able to lead a  useful, productive and rewarding life.  </P> <P> If the past is an inner-city environment, high school grades may not tell us  much about a person's college future.  </P></p>

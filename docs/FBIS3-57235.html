Recently new elements have been added to the conflict, which  actually dates back to earlier times: On Friday [14 January],  during a program on the local cable television Asket, General  Lebed stated that the leaflets that had been distributed on the  previous night announcing that a coup was being prepared had  been printed at the suggestion of Vladimir Shevtsov, the  security minister of the separatist government. Lebed also  accused Shevtsov of cabling a communique to Moscow warning about  the alleged coup, which was to have taken place on 15 January.    In addition, on the same day on which Lebed replied to those  allegations [on Asket television], the Dniester authorities  issued a press communique and organized a news conference on the  same issue.    Further events took place on Tuesday, 18 January, when the  Moscow daily IZVESTIYA published a statement by Lebed, who,  among other things, asserted: "Currently they are openly  looting in the Dniester Republic, and that is why no progress is  being achieved in the peace talks [with Moldova]" and that the  solution, in his opinion, consists of "the banishment of all  those loathsome figures (the current Dniester leaders --  editor's note), the organization of new elections, and the  ascent to power of credible personalities..." That is why the  general called upon the population living on the left bank of  the Dniester to disobey the authorities.    Recently the commander of the 14th Army held a meeting with  school headmasters and the chairmen of the trade unions in the  educational sector. Speaking in front of the plenum of that  meeting, Lebed acknowledged the children's right to study in  their mother tongue from textbooks printed in the Latin  alphabet. That upset Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, the leader of  a civic group, so much that he called Lebed "a spy for the  Republic of Moldova" and a "coauthor of the Romanization of  education in the Dniester republic."    Also on Tuesday [18 January] the 14th Army Command issued a  declaration warning the Tiraspol authorities that "decisive  retaliatory measures will be taken, including the use of arms,  if slander and attacks are issued against the personnel and the  military assets of the Army of the Russian Federation."    It seems that Moscow, in the person of General Lebed, is fed  up with the unaccomplished vanity of the self-styled republic's  leaders, and it also intends to react firmly. Obviously, all  such reaction will be in pursuit of Moscow's goals.    Anyway, a dual power structure has been instated in  Tiraspol,  and both parties possess sufficiently large and well equipped  military and paramilitary forces.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISUAL ARTS;  </P> <P> 2 SCULPTURES COMPLEMENT THEIR LOCATIONS  </P> <P> In a commendable move that counters the odious habit of installing "plop art"  in public places, two local arts institutions have commissioned works of  site-specific sculpture. Whether temporary, like the work by Mario Lara for  Escondido's Mathes Cultural Center, or permanent, like the George Trakas  installation at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, context plays a  central role in both the call for these works and their realization.  </P> <P> Reesey Shaw, curator at the Mathes Cultural Center, initiated the Escondido  project out of a need to keep art in the public eye during the months that the  center is closed for renovation. Late last year she contacted Lara, a local  artist trained in architecture, to conceive of a work that would attract  attention to the site.  </P> <P> "The building itself is understated and tends to get lost," Shaw said.  </P> <P> Despite the gallery's proximity to a public library, many people don't know  it's there, she said. By commissioning Lara to install a site-specific  sculpture there while the gallery is closed, Shaw hopes to remind them -- or  inform them anew -- that the building is a center for art. Lara's work,  "De-Terminis," is a formal response to the temporary closing of the gallery.  </P> <P> "The creative energy of the (center) was going to be displaced, so I wanted to  do a piece that showed energy in a state of flux," Lara said.  </P> <P> "De-Terminis" will sit on the roof of the cultural center, the site that Lara  and Shaw agreed would be the most visible from the large adjacent parking lot.  A wooden cone, fence and wall, all painted red, will evoke a basic  architectural skeleton, and will be pierced by segments of a pole, painted with  yellow and black stripes. The pole will interrupt the architectural structure  like a broken line, Lara said, symbolizing "a state of indeterminacy."  </P> <P> Lara and two assistants will be erecting the work this weekend at the site, and  the public is invited to observe the construction process. "De-Terminis" will  be officially unveiled and illuminated Feb. 17, at 5:30 p.m., near the library  entrance at 239 South Kalmia St.  </P> <P> The sculpture, co-sponsored by the Escondido Public Art Partnership Panel and  the Felicita Foundation for the Arts, will remain at the site until the  building renovation is complete, expected to be sometime in April or May. Its  removal then will correspond with the meaning of the work itself, Lara said,  for the displaced energy that "De-Terminis" represents will have been restored  to the cultural center.  </P> <P> While Lara's sculpture assesses its site in formal terms, Trakas' "Pacific  Union," at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, deflects attention away  from its own formal attributes to the surrounding landscape and view.  Officially dedicated last month, "Pacific Union" transforms the narrow tip of  the museum's garden, wedged between a loading dock and the adjacent streets  (Coast Boulevard and Cuvier Street), into an inviting area for exploration and  meditation. The work was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment  for the Arts, with support from the Arts Promotion Division of the Department  of External Affairs, Government of Canada.  </P> <P> Trakas, an internationally-known artist from Quebec who now lives in New York,  has been working in the arena of outdoor, site-specific sculpture since the  1970s, incorporating bridges, pathways and shelters into natural landscapes. In  "Pacific Union," these elements -- made of wood, stone and steel -- mediate  between visitors to the site and the expansive coastline beyond.  </P> <P> In addition to several new, narrow ramps, two newly excavated stairways dating  from the museum's prior life as a private home lead from the adjacent sidewalks  to the elevated site. Benches, platforms and a block of gray metal  bleacher-like seating facing the sea invite visitors to remain once they have  ascended to the grassy plateau.  </P> <P> Unlike traditional sculpture, which is self-contained and object-oriented,  Trakas' work is decentralized. It sprawls across the irregular site, presenting  itself and the spectacular vista beyond as environments to be experienced  gradually, from a variety of perspectives. From two of the platforms, for  instance, one sees the ocean over the tops of large slabs of granite the shapes  of which echo the waves' fluid rhythms. Small concrete shelters beneath these  stone slabs suggest hiding places for children or more intimate spaces for  private meditation.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, access from inside the museum to "Pacific Union" and another  garden artwork by Vito Acconci is awkward and not particularly encouraged. The  museum's pending expansion plans will remedy this problem, according to curator  Lynda Forsha, and allow a freer flow of traffic between the indoor and outdoor  art.  </P></p>

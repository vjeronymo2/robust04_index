The two ministers consider the Greek move to be  both politically reprehensible and in contravention of Community  law within the European Union. This was learned Monday [21  February] during an official visit to The Hague by the FYROM  minister.    The Netherlands is the first member state of the European  Union to receive a member of the FYROM Government on an official  visit. The FYROM is appreciative of the Dutch support it  received in connection with rescheduling its debt with the World  Bank.    During the meeting with Minister Kooijmans, Crvenkovski  emphasized that his government is prepared to resume  negotiations with Greece aimed at eliminating contentious  issues, such as the name and flag of the FYROM. [passage  omitted]    According to a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, Kooijmans  and Crvenkovski also exchanged views on the situation of the  Albanian minority in the FYROM, and on the guarantees of  equality for all inhabitants of the FYROM which are enshrined in  the [country's] constitution.    Crvenkovski thanked Kooijmans for his support for Skopje's  attempt to gain admission to the CSCE. Until now, the admission  of the FYROM has been blocked by both Greece and Albania.</p>

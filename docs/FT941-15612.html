			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Profile of John Magill Mr John Magill, author of the critical report on Westminster Council, is a low-key accountant who is highly regarded within the profession and has gained a reputation for local government work over many years, Andrew Jack writes. He is one of a small group of accountants who act as district auditors to Britain's local authorities. He is a senior partner with Touche Ross, the UK's sixth largest accountancy firm, which is responsible for a number of district audit contracts, and has been the firm's lead partner on work for the Audit Commission, which oversees the district auditors, since 1983. He was appointed auditor to Westminster City Council in 1986 and also holds the role for Buckinghamshire County Council, Luton Borough Council and St Albans District Council. He has not been afraid to make strong criticisms in the past. In a previous special report on Westminster he called the sale of three of the council's cemeteries to a Panamanian-registered company for 15p in 1987 'unlawful, unauthorised and to the detriment of rate-payers'. Mr Magill has been a partner with Touche Ross since 1975 and became national director of accounting and auditing in 1987. In this role he represented the firm in its ultimately successful appeal to the House of Lords after it was sued for alleged negligence in relation to its audit of a company acquired by Caparo Group.</p>

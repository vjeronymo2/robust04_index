			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE ECCENTRIC BUDDHIST VISION OF ITO JAKUCHU, GREENGROCER AND ARTIST  </P> <P> An exhibition of Japanese paintings that caused a stir last fall in New York  recently arrived at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "The Paintings of  Jakuchu," which features an astonishing range of works by one of 18th-Century  Japan's authentically great individualists, is certain to captivate aficionados  as well as visitors who just wander into the museum.  </P> <P> Jakuchu's colorfully painted scrolls depicting flora and fauna are so profusely  detailed and brilliantly designed that they defy imagining how any mere human  being could have created them. At the opposite extreme is his breathtakingly  minimal series of six ink-on-paper scrolls called "Lotus Pond." The quiet scene  melts away into a central space that appears to be empty but is actually filled  with the specter of death and winter.  </P> <P> Between these two poles of Jakuchu's sensibility are relatively crude paintings  of clay dolls, striking woodblock prints of bright birds on velvety black  backgrounds and -- seriously -- a funeral scene portraying the dead Buddha as a  radish surrounded by mourning vegetables.  </P> <P> There's a certain logic to "Vegetable Parinirvana," the improbable and  apparently irreverent death scene. Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) was the son of a  greengrocer and ran the family's wholesale business for 17 years before he  became a full-time artist at 40. He may have been more at home with the  mushrooms, persimmons, yams and cucumbers in his parody than with human  characters. An assiduous observer of nature, Jakuchu also raised chickens and  elevated them to lofty heights of grace and beauty in his paintings.  </P> <P> Environment may account for some of his subject matter, but there's no  explaining the innovative talent and brilliant eccentricity that has  distinguished Jakuchu in the annals of Japanese painting. A born artist, he was  ill-suited to business and eventually unloaded that burden on a younger  brother. Jakuchu had classical training in Japanese painting and drew  inspiration from Chinese painters, but he developed such an unusual style that  he stands out as an eccentric.  </P> <P> One wonders how he got away with it, but in fact he was highly regarded during  his life. Jakuchu had the good fortune to live in Kyoto during a peaceful time  when a spirit of experimentation and individuality was in vogue.  </P> <P> He initially gained fame for his masterpiece -- a series of 30 vividly painted  scrolls known as the "Colorful Realm of Living Beings." Painted from about 1757  to 1765, the scrolls are a pictorial encyclopedia of plants and animals  interpreted according to Jakuchu's vision of peace and prosperity. He presented  the scrolls in 1765 to Shokukuji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. They are part of the  Imperial Household Collection and are rarely put on public exhibition.  </P> <P> Examples currently on display in Los Angeles are panels called "Mandarin Ducks  in Snow," "Hydrangeas and Fowl," "Fish in a Lotus Pond," "Golden Pheasants in  Snow" and "Birds and Peonies." All are poetic marriages of flora and fauna, so  closely entwined that they seem to be of a piece. Striking in composition --  characterized by sweeping curves and rhythmic repetition -- the scrolls are  skillfully detailed down to the last detail of the last feather.  </P> <P> These color paintings represent one major component of Jakuchu's work. The  other is ink paintings that reveal the artist's devotion to Zen. Strictly  speaking, however, the ink paintings do not conform to Zen principles. Despite  their enormous energy and directness, they are more calculated, less  spontaneous in feeling than classical Zen works.  </P> <P> Jakuchu was a lay Zen priest, so his affinity to the philosophy's artistic  precepts are expected. But he was also such an individualist that he inevitably  came up with his own style. It is typified by such ink paintings as "Two  Roosters and a Hen" and "Pine, Plum and Crane," which contrast dramatic shapes  and patterns with open space.  </P> <P> About 45 works, on loan from Japanese collections, are on view on the lower  floor of the Ahmanson Building, but they are only the beginning of a  three-course Jakuchu banquet. Because of Japanese government regulations and  the fragility of the works, "The Paintings of Jakuchu" is being presented in  two parts. Part I continues through Jan. 14. Part II will be shown from Jan. 18  to Feb. 18. Each portion contains a full chronological range of the artist's  work, so that visitors who only see one part can grasp the whole of his oeuvre.  </P> <P> The third course of the banquet is an auxiliary exhibition (to Feb. 18) in the  Japanese Pavilion. "The Colorful Realm of Jakuchu and Jakuen" consists of works  by the master and his most prominent student, Jakuen, from American  collections. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Denver Art Museum  and four private collectors have loaned pieces that complement the County  Museum of Art's extensive Jakuchu collection.  </P></p>

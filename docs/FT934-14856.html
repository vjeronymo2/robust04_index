			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Woolworth takes Dollars 480m charge to cover shake-up WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, yesterday announced a Dollars 480m after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to cover restructuring, which includes closing about 10 per cent of its stores and slashing its workforce by about 9 per cent, or 13,000 jobs. Woolworth's sales performance has been lagging its competitors. The company disappointed Wall Street as earnings were eroded in the first and second quarters of this year when total profits were only Dollars 3m, or 2 cents a share, compared with net income of Dollars 50m, or 38 cents, for the first six months of 1992. In last year's third quarter, the group posted after-tax profits of Dollars 65m on sales of Dollars 2.5bn. Woolworth will close about 970 general merchandise and specialty stores in the US and Canada over the next few months. These stores suffered operating losses of Dollars 36m in the first half of this year. About 250 of those stores to be closed will be changed into more profitable formats - primarily into the group's athletic footwear and apparel chains. Woolworth will remodel and revamp the merchandise in some of its Kinney shoe stores and convert 100 Woolworth stores in Canada into its Bargain Shop chain. In the US, Woolworth will close 400, or about half of its Woolworth general merchandise stores. It will close 330, or about one-third of its Kinney and Footquarters shoe stores. In Canada, only about 5 per cent of the group's stores will be closed permanently. The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, to downgrade its ratings on Woolworth's debt, preferred stock and commercial paper. The agency believes the write-off highlights problems Woolworth is having in its general merchandise and Kinney family footwear businesses in addition to the general malaise in the retailing environment. Moody's Investors Service, which coincidentally placed Woolworth's commercial paper on review for possible downgrade, was concerned that Woolworth might be facing a decline in long-term demand in many of its markets. Mr William Lavin, who replaced Mr Harold Sells as chairman and chief executive in July, said the programme was 'consistent with a key strategic priority of the company: the restructuring, reformating and revitalising of businesses which can meet the company's financial objectives within a reasonable time span and the redeploying of assets away from those businesses which cannot.' He blamed unfavourable economic conditions in North America, increased competitive pressures and the generally depressed consumer-spending environment for increased store closures. Woolworth said it did not expect the programme to have a large impact on it cash flows on an after-tax basis.</p>

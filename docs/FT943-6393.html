			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / SPD challenges Kohl with triumvirate Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), trailing in opinion polls, tried to recover lost momentum yesterday by presenting a new triumvirate which it hopes will derail Chancellor Helmut Kohl's bid for a fourth term in elections on October 16. Mr Gerhard Schroder, the high profile state premier of Lower Saxony and a bitter rival of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, has been lured back into the party's 'war cabinet' with the prospect of taking over an enlarged Economics Ministry, including the present Traffic Ministry. There are high hopes that Mr Schroder's aggressive campaigning style, matched with the charisma of Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the Saarland state premier and the party's deputy leader, will counteract Mr Scharping's lacklustre style. At a news conference in Bonn to present a new 16-member SPD line-up, the genial Mr Schroder promptly found himself fielding almost as many questions as the party leader, a measure of the hopes riding on his invitation to join the SPD's inner sanctum. The SPD's three-man line-up contrasts sharply with the Christian Democratic Union, which has focused its entire campaign around Mr Kohl, presenting him as sole guarantor of affluence and stability. A poll of 2,000 people in the weekly Bild am Sonntag newspaper suggested that Mr Schroder would score 44 per cent against 34 per cent for Mr Kohl. The same poll showed Mr Scharping managing only 30 per cent against 41 per cent for the present chancellor. The styles of the two men, rivals during last year's contest for the SPD leadership and often at loggerheads over campaign strategy in recent months, differed markedly at the press conference. Mr Schroder was relaxed and confident, relishing the cut and thrust with over 100 assembled journalists, while Mr Scharping shuffled in his seat and seemed uneasy. The SPD line-up has been billed as a shadow cabinet but is likely to see adjustments if the SPD does enter government after the October elections. Some recent opinion polls suggest the SPD may be obliged to form a coalition with the Greens, who are predicted to win about 8 per cent of votes. The SPD might have to cede two or three ministries to the Greens. Other reports speculate that an alliance with the Greens might not be enough to secure a majority and that the Free Democratic party, junior partner in the present government, could be drawn into a three-party coalition. Mr Lafontaine, the SPD's unsuccessful candidate for chancellor in the 1990 elections, would become finance minister in an SPD-led government. Mr Gunter Verheugen, SPD general secretary, would become foreign minister, while Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the parliamentary party, would become defence minister. Observer, Page 17</p>

After each basic task has been performed once, each subsequent task must be performed in accordance with the new operator's schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For airplanes that have not been previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task for each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished prior to further flight or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

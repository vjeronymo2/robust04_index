			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINERS INCENSED AT PARK BAN;  </P> <P> ARTS: OFFICIALS CALL KICKOFF OF SOVIET FESTIVAL A PRIVATE PARTY; BALBOA PARK  STREET PERFORMERS CLAIM DISCRIMINATION.  </P> <P> Silly Star, a weekend clown, has been going to Balboa Park for a decade.She  considers herself a fixture, like the fountain, or the dozens of other street  performers who show up and entertain only for tips.  </P> <P> It isn't like a clown to be angry, she said, but she's furious.  </P> <P> "You could call it fighting mad," she said.  </P> <P> Cheryl Barton (Silly Star's real name) said she and 15 to 25 other street  performers are incensed that Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Balboa Park management and  the organizers of the Soviet arts festival have joined forces to ban them from  the park this weekend for Super Powers Sunday, which kicks off the 3 1/2-week  festival.  </P> <P> In place of the street performers who show up at the park every weekend, Barton  said, entertainers from Sea World and Seaport Village are being brought in by  the festival committee "to pretend to be" street performers.  </P> <P> Penny Scott, district manager for Balboa Park, who grants the permits that  allow street performers to juggle, mime, clown or dance -- but only for tips --  said no permits were being granted either Saturday or Sunday because Super  Powers Sunday is considered a private party.  </P> <P> "It's not that we're denying permits," Scott said. "The city ordinance says  public land cannot be used for private gain. The permits (for street  performers) are administered by this department and at our discretion. Street  performers enhance the park, but if we feel they pose a conflict for an already  scheduled event, we have the right to take away their  </P> <P> permits. We've chosen to exercise that right."  </P> <P> Barton called the ban discriminatory and said the park's legion of street  performers may stage a sit-in demonstration.  </P> <P> "I have some basic questions," said Cynthia Douglass, 29, of Del Mar, who plays  the harp in the park. "If we who perform in the park on a regular basis are not  being given the opportunity to play for our Soviet visitors, and others are,  why, exactly, is that? How is it not discriminatory?  </P> <P> Barton, 39, said she had been told by spokesmen in the park office that some of  the street performers are "bums" or "panhandlers" and that the city "didn't  want to be embarrassed" by having them seen by visiting dignitaries.  </P> <P> Scott denied that anyone in her office said that, but she did say that "some  people in the public have complained about the street performers. "A lot of  people don't like" performers seeking tips, she said.  </P> <P> Scott said the no-permit policy for this weekend is not discriminatory. She  also disputed the performers' contention that the city is embarrassed by them  and is choosing to shut them out because their image is not what the mayor's  office wants to convey.  </P> <P> "That is just plain old not true," said Paul Downey, a spokesman for Mayor  O'Connor, who conceived the festival. "We'll have 3,000 performers throughout  the park representing all the different cultures of San Diego. We'll have  Filipino groups, Mexican groups, Irish groups and Italian groups, the one  caveat being that everyone donate their time.  </P> <P> "If the Sea World and Seaport Village performers are being paid, they're not  being paid by us. And the last I heard, Peg Nugent (hired by the festival to  book entertainers for the park) still needed performers."  </P> <P> Nugent and representatives of Sea World and Seaport Village were unavailable  for comment.  </P> <P> "I've been coming here for 10 years," Barton said, "and I'm a quality  entertainer. Most of the street performers I know are talented and dedicated. I  know of one who was living in the park, but to lump us all together and  stereotype us as though we were common vagrants only adds insult to injury."  </P> <P> Barton said permits were also denied for last weekend's KidzArtz Fair for the  same reason: "We weren't welcome at a private party."  </P> <P> Scott said it was more a case, as it is this weekend, of the park being packed  with events and performers and that the sponsors of each event -- the  children's fair and Super Powers Sunday -- "went out of their way" to ask that  street performers "not be there."  </P> <P> "Each group said they'd just rather have their own people," Scott said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the San Diego Police Department has said that as many as 50,000  people could show up for the six-hour event.  </P> <P> Roy Phelps, 69, a Normal Heights retiree, who was in the park Wednesday  watching Barton, harpist Douglass and other performers earlier in the day, said  he is "mystified" by the city's objection.  </P> <P> "It's part of the atmosphere of a great park," Phelps said. "The street  performers are part of what makes Balboa Park a fun place. Take them away --  take away the atmosphere, chip away at it a bit at a time -- and what have we  got? I don't like the way this smells."  </P> <P> "This ban, as it were, is really sad," said Deris Jeannette, 41, who said he  had watched street performers in the park for years and considers them "one of  its best aspects."  </P> <P> "To forbid these people to do what it is they do -- and do well, for the  pleasure of many -- just because they don't fit the image that San Diego wishes  they would is really reprehensible," Jeannette said.  </P> <P> Barton, wearing a rug-like multicolored wig, red sneakers and suspenders and  blue stars painted on her chin and around her eyes, said the customary group of  street performers who visit the park includes three clowns, two jugglers, a  magician, a man and woman who read Tarot cards, six artists and an Indian who  does traditional Native American dances.  </P> <P> He, too, is banned, she said.  </P> <P> "I guess we're ashamed of even our own country's heritage," she said.  </P></p>

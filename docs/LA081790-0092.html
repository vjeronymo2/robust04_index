			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTEE LAUDER COSMETICS GO HOLISTIC  </P> <P> Is Estee Lauder getting hip? Or has America's queen of cosmetics and fragrance  gone bonkers?  </P> <P> With her newest company -- botanically based Origins -- launched last week at  Nordstrom, 82-year-old Lauder is breaking beauty business rules. No fancy  packaging. No fancy names or ingredients. In fact, Origins includes several  products with non-cosmetic names and unexpected uses.  </P> <P> Stress Buffer, for instance, is a gel designed to be rubbed on the kidney  region and the solar plexus (just finding your solar plexus is a challenge for  most people). Energy Boost, a blend of vetiver (a fragrant East Indian grass),  cinnamon and lavender, is said to "keep nerves from knotting." There's even  Peace of Mind, a natural headache reliever containing basil, rosemary and  peppermint, to rub on the temples.  </P> <P> The point, says Lauder's 30-year-old grandson, William -- who heads the new  company -- is "a more holistic approach to looking your best -- beauty from the  inside out."  </P> <P> There's an environment-friendly message for every product. Recycling bins for  used bottles, caps and boxes are positioned at every cosmetics counter that  carries the line. A consumer dictionary is always on hand in stores to explain  the uses of natural ingredients and essences like ylang ylang, myrtle and great  mugwort -- herbs said to be natural relaxants.  </P> <P> The accompanying cosmetics line is more conventional, but all the colors are  earth-toned. There's not a fuchsia lipstick or blue eye shadow in the lot.  Another Origins touch is the pressed powder, embossed with a mantra: "One touch  of nature makes the whole world kin." To that end, like many of today's  cosmetics, nothing is safety-tested on animals. Origins goes one step further.  None of the products contains ingredients derived from animals -- that means no  lanolin, collagen or other animal proteins, and no fur brushes.  </P> <P> Joe Gubernick, the Lauder scientist who developed the collection, reasons,  "From a scientific viewpoint, it doesn't really make any significant difference  that we use no animal-derived ingredients, but it makes people feel better."  </P> <P> Origins has its share of conventional skin-care products, but even they sound  like they emerged from a '60s sensitivity seminar. These creams and lotions  don't address oily, normal or dry skin, but rather skin that "acts" oily, dry,  confused, sensitive or mature. The premise is that all skin is "normal" and can  be troubled at times.  </P> <P> The products are carried at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, but the West Coast  launch was more significant, Leonard Lauder says. "People on the West Coast are  far more environmentally aware than anywhere else in the country."  </P> <P> Ann Spikula, a shopper who lives in Santa Monica, was in Nordstrom at the  Westside Pavilion on Sunday, sniffing the various Origins elixirs. She said the  environmentally friendly approach didn't attract her, but the prices did. No  Origins skin care product costs more than $25. "I'm going to buy this one  called 'Peace of Mind' -- it's only $10," said Spikula. "If it works, that's a  bargain."  </P></p>

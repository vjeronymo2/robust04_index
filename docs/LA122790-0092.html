			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> YOU ARE HERE;  </P> <P> SHOPPING MALL PLAYS TO UPSCALE COMMUNITY  </P> <P> A decade ago, Manhattan Beach was well along in its transformation from quaint  beach town to affluent community. But one thing that affluence demands -- a  convenient shopping mall -- was missing.  </P> <P> So in 1981, part of a Chevron USA tank farm gave way to the Manhattan Village  Shopping Center. With its Mediterranean architecture, lush landscaping and  emphasis on upscale stores, it deliberately played to the moneyed community  around it.  </P> <P> "This is a nice area. People have disposable incomes and they spend it," said  John Burns, the mall's general manager.  </P> <P> In 1989, the mall's 89 stores recorded taxable retail sales of almost $91  million and ranked 23rd among Los Angeles County's 45 largest malls.  </P> <P> From the start, Manhattan Village has had no regrets about not being the South  Bay's biggest mall. It has sought shops that have few other outlets and has  created an inviting, low-key atmosphere with an architecture marked by  skylights, interior trees and a fountain populated by ceramic sea animals.  </P> <P> Regular shopper Christine Seltzer said there is a feeling of being welcome.  "The clerks know who you are and they respect you," she said. "You're not a  number."  </P> <P> Although chain stores such as Miller's Outpost clothing and B. Dalton books are  a part of the mall, Manhattan Village also has Lucy Zahran, a fine china and  crystal shop, and Seaport Unique Gifts, which has the South Bay's largest  collection of Lladro ceramics and draws customers from as far away as  Riverside.  </P> <P> The mall also boasts St. Estephe, a four-star restaurant that utilizes French  sauces and Southwestern ingredients such as red and green chilis and blue corn  tortillas. With such delicacies as mushroom-filled chili rellenos in a garlic  goat cheese sauce, the restaurant has established an international reputation,  said manager Chris St. Marie.  </P> <P> Although Manhattan Village is aimed at the affluent, Burns said its customers  also include secretaries and white-collar workers in the nearby aerospace  industries. Most customers come from within a mile of the center, he said. TRW  shuttles employees to the center between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on workdays  so they can have lunch and shop. Hughes does the same thing during the  Christmas season.  </P> <P> "Our lunch business is stronger than our business evenings and weekends," Burns  said.  </P> <P> The first phase of Manhattan Village opened in 1980 with a Ralphs Market and  Sav-On Drug Store as major tenants. A year later, in October, 1981, the  enclosed mall opened with Bullock's and Buffums as anchor stores. Rounding out  the complex are restaurants, movie theaters, banks and offices.  </P> <P> Some shoppers say this kind of diversity makes the center a one-stop dining,  shopping and entertainment location. "There's a good selection here," said  Shirley Lochner, who frequently visits the mall to "shop, walk and just see  what's around."  </P> <P> The center also lacks the frantic pace of larger malls, according to shopper  Diane Christofferson. "It's never that overcrowded. If it were mobbed, I  wouldn't like it."

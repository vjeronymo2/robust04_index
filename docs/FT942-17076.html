			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: ANC Leader rules out any postponement of forthcoming all-race elections Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, yesterday ruled out any postponement of South Africa's forthcoming all-race elections, despite a report from the country's Independent Electoral Commission saying it would be impossible to hold elections in violent Natal province, Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman write from Johannesburg. 'Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections  ..either in the province of Natal or in any of the provinces,' Mr Mandela told a youth conference in Durban. Some 700 additional troops were last night on their way to bolster the 2,000 soldiers already enforcing the state of emergency in Natal, where over 100 people have died in six days. A government spokesman said last night the Natal crisis required a political solution, which will be the focus of tomorrow's peace summit between Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk, Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini.</p>

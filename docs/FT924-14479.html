			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Chancellor moves to plug economic policy gap MR Norman Lamont's new monetary policy won few fans in Brighton yesterday. The Conservative Conference gave the chancellor a brief standing ovation that was loyally correct but far from enthusiastic, while the City's immediate response was to mark sterling down by 2 pfennigs. But the policy to fill the gaping hole in monetary discipline caused by withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism contains two potentially far-reaching innovations. For the first time, a British government is setting an explicit inflation target: of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments. In a nation where policymaking is normally shrouded in secrecy, the chancellor has promised to make monetary policy more accountable. If inflation moves outside the targeted range, Mr Lamont has committed the government to giving a full explanation to parliament and the markets of what has gone wrong and how it plans to correct matters. The Treasury and the Bank of England hope these elements will help establish credibility. For in other aspects the plans in Mr Lamont's speech and in a letter to Mr John Watts, the chairman of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, are a rerun of Tory policy in the mid 1980s. Then as now, policy was guided by a number of monetary indicators and tempered by Treasury judgment. That approach was abandoned in 1987 by Mr Nigel Lawson in favour of shadowing the D-Mark, then replaced with sterling's ill-fated membership of the ERM. Mr Lamont promised yesterday that the government would look at monetary aggregates; asset prices, including house prices; and the exchange rate in determining when and by how much it should alter interest rates. That will be backed by 'the tightest control of public spending'. But the chancellor's letter to Mr Watts emphasised that there would be no question of making monetary policy on automatic pilot. Judgment will affect the very cornerstone of policy. 'The strength or weakness of the economy will affect the pace' at which the UK moves towards its long-term objective on inflation. Similarly, on the exchange rate, there will be no target range nor any shadowing of another currency. On the other hand, the government will not let the exchange rate 'go where it will'. The chancellor said: 'The test is whether we believe a movement in the exchange rate (as defined by the sterling exchange-rate index) or a particular level of it, sustained for a period, is likely to jeopardise the inflation objective.' Mr Lamont is wary of the indicators that will help to underpin his policies. M0, the narrow measure of money supply which the government targets, is behaving itself and is close to the centre of its 0 per cent to 4 per cent target growth range. His letter admits that M0, which comprises mainly notes and coin in circulation, 'is limited to providing a timely guide to current behaviour in the economy'. Past experience suggests that it would be unwise to establish a formal target for M4, the broad money measure. Instead, Mr Lamont will announce 'monitoring ranges' for M4 beyond which its movement would be 'increasing cause for concern' in next month's Autumn Statement. The Bank and Treasury will study various weighted broad money indices, such as the Divisia index, which has followers in the City. Mr Lamont said it was too early, though, to give such measures a formal place in the way monetary conditions are assessed. He will also monitor asset prices, particularly when house prices are falling or accelerating sharply. Mr Lamont's guarded exposition of his new policy reflects a realisation among policymakers that there is no magic formula for operating monetary policy. That was acknowledged last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, in a speech in Cambridgeshire. Yesterday's explanations of the mechanics of the new monetary policy gave the markets little clear guidance. Indeed, any trader watching the chancellor's speech on television could be forgiven for thinking that the UK economy was again to be steered by seat-of-the-pants judgments. The inflation targets detailed in the chancellor's letter showed that monetary policy would be tight, and tended to bear out Mr Lamont's claim that the government intends to take no risks with inflation. By past standards, the inflation targets are ambitious. The annual rate of retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, was 4.2 per cent in August and has never been lower than 3.1 per cent. On the other hand, the economy is so depressed that an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent or less 'in the long term' should be achievable. In the short term, however, there is no way that the speakers who called for interest rate cuts of 2, 3 or 5 percentage points yesterday will have their wishes granted. In one important respect, leaving the ERM has not changed policy. The inflation targets mean that a substantial cut in UK interest rates will have to wait for a clear easing of monetary conditions in Germany.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Camacho puts peace before presidency Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the Mexican state of Chiapas, has sought to end speculation about his political ambitions by apparently ruling himself out as a presidential contender this August. 'If it continues to look as if my priority is to become a candidate for the presidency of the republic, this could end up damaging the peace process,' Mr Camacho said. 'Between seeking a candidacy for the presidency and the contribution I can make to the peace process in Chiapas, I choose peace,' he said. However, in giving his work in Chiapas as the reason for not seeking the presidency, Mr Camacho left open the admittedly small possibility his presidential ambitions might return if the conflict in Chiapas were resolved, or if he were no longer needed in the state. Mr Camacho made clear he still wanted to be president, but not at the cost of peace in Chiapas. Despite the potential ambiguity, news of Mr Camacho's announcement led to a sharp recovery in the Mexican stockmarket yesterday. By noon it was up 3.7 per cent. The New York-quoted stock of Telefonos de Mexico was up by 7.2 per cent at 1pm. The peso also strengthened slightly. Mr Camacho, a former Mexico City mayor and foreign minister, is one of the best known and most powerful members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. His candidacy could have split the party, and thrown this August's presidential election wide open. The political uncertainty caused by his rumoured candidacy contributed to sharp declines in the Mexican stockmarket and peso, and consternation in the government. Over the past six weeks the stock market has lost about 17 per cent of its value, and the peso has depreciated by more than 6 per cent against the dollar. The situation in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas has also become more tense in recent weeks. Big landlords are engaged in a struggle over land with sympathisers of the Zapatista rebels, who launched a rebellion in the state at the New Year. Mr Camacho believes that speculation about his presidential candidacy was complicating efforts to bring the sides together. He also said that in the current electoral climate he would not seek to be a senator, nor would any member of his negotiating team in Chiapas seek political office. But he said he would continue in politics, seeking democratic reforms, and responding to the needs of the population.</p>

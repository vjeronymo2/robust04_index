			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS ADD A NEW MINOR LEAGUE TEAM  </P> <P> The Kings announced Wednesday that they will have a full working agreement next  season with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League, but  still will keep their American Hockey League affiliate in New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> The Kings recently signed a three-year extension with New Haven after plans to  sell the Knighthawks to a Connecticut businessman fell through.  </P> <P> "We will operate two full minor league teams this year," General Manager Rogie  Vachon said. "It's unusual, but we think we can do it."  </P> <P> "We feel Phoenix is perfect for the Kings. We're only an hour away if we need a  player. It takes almost a day to recall a player from New Haven. It would be  very easy to bring up a guy from Phoenix and he could play for you that night."  </P> <P> Phoenix, an IHL expansion team operating as an independent last season, had  partial NHL affiliations with the Kings, Edmonton Oilers and Buffalo Sabres.  </P> <P> In another move, the Kings named former NHL defenseman Nick Beverley assistant  general manager.  </P> <P> Beverley, who played with the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Minnesota North  Stars and Kings in the 1970s, was the club's director of player personnel the  last two years.  </P> <P> The Kings also signed forwards Mike Allison and Chris Kontos, and goaltender  Mario Gosselin to termination contracts, meaning they will become free agents  after next season.  </P></p>

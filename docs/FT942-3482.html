			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (4): Gates open to financing - The area is now eligible for UK and EU help The economic plight of the Nottinghamshire coalfield has raised the eligibility of the area for a bewildering battery of finance from both the UK government and from the European Union. It has spurred the activity of local agencies fostering economic revival. The October 1992 announcement of coal mine closures by Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, was accompanied by promises of assistance from the government, some of which has materialised, some of which has yet to appear. Last year's redrawing of the UK Assisted Areas map left the Mansfield travel-to-work area, the largest town affected by the coalfield problems, as a development area. Ashfield, on the east side of the county, Worksop and Retford are intermediate areas. This designation, by the department of trade and industry, allows companies, either in or coming to the area, subsidies for projects which maintain or increase the number of jobs. The status provides an additional inducement to potential inward investors. The government has also promised extra help through fresh funding for North Nottinghamshire training and enterprise council. One tranche of this has been secured. The Tec has signed a contract with the government which over two years and at a cost of Pounds 7m will provide training and support for miners from the Bevercotes, Clipstone and Silverhill pits. A further contract, covering the miners from the Bentinck-Annesley and Ollerton pits which is yet to be signed will provide roughly the same amount of funding as the first agreement. Given that the Tec's usual budget is Pounds 20m a year, the extra sums represent a considerable financial uplift. In a third move, the government overcame its antipathy towards an economic stimulation device of the early 1980s and promised to set up enterprise zones. Companies setting up within them will benefit from an exemption from the uniform business rate, capital allowances on new buildings and relaxed planning controls. But progress has been slow and statutory procedures allowing their opening will not be completed until the autumn. In fact, the acreage allotted to the zones is less than had been hoped for locally. There will be three: one of 165 acres next to Junction 27 of the M1, which will probably end up as a business park, another of 45 acres on the site of the old Mansfield colliery and a third of 40 acres on the site of the old Manton colliery. Mansfield District Council has set its criteria for use of its zone. 'We wanted to avoid moving jobs from one part of Mansfield to another,' said Phil Asquith, head of economic development. 'New projects must create, per acre, 25 new jobs in the district of Mansfield, although not necessarily in the enterprise zone.' Further government funding will become available through the Single Regeneration Budget, administered through the government's regional office. How much is not clear. The amounts will depend on the skill of local groups in assembling public-private-voluntary partnerships to run specific projects. The government is introducing competition in order to sort out bids from across the country for a limited pot of funds. 'Cash is tight this year,' says Mr Asquith. Mansfield, however, is pulling together 'an area bid which focuses into neighbourhood bids. The government is looking not just for a wish list - it wants projects to hang together, as does English Partnerships'. The aim is to bring together different sectors of the community and to make sure that the private sector plays its role in the wider regeneration process. This inevitably means a widening role for agencies where the public and private sectors come together, such as Mansfield 2010, Nottingham Development Enterprise and the Mansfield, Sutton and Kirkby Enterprise Partnership. English Partnerships now controls regeneration funding such as the old derelict land grant. 'We used to do well with the derelict land grant. We're waiting to see what will be given now. There were no major schemes in 1993-94,' said Howard Jackson, director of the county council's planning and economic development department. Eligible for finance Continued from page 2 Hopes of being able to obtain up to Pounds 5m during the last financial year from English Partnerships were thwarted, but the council hopes this year for funding of that order. Other government bodies involved in the coalfield include the Rural Development Commission, which is active in small projects running from the recycling of furniture to housing advice and training. The Rural Development Commission is part of an informal coalition of organisations which co-operate on an ad hoc basis to succour new and existing business. With British Coal Enterprise, the county council and North Nottinghamshire Tec, it is a source of venture capital and loan funding. Amounts are small by the standards of private sector venture capitalists. The Tec, which, said Pat Richards, the chief executive, had supported 300 companies over the past two years, has a limit of Pounds 15,000 on the loans it will provide. British Coal Enterprise has what it calls '250 live clients' in the Midlands  -it does not keep its statistics on a county basis - and has funded 639 projects in all. It is prepared to provide loans of up to Pounds 1m and equity capital of between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 250,000. Often the lending is unsecured. 'We are very much at the risky end of the market,' said Winsor Lewis, the Midlands regional manager. This panoply of funding is significant in drawing in funds from Brussels. EU funding depends on the provision of local funding at a matching figure, so no UK involvement means no European involvement. In the past Nottinghamshire successfully attracted European finance through the Regional Development Fund for economically weak areas, the Social Fund, a source of money for training, Rechar, directed at restructuring coal mine areas and Retex, concentrating on areas where the textile industry has declined. Council officials recently reported that Regional Development and Rechar could provide Pounds 65m of funding for appropriate programmes over the next three years. This would be a fillip to infrastructure projects as the county puts its economy on to a new tack.</p>

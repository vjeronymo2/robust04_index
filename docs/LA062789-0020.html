			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EYESORE  </P> <P> Driving south from Santa Barbara recently, my husband and I happened by Zuma  Beach, and there I was confronted by an eyesore that broke my heart.  </P> <P> The beach was almost deserted -- yet the bright orange and white trash cans  that proliferated (one almost every 20 feet) were enough to blight the  landscape and make me want to cry.  </P> <P> Were a private developer to permit such an atrocity, he would be skewered by  the public, but the "public" beach is scenically and environmentally destroyed  by this outrageous condition.  </P> <P> Certainly our taxes, bond issues, etc. should pay for trash cans that are not  so aesthetically out of line!  </P> <P> CAROL KIESSIG  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

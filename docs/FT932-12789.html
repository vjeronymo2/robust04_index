			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo signals pay crackdown MR MICHAEL Portillo yesterday warned that the government would not break its public expenditure targets, as he underlined the root and branch nature of its departmental spending review. As the finance bill implementing the measures in last month's Budget received its second Commons reading, the chief secretary to the Treasury also signalled a renewed crackdown on wages. Sustaining Britain's competitive advantage would depend on controlling costs 'wage costs in particular', he said. Wage restraint would 'help business to compete' and assist in the creation of new jobs. In a combative speech, Mr Portillo sought to portray the government's battle to control public spending as for the good of the whole economy. If public spending was too high, it weighed upon the 'wealth-creating sector of our country', he said. Offering a coded warning to cabinet ministers as the new round of public-spending discussions starts he predicted that the government's spending would grow at a slower rate than overall growth in the economy over time. He said the government had published fixed spending ceilings 'above which we will not go.' Seeking to buttress his argument with statistics, Mr Portillo said central government debt interest payments were projected to rise by nearly 9 per cent a year in real terms between now and 1996-97. This alone would add close to 1 per cent to the proportion of national income taken by public spending, which is planned to weigh in at over 45 per cent in the current financial year. Turning to his rolling four-year public spending review, Mr Portillo said he had agreed 'demanding agendas' with the four cabinet ministers whose big-spending departments had been initially targeted. 'We have chosen these programmes because they are among the largest - what is loose change in these programmes can be more than the entire budget for another department,' he said. Ms Harriet Harman, a front-bench Labour Treasury spokesman, took the government to task for breaking its pre-election pledges not to raise taxes, while Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, urged ministers to remember that they meant 'we are climbing out of the hole into which the government pushed us'. The bill received a second reading by 310 votes to 266, a government majority of 44.</p>

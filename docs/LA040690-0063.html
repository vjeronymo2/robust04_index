			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RADIO SHOW PLAYS NONE OF THE HITS;  </P> <P> BOOTLEG RADIO: LOU FRIEDMAN AND ROB RAINO GIVE UNKNOWN ROCK BANDS BADLY NEEDED  AIRPLAY.  </P> <P> Five years ago, Lou Friedman was struggling to start a Muzak-type service.  These days, the Canoga Park man fancies himself a Masked Avenger of rock 'n'  roll.  </P> <P> Friedman and a friend, Rob Raino, are co-hosts of a weekly radio show on tiny  KWNK (670). "Bootleg Radio" broadcasts one hour of contemporary rock -- the  kind of music that plays on KPWR (105.9) or KQLZ (100.3) -- but the program  features unknown, unsigned bands that most radio stations won't give a chance.  </P> <P> "We will listen to any band's tape," Friedman says. "We will play anything that  is good rock 'n' roll."  </P> <P> "Bootleg Radio" airs at 11 p.m. every Friday. The show can also be heard on  Friedman's 24-hour music service, KLF Cable Radio, which started out as a  Muzak-type service for restaurants. KLF now supplies Top-40 songs and news to  accompany the program guide on United Cable's channel 30.  </P> <P> One band, Misguided, recently appeared on "Bootleg Radio" and was subsequently  invited to record several songs for a major label.  </P> <P> "Everybody in the world comes to Los Angeles to do rock. It's competitive,"  said Meghan McMullin, the band's lead singer. "Once you can get your toe in the  door, then you squeeze the rest of your body through. Little things like that  can happen because of 'Bootleg Radio.' "  </P> <P> The program began in January, 1989, as a lark: Friedman and Raino were playing  in bands and knew, all too well, the difficulty of getting airplay. Unlike  other fledgling musicians, these two had what amounted to a radio station at  their disposal. Friedman had started KLF back in 1985. He and Raino decided to  put a weekly show on the music service and fill it with bands they'd met on the  club circuit.  </P> <P> At first, such fare reached only cable subscribers. Friedman soon approached  KWNK, and the Simi Valley station agreed to carry the show. Most other programs  for unknown bands are on small, college stations.  </P> <P> "It's almost like community access," a KWNK official said. "We want people in  the community to have a way of voicing their opinions, not only during our talk  shows but also musically."  </P> <P> The show got another break from the pop duet Captain &amp; Tennille. Daryl  Dragon and Toni Tennille, who are married, own Rumbo Recording in Canoga Park.  After listening to Friedman and Raino's pleas, Dragon and Tennille decided to  let "Bootleg Radio" tape in their studio, for free. Expensive equipment gives  the program a better sound than would be possible with KLF's small production  facilities.  </P> <P> Vicky Camblin, who manages Rumbo, said, "The Captain &amp; Tennille were  discovered at the Smoke House," referring to a former Sherman Oaks club. "They  would like other bands to have a chance."  </P> <P> Though "Bootleg Radio" has been on the air only a year, word has spread  quickly, and bands send in demo tapes by the sackful. According to Friedman, a  New York band heard the show in Los Angeles and told other groups in the East.  Tapes have been arriving from all over the country.  </P> <P> "We try to feature at least one out-of-state band each show," Friedman said.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles bands continue to dominate the weekly hour. By featuring groups  that play local clubs -- and have local followings -- the program guarantees  itself listeners.  </P> <P> "On the night when a band is going to be on the show," Friedman said, "the fans  will have a big party, and everyone will gather around the radio."  </P> <P> And now the show is trying to be syndicated nationally. Friedman and Raino say  they are negotiating with two dozen radio stations across the country. In a  promotional flyer, "Bootleg Radio" offers to deliver bands that will be the new  Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crues.  </P> <P> The Casey Lee Jones Band, which was on "Bootleg Radio" in January, hasn't made  it that big yet, but good things have happened since they were featured.  </P> <P> "We've been offered a movie sound track," said Steve Williams, the band's  manager. "Lou and Rob have a good concept. Bands need every opportunity they  can get."  </P></p>

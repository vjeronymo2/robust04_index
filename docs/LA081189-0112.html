The conservation group ranked an Alcoa plant at Calhoun, Tex., as  No. 1 in terms of the pounds of pollutants released into the environment. The  group said the plant released 465.3 million pounds of pollutants in 1987, the  latest year for which figures are available. The Great Lakes division of  National Steel Corp. in Wayne, Mich., was a close second at 423.1 million  pounds. Two other Alcoa plants in Milam, Tex., and Bauxite, Ark., were among  the top 10 of the list, made up mostly of metal, chemical, oil, drug, paper and  mining companies.  </P></p>

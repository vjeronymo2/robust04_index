			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 12 May--During a news conference today  in the Sejm building after a speech by Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski, Lech Walesa confirmed that he agrees with the policy  line presented by the minister.    The president said that he has been working with Olechowski  for some time, adding: "We have discussed those topics; however,  we could discuss phrases." According to Walesa, Poland is not  threatened by any attack at the moment. However, a lack of  strategy, policy, and vision of the functioning of the states of  Central and East Europe could be a threat.    The president said that he was not surprised by the  Constitutional Tribunal's decision on the dismissal of Marek  Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio and  Television Broadcasting Council. He "knew what the law is like  and who created it." Walesa said: "It was created by  Markiewicz, who knew from me that he would be the chairman, and  that is why the law is structured as it is." "However, I  thought the courts would view whether everyone in the country is  independent and self-governing, and if this really was a balance  of power seen in a different way," Walesa added [sentence as  received].    In Walesa's opinion, this is not in agreement with the  principle of balance, because everyone who has control of the  press and television has most of the power, and "may even--as it  happened--not broadcast what the president says."    The president said that he is convinced he had to recall  Markiewicz because he wanted to stress that "there must not be  absurd situations whereby a workman has no money for bread and  someone else earns 90 million zlotys, thanks to their  independence, and the Council is the cause of such financial  contrasts."    The president expects from every chairmen of the council  "harmony and cooperation."    Walesa declared himself in favor of wage control in the  economy, but, as he said, he did not block the earlier law so  that he could sign one that is as "weak" as the new one. "I  wanted to force the government to work out ideas tested in the  world. So far, I cannot see anything new in this law, and my  aim has not been achieved," Walesa said. [passage omitted]    Asked if he would take up the role of mediator between the  government and strikers, he said that, at the moment, "there is  no need for the president to participate in what is happening."  A proposal to mediate could be seen as the president "wanting  to heat up the atmosphere" and "score points," said Walesa.</p>

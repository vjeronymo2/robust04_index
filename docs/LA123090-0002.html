			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: AN AFTERTASTE OF IBERIAN UNREALITY;  </P> <P> THE YEAR OF THE DEATH OF RICARDO REIS BY JOSE SARAMAGO TRANSLATED FROM  PORTUGUESE BY GIOVANNI PONTIERO (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH: $21.95; 335 PP.)  </P> <P> The circumstantial fog that surrounds so many modern facts, the literary fog  with which some modern authors choose to write about them, the actual fog that  blurs and softens the Baroque architecture of Lisbon: How well, on the whole,  these come together in "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis."  </P> <P> The Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, author of the enchanting historical  fantasy "Baltasar and Blimunda," has created an utterly indeterminate  protagonist. He is a middle-aged doctor and poet who returns to Lisbon in the  mid-1930s after living for 16 years in Brazil. He dies a year after his  arrival. On the other hand, he may have been dead from the start. Or he may be  a literary invention of the real and historical Portuguese poet, Fernando de  Pessoa.  </P> <P> Indeterminacy is in literary fashion right now, with its deconstructionist  rupture between words and the reality they ostensibly represent. But it has  long roots, particularly in the literature of the Iberian Peninsula. There was  the Spanish writer Miguel de Unamuno; but chiefly, of course, there was  Calderon's "Life Is a Dream." Iberian unreality has ancestors and family  photographs; it has veins, warmth and melancholy.  </P> <P> Existent or not -- he argues for the possibility and does not always win -- Dr.  Ricardo Reis displays a great deal of life in the aimless interval that he  spends between his arrival on the first page and his "death" on the last.  Indecisive, languid and pedantic, he haunts us, nonetheless; just as throughout  the book, he is himself haunted by the sardonic and talkative ghost of Pessoa,  who comes regularly to visit.  </P> <P> A little narrative is in order. Reis lands in Lisbon, where it is raining, and  where it continues to rain virtually nonstop. He has no friends or connections;  he puts up in a comfortable hotel, works for a while as a substitute for  another doctor, makes vague plans to open a practice of his own and, with much  procrastination, moves to a somber and massively furnished apartment  overlooking the harbor.  </P> <P> History tosses and turns like an insomniac in the next room, without ever quite  breaking in on his daze. Reis' hotel is full of right-wing Spaniards plotting  the uprising that will become the Civil War. He himself is an object of  suspicion to the Portuguese government, led by the professorial dictator,  Salazar, and sympathetic to the Spanish Right. He is interrogated by the  police, inconclusively; a ghostly policeman shadows him, his presence  invariably announced by the odor of onions.  </P> <P> Reis' own past is no more definite than his existence. As a youth, he was part  of a liberal intellectual circle that included Pessoa; his departure for Brazil  followed an abortive coup. His return follows an abortive leftist coup in  Brazil: hence, the police surveillance. In the rambling musings that form a  considerable part of the book, he appears aimlessly indecisive: unhappy with  the Spanish Republic, and unhappy with Franco. Among all our doubts as to who  he is, it is clear that he is Saramago's image of the futile artist and  intellectual.  </P> <P> The futility is played out with comic allure that deepens into sadness in two  love affairs that Reis bonelessly carries along. One is with Marcenda, whom he  spots dining at the hotel with her father. She is slender and virginal, and has  a crippled left hand. Father and daughter come down from Coimbra once a month,  ostensibly so that specialists can examine her, and also so that her bourgeois  father can visit his mistress.  </P> <P> Marcenda and Reis exchange glances, and she contrives a decorous meeting in the  hotel lounge so that he can examine her hand. The hand is incurable, he tells  her, but she should continue the monthly visits. It will give her father an  alibi for his escapades, and it will give her an alibi for hope.  </P> <P> It will also allow her to visit him in his apartment. All that happens is a  passionate monthly kiss, which Saramago makes more arousing than any 10 bedroom  scenes. Finally Marcenda refuses an offer of marriage, and breaks off. Reis is  too immaterial to hold her.  </P> <P> Marcenda is a splendid character, outspoken, inhibited and as much a fantasist  as Reis. Lydia, the chambermaid with whom Reis conducts a much more fleshly  affair, is even more memorable. She belongs to the oppressed classes -- the  hotel, with its hierarchies, stands for society -- but her passion flames  through her timidity.  </P> <P> Reis holds her hand for a moment one morning when she brings him breakfast and  tells her she's pretty. She flees, but when he returns to his room in the  evening, he sees that she has put out two pillows instead of one, and has  turned down both sides of the bed sheets. Saramago's comedy is delicately and  intimately entwined with his bleak puzzles; these, in turn, are tangled in  something close to tenderness.  </P> <P> Lydia is whole-hearted, sensual and devoted. She creeps down the hotel's cold  corridors each night from her garret. When Reis moves out, she comes once a  week to remedy his domestic incompetence, "to tidy up this chaos, this resigned  sorrow of things badly arranged." Afterwards, she washes, and they make love.  They also argue about politics. She is a woman of the people; her brother is a  naval seaman and a Communist. At the end, he is killed in an abortive left-wing  mutiny.  </P> <P> Ultimately, Reis -- artistic dilettante and poet's figment -- is as muffled  against life, love and humanity as if he, like the regularly visiting Pessoa,  were a ghost or the poet-ghost's poetic invention.  </P> <P> He is a voyeur and an insatiable ruminator. Like Leopold Bloom canvassing  Dublin, he walks endlessly through the streets, reads all the trivia in the  newspapers, and rarely slows his stream of disconnected musings. He cannot find  reality, so he hurls speculation at it, like 40 chimpanzees set to pounding 40  typewriters in the hope that by chance they might write "Hamlet."  </P> <P> Reis' musing and peregrinating can be comically absurd. The first morning in  the hotel, he hears the maid -- it turns out to be Lydia -- at the door with  his breakfast: Surely, she is using both hands to carry the loaded tray. How  does she manage to knock? Does she have three hands? Surely, "we would be in a  sorry state if we had to hire only servants who possess three hands or more."  In their sheer volume, the musings can be wearying, as well. It is not always  easy to pay attention to Reis' ghostly meanderings.  </P> <P> Yet ultimately, the doctor-poet holds us and moves us. His struggle to be real  makes him real. Saramago, unlike some modern writers, seems to know that it  takes a real character to make one who is meaningless. It takes someone serious  to be absurd.  </P></p>

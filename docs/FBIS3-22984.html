The guards, in a statement published in Iranian newspapers,  said the "fatwa" (Islamic decree) issued against Rushdie by  Iran's late spiritual guide Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni five  years ago was "irrevocable and would definitely be executed."    The Indian-born writer was condemned to death for his novel  "The Satanic Verses," which was judged to blaspheme Islam.    "Rushdie has insulted the sentiments and beliefs of more  than  a billion Moslems and should be punished according to the  fatwa," the statement said.    The Iranian official news agency said Monday on the fifth  anniversary of the ruling that Rushdie was an apostate and  should die.    "The sentence has to be carried out irrespective of whether  the apostate repents or not," it said.    On Tuesday, Jomhuri-ye Eslami newspaper denounced Western  support for Rushdie and called on "Islamic forces to kill him."    "It is time to assert the will of the Islamic world," said  the daily, close to Islamic hardliners. "Islamic forces should  eliminate Rushdie and strike a blow to the enemies of Islam."    The paper said that the verdict had been reaffirmed on its  fifth anniversary by several Islamic associations here and the  Khordad-15 religious foundation, which has put up a reward of  more than $2 million on Rushdie's head.    British Prime Minister John Major said on Monday that Iran  could not expect to enjoy "full and friendly relations" with the  rest of the world until the sentence was lifted.</p>

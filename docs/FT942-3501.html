			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Making the most of oil in a hostile climate - A look at the problems of exploiting reserves around Kagalyn, Siberia It is a relief to leave Kogalyn. The name of the Siberian oil town - meaning 'a place where men perish' in the local Khanta dialect - is entirely appropriate; Kogalyn suffers from one of the most hostile climates known to man. Built in seemingly interminable swamp land, Kogalyn shivers in temperatures of minus 55'C in winter and scorches in summer, when swarms of mosquitos come out to play. 'Mother nature was not kind when she put down oilfields. But Siberia is still one of the toughest places to work in,' says one western oil man surveying the distant landscape. Even so, Soviet central planners decreed more than 20 years ago that the Tyumen region's oil reserves should be exploited. Kogalyn, a town of 60,000 people, emerged as an important oil production centre. It is doubtful whether any modern oil company having a nodding acquaintance with the free market would develop the fields today. Kogalyn's remote situation means infrastructure costs would likely to outweigh financial gains. But with the the development costs having already been covered in the Soviet era it is becoming an attractive proposition to increase the yields of existing wells and develop adjacent fields. The task has fallen to Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, which was established in 1993 when disparate exploration, refining and marketing operations were welded together. Lukoil now accounts for 15 per cent of Russia's oil output. Only Shell, BP and Exxon are bigger in terms of oil extraction and refining. The challenges confronting the new company - and the Russian oil industry as a whole - are immense. Last year oil production in the Tyumen region fell by 16.4 per cent and Lukoil's output slid from 57.1m tonnes to 48.8m. The company expects a further decline of 5 per cent this year. Mr Semion Vainshtok, director general of Lukoil's largest production subsidiary, Kogalymneftegaz, is busy fighting fires on many fronts. But perhaps the greatest is the change of mentality of the workforce, for whom cost was a seemingly unknown concept. 'Three hairs on your head are too few. But 3 hairs in your borsch are too many,' he says, illustrating a need for a change of perspective. Much attention is being paid to reducing electricity consumption and the volume of water being pumped into the oil reservoir. Stricter production guidelines have been introduced. About 1,000 employees have been laid off and a further 300 are on compulsory leave. Comparable statistics are hard to come by but Kogalymneftegaz estimates that such measures have already shaved two to three percentage points off the production cost of a barrel of oil. Annual savings could run to 60bn roubles, it claims. Kogalymneftegaz is also trying to raise the yield of existing fields. It is drawing on the expertise of several western companies. One of them, Calgary Overseas, a private Canadian group, has already helped to 'work over' 1,000 wells, at an average cost of Dollars 220,000 each. Mr Robert Lipsett general manager of Calagary Overseas, estimates that those improvements have helped to raise the output of the nearby Vatyegan Povkh fields by 10 to 15 per cent. 'The Russian's have very sophisticated technology for the oil and gas industry but they do not meld it all together to maximise production and minimise cost,' he says. The Canadian contingent is steadily declining as the local Russians learn to co-ordinate such work themselves. Lukoil eventually hopes to transfer its own skills abroad. In collaboration with Agip of Italy, it has started oil projects in Tunisia and Egypt. But many of Lukoil's problems are beyond its control. Financial upheavals in the Russian economy have resulted in cashflow problems and Lukoil says its customers owe it 600bn roubles. It is restructuring its finances to ensure that it has sufficient cash available in its operating companies. 'You cannot a build an island of well-being in a sea of economic troubles,' says Mr Vainshtok. Lukoil has also tangled with the government over taxation issues and export quotas. The company wants to break free of the state grip and operate as a wholly-independent privatised company. The government intends, however, to retain 45 per cent stake in Lukyl for the next two years and will continue to influence the company's actions. As a private corporation, however, Lukoil may face a fresh set of challenges. It is already entangled in a bitter legal dispute with Frankenburg, a Houston-based oil company, which is claiming more than Dollars 500m in damages for breach of contract, Lukyl denies the charge.</p>

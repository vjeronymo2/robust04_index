			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference in Nicosia today, Israeli  Ambassador in Nicosia Shemi Tzur said Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres will soon visit Cyprus for talks on the peace  process for the Middle East. Tzur said Cyprus is becoming more  involved in the peace process for the Middle East. He added  that President Glavkos Kliridhis will go to Israel on 8 July in  conjunction with a sailing competition between Cyprus and Israel  and he will meet the Israeli president, prime minister, and  foreign minister.    The Israeli ambassador reiterated that his country  recognizes  only one government in Cyprus, the legal government of the  Republic of Cyprus. He also denied reports that Israeli planes  fly to the occupied areas and described them as exaggerated and  wrong. He said: There has been no official Israeli activity in  occupied Cyprus. He admitted, however, that a small travel  agency, called (?Ricky Tours Inhetera), is cooperating with a  Turkish agency and takes tourists to the occupied areas. Tzur  said the Israeli Tourism Ministry has sent a letter to every  travel agency in the country stressing that the northern part of  Cyprus is under occupation and that the Israeli Government  cannot offer any assistance to its nationals who visit occupied  Cyprus.</p>

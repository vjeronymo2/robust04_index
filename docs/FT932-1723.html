			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): Of Mammon versus Bacchus - Management TIME AND MONEY: THE MAKING OF CONSUMER CULTURE by Gary Cross Routledge Pounds 13.99, 294 pages THE RISE AND FALL OF MASS MARKETING edited by Richard S Tedlow and Geoffrey Jones Routledge Pounds 35, 239 pages SOMEWHERE in the recent past humanity decided it would forgo the pleasures of the sloth in order to enjoy those of the international computer salesman, a decision not entirely to the liking of all those not party to its making. Time and Money is about that decision, how in the last two centuries we have reached the point where increased consumption, rather than increased leisure, has become the central goal of economic activity. Cross has written a worthy if somewhat academically dry text which details the pros and cons of the debate. There are some grimly entertaining moments, not the least being those where it is evident that some of the earliest feminists unwittingly colluded in a version of reinforced self-enslavement. Their arguments that they should be granted as much right to a full working week in abysmal factories as men now seem a trifle absurd, rather like pleading to endure more discomfort to prove equality. But perhaps that itself was progress? In the end though the book ducks the real issue - how, in a complex and increasingly global economy, can the temptations of Mammon be balanced against the seductions of Bacchus, without being excessively tied to either? If Time and Money is slightly disappointing, then The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing is a suitable candidate for investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority; the title promises much but the cupboard sometimes seems a little bare. The 11 essays - on topics as varied as the marketing of motor cars in the UK before 1950 and wheat marketing since 1945 - are essentially retrospectives, attempts to grapple with the history of certain aspects of marketing rather than bring light to bear on contemporary marketing problems by using past experience. One of the central problems for marketing is its lack of a stable, universally agreed definition. 'Is one discussing advertising, brand building, warehousing, transportation, pricing, consumer research, or a combination of the above?' ask the editors in their introduction. They have opted for most of the contributors to concentrate on issues of distribution, and some of the pieces - such as Geoffrey Tweedale's essay on the development of mass marketing of computers - are unexpectedly absorbing. But the overall use of the volume is very classroom bound, though as an attempt to create an academic credibility for marketing - certainly one of the more surprising growth areas in the UK's new polyversities - the book as a whole makes advances.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BELLATTY BACK AT CALABASAS HELM  </P> <P> Refreshed after a two-year absence from boys' basketball, Bill Bellatty has  returned as the coach at Calabasas High.  </P> <P> After leading the Coyotes to the Southern Section playoffs four times in five  seasons, Bellatty resigned after the 1987-88 season, citing burnout.  </P> <P> Bellatty coached the girls' team last season, but he has attended only two  boys' games since resigning. However, his interest was renewed when Dave  Hoffman, who replaced Bellatty, left Calabasas to coach at Chaminade in May.  </P> <P> "When Dave decided to leave, I started thinking about it," Bellatty said. "My  enthusiasm is back."  </P> <P> Calabasas was 10-13 last season. Greg Waugh, a 6-foot-7 center, and Tom Hoover,  a 6-2 swingman, are the top returning players. STEVE HENSON  </P></p>

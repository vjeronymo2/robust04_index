			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Khenik, Belarus minister of Chernobyl </F> affairs, by Gerd Rosenkranz; place and date not given:  "Chernobyl Avoided in the Election Campaign"]    [Text] [Rosenkranz] What role does the Chernobyl  disaster play in your country's presidential elections?    [Khenik] Fortunately, none of the candidates has made use of  this bad situation. Not in the polluted regions either.    [Rosenkranz] Why fortunately? The catastrophe has made  people sick, has burdened the budget and economic perspectives.  Does the population not want the candidates to tell them what  the future will be like?    [Khenik] Our people understand very well what effects the  disaster still has on the country. Take the 18-percent  Chernobyl tax that we have had to levy on all firms. There have  never been any complaints or protests about it, although it  makes life more difficult than it already is. The disaster has  been inflicted on our people together, and people are aware of  this.    [Rosenkranz] Does this mean that there is no polarization of  opinion between the presidential candidates on this issue?    [Khenik] No. Most of the candidates have tried to avoid  this issue in their election campaigns. The central priority in  the elections is our economic development.    [Rosenkranz] What are your feelings in Belarus as you watch  the Chernobyl nuclear center in the Ukraine still operating?    [Khenik] My country has repeatedly appealed to Ukrainian  President Kravchuk and the parliament in Kiev to cancel the  decision to maintain operations and reopen the reactor.  Unfortunately, we have not even received an answer to our  request to their parliament. Kravchuk asked us to understand  that there is no other solution owing to the current economic  situation in Ukraine.    [Rosenkranz] Belarus does not have any nuclear power  stations, but of all the countries concerned it is suffering the  most from the effects of the accident. Are you getting any  support from the former Soviet Union?    [Khenik] Russia is the only state of the former USSR that  supports us economically. This year, President Yeltsin wants to  increase payments to 40 billion roubles.    [Rosenkranz] Of the humanitarian help that your country gets  from the West, 82 percent comes from voluntary organizations and  individuals, while only 18 percent is from the states. Are  people in the West more sensitive to your problems than  governments?    [Khenik] It is true that only now, after eight years, has an  agreement come about with the German Government on cooperation  in fighting the effects of Chernobyl. Fortunately, several  German land governments have shown more human decency and have  supported us, especially Hesse and Lower Saxony. But it is true  that social organizations and individuals have been doing a  great deal more.    [Rosenkranz] In spite of this situation there have been  discussions going on in Belarus on whether the problem of energy  supplies could not best be solved by constructing nuclear power  stations. Would a party or a presidential candidate taking such  a position stand a chance of being elected?    [Khenik] No. That is why this issue is systematically  avoided in candidates' speeches. No president would be in a  position to decide on the construction of nuclear reactors by  himself, without a referendum. There is no possible location  where this would not lead to massive protests.    [Rosenkranz] What do you think the outcome of a national  referendum on that issue would be?    [Khenik] People would, of course, be against nuclear power,  no doubt about that. There is no other option: We will have to  find non-nuclear, alternative sources of energy.</p>

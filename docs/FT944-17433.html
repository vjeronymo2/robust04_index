			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Clinton lays into Republican opponents President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a fierce attack on his Republican foes in Congress, after weeks in which he has appeared to accept meekly their repeated and mostly successful efforts to thwart every bill he has tried to get enacted. As members of Congress tried to wrap up their final legislative business before going home to campaign for the November 8 election, Mr Clinton blamed 'partisan gridlock by the Republican congressional leadership' for blocking reforms of health care, campaign finance, lobbying rules and environmental legislation. 'Too many times an idea for creating jobs, reforming government, educating students or expanding income, fighting crime or cleaning up the environment or reforming the political system was met by someone trying to stop it, slow it, kill it or just talk it to death,' Mr Clinton said at a White House news conference. In recent weeks Mr Clinton has appeared reluctant to criticise his political opponents, perhaps in an effort to salvage some vestige of co-operation from an increasingly antagonistic and partisan legislative session, and perhaps for fear of alienating Republican support he is counting on to win ratification of the trade liberalisation measures negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the White House this week had to give up hopes of passing Gatt before Congress recessed, settling for a lame duck session at the end of November, after the election. Yesterday's attack appeared, therefore, to mark the president's decision to move into the political trenches ahead of an election in which the Republicans are increasingly hopeful of winning control of at least one, if not both houses of Congress. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the Republican senate campaign committee, yesterday predicted his party could go 'substantially over 50' seats in the Senate, where 35 of the 100 seats are up for election, overturning the 56 to 44 Democratic majority. Mr Gramm said that he expected Republican candidates to hold two of the three states where Republican senators were retiring, and that Republicans were level or leading in 11 states now held by Democratic senators. Mr Haley Barbour, the Republican party chairman, said his party could take control of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats are at stake, as well as the Senate. But Republican strategists appear to be adding around 25 seats to their current 178 to give them working control in alliance with right-wing Democrats, rather than the 40 additional seats necessary for an outright majority.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Aide D.B. Ryurikov by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- from the  "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Judging by U.S. President Clinton's statement, the  United States is insisting on a wider use of diplomatic force to  make good use of the precedent in Sarajevo. U.S. diplomats are  already pressing for peace initiatives to be extended to other  regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, the aide to the Russian  president on external issues told our correspondent in some  detail about Russia's stance on this question.    [Correspondent] Dmitriy Borisovich, how will Russia further  develop its diplomatic initiative in this area?    [Ryurikov] Well, Russia has not stopped its initiatives, and  it will continue to develop them very actively. They will  concern the creation of a stable and peaceful situation in  Sarajevo -- that is, lifting the blockade of this region and  possibly placing it under UN administration -- and then reaching  agreement on roughly the same actions in other security zones on  Bosnian territory. Of course these must be peaceful,  diplomatic, political solutions, and the process of seeking a  political settlement of the problems of Bosnia as a whole must  be sharply stepped up. This must be based on the EC plan,  possibly with certain changes, trying to achieve a settlement as  soon as possible in order to stop all hostilities.</p>

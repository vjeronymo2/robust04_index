			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Euro airline alliances Match-making in the European airline industry is at fever pitch. Later today, Germany's Lufthansa is expected to announce a far-reaching alliance with United Airlines, the second biggest US carrier. At the same time, negotiations between Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines about forming a new force in the European market have reached a critical stage. Both initiatives are, in part, a response to British Airways' recent acquisition of a 24.9 per cent stake in USAir as part of its strategy of converting itself from national flag-carrier into global airline. The wave of mergers, joint ventures, co-operation agreements and the like presents both opportunities and dangers for Europe's airline passengers. Theoretically, it could sweep away national monopolies and replace them with competing global carriers. In the process, economies of scale could be achieved, fares cut from excessive levels and passengers offered the convenience of choosing between a number of one-stop shops capable of flying them almost anywhere in the world. The downside risk is that the industry will turn itself once again into a global cartel. The industry's monopolistic traditions are certainly cause for concern. So is the recession, which has cost Europe's airlines Dollars 3bn in the past three years. Several European state-owned airlines are already trying to avoid the consequences of the European Community's recently implemented open skies policy by pleading for further injections of state aid. There has also been a call for a return to old cartel practices. Fortunately, the Commission has so far said no, but political pressures are strong. It might seem that the Commission should guard against cartelisation by taking a hard line against alliances. But this would not be the optimal policy. The current patchwork of national carriers is not an efficient industry structure but a testimony to the industry's monopoly past. Restructuring on global lines will, in many cases, produce a more rational structure. Opening markets A better antidote to cartelisation would be further opening up of markets. Despite recent liberalisation, substantial barriers to entry remain. The Commission and national governments should focus on three areas. First, enabling new entrants to get access to take-off and landing slots at congested airports. In part, this will involve increasing the overall supply of slots by improving the infrastructure in air and on ground. But it will also be necessary in some cases to remove slots from dominant players. The European Commission has proposals on these lines, but they are so controversial that they have yet to be put to member states for approval. Second, a crackdown on unfair competition. Central to this should be a continued hard line by the Commission on state subsidies. But it will also be increasingly necessary to prevent predatory behaviour as the industry consolidates into a smaller number of larger groups. Dominant players must not think that they will be allowed to drive new entrants out of the market by pricing below costs or engaging in other underhand tactics. Free competition Third, freeing up competition on transatlantic and other intercontinental routes. The current bilateral pacts between national governments are in general highly restrictive, often underwriting back-door carve-ups of markets between established players. Such anti-competitive measures are reinforced by laws preventing non-EC groups owning more than 49 per cent of an EC airline and parallel restrictions in other jurisdictions. Further opening up of airline markets in Europe would certainly be painful for many of the established players. Some of them would certainly not survive in their current form, which would cause political difficulties given the emotional attachment most countries have to their flag-carriers. But the current alliances must go hand in hand with a further dose of liberalisation. Otherwise, the industry will merely find a new way to cling on to its cartel practices. That would be bad for passengers and probably against the industry's long-term interests too. Governments and the Commission must act.</p>

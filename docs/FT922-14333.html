			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Family at war with dissent - Paul Cheeseright returns to the Martins, the FT's family of floating voters ASHDOWN one, Major two, Kinnock three. That was the pecking order of the leading politicians in the esteem of the Martin family after they watched a television election special featuring the three men last night. The studio audience heckled Mr Kinnock for refusing to reveal his personal view on proportional representation, and hissed Mr Major for refusing to apologise for the poll tax. This family is hung, just as the next parliament is likely to be. The men, Tony and Russell, had a majority in favour of Ashdown after ITV's World In Action special. Lyn was more ambivalent. 'He got straight to the point,' said Russell. But Lyn said: 'Where's his team? There's more to it than just the one. I quite like him but I don't think he's strong enough.' Tony advocated what the polls suggest is unlikely to happen. 'I'd like to see him side-by-side with John Major.' Russell agreed. Mr Kinnock struck the Martins as rather evasive. It was the PR issue that did it. 'He blew it on that last question. His true colours came out. He didn't really answer it. He didn't get to the centre of it.' The difficulty for Mr Kinnock is that Tony and Lyn remember the problems of the 1970s. They will have to decide whether the Labour of the 1990s is the same party. The tendency after last night's broadcast is to hope for some sort of situation which engenders co-operation and minimises bickering. How the family will work out which vote will help towards that utopia is still unclear.</p>

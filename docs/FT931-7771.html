			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Labour targets Welsh valleys LABOUR yesterday launched an initiative aimed at reviving the south Wales valleys. Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, backed by 12 Welsh Labour MPs, called for a strategy to improve workforce skills, introduce more technology and lift wages. He said: 'A twin-track programme is needed: immediate action to halt the economic decline and a longer-term, more strategic programme geared to permanent recovery.' Labour believes the government's valleys programme has failed to produce lasting economic improvements. Mr Davies said the scheme had 'upgraded the property and environment of the valleys. They are greener, but no foundations have been built for durable local economies.' The initiative is an attempt to steal thunder from the government, which is on the point of introducing plans for the valleys, once dubbed 'Wales's only area with inner-city-type problems'. Lord Walker, when he was Welsh secretary, brought in the first valleys programme in 1988. The initiative was continued by his successor Mr David Hunt, who has promised to announce new measures before the present programme expires at the end of March. Labour believes the valleys should be feeder areas for the growing industrial base being created along the M4 motorway corridor running east-west across south Wales.</p>

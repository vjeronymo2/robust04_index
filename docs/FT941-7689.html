			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers led lower by GRE The composite insurers' preliminary reporting season got off to a disastrous start, with a warning from Guardian Royal Exchange of increasing competition in the UK market more than offsetting top of the range results from the company. Shares of all the big five UK composites were badly mauled, but none more so than Guardian Royal's, which dropped 16, or 6.8 per cent, to 218p, in spite of the good profits and satisfactory increase in the dividend total. Turnover was a heavy 6.8m. Less than a month ago GRE shares reached a four-year high of 247p. The market took fright at worries that the UK premium rating environment may have peaked and that the composites' earnings may be about to come under pressure. Some analysts said, however, that the market had overreacted to the GRE statement. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance specialist at Morgan Stanley, said he expected the composites' earnings to continue to grow this year and next year and pointed to the sector's 50 per cent yields premium over the market. At BZW, Mr Andrew Pitt said he believed 'a softening of premium rates can be accommodated by the continuing earnings recovery in the sector'. Commercial Union, due to report this morning, fell to 614p before closing 9 off at 624p, and Royal, with figures tomorrow, lost 8 at 298p. Sun Alliance dipped 13 to 361p and General Accident 30 to 647p.</p>

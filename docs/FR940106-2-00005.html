			<p><!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments related to the scope of the analysis should be received by February 18, 1994 to ensure timely consideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement is to determine the environmental effects of the proposed action and of any reasonable alternatives actions that would also achieve the purpose and need while addressing significant issues raised through public comment and agency review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alternatives may include any combination of feasible water withdrawal sources; water storage sites; and water withdrawal schedules on source rivers or brooks as long as those alternatives would achieve the purpose and need for this proposal while addressing significant issues that are identified during the analysis. Alternatives may include different trail configurations if significant concerns are raised about the trail improvements being proposed. The analysis will include a discussion of cumulative effects of all water withdrawals in the area affected by this proposal, including the current withdrawal at Clay Brook, the proposed withdrawal on Mad River, and any alternative water withdrawals that are identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Environmental Impact Statement and analysis will not reconsider the overall development plans for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Areas as described in the Master Development Plan approved on July 14, 1983. Forest Supervisor Terry Hoffman completed a review of that Master Development Plan on September 30, 1993. The Forest Supervisor determined that there is no need to change the overall development plan or supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement that was prepared in support of that Plan, except for specific amendments to the Master Development Plan associated with the proposal from Snowridge Inc. to use the Mad River as a water source for snowmaking, increase the volume of water used for snowmaking, and revise the trail map (or the alternative to this proposal as selected by the Forest Service). Those specific amendments are the focus and scope of the Environmental Impact Statement that will be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this Notice is to inform you that the Forest Service, with assistance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers is soliciting your comments and concerns about this proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental analysis and decision-making process will include opportunities for public participation and comment so that people interested in this proposal may contribute to the final decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will host an open house to be held at the Waitsfield Elementary School, Waitsfield, Vermont, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on Monday January 24, 1994. The purpose of this open house is to discuss and answer questions about the project proposal, the analysis process that will be conducted by the Forest Service and cooperating agencies, and the ways that people can best participate in the analysis and decision-making process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be welcome throughout the analysis, but is especially important at two points. The first point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The agency is now seeking written comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. Comments relevant to scoping include: (1) identifying potential issues, (2) identifying those issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a previous environmental analysis, (4) identifying additional alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered, (5) identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives, and (6) determining task assignments among the lead and cooperating agencies. General notice to the public concerning the scope of the analysis will be provided by mailings, news releases and/or public meetings. The second point when public participation is most important is during the public comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments related to the scope of the analysis should be received by February 18, 1994 to ensure timely consideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written comments and suggestions related to the scope of analysis to Terry Hoffman, Forest Supervisor, Green Mountain National Forest, 231 N.

Most of the base lodge facilities are on provide lands, but some of the base facilities and many of the lifts and trails are located on National Forest System lands. Sugarbush encompasses about 6,000 acres, of which a little over 1,825 acres are on National Forest System lands at Sugarbush South (about 30%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sugarbush operates in accordance with the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, which was approved by the Forest Service on July 14, 1983. Specific operations on National Forest System lands are authorized under a Special Use Permit issued by the Forest Service on December 9, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action is consistent with the long-range goals for this area as defined in the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest. That Forest Plan was approved on January 15, 1987. Under that Forest Plan, the area encompassed by the Suguarbush Ski Area is assigned to management under prescription 7.1A. This management prescription emphasizes highly developed areas, including downhill ski areas. The purpose of prescription 7.1A is to provide opportunities for recreation requiring highly developed structures and facilities, maintain a visually appealing landscape, and manage for other resources and uses in a compatible way. The Forest Service does not anticipate the need for any amendments to the Land and Resource Management Plan as a result of this snowmaking proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

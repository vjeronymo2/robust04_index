			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No BR pot of uncollected gold Sir, In reply to Graeme Thomson (Letters, September 8), there is no rainbow's end where a pot of uncollected revenue awaits discovery. Surveys confirm the success of our penalty fares scheme and deployment of revenue protection staff; on Network SouthEast ticketless travel is down from more than 4 per cent to 2 per cent. This represents Pounds 20m a year of extra income to us. There is no sense in spending more to catch fare dodgers than we collect from them. John Nelson, managing director, Network South-East, 1 Eversholt Street, London NW1</p>

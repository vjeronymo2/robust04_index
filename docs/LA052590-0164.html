			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> FRIENDLY SEA RIVALS;  </P> <P> 2 HIGH SCHOOL SAILING TEAMS SHARE COACH BUT STILL COMPETE INTENSELY  </P> <P> As far as high school rivalries go, the one between Corona del Mar and Newport  Harbor is as intense as any. When these schools compete, pride is as much a  factor as athletic or intellectual ability.  </P> <P> But amid this turbulence there is also a peaceful coexistence -- a calm, if you  will, on the water. For there, student sailing teams from both schools practice  together, travel together and even share the same coach -- Bill Wakeman, who is  an English teacher at Newport Harbor as well as an accomplished sailor.  </P> <P> This togetherness has caused a change in some perceptions of the rivalry.  </P> <P> "Because of the sailing team, I have good friends over at Harbor, and my  attitude toward their school has changed for the better," said Darren  Sutherland, a Corona del Mar senior and sailor since age 11. "I'm not into the  rivalry between Corona and Harbor. To me, it's just another game."  </P> <P> And from the rival school?  </P> <P> "I'm more open-minded about other schools because of my friendships on the  sailing team," said Chris Johnston, a Newport Harbor junior.  </P> <P> The Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor sailing teams have been practicing  together since 1972, and Wakeman has been their coach from the beginning.  </P> <P> "These kids have known each other since they were 8 years old, and friendly  competition has existed for years," said Wakeman, adding that there has never  been a problem between the schools.  </P> <P> "I do this simply on a volunteer basis because it's a heck of a lot of fun,"  said Wakeman, who has been sailing since he was 9 and competed on the college  level for Harvard.  </P> <P> The teams practice in the Newport Bay Turning Basin every Monday and Wednesday  during April and May, the competitive sailing season.  </P> <P> They sail in individually owned Lasers, which are one-man boats, and yacht  club-owned Collegiate Flying Juniors, which are two-man boats.  </P> <P> Three local yacht clubs -- Bahia Corinthian, Balboa and Newport Harbor -- offer  both teams financial support as well as loan them sailboats, a coach's boat and  racing equipment.  </P> <P> "I think that the clubs should support the schools' sailing teams because  that's where the future of yachting is coming from," said George Leitch, vice  commodore of the Balboa Yacht Club.  </P> <P> The 4 1/2-hour practices begin with members rigging their boats at one of the  three yacht clubs and then making their way to the Turning Basin, which can be  time-consuming, depending on weather conditions. When both teams arrive, the  short practice races begin. Wakeman tries to get in as many races as possible  to emphasize the importance of starting techniques.  </P> <P> The boats sail a triangular course that takes about 20 minutes. Though these  are informal practice races, there is still some competition between the teams  as well as between teammates.  </P> <P> Many well-known local sailors have graduated from the schools' sailing teams  and some have gone on to collegiate success. All-American sailors from Corona  del Mar include brothers John (UC Irvine) and Mike (Charleston) Pinckney; and  from Newport Harbor, Hugo Schmidt (USC), Alan Andrews (Stanford) and Jack  Franco (UC Irvine).  </P> <P> The teams have had great success on the national level, with Newport Harbor  winning six national high school championship regattas and Corona del Mar  winning five, with its latest coming in 1987.  </P> <P> This year, both again competed in the national championships May 12 and 13 at  Annapolis, Md. The regatta was held at the U.S. Naval Academy in conditions  that were less than perfect.  </P> <P> On the first day of competition, there was no wind and only two races were held  before the race committee canceled the remainder. The next day, the weather  took a turn for the worse, with the wind blowing at a gusty 20 m.p.h.,  accompanied by heavy rains. To compound that, there were three- to four-foot  waves.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar teams did not fare well. In the  double-handed (two-persons in a boat) competition, Newport Harbor finished 11th  and Corona del Mar 12th in a field of 20 teams. In the single-handed (one  person) competition, I skippered the Corona del Mar boat to a 32nd-place finish  in a field of 34.  </P> <P> "We were expecting to do a lot better, but it just didn't come together in the  end," said Sutherland, who skippered the first Corona del Mar boat, which had  senior Chris Attencio as the crew and sophomore Keith Geffen as back-up crew.  The second Corona del Mar boat was skippered by sophomore Bill Ward, with  sophomore Josh Nichols as his crew.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor's first boat was skippered by junior Jory Twist, with freshman  Creighton Oyler serving as his crew and Chris Johnston as back-up crew.  Sophomore Ben Benjamin skippered the second boat, with sophomore Christina  Allen, the only female member of either team, as his crew.  </P> <P> Over the years, Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor appear to have had two of the  most successful sailing records on the West Coast. Tina McKinley, a youth  racing coordinator for the U.S. Yacht Racing Assn., attributes their success to  "the culmination of a consistent coach who brought the teams into varsity  status and parental support."  </P> <P> The success can also be attributed, at least partially, to the teams' combined  practices, where the more people sailing helps to make the competition stiffer.  </P> <P> And even if the sailors are from rival schools, there's enough camaraderie to  keep the sails full.  </P></p>

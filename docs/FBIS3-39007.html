			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnston: "Tory Euro-Divide Highlighted </F> by Clarke and Tebbit"]    [Text] Tory divisions over Europe were on display again  last night, threatening efforts to forge a united front ahead of  June's elections to the European parliament.    Lord Tebbit, the former Cabinet Minister, belatedly marked  the fifth anniversary of Lady Thatcher's Bruges Speech in  September 1988, with a robust repudiation of closer ties in the  EC.    But Mr Clarke, Chancellor, painted a much more positive  picture of Britain's future inside what he preferred to call the  European Union in an address to economists in Paris.    Lord Tebbit, whose hostility to the Maastricht Treaty has  not  abated -- he equated the measure last night with the retreat  from Dunkirk -- said he believed the tide of affairs was flowing  once again in favour of the nation state rather than a grand  European design.    "It is notable that some of the states which mouth the  slogans of federalism and centralism in accents most exquisitely  communitaire are now pursuing -- even if it involves cheating  and breaking the law of the European Community -- policies of  naked self-interest," he said. "On that basis the day of the  nation state is far from over."    Lord Tebbit, speaking at the Reform Club in London, said  that  before Europe could move to economic and monetary union -- the  precursors of political union -- there would need to be a single  language, something unacceptable to individual member states.    "Until Europe enforces a single language policy, we  Euro-sceptics know that our views will be proved correct and  attempts at union will fail," he added.    Lord Tebbit also called for overdue reforms of the Common  Agricultural Policy [CAP]. "It is really time there was a sense  of outrage against the unmitigated wickedness of the CAP," he  said.    In Paris, Mr Clarke -- speaking in French -- said Britain's  growth prospects were intimately connected with Europe's and  linked to the economic aims contained in the Maastricht Treaty.    However, he took the opportunity to swipe at moves to force  Britain to subscribe to social and employment policies that he  felt would hinder competitiveness.    Mr Clarke, a Euro-enthusiast, voiced the concern of senior  ministers that developments such as the social chapter -- from  which Britain has opted out -- will play into the hands of the  freer market economies of the Far East.    But his message was essentially one of moving forward, in  contrast to Lord Tebbit's belief that the existing structure  would begin to unravel.    Mr Clarke said: "As fellow members of the European Union, we  share a common commitment. We now have to help ensure that the  Union is pointing in the right direction. It must tackle its  deep- seated problems of competitiveness, recession and  unemployment. We can only do that by allowing private  enterprise and markets to realise more of their potential."    The Liberal Democrats launched their campaign for the  European elections yesterday with a claim to be the only party  with a positive approach to closer ties in the EC, writes  Phillip Johnston.    Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said: "We are the only party  that has been consistently and unashamedly pro-European and we  are proud of our record. Our task is to show that Britain needs  to take a lead in making Europe work for people."    Mr Ashdown called for a common security policy and military  command for unified action in crises such as Bosnia.    The party also wants:    Action on jobs via a European recovery programme;    Better exploitation of EC regional fund assistance;    Stricter Green standards;    Gradual steps to one currency;    A stronger European parliament.    The Liberal Democrats are confident of gaining between three  and nine MEPs [Members of European Parliament] -- their first.</p>

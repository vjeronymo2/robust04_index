			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A guide to going public - In a Nutshell The stock market flotation has returned to favour as a means of raising funds for growth. Many recent flotations have involved companies, many of them management buy-outs, backed by the venture capital industry. Venture capitalists would once have regarded a trade sale to a larger business as the natural 'exit' route from their investments. But fresh enthusiasm for new issues on the part of institutional investors has meant a flotation can result in a better price for the business. The revised edition of Going Public, a guide* to a London stock market listing by merchant bankers Samuel Montagu explains the methods, timetable and likely cost of such a move. A glossary explains the mysteries of clawbacks, red herrings and the yellow book. From Jeremy Prescott, Samuel Montagu, 10 Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6AE. Tel. 071 260 9000. Free.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE WON'T DANCE, TOP CANDIDATES SAY OF FUNDING SHUFFLE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: BALLOT INITIATIVES WILL NOT BE USED TO GET AROUND CAMPAIGN SPENDING  LAWS, VAN DE KAMP AND WILSON VOW. BUT SUSPICION REFUSES TO DIE.  </P> <P> Two leading candidates for governor are taking the pledge -- the pledge not to  try to waltz their way around California's new and confusing campaign spending  laws.  </P> <P> This curious phenomenon arises because of the intertwining of campaigns for  high office and campaigns for ballot initiatives during this upcoming election  cycle. Both Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen.  Pete Wilson have chosen to link their 1990 campaigns for governor with  grass-roots ballot proposals. Other candidates are contemplating coming forth  with their own ballot measures.  </P> <P> Under California law enacted by voters in 1988, candidates for office are under  strict financial limits. They can receive no more than $1,000 per contributor  per year, meaning an end to easy financing from fat-cat donors. Candidates are  instead forced into desperate searches for lots of friends with $1,000 to  spare.  </P> <P> The fat-cat still has a happy home, however, in supporting ballot initiatives.  There are no contribution limits for such propositions. And with old-fashioned  ballot favorites like crime, corruption and the environment leading the agenda  of proposals, money is bound to flow in large chunks, meaning large advertising  campaigns.  </P> <P> So the question is: Does Wilson or Van de Kamp intend to appear in television  or direct mail advertising paid for by the ballot initiative campaigns, thereby  supplementing his own limited advertising budget? Or more simply, are ballot  initiatives really a shortcut around spending limits?  </P> <P> No, both Van de Kamp and Wilson now insist.  </P> <P> The two said they fully intend to pay for their own commercials to link  themselves in the public eye with their pet proposals -- but only using money  they have collected under the $1,000 per contribution limit.  </P> <P> And this week, as they have before, they separately pledged not to appear in  advertisements -- broadcast or printed -- paid for from the treasuries of  ballot propositions they are pushing. Another major Democratic candidate for  governor, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, has resisted the  temptation to work up her own catchy initiative and is not part of the  controversy.  </P> <P> "Utter nonsense," said Van de Kamp about the continued suspicion that he would  somehow use the initiatives to finance his own campaign. "I'll be putting much  more into these campaigns than I'll ever get out of them in terms of television  broadcasting or the rest."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp is a sponsor of three initiatives -- one on legislative ethics,  another on crime and drugs, and a third on environmental preservation.  </P> <P> Said Wilson about his one ballot proposal to speed up criminal trials: "The  initiative will not pay for any spots in which I appear, not ads in print,  radio or on television."  </P> <P> This did not end the controversy, however.  </P> <P> Wilson indicated Wednesday that he remains skeptical of Van de Kamp's pledge.  He cited a letter from a Sacramento law firm to the California Fair Political  Practices Commission, seeking clarification of the issue. The letter, on behalf  of an unnamed candidate, asked specifically whether someone seeking office  could appear in ads for an initiative outside of the spending limit.  </P> <P> "So far there is only one candidate pushing ballot initiatives for the 1990  campaign," said Wilson.  </P> <P> Actually, Wilson turned out to be mistaken. The inquiry was not made on behalf  of Van de Kamp, but for Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is considering whether to  sponsor a 1990 ballot initiative and wanted clarification of the rules.  </P> <P> So far, the commission has declined to make a clear-cut ruling on the issue. It  rejected the McCarthy letter because of its policy to refuse anonymous inquiry.  </P> <P> "I don't think the rules are strict enough. And I don't know what the  commission can do," said Chairman John Larson.  </P> <P> "Speaking for me, and probably all the commissioners, I think there should be  restrictions on candidates appearing on television (advertisements) in  connection with ballot propositions. I would hope that we can reach that  conclusion. That would be the appropriate conclusion," he said.  </P> <P> The stakes for candidates are easy enough to fathom. Wilson has set a campaign  budget of about $16 million for his campaign, Van de Kamp $10 million. Most of  that money will end up in advertising. A few million more in advertising, tied  to a ballot proposition campaign, could add substantially to a candidate's  crucial exposure late in a campaign.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said the whole issue is overblown because the intention of voters  is clear. They want candidates limited in receiving contributions. And, he  said, the precedents of the Fair Political Practices Commission are  unmistakable: Initiatives will not be allowed to serve as a way around campaign  finance limits.  </P> <P> Wilson remained unpersuaded. "This is a very serious potential problem. There  is a very large and unintended loophole," he said.  </P></p>

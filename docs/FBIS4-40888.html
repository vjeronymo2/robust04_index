			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko: "An Important </F> Step Toward Europe"]    [Text] Having signed an agreement on partnership and  cooperation in Luxembourg on 14 June, the Ukrainian president  opened a new page in relations between Ukraine and the 12-member  European Union [EU].    The path traveled by the EU and Ukraine to meet each  other during the year-long negotiating process was not easy.  There were both points of mutual understanding and seemingly  insurmountable -- at first glance -- obstacles; however, victory  was achieved by the joint desire of both sides to establish  legal foundations for Ukraine's joining European processes.    In one fell swoop, Ukraine has ceased to be a subject of  international relations in spite of its own will. With regard  to the official membership of the former Ukrainian SSR to the  United Nations and other organizations with their headquarters  in Europe, this did not make Ukraine a full-fledged participant  in the European community of nations. This is why the joining  of European economic and political structures is a logical and  necessary direction in Ukraine's foreign policy at the current  stage.    Ukraine ranks fifth in Europe in terms of population and  first in terms of area. It is not a reason for pride or some  pretensions, but this fact cannot be disregarded, either.  Europe, too, has many key positions in Ukraine: transit  highways, reserves of raw materials, and ten of millions of  qualified producers and perspective consumers; or, quite the  opposite -- a potential hotbed of instability if the ark of  Ukrainian statehood goes to pieces. Therefore, many things  depend on how Western states approach our country.    The EU, in this context, plays a leading part. The  development of multifarious cooperation between Ukraine and the  EU is a path toward the gradual integration of the Ukrainian  economy into the European economic zone and the establishment of  broad economic ties with leading European countries, without  loosing traditional ties within the CIS framework.    In 1993-94, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, with the  participation of a number of branch ministries and departments,  held four rounds of official talks with the European Commission  on the concluding of a framework agreement on partnership and  cooperation. The Ukrainian side raised the question of  broadening the framework of cooperation, which was fixed in a  draft agreement proposed by the European Commission, to the  level of conditions stipulated by appropriate agreement on  associate membership, in particular, with Poland, Hungary, and  other East European countries.    This is the first agreement on cooperation to be concluded  with a republic of the former USSR. This agreement provides a  reliable and large-scaled basis for the development and  expansion of political and economic relations between the EU and  Ukraine, and is another piece of evidence supporting democratic  processes in independent Ukraine, as well as of the significance  assigned to Ukraine's political and economic reforms by the EU.    This document underscores the importance of democratic  values, respect for human rights, and dedication to the  principles of market economy, and treats them as an important  element of partnership between the EU and Ukraine. The sides  also believe that the development and strengthening of regional  cooperation, as well as the support of Ukraine's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity, are important  prerequisites for the future prosperity and stability in Central  and East Europe, as well as on the European continent as a whole.    The foundations were also built for full-fledged and  mutually  beneficial cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the wide  realm of political, economic, and humanitarian questions; in the  immediate future, it will be possible for Ukraine to obtain  political support and economic assistance in its efforts to  democratize social life and reform the economy according to  market principles.    The political part of the agreement confirms the importance  and necessity of the contribution made by both sides toward the  consolidation of a new democratic Europe, as well as the  development of political and economic process on the European  continent.    It is a matter of principle to introduce permanent political  dialogue and a system of regular consultations on all levels and  in the entire network of political, economic, and other issues  of mutual interests.    In the economic part of the document, the EU notes the  important character of Ukraine's efforts to transform itself  from a state monopoly over trade and system of centralized state  management of the economy to a system based on market  principles; the EU also expresses the need to render permanent  assistance to our country in this direction.    The sides agreed that mutual trade will be liberalized  according to GATT principles, while taking into account  amendments that were introduced during the recent Uruguay round  of negotiations. The EU will lift its restrictions on trade  with Ukraine with the exception of so-called "sensitive" goods,  including steel, coal, textiles, agricultural products, and  nuclear materials. Trade in these branches will be regulated by  special agreements, which are already prepared, or are being  prepared, on the basis of quotas established for Ukraine.    On the other hand, Ukraine also has the possibility to  introduce certain quantitative limitations in new branches of  industry and in those branches which are subject to  restructuring. However, it should be noted that these  limitations may be operational in the transitional period, prior  to 31 December 1998, or prior to the joining of GATT by Ukraine  if this joining takes place earlier.    It is a well-known fact that our country attaches special  importance to the issue of antidumping procedures in the sphere  of expanding economic cooperation with the EU "12." Provisions  of the economic part of the agreement testify to the positive  stance of EU countries with regard to the solution of this  problem. In particular, this concerns the possibility of a  constructive and flexible mechanism for examining antidumping  issues through consultations.    As market reforms in Ukraine proceed, the sides will revise  the provisions of certain chapters, in particular, those on  trade to create a free trade zone between the EU and Ukraine.  Therefore, the last year of the transitional period, that is,  1998, will see the outset of consultations on the beginning of a  negotiating process to create a zone which can become an  intermediate link toward the full membership of our country in  the EU.    Even today we may speak about positive results in the  relations between Ukraine and the EU. The EU Council of  Ministers session, which preceded the signing of the agreement,  was also devoted to the discussion of assistance to Ukraine, in  particular, the financing of compensation capacities at the  Rivne, Khmelnytskyy, and Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plants,  which would be able to solve the problems of energy deliveries  in the event of Chernobyl's shutdown.    Regarding the idea of Ukraine's future associate membership  in the EU, it should be noted that the implementation of this  idea is quite realistic. It is difficult to predict for the  time being how far-reaching and strategic will be the  consequences of the relations which are just beginning to take  shape on a permanent and legal basis. First, this will depend  to a great extent on the steadfastness and tempo of democratic  processes and, which is especially important, of economic  reforms in Ukraine. Second, this will also depend on the  meeting of obligations which were made by both sides under the  agreement.    The signing of this historic document opens the door for our  future membership in the European area, but it does not  guarantee that we will join this area. It is up to us whether  we will be able to use this opportunity. It depends on how  proficient we are in resolving problems, safeguarding the  implementation of economic reforms, transforming and  demilitarizing the economy, implementing large-scale  privatization, and stabilizing credit and monetary sphere.    It is quite within the scope of our powers to do this.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S BURT SEEKS COACHING POSITION AT NEW MEXICO ST.  </P> <P> Bob Burt, football coach at Cal State Northridge, is among those being  considered for the vacant job at New Mexico State.  </P> <P> Steve Shutt, assistant athletic director at New Mexico State, said that the  school has had "some correspondence" with Burt but that no interview has been  scheduled.  </P> <P> Burt, whose four-year record at Northridge is 27-17, confirmed that he had  applied for the job but had no further comment.  </P> <P> New Mexico State has dropped 17 consecutive games, the longest losing streak in  Division I-A football.  </P> <P> Mike Knoll, who was fired Nov. 19, had a 4-40 record in four seasons as coach  of the Aggies. New Mexico State was 0-11 the past season, its first winless  season in 35 years.  </P> <P> Burt, 48, has not had a losing season since coming to Northridge in 1986. CSUN  has been playing football for 28 years and no other Matador coach has had more  than two winning seasons in a row.  </P> <P> Jack Elway, who went on to coach at San Jose State and Stanford, came the  closest. Elway had winning seasons in 1976 and 1977 and a 5-5 record in 1978,  his final season at CSUN.  </P> <P> Northridge was 6-5 overall and finished in a second-place tie with Southern  Utah State in the Western Football Conference.  </P> <P> Although CSUN needed wins in its final two games to escape with a winning  record, the Division II Matadors raised eyebrows by almost upsetting Cal State  Fullerton in their second game of the season.  </P> <P> Northridge lost, 27-20, but only after a Fullerton interception in the end zone  foiled a last-minute drive.  </P> <P> Fullerton finished at 6-4-1 and went 5-2 in the Division I Big West Conference  to end up in a second-place tie with San Jose State. The Titans defeated New  Mexico State, 45-10, in a Big West game at Fullerton on Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Burt is familiar with the New Mexico State program, having coached against the  Aggies during his six years as Fullerton's defensive coordinator.  </P> <P> In addition, the Burt family has deep historical ties with New Mexico. In 1944,  Burt's grandparents, Robert and Edna Peterson, ran against each other for  governor of the state. The only other person on the ballot won.  </P> <P> Sources in New Mexico State's athletic department hinted that Burt, who was  born in Albuquerque, N. M., might be interviewed for the position sometime next  week.  </P> <P> Denny Stolz, formerly coach at San Diego State, is reportedly New Mexico  State's top candidate. Stolz, who was 16-19 with the Aztecs before being fired  last November, was interviewed by New Mexico State officials last Wednesday.  Stolz has been men's golf coach at San Diego State for the past year.  </P> <P> Jim Bradley, New Mexico State's coach from 1973-77 was interviewed Monday and  Bob O'Mera, coach at Western New Mexico, met with Aggie administrators  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bradley, who was 23-31-1 at New Mexico State, is a Las Cruces, N. M., native  who is coach at Roswell High, considered the premier high school program in New  Mexico.  </P> <P> O'Mera is 16-14-1 in three seasons at Western New Mexico, an NAIA school.  </P></p>

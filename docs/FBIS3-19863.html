			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "S.H.": "Mitterrand: Social Warning"] </F>   [Text] Francois Mitterrand yesterday rejected any solution  to unemployment in the industrialized countries which would  involve "a reduction in wages or a questioning of social  protection." The head of state, who was speaking at UNESCO  Headquarters at the opening of the Interparliamentary Union  [IPU] conference, which will be chaired by National Assembly  Speaker Philippe Seguin throughout this week, mentioned the  recent G-7 meeting on employment: "I and others in France have  worked very hard to ensure that the big countries deal with the  actual problems of their fellow citizens. That has been made  possible because a few big countries are no longer advocating  wage cuts or questioning social protection as a remedy for  unemployment, although many countries still are tempted to do  so."  <H5>  Preventing Conflicts </H5>   Stressing the need to create "good, real jobs," Francois  Mitterrand said that although, "strong growth remains vital," it  is also necessary "to exploit new ways of creating jobs through  the development of research, technology, education, training  throughout life, and a new organization of work. There will  only be lasting progress when social clauses are included in  international agreements," the president of the Republic  concluded. The head of state also defended the cause of the  United Nations, which he thinks is the "perfect framework" for  preventing conflicts. "This organization is irreplaceable for  consolidating peace," he said.    Philippe Seguin, for his part, argued in favor of  parliaments, which "have emerged as the main protagonists of  modernity since the 18th century (...). According to the  National Assembly speaker, far from demonstrating that national  parliaments are outdated, the new big world issues --  environmental protection, development aid, the organization of  exchanges of products and capital, the fight against criminal  networks -- emphasize the need for their determined involvement  in international affairs." He added that "democracy cannot be  decreed or improvised; it is the fruit of a patient  apprenticeship to which we must contribute." This remark is in  line with the concerns of the Interparliamentary Union which  intends to draw up in Paris this week, for the first time, a  "resolution" concerning the conduct of free and democratic  elections in the world.    Senate Speaker Rene Monory said, along the same lines, that  "parliaments have an important role to play in international  relations," adding that "no culture, no civilization can escape  the citizens' legitimate demand to participate in the major  political decisions through elections by universal suffrage and  institutions which respect human rights."</p>

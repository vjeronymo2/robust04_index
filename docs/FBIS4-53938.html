			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly Foreign Affairs and  Unification Committee held a plenary meeting today with the  presence of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of  the National Unification Board [NUB], for an interpellation  after being briefed on the North Korean nuclear issue and the  policy regarding North Korea.    During today's meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku  said  in his report that North Korea is showing an intention to link  the nuclear fuel rods replacement with the third-round talks  with the United States, and that the government will further  strengthen the cooperation system with the United States prior  to the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-ku said that North Korea is  trying to make a political issue out of the defection of loggers  from Siberia saying that they were kidnapped, and that if this  becomes excessive, the government will take head-on measures,  including taking issue of North Korea's human rights.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi added that the government has  established a policy to accept all those who wish to defect in  the future to the extent that does not agitate a third country.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku reported that inter-Korean  trade has been allowed even in the situation that the  North-South relations are blocked due to the North Korean  nuclear issue, and that this year's inter-Korean trade as of  April showed approximately a $7-million increase over the same  period last year at $65 million. However, Deputy Prime Minister  Yi said North-South economic cooperation, including ROK  businessmen's visit to North Korea, will not be allowed until  the nuclear issue turns to a positive direction.    During the morning session of the Foreign Affairs and  Unification Committee meeting, the ruling and opposition parties  once had disagreement over the demand for information concerning  Chairman Kim Tae-chung's remarks made in the United States and  the method of the questions and answers.</p>

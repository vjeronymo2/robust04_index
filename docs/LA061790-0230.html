			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FARLOW CHANGES HIS MIND, HE'LL JOIN PADRES  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton shortstop Kevin Farlow, who announced last week that he  would return to school for his senior season, said he has changed his mind and  will sign with the San Diego Padres today.  </P> <P> Farlow, a 6-foot-4, 175-pound junior who was a 15th-round draft pick of the  Padres, wasn't happy with the club's original signing offer and told Fullerton  Coach Larry Cochell he would remain a Titan for one more season.  </P> <P> But after hitting with a wood bat for a week, attending the Padres' 3-1,  13-inning victory over the Dodgers Friday night, and after the organization  increased its signing offer, Farlow decided to turn pro.  </P> <P> Farlow, a former Kennedy High School of Granada Hills and USC infielder, batted  .277 with six home runs and 31 runs batted in at Fullerton this past season. He  will report Monday to the Padres' Class-A affiliate in Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> "My main question was whether I could make the transition from the aluminum bat  to the wood bat," said Farlow, who played two seasons at USC before  transferring to Fullerton. "But I hit with a wood bat for a week and it felt  pretty good."  </P> <P> Watching the Padres play the Dodgers Friday night confirmed his decision.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem like San Diego is deep as far as shortstops go," Farlow said.  "It seems like I'd have a good opportunity in that organization."  </P> <P> Farlow, who brought defensive stability to the Titan infield this season, was  named to the all-Central Regional team after playing four errorless games and  going four for 14 with two doubles. Fullerton won the regional but lost its  first two College World Series games.  </P> <P> "I wish him the best," Cochell said. "He had a great season and I'm glad we had  him for a year."  </P></p>

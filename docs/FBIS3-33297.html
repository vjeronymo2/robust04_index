The war started while the slum's samba group was  beginning to parade along Marques de Sapucai Avenue. So far,  seven people have been killed -- three of them belonged to  Manino's gang and four to his rival Polegar's gang. The  atmosphere of fear kept the Manguera Hill slum residents off  their own samba rehearsal ground. Very few of them accompanied  the vote counting on 16 February to choose the winner of the  special samba group parade.    Some armed men freely circulated around the rehearsal ground  and the neighboring alleys because there were no police  patrolling the slum. An eyewitness, whose identity is being kept  secret, testified at the 17th Police Precinct (Sao Cristovao  District) on the war's details. According to the witness,  Polegar -- who controls the part of the slum known as Chale --  planned to increase his territory as soon as the Mangueira Samba  Group began parading. He planned to invade Manino's area -- the  one known as Buraco Quente -- while everyone was attentively  watching the samba group's performance during the parade.    Early on 16 February, 20 Polegar men wearing Civil Police  jackets invaded the Buraco Quente area and killed three members  of the rival drug trafficking gang. Manino answered the attack  early the following morning, when four of Polegar's men were  found dead.</p>

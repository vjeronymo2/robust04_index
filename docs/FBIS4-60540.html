			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Moshe Shahal says that Yasir 'Arafat will  not be able to visit Jerusalem without an official Israeli  invitation, because a person fulfilling a political role cannot  visit a foreign country without an invitation.    According to Minister Shahal the incidents between Israelis  and Palestinian policemen over the last few days stem from a  lack of coordination between the Israeli authorities and the  Palestinian police. This is reported by our correspondent Dani  Gur-Arye.</p>

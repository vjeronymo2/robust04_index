			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alima Fall: "Why Bedie Is Tightening the Screws"] </F>   [Excerpts] After the "post-Houphouet" period, Cote  d'Ivoire seems to be entering the Bedie era. From late April to  early May, the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], which  the late head of state led for nearly half a century, will hold  an extraordinary congress to elect a new leader. The natural  candidate to lead the ruling party is the new president, Henri  Konan Bedie. This is first and foremost, it seems, an act of  union. In reality, the PDCI, which had so far been able to  contain its divisions, is showing them today in broad daylight.    For the first time there is a strong protest movement within  the ruling party, which has come out into the open. Djeny  Kobina's Rally of Republicans [RDR] openly defies the  leadership, particularly its secretary general, Laurent  Dona-Fologo, the minister of state in charge of national  integration, one of the new government's strongmen.    Kobina and his friends do not want a head of state who is a  party leader. They have their champion: Philippe Gregoire  Yace, president of the Economic and Social Council. This man  led the PDCI for several years and knows all its intricacies.  If you know the relationship between Bedie and the president of  the Economic and Social Council, this proposal might make you  smile. In fact, the RDR pronounced itself especially in favor  of a break with what it calls "a republic of injustices." It  calls for the strict and clear management of public affairs,  which should not be made any more difficult through the  concentration of too much power.    It does not want a return to the former practices of the old  times of the Ivorian miracle. The era of cheap money is over.  It has been replaced by a devaluation, which was preceded by  economic difficulties which had already forced the government to  be more realistic.    Bedie is aware of the fact that he must hurry. He only has  18 months until the October 1995 presidential election, 18  months to move from the legality obtained by virtue of Article  11 to the legitimacy that obtained from the polls. [passage  omitted]    As an administrator Bedie must make the country move, but as  a politician he has to win the election, which will be held  within 18 months. In this field the new president and his team  have left no stone unturned in occupying all the pillars of  power, beginning with the media. Those which depend on the  state have already put on new feathers. Ali Coulibaly and  Yacouba Kebe have been relieved of their posts -- Coulibaly from  Channel I of the National Television Network and Kebe from the  FRATERNITE MATIN newspaper chain. The opposition press has not  been spared either. Many of its more renowned writers are  currently in prison. State television has regained the glorious  moments it enjoyed under the one-party system. [passage omitted]    The PDCI's extraordinary congress has given the president  the  opportunity to draw up "his friends" into the ranks. He does  not want to lose sight of the party. He must, by any means,  control it. This is one of his major war machines for the  forthcoming election. In Bedie's entourage, it is commonly  explained that:    "We have a new president. We need to make him known and  loved by the people. We are not going to give out power as a  gift to those who are fighting us. Our opponents must fight  legitimately to win. The congress is a good platform. It will  be open and democratic. [passage omitted]    The old political organization which he inherited is full of  currents and divisions, whose origin is not just limited to the  Bedie-Ouattara rivalry. Long before the violent demonstrations  in March and April of 1990, and before the appointment of  Alassane Ouattara as prime minister, the PDCI was already  showing signs of internal strife. [passage omitted]    It is up to the congressional delegates -- some 3,000 of  them  -- to play firemen, in order to enable Bedie to get a firm grip  on the party and to use it as a weapon, especially against any  eventual Gbagbo-Yace-Ouattara alliance, which some Ivorians are  anxiously hoping for.</p>

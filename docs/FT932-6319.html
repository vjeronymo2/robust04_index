			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT votes to open grain markets one hour earlier REVERSING a 108-year tradition, members of the Chicago Board of Trade have voted to open their agricultural futures and options contracts one hour earlier in the hope of gaining more European business. While the exchange's busy financial futures trading floor has undergone several changes in its trading day over the last decade - including the introduction of a night bond session - its 3 hour and 45 minute grain trading session has been sacrosanct. CBoT traders have opened their grain markets at 0930 CDT and closed them at 1315 CDT since 1885. Now, as the EC institutes its CAP reforms and European cereals prices are expected to become more volatile, the CBoT wants to have its pits open earlier in the European day. The move, exchange leaders contend, will ward off budding competition in agricultural derivatives from London's Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) and France's Matif. One day before the vote, CBoT traders had said it was too close to call. However, the proposal passed with a relatively wide margin, 583 votes to 347. Plans for a 0830 CDT opening must now be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CBoT hopes to implement the earlier opening before the end of the year.</p>

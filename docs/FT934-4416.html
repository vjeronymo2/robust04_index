			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Capital Cities' share buy-back offer shunned An offer by Capital Cities/ABC, the broadcasting and publishing company, to buy back 2m of its shares has been largely shunned by shareholders other than Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Mr Warren Buffett. Capital Cities, which announced a 'Dutch auction' tender offer for the shares on November 1, said yesterday that only 1.1m shares had been tendered, and 1m of these came from Berkshire Hathaway. The low take-up suggests many investors expect the group's shares to be valued at more than Dollars 630 a share, which was the upper purchase price limit set by Capital Cities in the Dutch auction. The stock stood unchanged at Dollars 637 1/2 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Under a Dutch auction, a company sets a range of prices at which it is willing to buy stock and investors specify a price at which they are willing to sell. The company then computes the lowest price at which it would be able to buy the block of stock and pays that sum to holders who offered to sell at or below that price. Capital Cities noted that since fewer than 2m shares had been tendered, it would buy all shares tendered by Berkshire Hathaway at Dollars 630 a share. The purchase will leave Berkshire with 2m shares, or about 13 per cent of the outstanding stock, down from 18 per cent. Mr Buffett has a seat on the Capital Cities board. An unusual feature of the tender was an agreement by Capital Cities that it would accept either all or none of the 1m Berkshire Hathaway shares tendered in the offer - a condition that could have left Mr Buffet with a 21 per cent stake in the business. Capital Cities decided a buy-back was the most attractive use of Dollars 1.2bn of surplus cash, since acquisitions were not available at attractive prices.</p>

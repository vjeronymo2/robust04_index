			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Fiasco over pensions casts long shadow - London Never mind the sleaze allegations that have engulfed Westminster: the scandal which gave the City much greater pause for thought this week was the extent of the pensions fiasco. It was always expected that the report of the Securities and Investments Board into the mis-selling of personal pension would make unhappy reading for the personal finance industry. However, it still came as unpleasant news to learn the scale of poor advice was far greater than had been thought - and that the compensation bill could reach Pounds 2bn. Life insurers must review hundreds of thousands of personal pensions and compensate those investors who were wrongly advised to buy them. Since 1988, some 600,000 personal pensions have been sold to people transferring lump sums from occupational schemes. Separately, a survey by the SIB's actuaries estimated that in more than 850,000 cases, people were advised to opt out of employers' schemes or not to join. The shares of the quoted insurance companies held up fairly well, because they have already made substantial provision for potential compensation. However, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, gave an inkling of the damage to investors' confidence when it revealed that sales of single-premium individual pensions in the first nine months of the year had fallen by 30 per cent. Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, did nothing to alleviate these gloomy thoughts when he warned a conference of personnel managers that Britain's financial services industry was facing an upheaval on the scale that had previously been experienced by manufacturing. Sir Brian said that although about 160,000 jobs had already been lost in financial services in the past five years, the competitive environment was going to get tougher still. For most of the week, there was little offsetting cheer from the stock market, which continues to be in thrall to fluctuating sentiment in the bond and currency markets. The FT-SE 100 went down 28 points on Tuesday, up 30 points on Thursday, and scarcely moved on Monday and Thursday. Even yesterday's 54-point gain mainly reflected relief that the US third-quarter growth figures had been well received in the bond markets, and was achieved in thin turnover. Volatility in the stock market is being increased by the low level of trading in London, which the chart illustrates. Edmond Warner, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson, points out that equity bargains currently number about 25,000 a day, almost 10,000 below the average of the past two years. Over this period activity was only as thin in the Christmas season and in early July this year - just after the market hit its 1994 low. Warner says: 'Meagre turnover is not in itself negative - apart perhaps for stockbrokers' sanity - but does reflect the prevailing uncertainty in the market. However, it also indicates the growing risk that equity prices will shift dramatically. Either current nervousness will transfer into outright institutional selling, or market makers will find their trading books unprepared for a resurgence of buying interest.' The Confederation of British Industry's latest quarterly survey of industrial trends showed on Tuesday that UK manufacturers were enjoying an export boom, but were also planning to increase prices in the face of rising costs. The survey said more manufacturers were planning to increase domestic prices over the next four months than at any time since January, 1991. The survey said that the pattern of price rises was mixed, with some industries still reporting declines. It added that manufacturers' expectations for higher prices did not always translate into reality. The CBI survey's findings on price expectations were one of the factors cited by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, when they increased base rates last month. However, on Thursday George said financial markets, both in the UK and overseas, were exaggerating the inflationary threat, and the likely interest rate rises needed to combat it. Analysts surmised that the Bank's quarterly inflation report, to be released on Tuesday next week, was unlikely to contain any surprises about inflation pressures in the economy. Meanwhile, shares in the electricity sector rose after East Midlands Electricity said it would give Pounds 186m back to its shareholders in a special interim dividend payment. The pay-out brings to nearly Pounds 1bn the amount returned to shareholders by privatised electricity companies this year. Imperial Chemical Industries confirmed that the chemicals industry was recovering strongly with third-quarter figures that showed operating profits more than doubling in some divisions. But it warned that while prices for many of its goods were rising, those nearer the consumer - such as paints - remained very competitive. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said demand in most markets looked 'more promising than for some time. Activity in the US, UK and Australian markets remains generally firm. Recovery in continental Europe appears to be under way and even the Japanese economy seems to have bottomed. Robust growth in the rest of the Far East continues.' One domestic factor which encouraged yesterday's surge by the FT-SE 100 was GEC's decision to top British Aerospace's agreed bid for VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker. This may or may not be the start of the final showdown between GEC and BAe over which group will dominate the rump of the British defence industry. But watching a contested takeover makes a pleasant break for traders from fretting about the global bonds market.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour Pounds 20bn plan angers Tories - Public spending LABOUR'S plan to inject Pounds 20bn into spending on key public services over the lifetime of a parliament was yesterday attacked by the Conservatives as a precursor to a 'disastrous' combination of extra taxes and extra borrowing. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, signalled that the spending pledge, made earlier this week by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, would be a key target in the Conservatives' offensive over coming weeks. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, joined the attack with a demand that labour spell out exactly the assumptions on which it was based. The pledge came under attack in the Commons as the prime minister, retaliating to Labour taunts over health service reforms, described Labour's plans as 'sheer wish fantasy'. 'The extra Pounds 20bn of public spending that Labour promises, is spending they could never deliver out of growth they have never previously produced, when they have been in government,' said Mr Major. He warned that new taxes under Labour would hit some teachers, policemen, junior doctors, registrars and senior house officers who could not be described as 'rich'. 'In London and the South East, Pounds 20,000 was less than the average white-collar wage last year and will certainly be substantially less this year,' said Mr Major. Mr Mellor also echoed Mr Major in singling out Labour's commitment to raise the ceiling on National Insurance Contributions as a serious threat to the living standards of those on middle incomes. He said the government was already committed to add Pounds 25bn to public spending between 1992 and 1994. That meant either Mr Kinnock had deliberately 'underbid' the Conservatives or the Pounds 20bn he had mentioned was in addition to the government's plans. Mr Kinnock wrote to the prime minister last night saying the annual growth rate under the Labour government of 1974-79 had averaged 2.0 per cent. In the last 12 years of Conservative government it had averaged 1.75 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interviews with NPC deputies and CPPCC members by </F> correspondents Bao Jinghao and Fu Yongchang in Beijing -- date  not given; from the "Special Program on NPC-CPPCC Sessions"]    [Excerpts] Listeners and friends, in his government work  report delivered to the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] on 10 March, Premier Li Peng said 1994  is an important year for China to push forward its reform. In  the new year, China will continue to deepen reform and open  wider to the outside world. He also stressed that it is  necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control. [passage omitted]    The state policy on macroeconomic regulation and control was  drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council  and is enforced jointly by them. However, it is different from  the planned management of the past. It does not contradict the  state's introduction of the socialist market economy.  Commenting on this, NPC Deputy Shen Daren, who is also chairman  of Jiangsu People's Congress Standing Committee, said:    [Begin recording] [Shen] Macroeconomic regulation and  control... [recording fades into announcer-read passage]    Deputy Shen Daren held: A market economy is not a free  economy in which one can do whatever one wishes. Not only is it  restricted by law, but it is also subject to interference by the  administrative means of the state. Experiences, both positive  and negative, in economic development over the past decade show  that it is impossible for localities to develop their economies  successfully if the overall economy is not well developed or not  enlivened, and if the economic relations between the center and  localities are not straightened out. If localities only take  into account their special interests to the exclusion of the  overall interests, and if they ignore the damage done to the  overall interests, there is no way they can preserve their  special interests. In past few years some localities have, more  of less, vied with one another in seeking higher growth rates,  undertaking new construction projects, and recklessly trying to  increase output. Problems of the localities need to be  addressed. Only by solving these problems can we guarantee a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy. [end recording] [passage omitted]    NPC Deputy Shuai Liguo, mayor of Guangxi's Beihai City, put  forward his view when he discussed the central policy on  macroeconomic regulation and control. He held that  macroeconomic regulation and control present opportunities for  localities.    Deputy Shuai Liguo said: [Begin recording] [Shuai] The  introduction of macroeconomic regulation and control by the  state is aimed mainly at achieving a balance between total  supply and total demand in the economy and solving the problem  of irrational economic structure. Under macroeconomic  regulation and control, we can strengthen weak links in the  local economies, readjust their structures, and remove  bottlenecks restricting the development of local economies. In  addition, during the period of macroeconomic regulation and  control, we can strengthen the construction of urban  infrastructural facilities and improve the "hard" investment  environment. We can also strengthen local economic management,  rectify the economic order, expand the scope of reform,  accelerate the pace of transforming the operating mechanisms of  enterprises, and heighten their economic performance. We can  concentrate on improving the "soft" investment environment in  order to lay the foundation for economic development. A  rational structure in the national and local economies will,  doubtless, play a role in boosting economic development.  Therefore, macroeconomic regulation and control, in a positive  sense, also provide an opportunity for localities to develop  their economies. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disposals limit Fisons' decline - Continued withdrawal of products in US behind 24% fall to Pounds 124m FISONS, the scientific instruments and drugs group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 down 24 per cent from Pounds 162.6m to Pounds 123.6m. The shares fell 7p to 222p. The results, which suffered from the continued withdrawal of two pharmaceuticals products in the US and the impact of the recession on the scientific instruments division, would have been worse but for a Pounds 23.3m net profit from disposals. Last year there were losses on disposals of Pounds 24.6m. Trading profits fell 41 per cent from Pounds 197.4m to Pounds 117.4m, on turnover up 4 per cent from Pounds 1.24bn to Pounds 1.28bn. The figures were prepared according to FRS 3. Last year's reported pre-tax figure was Pounds 190.5m for earnings per share of 20.8p. Earnings per share fell from 17.4p to 13.9p. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 5.4p for an unchanged total of 8.7p. The pharmaceuticals division reported operating profits down 38 per cent from Pounds 113.6m to Pounds 71m on sales of Pounds 410m (Pounds 427m). The scientific equipment division's profits were halved at Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 68.4m) on sales 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 676.2m (Pounds 644.5m). The horticultural division which is being sold, generated operating profits of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11.5m) on sales of Pounds 107.8m (Pounds 96.7m). Gearing rose from 38 per cent to 67 per cent, said Mr Roy Thomas, finance director. Disposals had brought debts down from Pounds 349m to below Pounds 200m by February. Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said the pharmaceuticals division's margins had been affected by the costs of overhauling manufacturing and quality control procedures. However, most of this had been completed during the first six months, and margins during the second half had improved from 11.1 per cent to 21.8 per cent. Sales of Intal, Fisons' best-selling asthma drug fell 1.2 per cent from Pounds 192.6m to Pounds 190.3m. This, claimed Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, was entirely due to trade destocking in the US. He added that this had been planned and that worldwide prescriptions for Intal had continued to grow satisfactorily at some 13 per cent. Tilade, the group's new asthma product which will shortly be launched in the US, generated revenues up 22 per cent from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 26.1m. The German market was particularly strong with prescriptions up 22 per cent, said Mr Scroggs. He pointed out that the anti-inflammatory treatments Intal and Tilade grew 14 per cent compared with 11 per cent growth for the whole of the asthma market. Sales of Opticrom, an eye product, increased 39 per cent from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 43.7m thanks to fast growth on the European continent and in Japan. Fisons continues to develop its two key new compounds tipredane, an asthma drug, and remacemide, an epilepsy treatment. Tipredane should be ready for registration with licensing authorities by 1996, while remacemide should be ready by 1997. See Lex</p>

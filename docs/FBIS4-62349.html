			<p>BFN     [Text] Tatarstan is seeking to be the leader in Russia's  regional policy, Tatar Vice-President Vasily Likhachev told  Interfax. He said that the bilateral agreement on cooperation  with neighboring Chuvashia signed in Kazan on May 13, the first  after the signing of a treaty with Russia on division of powers,  proves this aspiration of Tatarstan.    Likhachev said that both Chuvashia and Tatarstan thus state  their serious intention to continue the process of internal  reform in Russia "according to the will of peoples and from  inside." He noted that "although it is a bilateral agreement,  there is the third party -- Russia."    According to Likhachev, the document signed in Kazan for the  first time raises the problem of ensuring human rights  regardless of nationality. Besides, the text includes an  article taken from the practice of inter-government relations,  i.e. the commitment of the sides to refrain from actions  inflicting political, economic, ecological damage, etc. To each  other." [quotation marks as received]    The Tatar-Chuvash agreement is unique because it enables the  republic to grant legal aid to Tatar prisoners serving terms in  Chuvashia, Likhachev added. He explained that under the treaty  with the Russian Federation the Tatar president was given the  right to mercy.</p>

Golboddin  Hekmatyar, has intensified the last week launched diplomatic  offensive against president Prof Borhanoddin Rabbani and his  close associate commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud.    A four-member delegation of the Supreme Coordination Council  arrived in Islamabad last week to meet the foreign minister and  other concerned officials. The Council consists of Hezb-e  Eslami, Junbish-e Milli, Hezb-e Wahdat and Afghan National  Liberation Front.    The delegation members were Abdol Hadi Arghandiwal,  Hashmatollah Mujadadi, Dr Talib and Abdol Samad. During their  meeting with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali, the delegation  maintained that fighting in Kabul would continue until President  Rabbani resigned from his office to pave the way for  establishment of a broadbased interim government in the Afghan  capital of Kabul. They said Golboddin Hekmatyar was also  willing to resign from the office of prime minister. The  Council is also demanding holding of general elections in the  country within six months to elect the future government of  Afghanistan. The setting up of a national army is also one of  the Council's demands which links its four-point plan to  restoration of peace in Afghanistan.    The Council is also ready to surrender all of their arms to  the Ministry of Defence of the new government.    A reliable source told THE FRONTIER POST on Saturday that  the  delegation would also be visiting Iran and Saudi Arabia soon to  win diplomatic support of these two countries to their peace  plan.</p>

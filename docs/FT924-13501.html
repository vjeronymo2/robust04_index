			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Medeva announces decision to leave generic drugs market MEDEVA yesterday announced that it is withdrawing from distribution of most of its basic generic products; the lossmaking business that has hindered the growing pharmaceuticals group. Medeva is taking a significant loss on yesterday's Pounds 23.5m disposal. It is selling its generics stock for Pounds 11.5m to Norton Healthcare, a subsidiary of Ivax Corp of the US. It will receive Pounds 12m for a 29-acre site in Horsham, Sussex, and Medeva's manufacturing operation and leasehold premises at Bradford. The disposed businesses had a turnover of about Dollars 53m (Pounds 30.8m), according to Ivax. It also said that it is to issue 16m new Medeva shares - representing an 8 per cent increase in capital - to buy Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, a US developer and manufacturer of therapeutic drugs delivered through metered-dose inhalers. The purchase values Armstrong at about Dollars 54m. Mr David Lees, finance director, said the acquisition would dilute 1993 earnings unless US Food and Drug Administration approvals were obtained for Albuterol, a generic equivalent of Glaxo's Ventolin, which is used for the control of asthma. The sale of almost all of its generics business ends Medeva's costly blunder of entering the competitive generics market. When Evans Healthcare was acquired by Medeva in January 1990 for Pounds 87m, more than half of Evans' Pounds 43.7m turnover consisted of generics. Later that year, Medeva immersed itself further in generics by acquiring Thomas Kerfoot for Pounds 20m, although only Pounds 10m was paid because of the business's poor performance. Ivax's acquisition follows a series of deals by the US company to expand its marketing network and product range in Europe. In April, it spent Pounds 22m acquiring Waverley Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned UK contract manufacturing company. It follows the Dollars 73.4m acquisition two years ago of Harris Pharmaceuticals, a British generics manufacturer.</p>

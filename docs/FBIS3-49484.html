			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 4/1/1994 -- The executive  President of the (ruling) Social Democracy Party of Romania  (PDSR), Adrian Nastase, said that President Ion Iliescu's  consultations with political leaders were useful for finding the  best political solutions and formulae as a preliminary phase  towards a political pact, prior to reaching a ruling pact.    Adrian Nastase is of the opinion that the transition to the  new phase would be possible only when the political parties have  formed "a certain idea of what a parliamentary majority means."  The executive president of the PDSR also said at the press  conference of Tuesday, 4 January, that President Iliescu could  not possibly draw a new parliamentary map, because the present  one was the result of the electoral process, but that he could  endorse subsequent agreements between parties relying on the  political pact in principle which can forego a possible  discussion about the formation of a new parliamentary majority,  and, consequently, of a new government.    While reasserting the openness to dialogue with other  political parties, for a wider parliamentary support, Adrian  Nastase said that if his party fails to obtain it so, it might  consider the variant of withdrawing its confidence in the  government and of switching to the opposition ranks. The  recourse to early elections is accepted by his party, Mr. Adrian  Nastase said, only as an ultimate solution, because the chances  of having the present parliamentary representation proportions  changed are very low, as a recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for  Opinion Polling] poll shows, he said, adding that this choice  might present the risk that a low voting rate could raise doubts  as to the legitimacy of the future legislative forum of Romania.</p>

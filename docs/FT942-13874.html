			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Etam advances 28% as margins improve Etam's battle to defend margins in the face of heavy discounting last year from rival fashion retailers helped to boost annual pre-tax profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 14m. The increase was achieved on virtually flat sales of Pounds 220.3m for the year to January 29, against Pounds 220.7m last time. Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the refusal to cut prices had eroded market share in the second half. This was 'a small penalty' for increasing gross margins by one percentage point. The retail scene had been difficult in the last six months due to price competition from companies trying to 'sort themselves out', such as Burton Group, Mr Miles said. The discounting pressure had continued this year. However, there was some evidence that the most aggressive discounters were beginning to wake up to the impact on margins. Meanwhile, Etam would seek to draw in a wider base of customers by eliminating its 'cheap and cheerful image'. This would mean an extensive refurbishment and marketing programme from next year. Of the three brands, Etam had performed satisfactorily, Mr Miles said, while Tammy, the children's wear operation, had improved sales. Snob, which targets younger women, had performed below expectations. Etam's truce with Oceana, the South African Lewis family's group which made a hostile bid in 1991, was expected to bring benefits to all three brands, said Mr Miles. Etam had already gained from the presence of Mr Michael Lewis on the board; he joined when Oceana decided to back Etam's strategy for recovery. Oceana holds 36.5 per cent of Etam. 'It was good to make peace,' Mr Miles said. 'The initial indications give me great hope that the chemistry and synergy will be there.' Mr Stanley Lewis, Michael's 71 year old father, will join the board as a non-executive at the annual meeting. Earnings per share rose 32 per cent to 13.57p; the final dividend is increased to 5.75p, for a total up 9 per cent at 7.5p. COMMENT Etam's five year plan is coming through rather better than some might have expected just 12 months ago. The decision to hold prices when all about Etam were cutting furiously is paying off. Management is also getting to grips with the need to revitalise the Etam brand, while Oceana's input will bring some interesting benefits longer-term. The strategy is not without risk, however, as price pressures are not likely to disappear soon. The most immediate task will be to push up sales, without eroding margin. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 16.5m this year, making the shares - on a multiple of 16 - look more attractive than for some time.</p>

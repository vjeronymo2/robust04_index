			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A COOKED GOOSE?;  </P> <P> FAMOUS PLANE'S FATE HANGS IN BALANCE OF DISNEY DECISION ON PROJECT  </P> <P> Howard Hughes' fantastic flying machine, the Spruce Goose, seemingly has spent  its entire star-crossed career trying to recapture its one golden moment in the  sun. The question now is whether the massive seaplane, its wings clipped long  ago, can survive at all.  </P> <P> Preliminary plans unveiled last week by the Walt Disney Co. for a $2-billion  resort and theme park in Long Beach exclude the historic flying boat now housed  on the 300-acre proposed site. But the outcome remains uncertain because Disney  is undecided about the site and is still considering an alternative site in  Anaheim, near Disneyland.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, speculation about what will become of the historic flying boat,  which has been surrounded by almost as much mystery as the reclusive Hughes  himself, ranges from the mundane to the fantastic.  </P> <P> There is talk of dismembering the giant wooden bird for a trip across the  desert and reassembling it amid the glitz of Hughes' onetime hometown of Las  Vegas. Other entrepreneurs envision it as a spectacular centerpiece of a large  real estate development.  </P> <P> Some fans who want to see it kept in one piece -- and who say that moving it  out of Southern California would be like moving Hollywood to the Midwest --  favor transporting the entire plane aboard a giant ocean barge, perhaps powered  by its own propeller engines, to another port city in the region.  </P> <P> Finally, there are those who, letting their imaginations take flight, speculate  about what may appear as the simplest solution of all -- letting the old bird  fly out of Long Beach on its own power.  </P> <P> It would be only its second flight since Hughes piloted the huge airplane on  its one-minute maiden voyage in 1947, before secreting it away to a hangar.  With the end of World War II, the giant cargo plane, designed to transport  tanks and troops, already was destined to be a relic of the pre-jet-propulsion  age. When Hughes apparently finally admitted that time had passed by the grand  old flying boat, he had it put away. But he ordered the plane maintained in  flying order until a few years before his death in 1976.  </P> <P> Having lost its most loyal patron, the Spruce Goose fell on hard times. Evicted  from its home by the Port of Long Beach, which needed the land to construct an  oil tanker terminal, the homeless Goose was to be cut into pieces and scattered  across the country for display at various aviation museums. The seaplane was  saved when the management firm that took over the legendary Queen Mary for  exhibition in Long Beach offered to incorporate the Spruce Goose into the  nostalgic display.  </P> <P> More than 5 million people have visited the Spruce Goose and, no doubt, felt  dwarfed at the sight of the spectacular aircraft's Gargantuan dimensions. The  craft's wingspan is longer than a football field; its tailspan, the height of  an eight-story building.  </P> <P> Inside its aluminum dome, the flying boat appears in flight-ready condition and  rests in the middle of a reflecting pool with its huge wings tied down to the  floor with heavy metal cables, giving the impression that it might otherwise  take flight.  </P> <P> The Goose's most avid fans want the plane kept there.  </P> <P> "It's a magnificent thing and it's horrible that the possibility exists that we  will lose it," said Donald E. Madonna, director of the Museum of Flying in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "I think it should stay in Southern California. That's where Howard Hughes  built it and that's where it belongs," he said.  </P> <P> Merle Coffee, the radio operator on that day 43 years ago when Hughes  unexpectedly lifted the Goose off the water after a series of scheduled taxi  test runs, had looked forward to seeing the Goose take to the skies again.  </P> <P> But Coffee, like scores of others who worked for years carefully crafting the  giant, could not know the Goose's brief minute aloft would be its last.  </P> <P> It was heartbreaking, said Coffee, now 70, to see the flying boat put away in a  hangar for 30 years. "It was a waste of manpower," he said.  </P> <P> Among those who had led the effort to save the Goose in the late 1970s was Bill  Berry, the former director of the entire Spruce Goose project. Proposals back  then included moving it to the Salton Sea, the San Francisco Bay Area and Las  Vegas. Even actor John Travolta, an aviation buff, had expressed interest in  buying it, Berry said.  </P> <P> Berry and others opposed a plan to break the plane into pieces to move it,  which would have ruined its structural integrity. Although they determined that  flying the Goose would be impractical, Berry said it would not be impossible.  </P> <P> Berry and Coffee said they would hate to see the Spruce Goose torn apart to be  moved and reassembled elsewhere. They said that because of its unique  construction, the ship could never be put back together in the same way.  </P> <P> Others, like Nissen Davis, president of the Aero Exhibits Corp., which owns the  Spruce Goose on behalf of the Aero Club, believe that such "purist" attitudes  are a luxury the campaign to save the Goose can ill afford.  </P> <P> (In 1981, the government turned the plane over to the nonprofit Aero Club  corporation to facilitate leasing it to Wrather Corp. Wrather is the management  company that operated the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose until it sold both  leases to the Disney Co.)  </P> <P> Although "not anxious" for a move that would require the Spruce Goose to be  dismantled, Davis added that he is a "realist" and would not reject out of hand  any potentially viable proposals -- such as one from a group of investors that  has expressed interest in moving the craft to Las Vegas as the centerpiece for  an aviation-related convention center.  </P> <P> Some aviation enthusiasts and even some former Spruce Goose crew members say it  is too early to start earnestly planning the airplane's next nest.  </P> <P> Disney unveiled its master plan for the 350-acre entertainment complex just  last week and, it is generally agreed, the long and tortuous approval process  for the project could take from two to five years. The project could also fall  apart at any stage if the various entities involved -- including the city, the  California Coastal Commission and Disney -- fail to come to terms. Even if  approved, completion of the theme park could take as long as 10 years.  </P> <P> Some people are pessimistic about the Spruce Goose finding a home at all  because of the great expense and enormously difficult logistics of moving the  oversized plane. Thus, some argue that it is not too early to begin a new  effort to ensure preservation.  </P> <P> "All kinds of people are speculating and coming up with different  possibilities. It gets a lot of people's juices flowing," said Davis, of the  Aero Club.  </P> <P> "We'd love to see it stay where it is. But I have to be pragmatic," Davis  added. The plane's future home will be determined through negotiations between  the Aero Club, Disney and Hughes' Summa Corp., which still has a say in the  plane's fate, Davis said. Disney has promised to help find a suitable home for  the Spruce Goose, Davis said.  </P></p>

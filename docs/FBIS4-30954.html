			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mikhail Neykov: "Janissaries Along the </F> Vardar"]    [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  is a strange politician. As the leader of a newly established  state, he does not miss the opportunity to stress his adherence  to peace and security in the Balkans and Europe. He also did  this during his visit to Sofia. Simultaneously, he stubbornly  and selflessly defends opinions that overtly contradict the  principles of goodneighborliness and affect vitally important  interests of Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. For example, how is  it possible to declare a willingness to develop constructive  cooperation with Greece and, at the same time, to infringe upon  its cultural monuments? Is it impossible to speak about a  fruitful dialogue with Tirana, while the rights of the Albanian  minority in Macedonia, which is about 30 percent of the  country's total population, are restricted in all possible ways?    What could we say about the attitude of the government in  Skopje toward our country? It is well-known that it tries in  all possible ways to obtain recognition of the "Macedonian  nation," conceived by the Comintern, and of the "literary  language" concocted by the eminent academician Blaze Koneski.  Recently, President Gligorov prompted a scandal in Sofia by  demanding signature of the previously prepared interstate  agreements in Bulgarian and "Macedonian." Is this a real  striving toward goodneighborliness and developing broad  cooperation? He preferred to foil the signing of the documents  in order to utilize an opportunity to insult us. Naturally, his  trick failed. What remained was the bitter taste of the  behavior of the former graduate of Sofia's Kliment Okhridski  University, who got so carried away he forgot that he speaks and  understands Bulgarian.    However, an evil seldom comes alone. In his speech at the  opening of the Skopje International Fair, the same Kiro Gligorov  dared to infringe upon the holiest of the holy -- the cause of  the holy brothers St. Cyril and St. Methodius, and their first  pupil -- St. Clement. Well, we Bulgarians really are a nation,  and we are used to our lands being stolen. We will also survive  the attempts of some people in Skopje to usurp our historical  and cultural past.    The truth cannot be amended or forged. Regardless of the  pathetic attempts of pseudohistorians along the Vardar River,  they cannot convince anyone that King Samuil, for example, was  not a Bulgarian king, because his great enemy, the emperor of  Byzantium, was called Basil II -- "the Slayer of the Bulgars."  The same circles, and indeed Kiro Gligorov himself, cannot  convince the world that "Macedonia is the land on which the  Slavonic alphabet was created by the Thessaloniki brothers,"  because at the time of those brothers, there were only two  states in the Balkans -- Bulgaria and Byzantium. There simply  was no Macedonia.    Thus, if someone in Skopje is interested in  goodneighborliness, then he should reassess his behavior. We  can live without a few thousand Janissaries, who deny their kin  and mother. However, they cannot live alone.</p>

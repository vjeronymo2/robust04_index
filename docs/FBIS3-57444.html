He  believes this will be due to the government's economic policy in  November-December 1993, including decisions on subsidies to  miners, increase in wages for state sector employees and others  made with the participation of Gaydar.    "To tell the truth, he (Gaydar - IF) should have resigned in  November or December when the decisions' adoption failed to be  prevented," Shokhin told a press conference in Moscow on Monday.    He repeated that it would be necessary to repay not less  than  3 Bn rubles in the 1st quarter of this year to cover the debts  of the 4th quarter of 1993. However, in his words, the total  sum of debts is 2.5 times bigger.    According to Shokhin, this means that Gaydar and other  members of the government have "decided to avoid responsibility  for the consequences of their policy."    Moreover, according to the new economics minister,  unemployment may increase this year. Now the official number of  unemployed is about 1 million and the hidden one is about 5  million. These 5 million may become a part of the official rate  of unemployment, he emphasized.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [President Leonid Kravchuk question and answer session with </F> deputies following his speech at a session of the Supreme  Council in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] [Deputy Chernyavskyy] Deputy Chernyavskyy,  electoral district 352. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. I think  that the question is to Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, too. Isn't  there a contradiction in the fourth, fifth, and eighth points of  chapter six on chairmen of councils of the relevant level --  when they are elected by the people -- but here the issue comes  up that they are subordinate to the appropriate council.  [passage omitted] One can be elected by the people, but removed  from one's post by the president. With all due respect to the  president, well, that is, one can be removed not by those bodies  and people by whom they were elected.    [Kravchuk] I think that there should always be some kind of  mechanism. Well, for example, the question did not occur to you  that the president is elected by the people, but the Supreme  Council can remove him from his post by means of impeachment or  by submitting the issue to a referendum. Such a question has  not occurred. It did not occur. So why does the question occur  here -- one is elected by the people, but if the person violates  the Constitution, violates laws, and in that part especially  where the state delegates functions for him to carry out, then  naturally the representative body cannot remain without reacting  to these matters, and neither can the government remain aloof  from this if we truly want to create a strong and responsible  executive authority. Therefore I think that a counterbalance  should always be there, and the person should know that there is  some kind of lever forcing him either to work responsibly or he  will be removed from his post.    [Deputy Starichenko] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych.  Starichenko, Donetsk oblast. I have a question which perturbs  my electors. We are submitting the basis of the constitution  for examination and (?without) the main issue, which we have  taken away from our electors, which was in the old constitution.  That is the right of the individual to labor, to free  education, the right to free health care and so on and so forth.  The question is why the said issue has not been submitted in  this basis.    [Kravchuk] I share this point of view and the concern of  your  electors. For in our time we removed an entire 23 chapters from  the constitution then in force, and now these clauses are not in  our constitution either. That is, the present Supreme Council  has removed them from the constitution. But they were in this  constitution. But we, until now...[pauses] what is the law  called? On the fundamentals, the fundamental constitutional  principles regarding the organization of state authority and  local self-government. That is, we have taken a narrow issue,  which will be set out in the relevant chapters of the  constitution. But the Supreme Council, which will be convened,  I am convinced that it will, these chapters, and incidentally  they are in the draft constitution too, but maybe not in this  wording, but the Supreme Council will be adopting the  constitution as a whole, and these chapters will find a place  there without fail.    [Unidentified deputy] I'm sorry, but this situation --  because that which I spoke about is not here -- these clauses,  this situation could cause people simply not to come to the  electoral districts to vote. Because they want to see in the  constitution namely that which they had, and that which we want  to take away from them now.    [Kravchuk] Well, this also depends on us. If we explain to  people that everything is not determined by this law or by the  fundamental principles, then other issues have to be taken into  account too. (?We have taken) a narrow issue. But they will  certainly be in the constitution. But the Supreme Council can  adopt this too, because this is the most acute issue, and as a  rule the most acute debates occur regarding this.    [Deputy Stepenko] Stepenko, electoral district 330. Leonid  Makarovych, I have a brief question for you. Here in the second  chapter, the second sub-point, the paragraph where it says that  the Supreme Council works on a permanent basis, there is an  omission in the second version. Is this a misprint or is it  really an omission and is parliament going to work on a  nonprofessional basis? And another question. Here, well we say  that a strong presidential authority is needed. [passage  omitted] But look, the president does not appoint or sack the  Cabinet of Ministers. [passage omitted] And the last question  -- on the last page -- the issue was discussed whereby the  chairmen of oblast, rayon, and settlement councils are directly  elected by the people and head the executive authority. But the  directors of executive authority -- I am making this additional  proposal -- are elected at council sessions, that is, to exclude  personal appointments, which lead to servility and so on.    [Kravchuk] Well, first about the professional nature of  parliament. The present Supreme Council adopted a decision by  means of a law that the parliament is a professional one and it  has made an appropriate change to the constitution. It is  already in the constitution. It is already in the constitution.  We have not submitted everything. I repeat again. These are  details here. Everything that has already been decided today is  decided. As regards power and structure, we did not put it in  this draft. That is the first thing. The second question  concerned a strong executive authority and there being a link  between strong executive authority and the president. In this  draft, and we all agreed on this, the constitutional commission  and council representatives agreed, that executive authority is  fully concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers.  And it is entirely natural that if the prime minister is  responsible for executive authority, then we should give him the  right to form the government with which he wants to work. But  we also give the Supreme Council the right to express no  confidence in him or to propose another way, and then he leaves  his post and forms another government. If the president is  again going to be directly involved in these issues, then he  must assume executive authority.    This cannot be. Then a prime minister is not needed. One  thing only is needed. That is why we agreed on this version.    As for what you propose regarding the directors of executive  authority, I think that this can be resolved by a certain  clause. This does not necessarily have to be put into these  fundamentals.    [Deputy Marchenko] Marchenko, electoral district 347.  [passage omitted] I am asking you one question, only one. Would  you not agree for a third time to be true to your right of  legislative initiative and submit to a referendum only one  question -- on the need for the institution of the presidency in  Ukraine? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, I understand that this is the stance of  your  party. For your party the president is now an eyesore, let us  say, in Ukraine. You want this issue put to a referendum. But  the Supreme Council adopted corresponding decisions. And I am  guided by the decisions of the Supreme Council and not by the  decisions of individual deputies. There is a decision adopted  by this body on the referendum. Then they revoked it and  adopted a decision on preterm elections of the Supreme Council  and new elections of the president. What contradictions are  there here? The time will come, and there will be elections.  But you again want a referendum on whether a president is  needed. It is not about the name of the president, but about a  concrete figure, about the structure of power. If the people do  not vote for these fundamental constitutional clauses, then  imagine -- then the Supreme Council of the new convocation will  adopt the decision it considers necessary, and on the  institution of the presidency in Ukraine too, and on the nature  of power too. But this will then mean that the people do not  want such a structure and put themselves in the hands of the  Supreme Council of the new convocation. But you want to again  return to the issue of a referendum.    [Deputy Petrenko] Volodymyr Petrenko for Azov Electoral  District 195. [passage omitted] Following the logic of what is  written -- and I, for example, am not happy about -- I am also  going to vote -- I am not happy about paragraph 2 of Chapter 4,  Executive Power: The supreme organ of state executive power in  Ukraine is the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.    This is a collective body, whereas I would like a prime  minister to head executive power. Thus, only because of one  paragraph will I vote entirely against the whole of the  fundamental provisions.    So my proposal -- and I would like to know your view on that  one -- is that we should remove these fundamental provisions  because we are adopting this package when there is not yet a new  parliament. Seventy percent of us will not be there. There will  be new people who will have their vision but who will not,  however, have the freedom of maneuver because people will have  voted on this. Thank you for your attention.    [Kravchuk] Well, I would like you to listen to what I think.  I cannot see, for example, how the whole of executive power can  be vested in the sole person of the prime minister given that he  as a person is appointed by the Supreme Council. Executive  power has to concentrate in the Cabinet of Ministers as a body,  while the prime minister -- it is there further on, do have a  look under what the prime minister can do -- heads this power  and heads the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, forming the  government and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers and  exercising control over the Cabinet of Ministers, coordinating  and so on. In other words, the organ itself represents  executive power and the premier is at the head of it. So what  you are saying is there, and I cannot see any differences here.  However, the person is not elected democratically, but  appointed, so do you really want the whole of full executive  power to be given to one person? In that case, what is the role  of the government? That is to say, this has to be explained, as  simple as that, just explained. [passage omitted]    [Deputy Charodeyev, in Russian] Charodeyev for Donetsk's  Proletarskiy rayon. [passage omitted] The question is this:  Leonid Makarovych, I am carefully watching what you are saying  now and you said earlier that the questions on bilingualism and  state symbols could not be put up to a referendum, saying that  this question was unconstitutional. In many civilized countries,  this is a constitutional question. Where the leadership is wise  and makes the right decisions, it does so without a referendum.  Here the question is ripe. [passage omitted] Maybe the people  in the east will see that the majority in Ukraine is in favor of  this -- if it is in favor -- and maybe they will calm down.  Believe me, there is the total unacceptance of either the  symbols or monolingualism, and not only in eastern Ukraine.  There are letters from western Ukraine, in Ukrainian, that to  us, yellow has always been the color of harlots, traitors, and  the soft-headed.    That is why it is a referendum, rather than [Pavlo] Movchan  or [Larysa] Skoryk [both pro-Ukrainian people's deputies], that  can resolve this question. If you think there will be dangerous  consequences, tell me what they are. I would sincerely like to  make this issue clear to myself. I, however, will prove in a  speech that you are mistaken being under pressure from Rukh  people and unscrupulous advisers.    [Kravchuk] Well, you know, if we cannot reach a decision  here, given that we have not been able to reach it since May  1990, this is because there are different points of view.  However, under enforcible enactments and the procedure of work  of the Supreme Council, decisions here are made by a majority of  votes and nobody makes any distinction between deputies from the  West or East voting. It is a majority, period.    Now, imagine such a scene -- we have already seen it and  here; I am not making anything up; it has already happened -- as  Ukraine's western regions voting for the yellow and blue flag  and the east -- I do not know what for and I will not make any  forecasts now -- and they then (?secede). Then it is not that  the deputies cast their votes at the Supreme Council as a body,  that will be said. There will be a territorial division as to  who voted for what flag. You will say that by a majority this  flag should be hoisted here and you are bound, bound, to cause  confrontation. This is first.    Second, as democrats -- please listen, this is an important  issue, and it will anyway have to be settled...    [Plyushch interrupts and trys to restore order]    [Kravchuk] As real democrats, the issue in general and the  formulation of the issue on the state language, as it is, is  absurd, i.e. it fails to withstand any criticism. In this case,  however, it is about supporting the state language. That is all.  That is why I cannot see why this issue should be included in  the constitution. This can be settled by a law on languages.  This law exists, by the way, and it can be worked out, corrected  and adopted in the form the Supreme Council deems necessary.  This is a democratic way. But to impose on the people and divide  them according to the linguistic determinant will simply be  dangerous for the state, trust me, and passions will all the  time be inflamed over this, whether you want it or not. The  thing is that there is the situation that is in existence in  Ukraine today. That is why what I am saying about this is that  there is no need to include [the issues of state symbols and  bilingualism] in the constitution, moreover by a referendum.  Settle it by a law and everything will be all right. Perhaps the  Supreme Council will consider that two or three official  languages are spoken in Ukraine, Ukrainian, Russian and some  other.    [Plyushch] The second microphone.    [Deputy Romanov] Romanov for Odessa's District 294. [passage  omitted] We have a document called the Declaration on the  Sovereignty of Ukraine, where it is written down that the  declaration is the basis of a new constitution. We have now  prepared another document, which is the [fundamental  constitutional] provisions, that are also the basis of Ukraine's  new constitution.    My understanding is that the adoption of a [new]  constitution  will be carried out by a new Supreme Council. That is why, so  that there would not be variant readings, and since it will be  the basis of a new constitution, I think it would be all right  to write the following clause -- I would like to know your  attitude toward this -- in the general provisions, which is  Chapter 1 -- so that we then would not be accused of anything:  The right -- in Paragraph 4 -- the right to work, education,  scientific development, and environmental protection shall be  ensured for the future generations. If we do not write this  down, anything can happen after a referendum.    And the next question: In Chapter 5 on judiciary power,  nothing is said on the role of the office of the procurator. My  opinion is that this particular issue should by all means be  elucidated. The issue of the responsibility of the organs of  power for violations of the current legislation should also be  elucidated. What is your attitude towards these chapters?    [Kravchuk] Well, first of all let us assume the right to  everything you say is ensured. Ensured by whom? The state?  For everybody? Well, in that case, we have to say one more  thing, which is that there shall not be, shall we say, any  insurance medicine or any private colleges. No, no, no, no --  wait, wait, wait. Once we are saying A, we have to say B. That  is to say, the state in accordance with the budget takes it upon  itself fully to finance and ensure social security, which is how  it used to be.    Let us talk openly: Is it realistic in transition to a  market, socially oriented economy?    The next question to you then is this: I am not just saying  that we should write it down. Anything can be written and paper  will cope with it, but if we write down unrealistic things we  will simply ... [responding to a call from the audience and  changing thought] What you are saying is correct, but what you  have following this is another course of the development of our  society. Let us then write down that we are returning to the  old styles of work and to the old system of labor and  everything, and this all can then be written down.    That is why I would like to say this: If the Supreme Council  ... [pauses] Why is it important that this issue should be  examined by the Supreme Council? It is because it will weigh up  every situation and will specify it and can differentiate  something -- I do not know.    It cannot just be written down for the state then to say: I  have no base to do so, our economy is different. Throughout the  world, human beings have the right to use their talents, their  capabilities and conditions, rather than having it immediately  provided at any cost. You will not find it to be the case  anywhere.    So let us now take a realistic look at things. If you are  now in favor of this course, then finally say how you formulate  it and what we are to vote for.    [Plyushch] There was the office of the procurator. We agreed  that by a law on the office of the procurator...    [Kravchuk, interrupting] The office of the procurator -- it  is moved outside judiciary power. Our office of the procurator  is separate, it is to be established by a law on the office of  the procurator. You know that it is not included in the system  of judiciary power. Then a separate chapter will be needed.  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified deputy] I have several questions: Why are the  fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of  state power prepared so as to suit a personality, a personality,  rather than the state and the people? Let us so far consider  them to suit you as president and some...    [Kravchuk, interrupting] Can you be more specific?    [Deputy] I can say specifically...    [Kravchuk] Please.    [Deputy] This is the first question: Why is it that you are  elected for five years and the parliament for four?    [Kravchuk] You are welcome. First [words undistinct]...    [Deputy, interrupting] Why is it that you elect the judges  and we approve them? [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] My explanation is this: If it is about the  election of the president for four years, I am ready today to  alter the number of years, and by the way, it was not I who put  it forward.    Second, about why it is me who proposes the judges [passage  indistinct] why the president does the proposing is because  every society has to have counterweights. If it is the Supreme  Council that does the electing, then someone must do the putting  forward. You may not elect someone who is proposed, and the  president will have to put forward another candidacy. However,  it cannot be that an organ grabs everything. Let us say the  Supreme Council and president are elected democratically, right?  Why should one organ have more rights, more functions, more  powers, and more levers to exert pressure than the other who is  also someone elected democratically? One does the putting  forward and the other does the voting. There are not any  discrepancies here.    [Deputy] I have a second question. A second question. Do  you agree in accordance with your statement on re-election as  president in June?    [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council has adopted a resolution on  this.    [Deputy] Are there going to be elections or not?    [Kravchuk] Do I really decide this? The Supreme Council  decides this. Why are you addressing me? The issue has already  been resolved. Make a correction [as heard]. I repeat, the  Supreme Council commission, Oleksandr Pavlovych is right here.  I read it today. The draft has been distributed to you -- vote  for it. I cannot vote for the Supreme Council. Kozarenko there  is saying that this is not in the constitution. The Supreme  Council adopted a resolution from my proposal. And the Supreme  Council should secure this.    [Deputy Tkachuk] Anatoliy Tkachuk from the town of  Khmelnitskiy. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. Please tell me, to  this first question, do you believe that when two documents  exist in Ukraine, namely one document voted for at a referendum  and a second document called the Constitution of Ukraine, and  which is referred to here, that this eliminates turmoil in the  hall? In my view, this will only increase turmoil. This is the  first question. And the second question: please tell me, have  you made a psychological analysis of the situation on elections  of presidents of oblasts, an analysis of the Ukrainian  mentality, when anarchists are even praised in our songs. And in  two years you did not manage to remove your representative, whom  you appointed in Sevastopol. Will you remove such a  representative, when he is elected by the people?    [Kravchuk] I will start with the second question. First, it  is entirely untrue that I could not remove him. Simply I could  have removed him on the following day whenever I wanted to. So  one should not say that I did not manage to. This should be  precise.    To continue. You say that there will be two constitutions.  I will show you an example. I will show you with one example,  let us say with the example of executive authority. The Supreme  Council takes this as a basis -- that in Ukraine the Cabinet of  Ministers has executive authority, the Cabinet of Ministers is  the higher body -- takes this and on the basis of this adopts a  law on the Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is no debate as to  who is the head. The people will already have granted  fundamental powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. The Supreme  Council elaborates a law on the Cabinet of Ministers and it  begins to work fully. And there is no discrepancy here.  [passage omitted]    There is no fear here. There will only be fear if a new  Supreme Council comes to power with nothing in the way of a  constitution and begins once again going over what to give to  whom. Then they will divide up into blocs, some here, some  there, and in this way we will never agree on anything. The  people express their will, and the Supreme Council will then act  in accordance with the will of the people.    [Deputy Tkachuk] Aren't you afraid of little presidents in  oblasts? For instance, I do not fear this. If the oblast  entrusts one person with leading it, then let him lead.    [Kravchuk] Well finally, let us, well, I understand the  complexities. I understand the ambiguity of our situation and  life, but when we trust the people to elect a leader in the  localities, this has more possibilities, because they know their  own people best. Second, if he violates the law and  constitution, he can be removed -- this is envisaged -- removed  by the Cabinet of Ministers. And more, he can be removed by the  representative body if deputies assemble and vote for this.  That is, there is a counterbalance here. I am saying there is  a counterbalance. And there is no need to be afraid. And then  you will not be putting questions to me about why I did not sack  the representative of the president in Sevastopol. Because this  will be decided on the basis of the will of the people.    [Deputy Yatsenko] Yatsenko, Korosten region, electoral  district 157. [passage omitted] Why not determine approximately  five to seven selected issues that would more or less determine  where we are really going? Then the people would understand and  politicians would understand. And they would work for the  people and not for something else. And I would like to reduce  the second question to the second point regarding the president.  The president is the guarantor of human rights and freedoms.  Does the president have levers to implement, well, this  protection of the people? Evidently all of this is a matter for  the judicial authority, which has these levers. What do you  think? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, where we are going and what we are doing --  this is an eternal question. It is not, for instance, a  question to which one can reply unambiguously. If one is to  take the division of society on a historical scale into some  kind of formations, this is simple to do, to capitalism or to  socialism. This we know and studied five...[changes thought]  you understand, social and political formations. And one can  clearly define them. If you are talking about general rules,  they are here, freedoms before the law irrespective of one's  parentage, social and property freedoms, so that all forms of  ownership are safeguarded and all people are protected. But if  you have a specific proposal to formulate, then please formulate  it. Please do. It can be submitted. But I repeat, this is  about authority and what it should protect.    But can the president secure rights and freedoms? I think  that, for instance, in an abstract sense he is obliged to do  this, and in a concrete sense, certainly. But can the Supreme  Council ensure rights and freedoms today? No. This means that  this is a realistic mechanism when an individual should live in  a lawful, economic and social space, which protects his  interests. And everybody should do this -- and the president  above all -- if he is elected by the people. This question has  to be asked without fail. If it is not asked at all, then this  question is left up in the air: Who ensures these rights?    [Deputy Zakharuk] Dmytro Zakharuk, Snyatyn electoral  district 205. I have a question to both co-chairmen and authors  of the said draft from this aspect: first of all, one draft was  distributed, which truly said that the Supreme Council works on  a permanent basis. [passage omitted] So what do you think of  submitting this point (?to a referendum), that the Supreme  Council works on a permanent basis.    [Kravchuk] I noted in the draft that the parliament works on  a permanent basis, but not to note how many deputies.    [Zakharuk] Not to note down how many, but just that it is on  a permanent basis?    [Kravchuk] I agree with this. Because just imagine now. I  will name one figure now: 450 deputies and 450 assistants --  900 offices. The current Cabinet of Ministers has 870. And I  am not even mentioning motor vehicle transport, apartments, or  anything else. So maybe the new parliament will pay attention to  the situation. So I would note -- on a permanent basis -- but  not the number of deputies.    [Deputy Zakharuk] And the no less important issue is the  establishment of a balance between legislative power and the  president as to confidence and non-confidence in the Cabinet of  Ministers. This is to prevent such a happening as the Supreme  Council expressing non-confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers,  followed by it being once again full of the same people as  before composing it. Do you think a norm has to be brought in  here for no more than one third of the people from the old  Cabinet to be able to join a Cabinet of Ministers of the next  composition if the Supreme Council expresses non-confidence in  the Cabinet of Ministers?    [Kravchuk] What there can be is this: As it happens, I have  never been a supporter of, shall we say, unequivocal decisions.  But if you put it this way, then it cannot be one third. If,  shall we say, the Supreme Council expresses no confidence in the  Cabinet of Ministers, nobody can reenter a new Cabinet of  Ministers. Otherwise, how can it be divided? What does one  third mean? How will they be distinguished? Is one better than  the other? You are either in or out.    The truth, however, is that, as we saw, there are people  among the government that, shall we say, are not responsible for  separate sins, whereas the whole of the Cabinet of Ministers is  made to resign. I think what we have here is that if we take  the road of confidence in the prime minister, and the prime  minister is responsible for the state of executive power and is  accountable and responsible to the Supreme Council, he then  should have our confidence. When he resigns, he forms a new  government that is again agreed upon by the Supreme Council. I  cannot see it happen in any other way.    [Plyushch] Leonid Makarovych, your time is up.    [Kravchuk] Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HIGHWAYMEN TAKE THE HIGH ROAD  </P> <P> Ah, memories.  </P> <P> Johnny Cash once more singing "Folsom Prison Blues" -- a tale of lonely resolve  that established the Man in Black in the '50s as an exciting new force in  country music.  </P> <P> Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings joining together again on "Mammas Don't Let  Your Babys Grow Up to Be Cowboys," a '70s hit that helped define the  romanticism and independence of country music's landmark outlaw movement.  </P> <P> Kris Kristofferson reprising "Me and Bobby McGee," one of the key songs by the  former Rhodes Scholar that marked a breakthrough in country music in the '70s  by blending traditional country sentiment with a harsher, more contemporary  literary eye.  </P> <P> With moments like that, how could Saturday's Highwaymen concert at the Pacific  Amphitheatre be anything other than a warm, winning affair?  </P> <P> But the concert offered more than nostalgia. Much more.  </P> <P> For one thing, this tour is the first time Cash, Jennings, Kristofferson and  Nelson have ever toured together -- and it appears to be as much a treat for  them as it is for the fans.  </P> <P> These are singer-songwriters whose lives have crossed frequently --  professionally and personally. They have traveled many of the same roads,  battled many of the same demons and dreamed many of the same dreams.  </P> <P> Now, as survivors, they are joining together in a celebration that -- even  after more than two dozen shows -- seemed Saturday as enthusiastic as if they  were walking on stage for the first time together.  </P> <P> Rather than do separate sets and then all come out for a finale, the four  performers were on stage together with a nine-piece band for the entire two  hours.  </P> <P> Wisely, they had enough respect for the material to avoid trying to find a  place vocally for everybody in every song. On some numbers, three of them  simply played rhythm guitar while a fourth sang. At other times, two or more  would switch lead vocals in a single song or, when appropriate, all four would  sing the chorus.  </P> <P> Rarely dipping into the material from the two "Highwaymen" albums that gave the  tour its name, the quartet acknowledged the historic nature of these shows and  turned to material from throughout their respective careers.  </P> <P> The nearly 35 songs ranged from early Nelson ("Night Life") to late Nelson  ("Always on My Mind"), from rockabilly Cash ("Big River") to patriotic Cash  ("Ragged Old Flag"), from poet Kristofferson ("Sunday Morning Coming Down") to  preacher Kristofferson ("Why Me Lord"), from rowdy Jennings ("Are You Sure Hank  Done It This Way") to whimsical Jennings ("Wrong").  </P> <P> The latter Jennings number -- an appealing novelty about all the times another  perfect love proved wrong! -- was the only song from the show that's currently  on the country charts, but the other songs held up so well that all could carry  1990 copyrights.  </P> <P> More than merely spotlighting the imagination and heart of the music of these  four superb talents, the concert offered some lessons for the general pop  community.  </P> <P> For all its richness over the last 60 or so years, country music continues to  be viewed by many outsiders as something of a secondary pop style. But the best  country music is blessed with as much insight and grace as the best rock or  jazz or soul.  </P> <P> And the outlaw movement -- which embraces Merle Haggard as well as the four  tour principals -- is arguably the most significant strain of country since the  post-World War II honky-tonk uprising that delivered such artists as Hank  Williams and Lefty Frizzell.  </P> <P> In some ways, however, the ones who may learn the most from this tour are the  country music insiders -- the disc jockeys and record company executives who  seem to be under the delusion that the recycled music and array of new talent  (the post-Nelson/Cash generation) in Nashville is better than ever today.  Measured against the obvious artistry of the Highwaymen tour (which returns to  the Universal Amphitheatre on Oct. 1), that thinking sounds like just another  chorus in that latest Jennings hit. Wrong!  </P></p>

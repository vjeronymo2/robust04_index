			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Books: On with the Game - JDF Jones follows the fortunes of spies in the east ON SECRET SERVICE EAST OF CONSTANTINOPLE by Peter Hopkirk John Murray Pounds 19.99, 384 pages Great fiction creates its own version of history. The Russian conquest of the Ottoman fortress of Erzerum on February 16, 1916, is familiar to most of us, not from the war histories but from the final pages of Greenmantle, and we shall always believe that Sandy Arbuthnot had something to do with it. John Buchan spun one of his finest tales out of the clash of four empires - Turkish, German, Tsarist and British - in the 'Great Game' that was waged in the Near East, far from the bloody stalemate on the Western Front, throughout the First War. 'There is a dry wind blowing through the East . . .' he wrote, in the words of Sir Walter Bullivant, 'And the wind is blowing towards the Indian border.' More precisely, said Sir Walter, 'Some star is coming out of the West. The Germans know, and that is the card with which they are going to astonish the world.' End of fiction, enter Peter Hopkirk, whose latest book about the Great Game  -On Secret Service East of Constantinople - tells the true story of Kaiser Wilhelm's extraordinary attempt, posing as a convert to Islam, to launch a Holy War which would drive the British out of India and their Russian allies out of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Kaiser understood that Britain's empire might be vulnerable; he ordered his agents to 'inflame the entire Moslem world against this hateful, lying and unscrupulous nation.' The Great Game between Britain and Russia had been called off in 1907, and Buchan was to succeed Kipling in finding romance and drama in this new chapter of the same game, this time between Germany and Britain. The German Drang nach Osten dated back for much of the century, when it began to be realised that the eastern territories of the fading Ottoman empire might become 'Germany's India.' The emergence to power in Constantinople of Enver Pasha, with his German sympathies and his own dream of a new Turkish empire in Central Asia, caused great alarm in London and Delhi. If the Germans could extend a 'Holy War' into Afghanistan, the threat would become acute. Hence the importance of the Russian cavalry charge on Erzerum: it was the first Allied victory of the Holy War, especially welcome after the humiliations of Gallipoli and the defeat at the siege of Kut. Greenmantle correctly focuses on the probability that Erzerum fell as a result of the betrayal of its defences - a theory strengthened by the testimony of TE Lawrence (he became a friend of Buchan). The consequence was that the Turko-German advance on Afghanistan faltered and failed, while in 1916 the Arab Revolt broke out, with much work for the same TEL (This book concentrates on events east of Constantinople, excluding the Levant.) Indeed, Hopkirk's story falls into two parts. After the events above, he turns to the bewildering intrigues in Turkestan and the Caucasus between 1916-18, the detail of which will be obscure to most of us. There is a fascinating cast of characters. Among the Germans there were Captain Oskar von Niedermeyer and Wilhelm Wassmuss, whose loss of the German code books eventually led to the deciphering of the 'Zimmerman Telegram' which was directly responsible for bringing America into the war; among their British opposite numbers there were Captain Edward Noel (a dead ringer for Sandy), the Highland Chieftain Major Aeneas Ranald MacDonell, and Captain Reginald Teague-Jones, the young British spy who, inaccurately identified with the execution of the 26 Soviet Commissars at Baku in 1918, was obliged to spend the next 70 years of his life under an alias. Four empires were brought low in these years - the German, the Austro-Hungarian, the Turkish and the Russian. The Kaiser died in Dutch exile in 1941; Enver Pasha in 1922, leading a suicidal cavalry charge against Bolshevik machine guns; Teague-Jones in 1988, as 'Captain Sinclair', late of MI5. It is a remarkable story. It has to be added that Peter Hopkirk, who has made the Great Game his special subject - this is his fifth volume on associated themes - does not write with the spellbinding skill of an Alan Moorhead or a Jan Morris, let alone a John Buchan. His prose is duller than the tale deserves, he eschews set-pieces and purple passages, but the drama of these adventures in exotic regions carries us through very happily.</p>

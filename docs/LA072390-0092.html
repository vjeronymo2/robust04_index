			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDERS POSTS BOND, JOINS REDSKINS' TRAINING CAMP  </P> <P> Wide receiver Rickey Sanders reported to the Washington Redskins' training camp  Sunday after posting bond in Houston the day before on attempted murder  charges.  </P> <P> Sanders reported a couple of hours before the 11 p.m. Sunday deadline for  rookies and selected wide receivers.  </P> <P> Sanders made no statement about the charges, which resulted from an altercation  with a parking attendant May 1.  </P> <P> He was among about 80 players who joined the team, which will begin practice  today.  </P> <P> One of three Redskins receivers to gain at least 1,000 yards in receptions last  season, Sanders posted $5,000 bond in a Houston court Saturday.  </P> <P> He is expected to be ordered to return to Houston Friday for a court hearing.  Sam Jamus, manager of a parking service outside a topless bar, alleges that  Sanders tried to run him down after an altercation in the parking lot there.  </P> <P> Sanders has denied trying to hit Jamus.  </P> <P> Sanders isn't expected to miss any practice, but coaches are wondering what  effect the turmoil will have on the team.  </P> <P> "I think if it gets to where he misses time, that becomes a distraction," Coach  Joe Gibbs said Sunday.  </P> <P> "We're used to something going on in training camp, but not something  potentially of this magnitude.  </P> <P> "There seem to be two sides to it. We're just hopeful that what Ricky says  comes out really happened," he said.  </P> <P> The Redskins' interest might involve more than merely what effect the charges  will have on Sanders' performance, however. San Antonio, Tex., attorney Tom  Hall, who is representing Jamus, said he might name the Redskins in a civil  suit he said he would file today.  </P> <P> Charley Casserly, Redskin general manager, declined to comment on the legal  issues, saying only, "I think Ricky will put it all in perspective and give us  100%."  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Older students the top priority - Education GRANT-maintained schools and further education for 16-19 year-olds are top of the government's agenda for extra education spending in the figures announced yesterday. Teachers and local-authority schools fare much worse, however, and expansion of the university sector is likely to slow. The chancellor said that increased spending on education was a vital national investment 'to improve the quality of the country's human capital'. Central government's education spending will rise by 5.8 per cent - Pounds 523m - next year, one of the most generous departmental settlements. However, total national education spending will rise by far less, because most of it - about Pounds 19bn of Pounds 27bn in the current year - is met by local government, which gained only a 3.7 per cent increase in its government grant. The precise implications for local education authorities (LEAs) will not be clear until ministers reveal the breakdown of the local government grant later this month. But given the full-year effect of last year's teachers' pay award, and next year's award, there will be little room for LEAs to increase recurrent spending. LEA leaders were last night predicting redundancies and other cuts in school grants. Some may, however, be able to increase their capital spending on schools as a result of the government's decision to relax the rules preventing councils from spending capital receipts. Teachers fare poorly from the award, with their pay rise for next year capped at the 1.5 per cent ceiling for public sector pay. Loud cries of woe issued from the teachers' unions last night. Yet a serious backlash is unlikely. Teachers' pay has been increased significantly above the rate of inflation for the past three years. The government may still hit trouble, though, with the performance-related pay scheme it has instructed the teachers' review body to produce in the New Year. Mr John Patten, education secretary, wants to see a much larger proportion of the total pay bill awarded for performance. Past practice suggests that such schemes cause bitterness if introduced with a tight overall award. Mr Patten stressed last night that further education was the government's top priority. The increases 'should lift us towards the top of the international league table in staying-on rates for 16-19 year-olds within the next three years,' he said. The government's target is to increase the number of students in further education and sixth form colleges by 25 per cent within three years, taking numbers from 899,000 this year to 1.1m in 1995-96. However, the emphasis on expanding further education will be at the expense of universities. Yesterday's statement talks of a 'consolidation' of higher education student numbers. The next leap towards the government's target of one in three 18-year-olds proceeding to university by 2000 is now to come 'at the end of the decade', with full-time student numbers for higher education projected to rise by 13 per cent - from 776,000 to 880,000 - between 1992 and 1996. To encourage efficiency the government will instruct the new Further Education Funding Council to relate part of its provision to actual student numbers. 'This funding approach will encourage institutions to compete for students and will enable the sector as whole to improve its efficiency,' the education department said. The Autumn Statement provides for the number of grant-maintained (GM) schools to rise from 342 to 1,500 by April 1994. Encouraging schools to opt out of LEA control to GM status is the most sensistive aspect of government education policy. The decision to increase central government spending on the GM sector from Pounds 61m this year to Pounds 446m in 1995-96 will be controversial.</p>

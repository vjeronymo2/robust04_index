			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miladin Manojlovic from Beli Manastir] </F>   [Text] The second round of elections for president of the  republic of Serbian Krajina in Slavonija, Baranja, and Western  Srem passed in perfect order. The response in the five  electoral units was massive, regardless of the fact that no  invitations were issued on this occasion and that the weather  was bad. More than 60 percent of the voters have voted in this  part of the republic of Serbian Krajina.    The electoral commissions are still sorting the data and it  is not certain yet which of the two candidates for president --  Milan Martic or Milan Babic -- has won the trust of the voters.    We have learned that it is definite that both candidates won  numerous votes and that the victory of one or another will be  very narrow. The president of the republic of Serbian Krajina  will be the candidate who wins the majority of votes. The first  unofficial results will be known tomorrow.</p>

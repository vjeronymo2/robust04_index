			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Diesel fuel comes clean - Worth Watching Water contamination in diesel fuel can cause breakdowns, particularly in cold weather when the water freezes. Unlike other diesel additives Aquasolve, a new product marketed by Shurflo, of Reigate, Surrey, and based on research by the Thermo-Fluids Engineering Research centre at City University in London, bonds the water to the fuel to form a solution that burns cleanly with no adverse effects or power loss. Shurflo also claims the blending helps improve combustion, cleans engines and reduces emissions. Aquasolve is equally effective treating fuel contaminated with sea water and prevents bacteriological growth caused when diesel fuel is stored in tanks. Shurflo: UK, 0737 242282.</p>

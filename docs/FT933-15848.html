			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / SFO call for US-style plea bargains rejected CALLS BY the Serious Fraud Office for a US-style of plea-bargaining to help reduce the number of controversial City 'mega-trials' have been rejected by the Royal Commission. Instead, the commission recommended a system of 'sentence discounts' for defendants in all criminal proceedings willing to plead guilty before a trial starts. However, it stopped far short of agreeing with the SFO that prosecutors should have an active role in offering lower sentences to suspects in exchange for increased co-operation. Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, had argued that the introduction of formal plea bargaining was the most effective way of shortening the process of prosecuting fraud. This was rejected by the commission as too extreme. Lord Runciman yesterday emphasised the commission's view that sentencing issues should be determined by judges alone with prosecutors playing no role in deciding penalties. The commission suggested a number of improvements to the investigation and prosecution of fraud cases, including forcing defence teams to give a detailed outline of their cases at an earlier stage. However, the general reaction of lawyers was that the commission had addressed matters of detail rather than proposing major reform and that its proposals, if implemented, would have only marginal impact on the problem of the large fraud trial. This, as one lawyer said, reflected the 'bolting on' of fraud trial reform to the commission's agenda after it had begun addressing its central concern of miscarriages of justice. The SFO welcomed the report, saying it was pleased the commission had reflected some of its views. Recommendations made by the commission for the investigation and prosecution of fraud include: Greater disclosure by defence lawyers of their clients' case to the prosecution before the trial starts. Defence lawyers can now say merely that they oppose the prosecution's case. They should have to state their attitude on individual details of the prosecution case, the commission suggests. Trial by jury should remain. The 'Section 2' powers of the SFO, which remove the right to silence and compel witnesses to answer questions - should be extended to allow police officers, as well as SFO lawyers and accountants, to carry out such interviews. Evidence gathered in Section 2 interviews should remain inadmissible in court, unless it contradicts evidence given in court by a defendant. A feasibility study should be carried out into the possible merging of the SFO with the Fraud Investigation Group. The commission said there was no justification for the group, which is part of the Crown Prosecution Service, not having the same Section 2 powers as the SFO. Time limits on fraud trials could be introduced, provided they remained flexible. Judges should be able to outline a case's basic issues to the jury at the start of a trial. Fraud defendants should be able to be able to plead guilty to a serious regulatory offence subject to the disciplinary sanctions of the Securities and Investments Board, rather than face criminal charges, although this should only be available in a strictly limited type of case. Reactions among fraud solicitors were muted. Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley said the recommendations would not fundamentally advance the present state of affairs. However, he questioned the wisdom of suggesting police carry out Section 2 interviews when they also carried out the interviews with suspects which could later be used as evidence in court. Mr Anthony Vernon of Richards Butler said sentence discounts would have less effect with fraud than in other types of crime. With fraud, the issues involved often only became clear at a comparatively late stage. To encourage early guilty pleas in these circumstances might amount to undesirable 'horse-trading', he said.</p>

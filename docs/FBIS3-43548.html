South African Communist Party head Joe Slovo and African  National Congress [ANC] chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa were  whiskered [as received] away by bodyguards seconds after the  shooting.    ANC bodyguards returned fire immediately but it is not known  at this stage whether anyone was injured in the armed assault.    Initial reports indicated the shots were fired from the  nearby Mazibuko hostel.    Reporters dove for cover, and a SAPA reporter on the scene  said at least 40 rounds were fired.    Police helcopters were on the scene.    The tour, ironically was to "give impetus" to the peace  process at Katlehong and Thokoza.</p>

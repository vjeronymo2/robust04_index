			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 45 handlers of limes grown in Florida, and approximately 40 producers in the regulated area who are subject to regulation under the lime marketing order. Also, there are approximately 65 handlers of avocados grown in Florida, and approximately 95 producers in the regulated area who are subject to regulation under the avocado marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of lime and avocado producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lime and avocado marketing orders, administered by the Department, require that the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable limes and avocados handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible for local administration of their respective marketing orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. Each Committee consists of producers, handlers and a non-industry public member. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The Committees' budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of limes and avocados (in bushels). Because those rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees will have funds to pay their expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Lime Administrative Committee met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenditures of $89,697 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of limes. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $24,149 more than the $89,697 recommended for this fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment rate of $0.16. The major budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries and $10,100 for employee benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $64,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 400,000 55-pound bushels of limes. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $2,000 to income. The assessment and interest income will have to be augmented by $23,697 from the Committee's reserves to provide adequate funds to cover budgeted expenses. Sufficient reserve funds are available to cover the projected deficit. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $250,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal years' expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Avocado Administrative Committee also met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenditures of $97,000 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of avocados.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $16,846 more than the $97,000 recommended for this fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment rate of $0.16. The major budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries, $15,600 for compliance, and $10,100 for employee benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $96,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 600,000 55-pound bushels of avocados. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $1,000 to income. Sufficient reserve funds are available to cover any unexpected shortfall in projected income. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $100,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal years' expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committees' recommendations, and other available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro has warned that if the  United States unleashes a war against Cuba, no matter under what  pretext, Cuba would wage a no-holds barred fight against the  enemy in every corner of the nation where they may be. The  Guantanamo Naval Base would, of course, be no exception, because  in the region surrounding it, we have everything necessary to  neutralize that U.S. enclave. Raul added that in that case, and  as long as the aggression does not originate from that base and  the lapsed time is not used to reinforce the base, Cuba is  willing to allow the time necessary to evacuate civilians from  the base, primarily the spouses and children of the personnel of  the U.S. naval base.    In the ceremony held in Guantanamo to observe Militiamen's  Day and the 33d anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist  nature of the Revolution, Raul stressed that our historic legacy  is to fight fiercely for the independence of the fatherland,  under highly disadvantageous conditions, against the enemy; to  take their weapons; respect prisoners of war; and help injured  prisoners. After stressing that our people feel admiration and  gratitude toward their brave sons, the members of the border  guard troops unit, Raul pointed out that the Revolutionary Armed  Forces are proud of the courage, dedication, and discipline of  this unit deployed on the front line.</p>

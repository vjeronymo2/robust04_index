			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Embattled Lamont may be impaled on a sterling skewer MR Norman Lamont may join the ranks of British chancellors whose careers have been impaled on the pound. The rise in interest rates has the same whiff of personal disaster as Lord Barber's forced exit from the European monetary 'snake' - forerunner of the European Monetary System - after just six weeks in 1972 or Mr Denis (now Lord) Healey's about-turn on the road to Heathrow in 1976 when he decided against going to an International Monetary Fund meeting in Manila because of a sterling crisis. If Mr Lamont makes it to Washington for the IMF meeting at the end of the week, it will be no consolation to know that Lady Thatcher will be addressing an audience a couple of miles away. It would be uncharacteristic for her not to reiterate her belief that 'fixed rates don't stay fixed'. Nor will the chancellor find much sympathy in the G7 itself. Other G7 countries have watched with growing dismay how the UK has deprived itself of room for manoeuvre by clinging limpet-like to the DM2.95 parity for the pound. The UK has also attracted criticism for not acting fully in the spirit of the EMS. Non-UK monetary officials believe Britain bungled the weekend realignment by refusing to shift sterling's D-Mark parity. Admittedly that would have been politically very damaging, but the scale of intervention in recent days shows how unexpectedly large speculative forces have become. The Bundesbank and Bonn did not get the revaluation D-Mark they wanted. The Germans sought a differentiated realignment that would have involved more countries, in return for an interest rate cut. But the UK refused to make concessions on sterling's parity in return for lower German interest rates. The German line reflected a growing feeling that economic convergence in Europe is not sufficiently developed for the EMS to be treated as a fixed-rate system. While the Germans accept that the French franc should be pinned to the D-Mark for political as much as economic reasons, they have watched with disquiet how governments have aspired to fix currencies such as the pound, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo to the D-Mark. There is a recognition of the huge sacrifices being made to stamp out inflation, but some G7 officials ask whether that is not too rigorous an approach, given that high-interest-rate policies are stifling business activity and prolonging recession. There has also often been resentment among the other ERM members at the way the UK has frequently appeared reluctant to take the unpleasant medicine sometimes associated with EMS membership. The nature of Britain's entry into the ERM in October 1990 is still cited as a case of the newcomer trying to bend the rules - the UK unilaterally announced that it would enter the ERM with a DM2.95 central rate, simultaneously cutting interest rates by a full percentage point, before starting formal negotiations with its partners. If Mr Lamont has in recent weeks frequently emphasised how Britain would base its defence of sterling on the so-called 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement, he has until yesterday been unwilling to use the main weapon in the Basle-Nyborg armory, which is to change domestic interest rates. Those different approaches reflect the UK's long absence between 1979 and 1990 from a club in which other members were adapting to each other's ways. With hindsight, the chancellor may have avoided yesterday's painful moves with an earlier and smaller interest rate increase when pressure first began to build. Such speculation, though, ignores the politicised nature of UK economic and monetary policymaking, which is a more high-profile activity than in countries where technocrats or independent central banks hold sway. Heightened public interest may reflect the frequent mess the UK has made of economic management since the Second World War. Concentration of policy in the Treasury also makes the chancellor a central political figure, in a way that finance ministers elsewhere are not. In the UK, the chancellor increasingly is seen as the man who wins or loses elections for the government.</p>

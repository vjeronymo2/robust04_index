			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Lecturers' union chief to quit MS DIANA Warwick is to resign as general secretary of the Association of University Teachers to become first chief executive of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, an all-party body set up to provide advice and material aid for fledgling democracies. The departure of Ms Warwick, who has led the AUT since 1983, leaves the the association without a leader in the middle of a pay dispute between lecturers and the government. This year's 7 per cent pay deal, agreed with the vice-chancellors, was last week vetoed by the government as 'excessive'.</p>

Raul Iturria stressed that information received from  throughout the country indicates that nothing like that exists,  adding that rumors of transfers and retirements in the Coraceros  Guard are absolutely false.    "Transfers, if they exist, are normal within the functions  of  the institution. For example, we have the penitentiary security  service, but this is a normal everyday occurrence. No officer  of any rank has been transferred, other than those transferred  for service reasons," he stressed.    On 4 February the minister had a very full agenda, first in  Rio Branco and during the night he visited Melo, where he met  with Intendant Rodolfo Nin Novoa. He then officially dedicated  the refurbishment of Urban Precinct No. 1 and gave a news  conference in the office of the chief of police, Lieutenant  Colonel Luis A. Esteba, retired.

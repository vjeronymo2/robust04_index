			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio </F> La Malfa by Fernando Proietti in Rome; date not given:  "Giorgio: Back to the Center To Create Third Pole and Prevent  the Right From Winning" -- first four paragraphs are CORRIERE  DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- In front of the door of the elevator leading  to the PRI's [Italian Republican Party] headquarters on the  second floor of a small building in Piazza dei Caprettari, a  forlorn Oscar Giannino informed the author of this report that  he had just resigned from his post as La Malfa's spokesperson.    So what will he do now? "I really do not know," replied the  youngest of the Great Old Men who were defeated at the last,  stormy PRI convention. It took place at the Parco dei Principi  Hotel, transformed for the occasion into a slaughterhouse of the  resentment experienced by at least three generations of PRI  members. With a majority of only six votes, the meeting decided  the PRI's return to the center.    However, on this cold and uncertain, late-January Monday  morning, Giannino's tearful farewell was not the only split  which took place within the sober walls of the  nondenominationalist club. Indeed, following such a  close-fought victory, what feelings does a leader experience --  including from a human point of view -- when he sees some of his  most loyal co-workers suddenly turning their backs on him? "We  are very happy," one of the lady assistants of the resuscitated  secretary said smilingly. Giorgio himself also expressed his  satisfaction at "the political result, but only at this  political result" obtained by the PRI.    [Proietti] No doubt, it will not be easy for you to heal  certain wounds...    [La Malfa] Did you attend our platform conference at the  Piccolo Eliseo? If you did, then you must have realized how  outdated the debate was within our party. This is why I am very  happy with the final result achieved by our National Council. I  managed to put some order and clarity back into a party that was  losing its bearings. This is also why I was particularly  disappointed by the behavior of some people whose intelligence I  respect. However, those who are leaving -- and I believe there  are not many -- are only looking for a seat outside the PRI.    [Proietti] Does that include Bruno Visentini and Giovanni  Ferrara?    [La Malfa] I bear them no grudge. Bruno Visentini was the  only person I informed of the turn beforehand. Not even my  closest co-workers knew about it. I had to tell Visentini,  though, if only out of a sense of respect for him. It was  Visentini who had supported my reelection to the post of  secretary.    [Proietti] What about your formerly heeded adviser Ferrara?  Would you rather not talk about him?    [La Malfa] I am disappointed in Giovanni because of his lack  of understanding for my political proposal. Despite being a  very sharp political thinker, he refused to listen to my  reasons....    [Proietti] What is your reply to Bogi and Battaglia's bitter  accusations that you are, basically, a turncoat?    [La Malfa] I believe their opinions speak for themselves. On  the other hand, we each strive in our own way to safeguard our  political life. I lived through a dramatic experience, that of  bribe city, because I am convinced that politics are not  something personal, and that, in any case, public opinion must  be listened to.    [Proietti] Why, then, did you accept being reelected as a  secretary?    [La Malfa] It was apparent to me, also at the Cusani trial,  that people are able to draw distinctions between different  types of suspects. So when I had to decide whether to go back  into politics, I asked myself on what conditions I could do so,  and I decided I could attempt going back by renouncing something  even more significant, namely, by not standing for a seat in  parliament.    [Proietti] How did you reach your decision to return to the  center?    [La Malfa] The first difficult choice was that of returning  to politics after the bribe city mishap. This happened when the  local election results in the fall, especially in Rome and  Naples, revealed an alarming fact: In the capital, the fascists  had mustered a relative majority, whereas the winner in Naples  was a representative of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  opposed to [Alessandra] Mussolini. I was concerned because that  result was often interpreted in a distorting fashion, as  apparent from the latest election in Catania, where the fascists  won by a large majority in the provinces. Only [Pact for Italy  leader Mario] Segni is standing up to them. So I asked myself:  What sort of Italy will emerge from the next general elections?    [Proietti] Initially, however, you had approached AD  [Democratic Alliance].    [La Malfa] Yes, [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto showed some  courage, among other things, by giving a negative historical  judgement on the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] past history.  However, when I understood that the PDS leader was aiming to  build a left-wing coalition without worrying too much about who  was in it, and without giving any thought to the platforms, I  also asked myself: How can we possibly join forces with  Communist Renewal which was still singing hymns to Cuba at its  congress?    [Proietti] But AD also included the PRI with Visentini,  Bogi,  and Giannino.    [La Malfa] My friends who have joined AD will soon  understand  that it makes no sense to remain in an alliance which is leading  them to embrace Bertinotti. I doubt also whether businessmen  like Averna and Marzotto will be able to stand such company.    [Proietti] Of course, the businessmen. What about [Forza  Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi?    [La Malfa] I believe that he is plunging into politics to  strengthen the right. This, however, is madness. Besides, it  would not harm a businessman like him to be a little more  reserved. Agnelli always refused to identify a major productive  force such as Fiat with any single party. It is most  distressing to imagine what Italy would really be like if it  were governed by [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, with  Berlusconi acting as a mediator between the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] and the League, and Bertinotti in the opposition. But  the same applies to the reverse situation. This is why the PRI  is going back to the center -- to build a third pole and to  prevent the right from winning.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings surge at United Tech UNITED Technologies, the US technology group which is being restructured, reported second-quarter net income nearly quadrupled from an unusually depressed 1991. The company announced net income of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with Dollars 44m, or 28 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5.4bn. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. In last year's second quarter, earnings were abnormally depressed by a Dollars 148m pre-tax charge to restructure a contract at Norden, the group's radar system manufacturer. Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said the company was seeing strength in three of its business segments - building systems, which includes Carrier, the air conditioning company, and Otis, the elevator group; flight systems, which includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer; and automotive components. It was also encouraged by the early results from its restructuring programme, announced last January. So far it has cut the workforce by 4,650 jobs, or 65 per cent of the 1992 goal. 'We are meeting our schedule for restructuring and increased earnings,' Mr Daniell said. 'We expect additional modest benefits from a slowly improving economy and continuing gains from the restructuring programme.' The company's power segment, the Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine manufacturer, reported an operating profit of Dollars 116m, down from Dollars 123m a year ago. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 1.8bn. The company said there was a higher contribution from spare parts for commercial engines, and pointed out that the 1991 figure was boosted by some Dollars 100m in participation fees for the PW4000 engine. However, Mr Daniell described the overall condition of the commercial airline industry as 'troubling and indicative of continuing financial pressures on the major airlines'. The flight systems business made Dollars 65m on sales of Dollars 968m, compared with a loss of Dollars 72m on sales of Dollars 986m; building systems made Dollars 164m on revenues of Dollars 2.4bn, up from Dollars 124m on sales of Dollars 2.1bn, and automotive made Dollars 38m on revenues of Dollars 633m, compared with Dollars 28m on sales of Dollars 541m. For the six months United Technologies made Dollars 275m, or Dollars 1.95 a share, against Dollars 84m, or 53 cents, last year while revenues rose to Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars 10.2bn.</p>

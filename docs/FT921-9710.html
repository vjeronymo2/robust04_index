			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Potterton Myson to close boiler factory POTTERTON Myson, part of Blue Circle Industries, yesterday announced the closure of its domestic boiler factory at Birtley, Co Durham, with the loss of 302 jobs. The company, which hopes to redeploy about 10 per cent of the Birtley workforce, said output would be transferred to the factory's sister plants at Padiham, Lancashire, and Warwick. Acquisition of Myson Group in late 1989 had given Potterton Myson more manufacturing capacity than was needed to meet expected demand. That was the main reason for the Birtley closure, the company said. Mr Peter Taylor, director and general manager at Birtley, said: 'If it didn't happen now I fear we would die by starvation.' He added that the plant was essentially an assembly operation lacking core technology, whereas Warwick and Padiham manufactured the heat exchangers used in the company's gas central-heating boilers. 'Today if you want to invest you have to invest in your core technology,' he added. Mr Taylor declined to disclose how much the recession's impact on housebuilding had hit demand for Birtley's boilers. But he said it had depressed the market considerably. The AEU engineering workers' union, which represents most of the workforce, said it was monitoring the situation. 'The employees have been devastated by the news and are in a state of bewilderment,' said Mr Davey Hall, Tyne district secretary.</p>

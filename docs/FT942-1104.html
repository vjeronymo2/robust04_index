			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Tough line on Tessas When tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) were launched in January 1991, they were intended to be straightforward accounts which could be transferred from one building society or bank to another. Tessas are now in their fourth year and the situation is changing. While rates generally have fallen in line with base rates, those of the societies have held up better than banks. Rates from many banks are now down to between 4 and 5 per cent while those offered by societies are between 6 and 7 per cent. Maturity bonuses, which were introduced to encourage investors to stay with the same institution, have not been repeated in subsequent Tessa issues. And many of the top-paying accounts will not accept transfers of Tessas due to administration costs and a desire to keep the Tessas for their full five-year term. Higher-paying Tessas also tend to require larger opening balances. They demand the maximum permitted investment each year and, sometimes, a feeder account. Under this system, the investor must not only deposit an initial Pounds 3,000 into the Tessa in the first year but must also put a further sum into the feeder account, from which transfers are made into the Tessa each year. This is fine as long as the feeder account pays good rates to compensate for the loss of access to funds. Confederation Bank's Tessa, which is fixed at 8 per cent for the term, also pays 8 per cent fixed on the feeder account. But the Market Harborough society requires Pounds 9,000 to be deposited up front; and while it pays a variable rate of 7.6 per cent on its Tessa, it offers only 6.25 per cent (variable) on its feeder. Even this is tiered, and drops to only 1.5 per cent when the balance fall below Pounds 2,400.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Peru's opposition 'in search of candidate': Former UN chief Perez de Cuellar is being touted as likely opponent to Fujimori Lima's leading news magazine recently carried a photographic mock-up of a 'dream ticket' for next year's presidential elections: as president, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary general; running mates, Mr Ricardo Belmont, a television personality twice elected mayor of Lima, and General Ketin Vidal, who masterminded the capture of Sendero Luminoso guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman. The three are not known ever to have met and none - least of all General Vidal - has expressed a firm intention to run. But speculation about who might have a chance of beating Mr Alberto Fujimori next year is growing. Influential opposition figures are busily promoting a Perez de Cuellar candidacy. And a series of opinion polls in the past month have indicated that, in a straight two-way fight, the former diplomat would beat Mr Fujimori by six points. 'What we really have at present is an opposition in search of a candidate,' says Mr Manuel Torrado, head of political research at local polling organisation Datum. Mr Perez de Cuellar towers over other presidential hopefuls. What is most important, he fits the bill as a political 'independent' - 80 per cent of Peruvians claim to have no party loyalty and the traditional political groupings are still suffering from the generalised discredit both self-inflicted and skilfully promoted by Mr Fujimori. Supporters of Mr Perez de Cuellar point to his impeccable democratic credentials and high international standing. He would, they argue, help rebuild the still-precarious bridges between Peru and the rest of the world. His experience in seeking consensus could also be a welcome change from Mr Fujimori's authoritarian style. On the down side are Mr Perez de Cuellar's age (he is 74) and his lack of familiarity with his native land: he has lived abroad most of his life and continues to do so. A senior Fujimori aide describes the former UN secretary general as 'colourless, tasteless and odourless'. Former president Mr Fernand o Belaunde Terry, meanwhile, is reported to have said that 'this is a product that won't sell in the Andes'. Mr Torrado, a veteran of Peruvian political campaigns, disagrees. With proper marketing, he says, Andean peasants in the remote highlands would vote en masse for Mr Perez de Cuellar. 'How could they not? In their eyes, he's already been president of the world.' President Fujimori, however, will be hard to beat. His approval ratings remain high and, though he has yet to announce his candidacy for a second term, he already appears to be on the campaign trail. For weeks he has been visiting remote rural areas and urban shanty-towns, opening new schools and the like. The 1994 public purse has been conveniently swelled by a stepped-up 'social compensation fund' budget as well as by cash from privatisations. One thing Mr Fujimori notably lacks is a political party. Cambio (Change) 90, which he created to support his 1990 presidential campaign and New Majority, conjured up to run candidates in the 1992 post-coup constitutional elections, have failed to put down roots. With the long-established Apra and Popular Action parties gearing up to run candidates, a 1995 congressional majority for Mr Fujimori looks unlikely. Increasingly, the army has substituted for the political party Mr Fujimori lacks. That, too, may create problems. Army support is always essential in electoral processes in Peru - to distribute electoral material, guarantee order and collect ballot boxes. The biggest test for Peruvian democracy over the 11 months before the first round may be whether the armed forces can maintain neutrality towards a president-candidate with whom they are intimately linked.</p>

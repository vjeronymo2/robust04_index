			<p>BFN     [Text] Heavy clashes took place yesterday in N'Dalatando,  the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. The clashes lasted for  two and a half hours, at the end of which troops led by General  Fateira were put to flight. The People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] abandoned several killed and large  quantities of war materiel on the ground. Our forces captured  Lieutenant Pdro Joao, son of Joao Andre and Antonica Pedro Andre  and born in Cazenga in September 1974. He was assigned to the  1st Company of the Tank Battalion. Our N'Dalatando  correspondent Firmino Lukamba has other details:    FAPLA forces abandoned 45 killed. The local Military Command  has meanwhile denied a Radio Nacional de Angola report from  Cuito, saying UNITA forces stationed in N'Dalatando have been  deployed elsewhere to take Cuito.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Francis Lun, Hong Kong </F> Democratic Foundation Central Committee member: "Selection  Process for First SAR Chief Executive Lacks Credibility"]    [Text] The recent elevation of Mr Tsang Hin-chi, a local  businessman, to the Standing Committee of China's National  People's Congress gives us a glimpse of what we can expect in  the post-1997 Hong Kong political arena.    The selection of Mr Tsang drew heavy criticism even from  China's own-appointed Hong Kong people's deputies. Actually,  Hong Kong deputies wanted to elect another person to the  Standing Committee rather than Mr Tsang. The Chinese government  chose to ignore the opinions of the Hong Kong deputies. If the  Chinese now ride roughshod over the opinions of its own rubber  stamp parliament, what hope is there that the Chinese government  will even pretend to listen to the people of Hong Kong and  respect Hong Kong's democratic institutions and the rule of law.    In a recent RTHK television program on the Basic Law, the  host asked me what was the most important article in the Basic  Law. I answered instinctively, that article 45 on the selection  of the first SAR chief executive was by far the most important.    There are two reasons for this choice. One, under the  existing Hong Kong political structure, all the powers of  government are concentrated in the hands of the Governor. He  is, in fact, a potential dictator with no effective  constitutional checks and balances and does not have to be  responsible to anyone or any political organisation. The  Executive Council is entirely appointed by the Governor.    The partly-elected Legislative Council has very limited  powers. The Legislative Council can exercise some form of  restraint on the government only through the finance committee.  Otherwise, the Legislative Council is an advisory body in fact.  Fortunately, the Governor has not resorted to dictatorial  powers to govern Hong Kong, up to now.    On 1 July 1997, the existing dictatorial powers of the  Governor will automatically pass to the first SAR Chief  Executive. If the first chief executive was to be  democratically elected, Hong Kong would have some control over  the first chief executive. Unfortunately, under Appendix I of  the Basic Law, the election of the first Chief Executive is by a  very undemocratic process.    The first chief executive is to be selected by an election  committee of 800 members, selected by the Chinese government  through the Preparatory Committee. Out of the 800 members, 200  members are selected from the business and finance sector; 200  from the professional ranks; 200 from organised labour and  social welfare groups, and 200 from Hong Kong's people's  deputies to the NPC and local members of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference.    These 800 members will be selected by the Chinese government  and not elected by the people of Hong Kong, directly or  indirectly. In the first group, all businessmen for their own  self-interests bend toward Beijing. In the second group of  professionals, we can be sure that Martin Lee will not be among  them. In the third group of labour leaders, we can be sure that  Lau Chin-shek and Lee Cheuk-yan will not be among them. In the  final group of rubber-stamp Chinese parliamentarians, even the  so-called democrat Law Cheung-kwok, voted against his own  democratic principles.    What credibility is there that the election committee will  respect and reflect the wishes of Hong Kong people, and defend  democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong? From Mr Tsang's  selection, we now have a pretty clear idea of what  qualifications the first SAR Chief Executive must have to suit  the Chinese government. First of all, he/she must be a business  tycoon. Second, he must have enormous investments in China.  Third, he must donate huge sums to the Chinese government.  Fourth, he must be obedient to the dictates of the Chinese  government.    Anyone can tell you that all tycoons are dictators because  democracy does not exist in corporations. The Chinese  government will get a dictator in line with their thinking. In  fact, Mr Tsang got selected right after he donated $100 million  to the Chinese government. I believe maybe there is a better  method of selecting the first chief executive.    Why don't we hold a public auction in June 1997, to see  which  tycoon will pay the highest price to be Hong Kong SAR's first  chief executive? The reward is enormous. The Hong Kong  government's annual expenditure is now over $170 billion.  Including the exchange fund, retained earnings, Hong Kong's  reserves by 1997 are likely to exceed $400 billion. The Hong  Kong government is one of the world's richest. Any person who  can get his hands on this huge reserve can do a great many  things. The temptation is just too great.    I often think of Hong Kong as a financial Bosnia, just  waiting to be carved up in 1997. When the international  community starts to take note of what is happening, I fear that  Hong Kong will be like Bosnia now, with very little of anything  left. The Tsang Hin-chi saga tells us that, like Bosnia, Hong  Kong is just waiting to be pilfered, pillaged and carved-up.  This scenario could be avoided if the chief executive was  democratically-elected as provided by the Joint Declaration and  accountable to the people of Hong Kong.</p>

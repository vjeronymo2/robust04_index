Speaking to our correspondent Sheli Yehimovich this morning,  Minister Peres said that although 'Arafat has the right to  reject the Cairo agreement, this rejection leads to the  conclusion that a meeting would be pointless.    He added that Palestinian rivalries are hurting the main  goal  of advancing toward peace, which should be put before squabbles.  Mr. Peres noted that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], head of the  Palestinian delegation, is the one who should have spoken about  the Cairo agreement, but after confirming the existence of the  agreement in a television interview, Abu-Mazin became mute and  Nabil Sha'th took the floor.    Referring to Knesset Member Dalya Itzik's proposal to give  up  the Qatif Bloc in exchange for the Palestinians' agreeing to  reduce the Jericho area, Minister Peres said he is categorically  opposed to this.</p>

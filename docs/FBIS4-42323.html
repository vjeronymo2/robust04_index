			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has criticized RAI.  According to the government leader, every year RAI spends  billions of lire making programs which could serve as propaganda  for the Communists. He added that it is always the citizens who  end up paying for this wasteful use of their money.    According to agency reports, Berlusconi made his harsh  comments during the course of a meeting of Forza Italia deputies  which was held today. The prime minister was talking about the  lack of efficiency in the public sector.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Executive jailed for corruption MR COLIN STUART, managing director of Dutton, the engineering company based in Wrexham, north Wales, was yesterday sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for corruption. Mr Stuart, 57, of Chester, had pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in London to bribing an agent of Exxon Chemicals, the US chemicals producer, in July 1990. The bribe was to end a dispute over payment for work by Dutton. Judge Gerald Butler QC ordered Mr Stuart to pay Pounds 5,000 towards prosecution costs. Mr David Turner-Samuels QC, defending, said Mr Stuart had been put under extreme pressure by his company's financial difficulties during a dispute with Exxon. He wrongly gained the impression that Exxon's agent was seeking a 'kick-back for himself'. He had paid Pounds 7,000 as an inducement to 'get out of the impasse' as that was cheaper than litigation. The judge stressed that there was no corrupt conduct by Exxon or any of its employees.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / E European households seen as big market Sales of white goods in eastern Europe are likely to rise more than 50 per cent by 1997, paced by strong growth in Hungary and Poland, according to a report* by Euromonitor, the London-based market analysts. Volume and value sales of white goods - cookers, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, dishwashers and ovens - will grow by 14 and 53 per cent respectively by 1997, when Euromonitor estimates the market will be worth about Dollars 6.2bn (Pounds 4.2bn), including partial data from Russia. The projection implies that more sophisticated products will gain market share, boosting the value of the market. It underlines the importance of the east European white goods market to the big western appliance groups, whose traditional markets are more mature. Whirlpool, the world's biggest white goods producer, forecasts annual growth of 6-8 per cent in the east European market, around double that for western Europe. Euromonitor says growth in Hungary and Poland will be fastest because they moved towards a market economy relatively early, and consumers have more money to spend on domestic appliances. It says ownership levels in eastern Europe are high for refrigerators and washing machines, while unfamiliar products such as dishwashers, microwave ovens and driers are still taking time to establish themselves. Washing machines, however, are likely to become the most important product sector. They are less well established than refrigerators, giving scope for sales to increase, and are a higher priority for consumers than dishwashers or microwaves. The report says there is plenty of scope for white goods companies to establish manufacturing bases in the region, though in the short-to-medium term it will be more feasible to establish a regional distribution network. *White Goods Market in Eastern Europe.

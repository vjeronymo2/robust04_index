			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: ABB set to sign Russian contract Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri, will sign a preliminary contract in Moscow today which could lead to the construction of a Dollars 500m (Pounds 342.4m) hydrocracker plant at Kirishi in southern Russia. The initial engineering contract will be awarded to ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, and Chevron, the US oil company, its partner in the proposed project. Lummus, a US company that is part of ABB, is a world leader in the technology for hydrocrackers, which crack heavy oils into light fuels. The final contract for the plant has not yet been awarded. Mr Barnevik coupled his announcement of the initial contract, at ABB's results meeting in Copenhagen yesterday, with another plea for more western finance for power and oil-and-gas related projects in Russia and Ukraine. He said it was 'a great tragedy' that the west, with some exceptions, had contributed almost no new money to help ex-Soviet republics reach economic and political stability. Tens of billions of dollars, rather than hundreds of millions, were needed, he said. The west had missed the opportunity to support the reform programme in Russia, he said. Reforms would now take longer. Mr Barnevik said ABB saw revamping of Russia's oil and gas industry as a top priority because it would boost exports. But modernisation of polluting power stations was also important, along with increased automation to raise productivity of basic industries. He said western finance was vital for energy-related projects in Ukraine. The priority was improved safety and availability of power from nuclear stations, more district heating, more efficient use of coal, and energy efficiency in basic industry. This would help Ukraine reduce its dependence on imports of gas from Russia and Turkmenistan. ABB results, Page 19</p>

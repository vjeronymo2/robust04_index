Mr.  Kifle said the document stipulates the formation of  parliamentary system of government, with the prime minister  fully responsible for the parliament, and a nominal head of  state. It also provides for a federal system of governance,  whereby the federal units will have very [words indistinct] of  internal governance as well as very strong participation in the  central government.    The chairman said the proposed parliament will have two  chambers: the upper house, House of the Council of Federation,  and the lower house, where the public are represented through  delegates elected by them.

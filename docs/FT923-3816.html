			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Case for Danish No and French Yes If I could vote in every European referendum on the Maastricht treaty, I would have voted No in Denmark but would vote Yes in France. This is because the Danish vote was a useful shot across the bows. A French No vote would, however, mean something very different. It would put in jeopardy the real achievements of the European exchange rate mechanism in bringing down inflation and reducing currency fluctuations in western Europe, without necessarily bringing any offsetting gains in growth. The hard ERM, in which parities are very rarely changed, can be justified on its own terms. Unfortunately the effect of the treaty and the negotiations leading up to it was that too many people have come to see it mainly as part of the drive to European monetary union (Emu) and to the political structure which Emu would supposedly need. Psychological links are, however, not everything. The position of Scandinavian countries that have been informally shadowing the ERM is quite different from that of full members which have unlimited short-term credits if their currencies are against the bottom. The gamble that Bengt Dennis, governor of Sweden's central bank, has taken in raising overnight interest rates to 75 per cent might yet come off if it convinces the markets of Sweden's seriousness in maintaining the exchange rate as an anti-inflationary anchor. What can be lost has been shown in Finland, which was all set for a wage pact with a zero overall pay increase  -now shelved. The wider importance of Scandinavia for the rest of the world is not the exchange rate tensions themselves, but what it reveals of the underlying weaknesses of banks, which may have to be tackled in their own right. Meanwhile the financial talking classes are dangerously underrating the determination and ability of central banks and governments to maintain ERM core existing parities. Whatever happens to the Italian lira, these core parities include the sterling/D-Mark as well as the franc/D-Mark rate. The main result of a French No vote would be to increase the chances of an increase in interest rates outside Germany. This is the opposite of what is required, but would still be better than jumping from the ERM ship into the cold water of sinking rates and competitive devaluation. The impact of the French referendum on the treaty, although in the direction I have suggested, might be smaller than supposed. 'Decisive' events often are. The foreign exchange markets have already gone through a phase in which the balance of probabilities has appeared to be No. On the other hand, a Yes vote would not resolve the conflict between those who wish to stay in the ERM and the black-red coalition of flag-waving Conservatives and inflationists of all hues who assert against all past evidence that the British government could do better in splendid isolation. The full significance of the British Treasury's Pounds 7.3bn syndicated borrowing has still not been fully appreciated. Of course, it is no more a triumph than the many rescue packages for sterling in the mid-1970s. But like those packages it can buy time. It puts, however, British leaders squarely in the firing-line. For if sterling were to be devalued, the sum would have to be repaid at a loss, as occurred when sterling was devalued under the Wilson government in 1967. The swap arrangement differs from that of the 1970s in important ways. The UK government is committed to drawing the D-Marks in the course of the present financial year. This means that even if sterling were to recover, the funds would still have to be drawn; and their conversion into sterling would tend to push the pound up within the grid. Commentators have also misinterpreted sterling's position near the bottom of the grid. So long as the central parity can be maintained, speculators against sterling now face a one-way risk. For the pound can only move upwards, in which case they would lose money. The whole point of negotiating a wide grid for sterling (as previously for the lira and the peseta) was to give this additional weapon to the Bank of England. Indeed my main query was why the Bank had not allowed sterling to fall to the bottom much earlier. Moreover, the new swap line is only one part of the reserves available to defend the parity. The published reserves themselves amount to Pounds 23.7bn. In addition, the central banks of the stronger currencies have an obligation to provide unlimited assistance for up to three months to currencies against the lower limit of the grid There is also quite an unnecessary mystery about the position of Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. As far as he can see, Germany does not need an interest rate rise and he has tried to help his EC colleagues in sticking his neck out in saying so. It would be astonishing if he went beyond a slight hardening of what he has already said in Germany. There is another point about which it is best to be frank. Prof Schlesinger happens, as an economist, to believe in floating exchange rates, as is his privilege. As a constitutionalist, he knows that the choice of exchange rate regime is one for the German government; otherwise the ERM would never have come into existence. As an economist, he has no objection to other countries linking their rates to the D-Mark, so long as the adaptations are made by these countries and he is not expected to inflate the German money supply to accommodate them. There is a good technical argument that because of the sharply inverted yield curve and the temptation for holders of short-term deposits to move from dollars to D-Marks, that the German monetary indicator, M3, is giving misleading signals. The case was made by Prof Ronald McKinnon in the Financial Times on Sept 7. I doubt, however, if the Bundesbank will stick to M3 for scholastic reasons, once it decides that recession is a greater threat than inflation. This brings me back to the question behind the UK overseas borrowing: 'Buy time for what?' Immediately, for the French referendum campaign. Looking further ahead, for German interest rates to subside and for the dollar to reach the bottom of its trajectory. But most important of all, it is to buy time for the entrenchment of the lower UK inflation rate so precariously achieved. As Andrew Burrell points out in the August London Business School Economic Outlook, recession has brought inflation down to a lower level than that of a decade ago; 'but the effect will only be confirmed if the present realism is continued into the cyclical upswing'. It is precisely to guard against the temptation to relax overall financial policy when the going gets rough and before the goal has been secured that the ERM is valuable. The real argument against British membership is that against stable prices itself and I welcome the fact that this has now come into the open. Anyone who believes after the experiences of the past decades that giving up on inflation control will promote growth has, like the Bourbons, forgotten nothing and learned nothing. Of course, I have also been thinking about how to counter any threat of worldwide or UK deflation. But crying 'wolf' before it has happened, or likely to, is not a good counsel.</p>

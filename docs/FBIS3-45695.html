			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. giant  medicine manufacturer Merck &amp; Co. has formulated a strategy  for  entering the Chinese market, with the help from Hong Kong.    Using Hong Kong as a base, the company is looking to sell  many of its more than 150 prescription medicines in China,  according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's New York  office here today.    P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive office of Merck  said, after a recent trip to China's Shenzhen, his company has  made some important decisions about China and their strategy was  well advanced and about to crystallize.    The visit by a five-member Merck delegation to Shenzhen was  organized by the Hong Kong Council. Since 1953 Merck has  established its Far East Regional Office in Hong Kong and in the  past months representative offices were also set up in Beijing,  Shanghai and Guangzhou.    As the chairman noted, the company has now reached the point  to become a joint venture partner in selling directly to China's  domestic market and producing some of the products on the  mainland.    A technology transfer project from Merck prompted China's  national vaccine and serum institute to launch a factory in  Beijing last October that produced vaccine against hepatitis B  and now a similar factory is now under construction in Shenzhen.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nordstrom profits at Dollars 50m despite charge NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer, lifted after-tax profits to Dollars 49.96m in the final three months to end-January. The results were scored on a 9.3 per cent improvement in sales, at Dollars 1.07bn, and compared with a net profit of Dollars 40.86m in the corresponding period of 1991-92. The 1992-93 results would have been slightly higher, had it not been for a Dollars 4m charge related to the payment of plaintiffs' legal fees in Nordstrom's recent settlement of a labour class action lawsuit. As with most retailers, the fourth quarter is the most crucial in the trading year.</p>

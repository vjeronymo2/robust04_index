			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anabel Diez and Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Alfonso Guerra </F> Will Agree To Stay on New Socialist Executive Committee Only If  It Is `Balanced'"]    [Text] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  Deputy Secretary General Alfonso Guerra yesterday laid down his  ideological territory, his rules of the game, and the conditions  for peace in the PSOE. He will not agree to sit on an Executive  Committee which is not "balanced," and which, on the contrary,  is exclusive. Alfonso Guerra trusts that at the 33d congress in  March there will be talk not only of seats but also of the  political and ideological substance characteristic of a social  democratic party. Guerra claimed for himself and his supporters  "a certain degree of nonconformism, utopianism, and a zeal to  transform society."    The PSOE number two stated that there is no Guerraism but  rather a left wing, estimated at 40 percent of the party, which  he represents. He conceded to the renewalists, "with a more  social liberal stance," another 40 percent, and, last, another  20 percent who opt "for an intermediate stance." However, the  deputy secretary general mentioned another small group, which he  also called renewalist, whose aim is solely to "kill Guerra."    Renewalists and Guerraists were awaiting Guerra's appearance  on "The Radio 1 Breakfasts" with anticipation yesterday, in view  of his silence over the past three months. Secretary General  Felipe Gonzalez made a move by stating last month that he is  counting on Guerra for the party's deputy secretary generalship.  Many renewalists have insistently called for a response by  Guerra. The renewalists have received Guerra's political line  with satisfaction because of its "constructive" nature, since it  currently seems that the idea of integration must prevail in  view of the prospect of the abyss opening up for the Socialists  if they head for open confrontation.    Nevertheless, various renewalists expressed their  disagreement in the Congress [of Deputies] yesterday with one of  the fundamental aspects of Guerra's line, which is to seize the  banner of the PSOE left wing. For their part, the Guerraists  received their leader's appearance with satisfaction, in view of  their conviction that he would be moderate and conciliatory.    The fact is that Guerra dealt fully in his well-considered  replies with all the questions which have remained open for  months. Everybody was wondering whether Guerra would wish to be  on an Executive Committee in which his stances would be  glaringly in a minority. "The leadership which emerges from the  next congress should be balanced, without excluding anybody,  and, if it were not so, I would not wish to be in it." He then  developed somewhat further his idea for the new Executive  Committee. "Balanced means that the party feels satisfied, that  there is no frustration, that society perceives that there are  no fanatics or people who wish to divide."    Guerra set further terms for feeling part of the Executive  Committee which will emerge from the next congress, which have  to do with the course of that Socialist assembly. "The  important thing is what will happen at the congress; whether or  not a program with a desire for transformation emerges; whether  it has some degree of nonconformity; whether it has some degree  of utopianism, which is not madness but a premature truth, a  search for the improvement of society." Guerra wants solutions  or indications of disagreement with the situations of injustice  which Spain still experiences to emerge from the congress, and  he expatiated on the weakest sections of society. This does not  mean that Guerra rejects the task of the government of which he  was deputy prime minister for 10 years, since, in his opinion,  that decade's work "was impressive."    He did make it clear for the first time that a left wing  which he represents has taken shape in his party, since he  rejects the term "Guerraist" because he does not feel that he is  a distributor of membership cards bearing that name.    Although, in terms of the percentage of delegates to the  congress, the Guerraists have won just over 30 percent, Guerra  asserted that, in terms of the number of votes, they total 40  percent. He did not neglect to mention that through the  allocation system the minority obtains 25 percent, even if there  is only one vote between it and the majority. Guerra specified  that he was not the inventor of this allocation system, and even  declared himself opposed to it.    Alfonso Guerra did not forget to mention those who have been  calling for him to speak out over the past few weeks. "I have  kept silent because I did not wish to contribute to the tendency  toward division, and perhaps I have upset the strategy of some  people who were expecting an angry response; well, no, I did not  wish to inflame matters."  <H5>  There Are No Rifts Here </H5>   Alfonso Guerra bore up as best he could yesterday in order  not to give the impression of being beset. He appeared not to  be surprised by the trickle of defections by supporters. "Those  were no friends, and so there is no betrayal; they have simply  removed their masks. I was already saying that those who  praised me so highly were untrustworthy." Guerra showed signs  of rejecting his position as a minority accustomed to holding  "the truth" and power in the PSOE. He deemed it "crazy" to  believe that the parliamentary group members supporting him  could take the path of the mixed group. "Whoever says that must  be somebody new, who does not know the PSOE's culture and  strength."    Although he declined to seem to disagree with the government  doctrine, he also did not appear enthusiastic about the current  government policies. When speaking of the 27 January strike and  the reform of the labor market, he tried to please everybody.  He said the reform is absolutely necessary, although he warned  of the need to improve working conditions: "The employers must  accept this."    He did not neglect to hit out at People's Party Chairman  Jose  Maria Aznar, "gored," according to him, by Cantabrian premier  Juan Hormaechea: "He will know where, but it seems to hurt him."</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Books: Poet's desolate life of hell on earth PLACES OF THE MIND: THE LIFE AND WORK OF JAMES THOMSON ('BV') by Tom Leonard Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 407 pages A MUSICAL concert, said the Victorian poet James Thomson, is 'two and a half hours of paradise for a shilling'. It was the only kind of paradise Thomson knew, for his life was singularly 'desolate and Fate-smitten'. It was also the only kind he expected, because he was a militant atheist who wrote for the secularist press. But it was not merely the immanence and transience of paradise that haunted Thomson; his greatest poem, The City of Dreadful Night, is a powerful description of the human condition as paradise's very opposite: a 'termless hell'. Tom Leonard's biography of Thomson is outstandingly good. It will surely rescue the poet from his undeserved obscurity. It shows that Thomson was not only a fine poet but a great essayist. His life was tragic; in the hands of a lesser biographer it would easily make a romantic, even a Gothic, tale of blighted genius. But Leonard writes with restraint and exactness, letting the story tell itself by interweaving sympathetic quotation and paraphrase of Thomson's work with a superbly realised account of Victorian Britain in the period between 1830 and 1880. Thomson's tormented character is allowed to emerge under its own impulsions, coming clearest into view just as its collapse into Faustian self-destruction begins. Thomson was Scottish but lived in London from infancy. Both his parents were religious enthusiasts, his father morbidly so. At the age of eight, following his mother's death, he was admitted to the Royal Caledonian Asylum in Islington. Upon leaving it he trained as an Army teacher, living an itinerant military camp life instructing illiterate soldiers and their offspring. After eight years he was 'discharged with disgrace', having accumulated enough black marks for a minor court martial offence to give the Army an excuse to sack him. Thereafter Thomson lived chiefly in London. He worked in the City, at one point travelling to Colorado to purchase silver mines for the company he served. In his spare time he wrote for journals like Charles Bradlaugh's atheistic National Reformer, contributing poems, translations from Heine and Leopardi, and essays. Among these latter were brilliant satires on religion and the corrupted literary tastes of Victorian England. His pseudonym was 'BV', standing for 'Bysshe Vanolis' in honour of Percy Bysshe Shelley and - by way of anagram - the German poet Novalis. Apart from a brief and unsuccessful stint as a war correspondent in Spain, Thomson increasingly relied on literary journalism for a livelihood. It was a precarious resource; journals were short lived, their editors unreliable paymasters. For a time he was obliged to live by researching long propaganda articles for a tobacco magazine. In early adulthood Thomson had the Dante-like experience of falling in love with an enchanting young girl who soon afterwards died. Her identity remains a point of controversy, and Thomson probably never expressed his true feelings to her. But the wound of the loss appears fresh in many of his poems. His life thereafter, despite friendships and some literary success, was a solitary and immensely painful one. Such was its agony that Thomson at one point tried, by burning all his manuscripts and letters, to destroy his past in order to salvage a future. The task took him five hours. In the immediately following years he wrote The City of Dreadful Night, an achievement described by Herman Melville as 'massive and mighty.' The publication of this masterpiece brought Thomson celebrity. It was admired by George Meredith, Rossetti and Swinburne among others. But the publication in rapid succession of two volumes of poetry and a collection of essays came too late. It could not save Thomson from the slide into poverty and alcoholism which, in the obscure years leading up to the success of these works, were the price he had paid for writing them - in particular, for inhabiting the desperate city of which his poetry was the map. Within a couple of years Thomson was dead, after a final scene of drunken insanity and dissolution. Leonard tells the tale with great skill. He does not indulge hypotheses about Thomson's feelings and motives; he lets the poet speak for himself, setting his words against a meticulously researched description of Victorian Britain's wars of religion and the literary and free-thinking alleys of Grub Street. This is the kind of biography Francis Steegmuller and others have perfected: the documentary life, the 'Jackdaw' folder which presents the reader with material on which to base his own judgment. Yet it makes a gripping story, and a harrowing one, which shows the cost that the productions of the mind exact, and how much human agony goes into their making.</p>

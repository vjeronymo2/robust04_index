			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cambodians Must Rebuild Their Disgraced Armed </F> Forces"]    [Text] One of the defining images of U.S. involvement in  the Vietnam war is a much celebrated picture of napalm-spattered  girl, her mouth stretched wide in pain, fleeing down a  paddy-lined road as plumes of smoke rise from her burning  village in the background.    Another photo of the same era, while less known, serves a  similar function of encapsulating Washington's role in Cambodia.  It shows a young boy, not much older than the Vietnamese girl,  swamped by his U.S.-supplied battle dress and M-16 getting ready  to go to war.    Twenty years later, the photo still serves as a graphic  reminder of the folly of providing massive military aid to the  corruption-riddled regime of Lon Nol. In both Cambodia and  Vietnam, foreign military assistance extended the suffering of  the local populations.    Despite Phnom Penh's objections and cries of interference,  Thai military leaders and politicians are right to criticize an  appeal by Cambodia's leaders for international donations of arms.    The Royal Cambodian Army is poorly-equipped but it is not  for  lack of arms that it has suffered a string of stunning defeats  at the hands of the better-armed Khmer Rouge over the last few  months. The biggest problem, as Bangkok has noted, is corruption  and poor leadership among its generals.    Sihanouk is well aware of the dangers of greed and  incompetence among his officer corps, whom last week he called  the "world's masters of corruption". After their defeats at the  hands of the Khmer Rouge in Pailin and Anlung Veng, government  soldiers complained their officers had been more interested in  pillaging the area than taking proper precautions to defend the  bases.    According to some reports, government officers requisitioned  military trucks to transport their looted spoils back to Phnom  Penh while wounded soldiers were left to walk out.    Irregularly paid, and poorly looked after, Cambodia's  soldiers have little incentive to risk their lives.    Last week, Australia said it along with the United States  and  France were seriously considering the possibility of sending  weapons to Cambodia.    Thailand has criticized the idea repeatedly, saying a  renewed  influx of arms would result in a prolonging of the conflict.  Bangkok officials say they still hope to see a political  settlement and national reconciliation but as Sihanouk, for long  the leading proponent of cutting a deal with the Khmer Rouge,  lamented last week, such a hope is looking increasingly vain.    At the height of its ugly diplomatic row with Phnom Penh  over  alleged assistance to the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri said Thailand was washing its hands of the Cambodia  affair and he announced Thailand would play no part in hosting  peace talks.    But the Cambodian problem won't go away. Shells continue to  stray over the border and the unending upheaval across the  border hurts Thai business interests and is a source of a wide  range of criminal activity from banditry to gunrunning.    What would serve Thailand better would be to join an  international effort to revamp the Cambodian armed forces.    An effectively trained and led army could do much to restore  peace throughout much of Cambodia. A well-disciplined army  would also eliminate one of the last sources of support for the  Khmer Rouge -- the widespread resentment at official corruption  and extortion by government soldiers.    Further more, aiding the government army may be the only way  to dispel the widely-held impression that the Thai military  continues to support the guerrilla group.    In the end, however, whatever military training the  international community can offer, it will do little good unless  the factionalized government in Phnom Penh also extends its  support. The Cambodians must start the process of rebuilding  their disgraced army and then perhaps the world will be in a  position to help.</p>

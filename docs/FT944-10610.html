			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Mandela seeks new mines policy President Nelson Mandela yesterday called on South Africa's mining houses to expand their dialogue with the government and trade unions by establishing a permanent forum of big stakeholders to help shape a new policy framework for the industry. Addressing the Johannesburg meeting of the Chamber of Mines, an umbrella body representing mining industry interests, Mr Mandela said such a forum could improve productivity and help mines develop education and training initiatives for workers, while improving health and safety measures. 'The mining industry's impressive technological achievements still confront archaic social conditions and a workforce built on a low skills base and largely confined by illiteracy.' While praising the achievements of the industry as 'truly remarkable,' Mr Mandela avoided addressing the question of mineral ownership, merely saying he hoped that 'under whatever form of ownership,' mining would seek 'to uplift the most disadvantaged of our society'. Since last year, a debate has been under way in Mr Mandela's African National Congress on whether the state should assume ownership of all mineral rights, to release under-used deposits for possible exploitation by foreign investors and small black-owned mines, or whether it should accept the private ownership system. Talks between the ANC, the mines and the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs have been continuing since the April general elections, but the government has yet to make a definitive policy statement on the issue. For the moment, Mr Mandela's address appears to indicate the state's willingness to accept the status quo while encouraging further social responsibility programmes by the mines. Mr Jurie Geldenhuys, outgoing president of the chamber, responded by urging 'a synergistic and co-operative relationship' between government and mining, and praising the administration's non-interventionist approach to the private sector as a whole. But Mr Geldenhuys criticised planned alterations to labour laws, such as more public holidays and a 40-hour maximum work week, as well as tighter environmental controls, charging they constituted 'an anachronism' that could prove extremely costly to the industry.</p>

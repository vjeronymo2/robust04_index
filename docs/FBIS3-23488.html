The highly-placed source identified the terrorist as Ramzi  Ahmad Yousef, one of three terrorists who remain at large after  allegedly carrying out the bomb attack on the World Trade Center  on Feb 26 last year.    The source said pictures of Yousef had been distributed  among  police in Bangkok and the Muslim-majority provinces in the South  where he was believed to be hiding.    He said apart from the Israeli diplomatic mission, possible  targets of the terrorists responsible for the truckload of  explosive materials uncovered by police last Thursday may have  included the embassies of the United States and Turkey as well  as foreign dignitaries in Bangkok. [passage omitted]    The source said Pattani is one place where international  terrorists, most of them Shi'ite Muslims, can find a safe haven  after committing crimes in other countries.    He said the terrorists travel on fake passports and get to  Pattani via Malaysia.    Tourist districts in Bangkok frequented by visitors from the  Middle East, such as Soi Nana and Saphan Kwai, are also hiding  places for terrorists, the source said. [passage omitted]</p>

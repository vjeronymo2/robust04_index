			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eight Days To Save Referendums"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- [Radical leader] Marco Pannella has scored  his first victory since starting his complete hunger strike,  having taken no food or drink for the past four days. The  Council of Ministers decided at the last moment last night to  issue a decree extending by eight days the deadline for  gathering signatures in support of the 13 abrogation referendums  proposed by the Pannella Club and the Northern League. A  subsequent period of seven days is expected for delivering the  signatures to the Court of Cassation. This is the first time  such a measure has been adopted. The decision followed a report  from Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who spoke about the need  to "find a just solution to the referendums problem" since, he  said, it is not enough to place an entry in the Official Gazette  in order to terminate an initiative which, however much people  may agree or disagree with it, is nevertheless legitimate.    An extension of the deadline has been granted for gathering  signatures and submitting the referendum proposals for which  signatures are being gathered.    So the volunteers assigned to gathering signatures -- which,  according to the latest estimates, now total 440,000, Marco  Pannella said -- can resume their work. But the Radical leader  was cautious: "Let us not celebrate yet; we still have to read  the decrees carefully." Be that as it may, he said, the rate at  which signatures have been gathered in recent days is  encouraging -- "an average of 25,000-30,000 per day," which, if  maintained, would enable the promoters to achieve the quorum of  500,000 signatures. This, partly because, Pannella went on, "the  margin of error when gathering signatures is about 3 percent of  those gathered by us, 15 percent of those gathered by others who  are less expert, and some 8-10 percent of those gathered by the  municipalities."    So does the Radical leader expect to end his fast? "We shall  see.... Certainly, if the situation really is as we hope it is,  I might at least end my water fast."</p>

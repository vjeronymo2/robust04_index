			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report, the U.S. State Department,  in its annual report on the human-rights situation in the world,  has raved absurdly as if the citizens in our country are not  ensured with even basic human rights while enumerating on  human-rights conditions in various countries. This is shameless  interference in our country's domestic affairs and intolerable  debasement of the popular mass-centered socialist system of our  own style.    Our government of the Republic, which sets up as a firm  policy to value the people and respect the people's rights,  practically ensures the true sense of freedom and rights for all  citizens and reliably guarantees a bountiful and happy life for  them. The policy of the popular masses-centered socialism of  our own style which embodies the chuche idea is the true human  rights policy that respects and guarantees everyone's human  rights to the maximum.    The fact that the United States, distorting a stern reality,  comes out with the rumor on so-called human rights violations in  North Korea is nothing but a cunning scheme aimed at staining  the image of our Republic internationally so as to isolate  [korip] us. This clearly shows that the United States is  strengthening propaganda maneuvers in every way to lay an  artificial obstacle in way of the DPRK-U.S. talks for  fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, to heighten the tension on the Korean peninsula to  the extreme, and to base the Republic.    In fact, speaking of the chieftain of human rights  violations  and the barren land of human rights, the United States and South  Korea are the ones. It is ridiculous for the United States to  babble about our nonexistent human rights issue without uttering  a word on this. If the United States thinks it can damage the  superiority and the invincible cause of the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style with this nonsense,  it is a miscalculation.    The United States must immediately give up the  anti-Republic,  anti-socialist strategic propaganda maneuvers, such as our  so-called human rights issue, the byproduct of the U.S.  reactionary strategy.</p>

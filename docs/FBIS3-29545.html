Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said China would be  most unwise to undo electoral changes when it takes over the  colony in 1997. Senator Evans was responding to an Australian  Television interview to China's criticism of him as  irresponsible over the Hong Kong issue.    The comment carried by the XINHUA News Agency followed  Senator Evans' expression of admiration on Wednesday for the  democratic reforms being promoted by Britain through its Hong  Kong Governor Chris Patten. Senator Evans said his statement of  support during Mr. Patten's official visit to Canberra was not  the first time Australia had backed the electoral changes.  Australia's foreign minister said Britain was taking a few  modest steps on the path of democratization. Senator Evans said  it was consistent with the terms of the agreement between China  and Britain. He said Australia and rest of the world should  stand firm on the democratic principle involved in Hong Kong.  Senator Evans is scheduled to visit China in early April.</p>

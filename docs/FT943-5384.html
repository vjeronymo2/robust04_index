			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Brazilian finance minister quits over broadcast Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, resigned yesterday after confessing in a private conversation mistakenly broadcast by satellite television that, when it comes to inflation indices: 'I don't have any scruples. What is good, we use - what is bad, we hide.' His resignation comes at an awkward time for Brazil's two- month-old new currency, the Real, and for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the government's candidate in next month's presidential elections. Mr Ricupero was talking privately to a journalist from TV Globo, Brazil's main broadcaster, in between taping interviews. About 10 minutes of the conversation was transmitted live and received by homes with satellite dishes in Brazil. During the conversation, Mr Ricupero suggested that the success of the Real and his personal popularity were winning votes for Mr Cardoso and taking support from his main rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers party (PT). 'The greatest vote-getter today for (Mr Cardoso) is me,' he said. In a prepared statement yesterday, Mr Ricupero said he was the victim of 'an electronic failure' and that he was exhausted at the time of the conversation. 'This is not how I normally behave,' he said. 'But the Real plan is more important and that is why I handed in my resignation.' Last week, the PT complained about government support for Mr Cardoso which, although not surprising in Brazil, is technically illegal. To comply with Brazilian law, Mr Cardoso resigned as finance minister in April to run for president. But he is still closely linked with the new currency, which has cut inflation sharply and won him support among poorer voters. Mr Ricupero said during the interview that television stations such as Globo were using favourable comments about the Real to support Mr Cardoso's campaign, instead of giving him more open support. Among other revealing comments, he said he was preparing widespread tariff reductions on imports. Mr Ricupero's resignation, although extremely embarrassing for the government, will probably not threaten the Real. While currency markets are expected to open nervously today, the team of economists who designed the new currency and other anti-inflation measures remains in place. The new finance minister is to be Mr Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceara state and a close political ally of Mr Cardoso. Mr Cardoso leads Mr da Silva by 45 per cent to 23 per cent in the latest opinion polls before the first round of the presidential election on October 3.</p>

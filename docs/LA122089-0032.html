			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HUD'S SYSTEM OF POLICING ETHICS 'WEAK,' CONGRESSIONAL STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> The Department of Housing and Urban Development has an "extremely weak" system  of policing possible ethics violations by key officials and consultants,  according to a congressional study released Tuesday. It said that HUD Secretary  Jack Kemp was partly to blame.  </P> <P> "It appears that, to a large extent, it is business as usual at the Department  of Housing and Urban Development," said Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), who  requested and released the General Accounting Office report. "I am faulting  Secretary Kemp."  </P> <P> Pryor said he believed Kemp, who took office in February, was committed to  reforming the agency but that it did not appear that all HUD employees were  following his lead.  </P> <P> Kemp aides acknowledged that problems persist in the agency's internal policing  efforts but said Kemp and his deputies were making steady improvements.  </P> <P> The GAO, in a draft report to a Senate subcommittee, said it reviewed the files  of 62 consultants hired by HUD from 1986 to 1989 and that 52 had not filed  required financial disclosure forms.  </P> <P> The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, said also that HUD had received  62 disclosure reports from employees who are required to file them but that,  more than 100 days later, the agency had not reviewed any of them. Ethics law  requires that the reports, designed to uncover possible conflicts of interest,  be reviewed within 60 days.  </P> <P> Francis Keating, HUD's general counsel, said that most of the disclosure  reports had been reviewed since the GAO had checked in late September. Keating  said that Kemp ordered Tuesday that the rest be scrutinized by Jan. 15. He  could not say how many needed to be reviewed.  </P></p>

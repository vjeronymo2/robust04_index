			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: HK bank unit still in deficit HONGKONG Bank of Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, has posted a net deficit of ADollars 37.8m (USDollars 28.4m) for 1991, adding to the litany of losses reported by foreign banks operating in Australia. However, the result represents an improvement on the previous year's ADollars 273m loss, and reflects a reduction in bad and doubtful debt provisions, from ADollars 221m to ADollars 128.4m. It follows the announcement of a ADollars 103m loss by NatWest Australia and a ADollars 230m loss by Citibank.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROAMING ROMANIA  </P> <P> We recently returned from two weeks in Romania. Here are a few facts that were  not found in any travel book that we had read:  </P> <P> If driving into Romania from Vienna in a rented car through Hungary, remember  to ask for a "leaded" gas tank, as there is very little unleaded gas in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> Buy your hotel vouchers before entering an Eastern European country. They offer  a real saving, as they "fix" the room rate, plus give you a ration of gas per  day. Every book talks about the vouchers, but does not stress that you must buy  them before your trip. The Romanian embassy in Vienna has them.  </P> <P> Also, if you want milk in your coffee or tea, you had best take along a  condensed kind, as dairy products are very scarce. The country is magnificent.  We skipped going on to Bulgaria to stay longer in Romania.  </P> <P> BARBARA NORVELL  </P> <P> San Jose  </P></p>

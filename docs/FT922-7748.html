			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Long View: What's good for the US THE DE-LEVERAGING of Corporate America has been continuing apace. But have small investors in the US been too enthusiastic in playing their part in Wall Street's push to new bull market highs? Don't they remember 1987? With the collapse of Tokyo, Wall Street has again become the world's dominant stock market. Recently it has accounted for about 41 per cent of global market capitalisation. Yet just as international investors were feeling uncomfortable about the Japanese equity market as it approached its peaks in 1989 (actually getting to about 45 per cent of the world market) so the global investors are now being sniffy about the US. Look at British pension funds. They have 25 per cent of their portfolios in overseas equities, and given that the US represents 47 per cent of the World ex-UK market capitalisation, they might be expected to have 12 per cent in the US. In fact, they only have 6 per cent on average. In the curious way that fund managers think, that represents a very big bet against Wall Street. You can argue that the American company sector thinks in much the same way about the values currently obtaining in the US stock market. Remember that in 1988 and 1989, in the wake of the crash, US corporations were eagerly buying in their equity from the public at levels of 2,000 to 2,500 on the Dow Jones average. In many cases this turned out to be a bad mistake as overborrowed companies collapsed in the recession. However, the American corporate sector is now pouring out new equity to the tune of some Dollars 80bn a year. This is happening with the Dow well over 3,000. This looks like a profitable in-and-out move which is good for America, but is it good for American investors? The buyers of all this new paper are not primarily the long-term institutions: indeed, many of the US pension funds are busy with plans to raise the overseas content of their equity portfolios from 5 to between 10 and 15 per cent. Instead there is a big rise in public participation. This is seen not only in the booming profits of the big retail stockbrokers like Merrill Lynch, but most clearly in the sales of equity mutual funds, which have been recently been growing, net of redemptions, at about Dollars 7bn a month. It amounts to a flight from deposit instruments which now yield only about 3 1/2 per cent. Investors feel themselves forced to switch into higher risk investments in order to obtain a satisfactory return. Equity mutual fund returns have not in fact been at all remarkable recently - about 12 1/2 per cent on average, including income, over the past year. However, that can seem a better deal. This rush into equities has had strange monetary consequences. The rundown of certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds has corresponded to weakness of M2, the measure of broad money which is targeted by the Federal Reserve. Thus the Fed has been cutting short-term interest rates in an effort to stimulate M2, with a minor uptick at last visible in Thursday's monthly figures, upsetting hopes of a further imminent rate cut. But for many months bank loan demand has been sluggish and has not responded. Further interest rate cuts could encourage yet more investor switching into stocks and de-leveraging by the corporate sector. Meantime M1, the narrow money measure, is surging, so the monetarists hardly know whether to worry about deflation or inflation. In the circumstances the valuation basis of the US equity market has been driven to an extreme. The dividend yield on the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poors index of 500 stocks is only 2.6 per cent and the p/e ratio is an alarmingly high 26. That ratio is not quite as bad as it looks because many big US corporations made exceptional write-offs last year. The consensus appears to be for over 50 per cent growth this year and maybe another 15 per cent in 1993. However, this may be a case of desperate investment analysts trying to justify current share prices. Even so, a prospective p/e ratio of 15 looking two years ahead does not make the US stock market look good value. Nor do American equities offer good value against bonds. Although the long Treasury bond yield has fallen back from the 8 per cent in the last few days it looks as though the bond market may have peaked in the first quarter. The ratio between the bond and equity yields is about 3, a figure previously seen only in the last few months of the 1987 pre-crash surge. Bulls have to fall back on the argument that the ratio between short-term rates and dividend yields is still historically acceptable. But this means that the valuation basis of Wall Street depends on the continuation of very low short-term interest rates on the one hand and the assumption of strong earnings and dividend growth on the other. It is hard to think of circumstances in which these conditions could apply at the same time. Professional experts have been questioning the level of the US stock markets for many months and it continues to stay up there - and even break new high ground. The strategists wonder whether permanently low inflation might allow earnings to go on to a permanently higher rating. As for those amateur punters, do they know something the pros do not? Will there be a long shallow recession in which interest rates stay low but companies will be able to rebuild their profits because of the remarkable softness of American wages? Only about 15 per cent of US labour is now unionised. Perhaps this is a new era for American capitalism. The odds are, however, that the refugees from the deposit accounts are no wiser than they were in 1987, but are just chasing a higher return than a low inflation environment can deliver.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost of executive share options should be assessed on issue Sir, Your statement that 'options defy precise valuation' ('One option they don't want', May 25) sits uneasily with the rather precise valuations of London's financial futures and options exchange (Liffe) Equity Options printed each day in another part of your newspaper. The Black-Scholes option valuation model has been used for more than 20 years, and can easily be programmed into a pocket calculator or a simple spreadsheet. The only element that makes executive share options so difficult to value is the lack of information regarding the option exercise price, maturity date and current share price when issued. This means attention is now focused instead on the information revealed when options are exercised (the large payouts seen in the cases of BAe and LWT). Were quoted companies required to provide sufficient information to allow executive share options to be valued when issued, the cost of granting such options would then be clear to shareholders. Mike Staunton, 138 Regents Park Road, London NW1 8XL</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Ford to cut discounts to rental companies FORD is to cut back on deeply discounted sales to the big rental fleet operators such as Hertz and Avis, whose combined new car purchases - not just from Ford - approach 100,000 annually. The rental and leasing industry has been getting cars 'on the cheap' and Ford intends to 'get back to better margins', Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director, said yesterday. Such a course should help Ford to return to profitability this year after making heavy losses in each of the past two years, Mr McAllister said. He gave no firm indication of the discounts such companies have received from Ford. However, a study undertaken for the Retail Motor Industry Federation, the franchised dealers' trade body, has concluded that discounts of up to 40 per cent have been available from some manufacturers to some of the biggest fleets. A growing number of large fleet deals have also been concluded directly between manufacturers and fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks through which all cars should theoretically be sold. Such procedures are provoking bitter opposition from the federation, which has warned that dealer networks could start to disintegrate if the practice grows much beyond the 200,000 cars a year thought to be subject to such deals. Mr McAllister, acknowledging that direct sales could pose a long-term threat to dealers, indicated that Ford would be less willing than in the past to involve itself in such deals.

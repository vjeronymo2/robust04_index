			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Swiss banks lead Zurich equities down The fall in bond markets continued to depress bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH turned weaker, continuing to take its lead from the banking sector, and the SMI index finished 43.9 or 1.5 per cent lower at 2,858.5. SBC, the last of the big three banks to report, shed SFr10 to SFr439 after it said that it expected last year's record profit to be followed by good 1994 results. CS Holding was SFr10 easier at SFr439, as investors reacted to preliminary figures which came after the market closed on Tuesday. UBS bearers, SFr47 lower at SFr1,237, led the active list and Bank Julius Baer, the portfolio management bank, fell SFr70 to SFr1,470. Analysts commented that while the banks' results had proved broadly in line with expectations, the level of dividends had left some investors disappointed. Yesterday's selling was also attributed to the view among foreign buyers that the shares had limited short-term potential. Cyclicals continued to attract attention although Brown Boveri gave up an early advance to finish SFr4 lower at SFr1,125 ahead of today's annual news conference: some analysts expected ABB's 1993 profit to be halved by higher taxes and restructuring costs. Ascom bucked the trend, adding SFr70 to SFr1,340 for a cumulative two-day rise of 12.6 per cent, after the troubled telecommunications company was effectively put up for sale on Monday. PARIS blamed bond market weakness as the CAC 40 index fell 16.79 to 2,199.64 in thin turnover of FFr3.53bn. Dealers thought that the Bundesbank's repo rate cut was too meagre to advance the prospect of cuts in French, or German key interest rates in the weeks ahead. Dealers picked out the relatively few climbers for comment. In engineering, Vallourec hit a year high, closing FFr22 higher at FFr297 after several buy notes, and on investor interest in underperforming cyclicals. Euro Disney climbed FFr2.10 to FFr36.15, reacting to the view that a financial restructuring plan for the troubled leisure group can be agreed before the March 31 deadline. FRANKFURT stayed in its shallow downtrend, the Dax index falling 7.95 to 2,116.09 on the session, trying again for an afternoon lift but eventually subsiding to an Ibis-indicated 2,118.01. Turnover fell from DM10bn to DM9bn. Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that the gentle cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate from 5.97 to 5.94 per cent was much as expected. However, financials reflected the fall in bond markets and Deutsche Bank dropped DM12.50 on the session, to DM796. Mr Benischek was encouraged, however, by the fact that the big blue chips, which led the recovery from last week's market setback, continued to be active: Daimler rose DM4 to DM815 as BMW dropped DM19 to DM866 on profit-taking; Volkswagen and BASF, he said, were close to three or four year highs. Slightly lower down the scale, Lufthansa rose to DM192 in the post bourse, after falling DM2.50 to DM184.50 on the session, on the prospect of a dividend in 1994; Schering recovered DM48 to DM1,029 after last week's major broker sell recommendations were overtaken by buying from one of the pharmaceutical company's big supporters. MILAN turned down in response to the poor performance of bond futures and in technical trading relating to the end of the account. The Comit index shed 6.34 to 662.89. BCI picked up from a weak start to finish L42 ahead at L6,308 although analysts cautioned that the stock was unlikely to mirror the near-30 per cent jump above the privatisation price achieved by Credito Italiano. Credito was L19 higher on the day at L2,648. Insurers were weak with RAS shedding L788 or 3.1 per cent to 24,820. AMSTERDAM continued to trade a little nervously with an eye on the performance of bonds. The AEX fell back 2.27 to 420.75. One of the main losers was aircraft maker, Fokker, which lost Fl 2.70 to Fl 18.30 on announcement of a Fl 460m plunge into the red. Financials were knocked by fears of climbing rates. MADRID was lower across the board in thin trading which was halted twice by technical problems. The general index shed 2.26 to 336.20. In a mixed banking sector BCH shed Pta60 or 2 per cent to Pta2,870 and Argentaria fell Pta70 at Pta6,020. Banesto edged Pta2 higher to Pta743. Iberdrola was the weakest feature among the electrical utilities, falling Pta15 to Pta1,045. TEL AVIV saw more arrests for alleged share manipulation and bribe-taking with a senior investment adviser and two brokers being detained. The latest move in the scandal which has recently been hanging over the market took the Mishtanim index down by 10.91, or 4.9 per cent to 210.20. Sentiment was worsened by a dip in Israeli shares trading in New York. ISTANBUL again suffered from poor sentiment triggered by economic and political uncertainty and the composite index fell just over 801 to 13,705.31. Trading was dull and thin although some late buying picked the market up from earlier lows. The fall over the past three days amounts to an aggregate of 12 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 9                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1447.43      1447.05      1447.80      1448.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1499.17      1500.01      1501.24      1501.14  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1446.93      1446.87      1448.49      1445.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1498.76      1498.18      1499.68      1496.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Mar 8     Mar 7     Mar 4     Mar 3     Mar 2 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1459.23   1460.44   1428.41   1414.65   1393.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1511.16   1516.19   1489.46   1475.40   1462.08  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 - 1449.44; 200 - 1501.77 Low/day: 100 - 1445.47  200 - 1496.63  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, Michael Morgan and Christine Buckley</p>

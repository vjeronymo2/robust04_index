			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / RTZ cuts stake in Papuan gold RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday announced plans to cut its stake in the Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea  -the largest known gold deposit outside South Africa - from 80 per cent to about 20 per cent in exchange for Dollars 108m (Pounds 72m) cash. The UK group has wanted to reduce its exposure for some time to what it saw as a marginal project. Lihir's gold is in the crater of an extinct volcano full of hot water and technically difficult to extract. However, analysts were surprised by the value put on the project, only Dollars 300m, and by RTZ's new partner - Venezuelan Goldfields, a Vancouver-listed company in which controversial promoter Mr Robert Friedland is the biggest shareholder. RTZ has agreed to sell a near 20 per cent indirect stake in Lihir to Vengold for Dollars 59.97m. 'This is all fairly peculiar,' said Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg. 'It does not put a very large value on Lihir and why sell to a small Canadian exploration company. Where is the synergy?' Vengold will hold its interest in Lihir via RTZ's project parent company, control of which will be retained by RTZ. The UK group will continue to manage the project. RTZ has also agreed to sell to Niugini Mining - part of Battle Mountain Gold of the US - a further 16 per cent of Lihir, for Dollars 48m, to add to its current 20 per cent. The deals have to be approved by the Papua New Guinea government which has indicated it will take a 30 per cent shareholding. If so, the RTZ/Vengold company will eventually control 40 per cent of Lihir and Niugini 30 per cent. The PNG government has been pressing RTZ for a quick decision on Lihir because it needs the income stream from the mine. The deposit contains nearly 14m ounces of mineable gold and the partners expect to produce 620,000 ounces a year. The government recently threatened to take 50 per cent of the project to speed things up and in June offered - without RTZ's approval - a 20 per cent stake to the Malaysian Mining Corporation. RTZ said it had not talked to MMC. There is incentive for the government to give approval because RTZ said construction could start earlier than expected, in 1994, and take only 28 months. Also, a final cost estimate is expected to be lower than the previous one of Dollars 767m. Some analysts suggested it was not the quality of the project that caused RTZ to reduce its stake but the perceived political risks of mining in PNG. RTZ's Australian associate, CRA, closed the Bougainville copper mine, one of the world's biggest, three years ago because of a violent uprising and this year the government was involved in disputes about the Mt Kare and Porgera gold mines.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: World shipbuilding output reaches higest level in 15 years WORLD shipbuilding output reached its highest level in 15 years in 1992, latest figures from the London-based Lloyd's Register of Shipping* show, Richard Tomkins writes. Completions totalled 18.6m gross tonnes, 2.5m grt up on the previous year. The output reflects the peak in orders ahead of the present recession. Since then, orders have slumped: yesterday's figures show new orders exceeding deliveries by 5.8m grt last year. Biggest shipbuilding nations last year were Japan, with output of 7.6m grt, and South Korea, (4.8m grt), followed by Germany (903,555 grt), Taiwan (698,000 grt) and Denmark (599,878 grt). China was ninth with 360,735 grt. *Annual Summary of Merchant Ships Completed 1992. Lloyd's Register, 71 Fenchurch Street, London EC3M 4BS. Free.</p>

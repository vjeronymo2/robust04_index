The production line is financed by the No. 1 Motor Vehicle  Plant and Volkswagen Co. Ltd. as a Sino-German joint venture.  It has a designed annual production capacity of 150,000 Jetta  sedans.    According to engineers in charge of the construction  project,  the main workshops for general assembly, welding, coating and  engines, and some other necessary facilities, have been  completed.    A total of 95,000 sq m of roads, public squares and parking  lots have been constructed and put into use. Imported welding  equipment and production equipment have been or are being  installed.    The plant has won 420 million U.S. dollars in loans from an  international banking consortium formed by 36 banks. The money  will be used to cover expenses for importing engines and  transmission drive chains from overseas.    The construction of the production base is being carried out  simultaneously with production by using existing production  lines for Audi sedans.    Last year, the plant manufactured 12,000 Jettas and earned  1.58 billion yuan from sales of such cars. The localization  rate for Jetta sedan cars has reached 20.1 percent.    In addition, 101 after-sale Jetta service centers have been  set up across the country.    The entire base is expected to be completed and put into  operation in 1996.</p>

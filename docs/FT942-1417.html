			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / KPMG points to growth of fraud International fraudsters are increasingly laundering money through physical assets such as gold bars, senior fraud investigators claimed yesterday. In an effort to prevent money flows being traced, they are buying precious metals, antiques and other commodities, said Mr David Smith, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick's forensic accounting department. Speaking at the opening of the department's annual conference, Mr Smith said the transactions were partly a response to tougher guidelines on money laundering. Much of the money came from drug transactions. Mr Robert Chambers, head of the department, said there was a substantial growth in fraud in the US, partly due to the loss of internal controls as companies restructure during the recession. He said there was evidence of growing involvement in corporate fraud by organised crime, and that many police departments no longer had the budgets to investigate white-collar crime. Mr Smith said the development of high-quality colour photocopiers and sophisticated printing equipment was making forgery difficult to detect. He added that there was evidence of growing fraud in the former Soviet bloc, particularly involving the Mafia, but that there was little government money available to help pay for investigators to prevent fraud or recover stolen money. There was also a likelihood of growth in illegal money flows out of Hong Kong and South Africa over the next few years, a reflection of the countries' political instability. He said it was important that companies ensured their employees took holidays and others did their work while they were away, in an effort to ensure that no frauds were being concealed by staff. However, it is proving far easier than many believe to freeze assets held in Switzerland, he said.</p>

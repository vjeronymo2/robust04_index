			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: EL TORO;  </P> <P> MILITARY POLICE TURN RADAR GUNS ON SPEEDERS  </P> <P> Military police at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station have started using  radar guns in combination with a radar display board to try to reduce speeding  violations.  </P> <P> An officer aims a radar gun at an oncoming vehicle and the display board  sitting on top of the military police car flashes the car's speed. The military  police are authorized to issue speeding tickets based on the radar reading,  said Sgt. John P. Falcetti III, chief accident investigator.  </P> <P> The location of the radar unit will change from day to day, and it will also be  used off-base on Trabuco Road near El Toro Marine School.  </P> <P> Last year, military policemen issued 1,540 speeding tickets on the base. So far  this year, 500 drivers have been ticketed for speeding.  </P></p>

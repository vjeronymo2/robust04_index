			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A total of 6,400 American military personnel and civilians finished moving over  the weekend onto U.S. bases in Panama, widening the rift with the regime of  Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. The U.S. military's Southern Command said the move is  intended to "maintain a low military profile in the face of harassment by the  Panamanian Defense Forces in recent months." It also seems designed to increase  pressure on Noriega to step down by depriving the battered economy of about $60  million a year that the Americans were spending. Instead, they will make  purchases at facilities within the Southern Command. The move was ordered in  May by the Defense Department when violence broke out after the May 7  presidential election.  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Prior says rail plans could destroy jobs LORD PRIOR, the former Tory cabinet minister who chairs General Electric Company, yesterday warned that the government's rail privatisation plans could destroy Britain's trainmaking industry over the next three years. His warning came as the government tried to meet the industry's concerns by publishing a consultation paper on its plans to encourage trainmaking after privatisation. GEC is one of Britain's biggest railway equipment manufacturers, employing a workforce of 4,000 on trainmaking and signalling in a sector directly employing more than 12,000. Lord Prior told the Commons transport committee that the industry had little work beyond the completion of existing contracts and that there were very few home orders in sight. He feared that the government's rail privatisation plans would lead to a drying up of orders because the transition to the new regime would be accompanied by a hiatus in investment. The result would be heavy redundancies. 'Unless some orders come in reasonably quickly there will be no rolling stock industry left in three years' time,' Lord Prior said. 'I don't think that's an exaggeration.' Lord Prior's warning echoed the Railway Industry Association's claim last month that train manufacturers were 'staring annihilation in the face' because of the government's plans. Trainmakers fear that companies winning franchises to operate BR's passenger services will be reluctant to buy or lease new rolling stock because of the risk that they will be unable to find a buyer for it should they fail to renew their franchises. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, yesterday sought to allay the industry's fears about an investment famine with assurances that the gap would be bridged. He said British Rail had been given permission in the 1992 Autumn Statement to lease Pounds 150m-worth of trains. Beyond that, BR would still be operating non-franchised services for years to come and would continue ordering new trains. In addition, he hoped private-sector train manufacturers would embark on the speculative building of rolling stock which it would then lease to train operators. The government also planned to establish public-sector train leasing companies which would be privatised as quickly as possible. Addressing doubts about the private sector's willingness to invest in new trains, Mr Freeman said he did not rule out the possibility of making some franchises conditional on such investment.

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> EISNER GRILLED: Thursday's Disneyland press conference was supposed to be  nostalgic (B6), but from the media ranks came a barbed question: Won't new  admission prices ($25.50 for adults, up 8.5%) keep families away? . . . The  question came from Samantha Test, 11, of La Palma, "cub" reporter for the  Irvine-based Bear Essential News for Kids and caught Disney CEO Michael Eisner  by surprise. "That's the toughest question I've had in a year," he said with a  small laugh, then explained that surveys show patrons will pay the price. Mark  I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

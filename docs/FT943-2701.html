			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Dow wobbles on its erratic flightpath - Wall Street It was a poor start to the week. Just before 2am on Monday morning, a small red and white Cessna 150, apparently on a suicide mission, glided through the sky towards the White House in Washington DC, bounced off the South Lawn, crashed through the branches of a magnolia tree, and came to rest in a crumpled heap beneath President Clinton's bedroom window. As it happened, Bill Clinton was not at home. But if the United States of America could not protect the bedroom of its president from airborne attacks by deranged Maryland truck drivers, investors might have felt entitled to ask, what chance did it stand of successfully managing the economy? Just the Friday before, Wall Street's late summer rally had been abruptly halted by the publication of figures showing a bigger-than-expected rise in the producer prices index. The inference drawn was that, in spite of five increases in interest rates in the last seven months, the Federal Reserve had failed in its efforts to nip inflation in the bud. Stocks plunged on fears that more increases in interest rates would be needed to put the economy back on track, so dampening economic growth, and with it, company profits. Traders were therefore in a jittery mood when the market opened this week. Up till the previous Friday, most economists had thought the Fed would wait until at least November before contemplating any further credit tightenings. Now, they feared the next increase in interest rates could be bigger and earlier. Not even the announcement of yet another mega-merger - a Dollars 2bn bid by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, for Borden, the struggling US food group - was enough to raise investors' spirits, and prices drifted lower as the market waited in nervous anticipation of more bad news on inflation from Tuesday's release of the consumer price data for August. The bad news, however, failed to arrive. In fact, when the figures for consumer prices came out, the index was up by only 0.3 per cent, a figure that compared favourably with the consensus forecast: and as investors breathed a collective sigh of relief, the Dow Jones industrial average performed a smart about-turn, rising more than 19 points. The same thing happened on Wednesday, when figures showing a lower-than-expected increase in August retail sales further damped inflation fears and lifted the Dow Jones index 15 points. And on Thursday, when a survey of business conditions from a regional Federal Reserve Bank brought more good news on inflation, the optimism turned rampant, sending the Dow index up nearly 60 points to its highest since February 3. But it was too good to last. Market sentiment is these days so fragile that it only takes a little bad news to trigger a wave of selling. On Friday morning, that news came in the form of stronger-than-expected figures for August industrial production and capacity utilisation. Suddenly, the market was in flight again: by midday yesterday, as this column went to press, the Dow was down 33.98 at 3919.9. Such fickleness continues to leave investors without any clear lead on the market's direction. Some would like to believe that the US economy has now reached an ideal state in which growth is strong enough to support profit increases but not so strong as to trigger a pick-up in inflation. Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, calls this the Goldilocks economy - one in which the bears are kept at bay - but in the same breath dismisses the scenario as a fairy tale, warning that the market is overvalued and set to plunge by 10-12 per cent. Why the gloom? Salomon points out that, in spite of recent hiccups, the market is now as high as it was at the beginning of the year - yet interest rates are already higher than they were in January, and are set to go higher still. And although the current wave of merger mania in the US may be bullish for stock prices, surges in merger activity have historically been associated with market tops, not market bottoms: witness the late 1920s, late 1960s and mid 1980s. If that were not bearish enough, it also emerged this week that former football star and television personality OJ Simpson had quietly been cashing in more than Dollars 500,000 worth of his shareholdings. Simpson may stand accused of the gory double murder of his former wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ronald Goodman, and probably needs the money for his legal expenses: but it is an ill omen when one of the best-known figures in US popular culture starts pulling out of the stock market. Investors can only hope that his function as a role model is somewhat less than it was.  ------------------------------- Monday       3860.34 -     14.47 Tuesday      3879.86   +   19.52 Wednesday    3895.33   +   15.47 Thursday     3953.88   +   58.55 Friday       3933.35 -     20.53  -------------------------------</p>

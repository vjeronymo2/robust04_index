			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: Labour and industry THE STRIKING feature of Labour's latest attempt to develop an industrial policy is not that it looks like yet another retreat into the nostrums of the 1960s. Rather, it is that the emphasis on manufacturing is no longer an exclusive Labour preoccupation. Much in this new draft could have been written without a blush by members of John Major's government. More could have been written by leading luminaries in the administration of Mr Bill Clinton. But the mere fact that the spirit of the times seems to have moved closer to Labour rather than vice versa is something less than an overwhelming commendation for a mixed bag of policy proposals. The convergence of political interest in manufacturing is, of course, no coincidence. With the country running a huge trade deficit in the depths of recession, the case for shifting resources into manufacturing is easily made. But to jump from there into the technological nationalism espoused by some of Mr Clinton's economic advisers is more contentious. The evidence, such as it is, suggests that success in high-technology industries is a result of general economic success, not the other way around. While the Japanese have demonstrated increasing technological sophistication in generating their economic miracle, their high-growth rates have had more to do with good macro-economic management and a culture that values such things as saving, education and harmonious labour relations, than with any obsession with technology. Labour is nonetheless clearly tempted by a reform of corporate governance that would take Britain closer to systems such as the Japanese or German, which recognise government, employees, creditors and others as having a stake in the business. But most of British management remains antipathetic. Legislating for employees in the boardroom is thus not practical politics. And while Labour has interesting ideas on such things as the structure of the financial system, investment incentives and the operations of the bankruptcy laws, it is not clear that these and other components of industrial policy are central to addressing Britain's competitiveness problem. The country's structural trade deficit is very largely a reflection of inadequate investment in the production of tradeable goods and services, itself largely explained by stop-go policies and consistently low profitability. What is needed is to constrain the growth of real wages and stimulate higher savings and investment. It is questionable, however, whether Labour, any more than the Tories, would be willing to forgo the customary pre-electoral boost to wages and reduction in private savings that deliver votes, but at the cost of swelling the trade deficit and restarting the stop-go cycle. It is here, not in technological mercantilism, that the miracle economies of the east have the most valuable lessons to impart.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [David Hencke report: "Thatcher's Secret Arms Deal"] </F>   [Text] Britain agreed a secret pact with Malaysia to  subsidise defence exports for British Aerospace and GEC [General  Electric Company] as part of the 1 billion pound arms-for-aid  deal involving the Pergau dam, according to a confidential  document signed between the two governments by Lady Thatcher and  Mohammed Mahathir in September 1988.    The memorandum of understanding, a copy of which has been  obtained by the GUARDIAN reveals that the Government was  prepared to set up cheap loans for the Malaysians to subsidise  their purchase of British defence exports. The Government would  pay the difference between the banks' commercial rates and the  concessionary rate it was offering, involving potential  subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds.    Labour and Liberal Democrat MP's expressed outrage last  night. The terms of the memorandum were "absolutely monstrous,"  said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman.    The funding deal is in addition to the 234 million pound aid  that Britain agreed to give to Malaysia to build the Pergau dam,  which was described as a bad buy by Sir Tim Lankester, permanent  secretary at the Overseas Development Administration.    Foreign Office ministers have already admitted that this aid  was tied to a mathematical formula on the sale of arms.    On funding, the agreement reads: "The total payment for any  equipment procured under this (memorandum) will be provided by  the Malaysian government but in the event that there is any  shortfall in the funding, the United Kingdom government will  assist in the arrangement of financial facilities provided by a  United Kingdom bank or a group of United Kingdom banks and the  United Kingdom will ensure that the interest to be charged will  be at concessionary rates."    The 15-part memorandum reveals that Britain was prepared to  go further than the normal practice of providing spares and  ensuring that defence companies offered training to foreign  troops and pilots in the use of arms equipment. In this case  the Government agreed to train Malaysian troops in Britain in  military strategy, advising on war and defence plans.    The document reveals that like the huge arms deal with Saudi  Arabia, Lady Thatcher agreed to set up a unit inside the  Ministry of Defence [MoD] in support of the 1 billion pound  deal, and she established an MoD team in Malaysia to assist.    Lady Thatcher also agreed to supply the Malaysians with a  list of firms supplying arms aircraft and ships, and advising on  companies the Government regarded as most reliable.    The British proposed to charge the Malaysian government a  sum  tied to the order price of up to 10 million pounds as a  management fee for its assistance in training and advice,  including a down-payment of 1 million pounds within 30 days of  the first order being made.    Mr Campbell said: "The terms of the funding arrangements  which required the British government to arrange cheap credit  for the Malaysian government are absolutely monstrous. What  possible justification can there be for such an arrangement  unless there was a direct connection with some other financial  deal?"    Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, which  includes the Swan Hunter shipyard which lost the bid for two  Malaysian frigates to its rivals Yarrow Shipbuilders, said:  "Contrary to what we were told by the Government at the time,  Britain was secretly rating the bids from different companies  instead of operating a level playing field."    George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, said: "This is  absolutely outrageous. It amounts to a sweetheart deal financed  by the British taxpayer."    The deal has led to an order for British Aerospace Hawk  trainer aircraft and two frigates from Yarrow, a GEC subsidiary.  But orders for Tornado aircraft and submarines have not  materialised.    Last night the Foreign Office said the memorandum was  confidential: "It is only for the eyes of both governments and  is not a published document."</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Books: An isle full of noises and sweet airs - The contradictions, charm and, above all, the chatter of a nation in flux IRELAND AND THE IRISH: PORTRAIT OF A CHANGING SOCIETY by John Ardagh Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 446 pages The dinner party had been a fairly tame affair. As the Irish evening light faded, topics would momentarily flare into life then, like rainbows, evaporate as sentences were left unfinished and mouths were delicately wiped. But then someone mentioned De Valera. A small, elderly gentleman, whose only contribution to the evening had been a hearty burp over the soup, sprang to life. 'De Valera was a cantankerous, humourless old bollocks,' he said, his pudgy little legs kicking the air. 'The worst thing to have happened to this miserable little country since Cromwell. That man (here he brandished his fish knife, sending a piece of turbot au beurre flying through the candlesticks) set Ireland back 200 years.' Things were not the same again. Tempers flared. Manners were forgotten as the civil war was replayed across the dinner table. Fresh drinks were petulantly called for. By the time coffee and liqueurs were served in the lounge - 'Make mine a large one: none of your Protestant meanness here,' shouted one guest to his landowning, but very Catholic, host - it was a verbal free for all. Dark personal secrets were revealed. A bottom or two was pinched. A large lady walking unsteadily to the lavatory almost garotted herself on a Victorian umbrella stand, collapsing in a heap of suspenders and stretched velvet. There is nothing the Irish like more than talking - particularly about themselves. It amounts to a national disease. Whole summer schools are devoted to the subject - hour after hour, year after year. The conclusions are inconclusive. The Irish are charming, difficult, spontaneous, unreliable, creative and knavish. They are Europeans, but not really. They are certainly nothing to do with the English - though it is grudgingly admitted that there are more of us over there than over here. In short, the Irish are unique - in their own sort of way. John Ardagh is charmed by the Irish. He has put together a highly readable account of the way Ireland is changing and how it is, a trifle self consciously, coming to terms with the modern world. Ardagh's energy cannot be doubted. He crisscrossed the country talking to scores of people from various shades of society. His list of thanks and acknowledgements reads like a Who's Who of modern Ireland. But somehow Ardagh is too kind. He makes the Englishman's mistake of believing too much of what the Irish tell him. Ardagh finds a great wealth of talent in Ireland. That is true. But Ardagh is too fond of littering his text with gushing adjectives. At least one person is described as astonishing, others are marvellous. Several people or their books and newspaper columns are brilliant. Ardagh admits to being pleasantly surprised by Northern Ireland. Its people, he finds, generally have more about them than the more easy going southerners. But again he cannot resist a bit of hyperbole. 'The people are marvellous, second to none.' Mary Robinson, the president, is one of the brilliant ones. 'A creaking political system - but a fine new woman President' is the irritating sub heading in one chapter. President Robinson is doubtless one of the best things to have happened to modern Ireland. But as Ardagh points out, she might have influence but she has no power in a country where political talent - in contrast to the cultural or academic spheres - is very thin on the ground. As is hinted at, Ireland has been a badly run country. The sleeve note on his book describes Ardagh as 'a strong believer in the battered old idea of European union.' There is no doubt that EU membership has brought great advantages to Ireland. It has widened cultural horizons, raised incomes, particularly of the farmers, and done away with some of the old dependence on Britain. But EU membership has introduced a new kind of dependence. Irish politicians gleefully talk about 'the take' from Brussels. EU membership has only delayed the painful adjustment of Irish agriculture to the modern market economy. In spite of the Irish diaspora spread round the world, Ireland itself remains an insular society, hardly part of the European mainstream. Ardagh does explode many of the old myths about Ireland by focusing on society as it is and not, as tourism promoters would have it, as some kitsch theme park full of Yeats and leprechauns. In the midst of all the interviews it is a pity that Ardagh does not pause for a bit more fun. When he does it illuminates what at times is a somewhat repetitive journal. Ardagh describes meeting Garech Browne, part of the Guinness clan and an eccentric even by Irish standards. 'Garech is married to an Indian princess who is sometimes around. He was asleep when I arrived as agreed at 7pm, but eventually he woke up and remembered who I was . . .' Garech is founder of one of Ireland's most successful recording companies but had no record player in the house. Ardagh relates how Garech takes him out to sit in his old Mercedes where, 'shivering under the starry March night, we listened to cassettes of glorious Irish folk music on its radio. I went home very happy.'</p>

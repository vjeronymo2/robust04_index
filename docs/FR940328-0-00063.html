			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, one commenter stated that a different rationale statement should be permitted for irradiated product. They suggested that a reference should be made to the reductions in bacterial counts that irradiation produces. While FSIS does not agree with this comment, it anticipates addressing the issue of label claims related to emerging pathogen reduction treatments in the future. However, these statements should not be a substitute for the required safe handling instructions since the handling statements also apply to treated products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Handling Statements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters suggested allowing flexibility on the cross contamination, cooking, and leftover statements similar to the flexibility permitted in the proposal for the refrigeration statement. Three commenters suggested that deviations in the statements could be approved through the prior approval system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS does not agree with these comments. In the long term, differences between label messages would work against consumer recognition of the one label message. In addition, this is supported by five commenters who recommended that FSIS make no changes in the text of the safe handling statements and one commenter that stated that it was in the best interest of both consumers and the industry to have only one set of safe handling instructions since the existence of more than one statement would only contribute to consumer and industry confusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that we require the FSIS Hotline number with the label. The Meat and Poultry Hotline telephone number may be included on other parts of the label. FSIS does not have enough information about the impact of including this phone number on the label. Requiring it on 15 billion packages of product per year might easily overwhelm the Hotline resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One fast-food restaurant chain suggested that FSIS permit deviations in the refrigeration statement, as well as in other statements, if they conflicted with company policy or other printed company materials including operating manuals. FSIS is not persuaded by this comment to make any changes in the regulation. FSIS believes that the flexibility provided for the refrigeration statement is adequate to accommodate the only significant area of concern identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that FSIS add a recommendation for disinfecting or sanitizing hard surfaces because washing cutting boards with soap and water will not guarantee elimination of pathogens. One of the commenters suggested that this be included in leaflets containing other expanded information, such as cooking temperatures. They recommend that the leaflets be required to be available at the point-of-sale in addition to the safe handling labels on the products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washing of working surfaces has been found to be an effective means of reducing pathogens on cutting boards, utensils, etc. Use of a sanitizing agent would add another margin of safety, however, FSIS believes that the current message conveys the importance of washing working surfaces that have contacted raw product. This was further supported by the focus-study research. Participants preferred short word messages, and indicated that the longer the messages, the less likely consumers would be to read them. While FSIS encourages programs to provide additional information on safe handling at the point-of-sales, it believes that additional verbiage might detract from the efficacy of the label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the cross contamination statement be revised to include washing before and after contact with raw meat and poultry. While FSIS agrees that this is a good practice, the focus of these statements is avoidance of contamination of other ready-to-eat foods with raw meat and poultry products. This change will not be incorporated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six commenters stated that more explicit cooking instructions were necessary. The commenters suggested that visual signs of doneness and/or internal temperatures be required or at least allow the flexibility in the cooking statement to include such information. One commenter recommended that FSIS provide the proscribed internal cooking temperatures for each type of raw meat and poultry that would be labeled as well as a descriptive statement to accompany the internal cooking temperature. One suggested that a descriptive visual definition will provide safeguards for any consumer who is unable or unwilling to measure the internal temperature of their meat. One consumer group suggested that visual keys were preferable to the use of internal temperatures, as consumers may misunderstand the internal temperature to be a cooking temperature. They stated that it is critical to provide more specific cooking instructions since there is no single definition of ``thoroughly cooked'' among consumers. One meat trade association stated that the cooking instructions were adequate for the safe handling label because consumers want simple accurate information. In addition, they stated that it would be more appropriate to include more detailed handling information in a brochure or pamphlet which could be distributed at the point-of-purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS does not believe it would be appropriate to add either an endpoint temperature or more comprehensive cooking directions because cooking temperatures and other visual indications of doneness vary by product. As stated above, this labeling is not intended to replace comprehensive cooking statements that accompany many products. Additionally, as cited earlier, more complex messages might reduce the likelihood of consumer use of the label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A consumer group suggested that FSIS include a time limit with the leftover statement, such as the two hours mentioned in the interim regulation. Another commenter representing a restaurant chain suggested that the leftover statement be eliminated in situations where company policy strictly controls holding time for products and the sale of leftover meat and poultry products is not permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

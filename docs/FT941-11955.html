			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures selling wipes out initial market gains - Market Report Another powerful early showing by the UK stock marketdrove the FT-SE 100 Index to yet another all-time intraday peak. But it ran outof steam in midsession when the Footsie future turned sharply lower and, later,Wall Street succumbed to a bout of profit-taking. The FT-SE 100 was, however, sprinkled with some big winners, with British Aerospace turning in anothersparkling performance as the City continued to register its approval of BMW's purchase of the Rover car manufacturer. There was also said to have been another significant shift from the FT-SE 100 constituents and into the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks after the recent bout of underperformance by the latter. Dealers saidmany of the big securities houses, which have been lining up covered warrants against the second-line stocks, had moved in to cover short positions on their trading books. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange is launching its FT-SE Mid 250 Index futures contract on February 25. The sell-off in equities was said to have been triggered largely by an abrupt turnround in international bond markets and talk of a big seller in the Footsie future. Share prices moved ahead strongly at the outset, with the FT-SE 100 Indexreaching an all-time peak of 3,514.3 within an hour of the opening as the cash market responded to Wall Street's overnight advance to record levels and the further rise by the Tokyo equity market. The market suddenly came under pressure, however, as the appearance of a big seller saw the FT-SE future dive and trade at a discount to the cash market for much of the rest of the session. What disconcerted other traders in the Liffe market was that the big seller had only minutes earlier been an aggressive buyer of the future. Gilt-edged stocksalso played a big part in the market's retreat. News of the resignation of the deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve was said to have unnerved US bonds, whichin turn brought substantial downward pressure to bear on UK gilts. At its worst, the FT-SE 100 showed a loss of 20.8 points, before stabilising in the last hour of the trading session as the second-line stocks continued to climb. The FT-SE 100 finished 10.3 off on the day at 3,481.5, while the FT-SE Mid Cap settled 21.1 higher at 4,105.4. Turnover was a heavy 1.087bn shares, marginally ahead of Monday's 1.084bn, with activity in second liners accounting for 699.3m shares, or 64 per cent of the total. The Stock Exchange said the value of customer business transacted in the market on Monday was Pounds 1.76bn, below levels reached last week but still well above usual daily amounts for January. The mo tor component stocks were said to have attracted extremely heavy demand and to have played a big part in the strong showing by the Mid 250 Index. HSBC Holdings was the focus of attention in a busy banks area, with the shares sprinting ahead amid hints that one of the big securities houses  - BZW was mentioned - could be about to issue a covered warrant against the shares. Life stocks were boosted by suggestions of an imminent buy recommendation for companies such asLloyds Abbey and Legal &amp; General. The relisting of Berisford saw the shares rocket as the market displayed its pleasure with the terms of its acquisition of the Magnet business.</p>

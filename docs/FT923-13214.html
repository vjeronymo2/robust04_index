			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Feminists to a man - Television SINCE we no longer seem to have the sort of judges who quaver 'What are the Beatles?', we really ought to slap a preservation order on Lord Rees-Mogg, who clearly comes from the same club. Peering out from behind those spectacles and speaking in that endearing lisp, he delivers wonderfully potty pronouncements upon television. His latest corker is the assertion that because television is run largely by men, television drama is dominated by male attitudes and male fantasies, and for evidence he cites the sex scenes in Melvyn Bragg's A Time To Dance. It seems his attention was drawn to this by complaints to his clean-up group. How many complaints? Conveniently he cannot remember. More than 300? 'Oh no, less than that'. It would not be surprising if it was fewer than 30, since the BBC's monthly aggregation of complaints by category shows that sex comes way down the list, usually outnumbered 20, 30 or 40 times by complaints about scheduling ('Why, oh why must you drop children's programmes to stay with the tennis?'). What the dear old buffer has missed is that even though men do predominate in broadcasting, these days they are feminists to a man, which has a profound effect upon television drama, a fact which could not possibly escape anybody who watched as much television as the average viewer. From Coronation Street to Clarissa men are depicted with contempt. They are shown as weak, inept, inferior to women in every way, and simultaneously sexually rapacious and incapable of satisfying women in bed. If he watched Eldorado he would find that the men ranged from wimps to criminals, all of them inadequate, stupid, sly, or incompetent - sometimes all four. Did Lord Rees-Mogg see ITV's excellently acted and produced Firm Friends with Billie Whitelaw and Madhur Jaffrey, which treated all men as something that needed scraping off women's shoes? Still, we should not complain too much; the prating peer adds hugely to the sum of national merriment.                               *      *      * Disparaging men as a group is, of course, highly fashionable (imagine programmes taking the same attitude to black people) and is unlikely to harm Eldorado. The word 'flop' has been used widely to describe a first night audience of 6m, a figure undreamed of in the circulation departments of the newspapers using the word. Twice as many people, we are told, watched ITV's spoiler - the 60-minute Coronation Street special. What we are not told, though it must surely be significant now that more than 80 per cent of British homes have video recorders, is how many regular Street viewers, who presumably constitute the bulk of Eldorado's target audience, were taping the newcomer while watching their old favourite. No soap opera ever started at the top of the ratings, and the proof of the Eldorado pudding will, as usual, be in the eating. Leaving aside the quality of the drama, this promises to be a long term winner. The idea of using the sunny Spanish setting, familiar to so many package-tour Britons, as the permanent location looks shrewd (a perpetual holiday) and the success of the Australian soaps suggests that the teenage element will also be a big attraction. Whether the BBC ought to be spending Pounds 10m a year on such stuff is another question, but 12 months from now, when Eldorado is nudging Coronation Street at the top of the ratings, the BBC will use it as proof that they do not merely spend the licence fee on pointy-headed drama for a Hampstead minority but serve all the public some of the time.                               *      *      * Lord Rees-Mogg has not been the only source of 'Shock] Horror]' headlines about television recently. Reports about the current issue of Cultural Trends say that, according to its figures from the Policy Studies Institute, viewers are watching four hours a week less television today than they were in 1985. Yet if you consult the figures produced by BARB, the joint BBC/ITV ratings body, you find that the hours viewed in the first week of the month for the first six months of 1985 and 1992 (this year's figures in brackets) are: 34.03 (32.47), 29.44 (29.09), 28.13 (28.59), 27.56 (27.53), 25.19 (26.19) and 22.27 (23.13). Of course newspapers love 'trends' which show television viewing falling, but not only do these figures fail to bear out the claimed trend (over the long term the graph shows a pretty steady rise) but today's figures still exclude the viewing of rented videos.                               *      *      * However big the ratings for televised motor racing (and in Britain it seems likely that nationalism is currently a major factor in these figures, thanks to Nigel Mansell's unprecedented success), the sport as spectacle becomes more and more tedious because of the Alice In Wonderland handicapping system. In a sensible sport such as sailing, you establish which boats go fastest and start them at the back of the fleet so that they have to overtake everyone else to win. In motor racing, as viewers of the British Grand Prix saw on Sunday, they do the opposite, starting the fastest car from the front. The effect, predictably, is a procession in which the fastest car is never passed. The televising of soccer with its boring nil-nil draws has prompted this column to demand the doubling of goal sizes and the abandonment of goalies in the hope of achieving 50 or 60 goals a match. For the sake of viewers everywhere, perhaps this should be broadened into a Campaign For Sensible Sport, urging that in motor racing the slowest should start first and the fastest last, with enough of a stagger to avoid crashes at the first bend. If they wanted a real contest of driver skills, they could handicap the cars according to their speed - but that might scupper the constructors' championship.                               *      *      * Does your heart sink when you are watching a good athletics meeting and the commentator follows an event with the words 'Now Charlie Farnsbarns is trackside with my colleague. . .'? Willy-nilly, the programme comes to a halt and is turned into a chat show, usually a bad one. You can hear athletes parroting coaches and newspaper reporters ('Well, with the Olympics coming up it's gotta be a great morale booster for me' said Colin Jackson during ITV's Crystal Palace programme on Friday), just as you can hear convicts in prison documentaries parroting social workers ('I'm alienated from me dad, see, it's all sibling rivalry, innit?'). If the rule was that interviews with athletes were screened only when they had something original to say we would get 50 per cent more sport in these programmes. Channel 4's Tour De France gets it right: they leave the race for about 30 seconds to tell you some odd detail about modern bicycle design or a rider's antecedents, and then dive straight back into the peloton.                               *      *      * There are so few programmes of arts criticism on television that almost any addition is welcome, but Siskel and Ebert, the cinema series on BBC2, seems a particularly odd choice. First, one of the few critical programmes we do already have is Barry Norman's excellent Film 92, so the time would be better devoted to dance or drama or even television itself, a subject in which the public is rather interested despite the supercilious attitude of many broadcasting executives who tend to watch even less than Lord Rees-Mogg. Second, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert make their buddy-buddy programme about new releases for an American network, so they are forever saying 'Coming up next ..' or 'After the break ..' which, on BBC2, is absurd because all they can do is fade to black and promptly resume. Moreover talk about a movie being a 'CN17 not an R' is meaningless in Britain. Why not Powell and Andrews or Malcolm and Walker?</p>

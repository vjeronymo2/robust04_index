			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Hopes of saving failed hospital The Health Care International medical centre at Clydebank, which went into receivership after receiving Pounds 27m of public money, could be saved, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. Investors believe the private hospital might still be made to pay, he told MPs on the Commons Scottish Affairs committee. But Mr Lang all but ruled out the idea of the Pounds 180m development being handed to the National Health Service.</p>

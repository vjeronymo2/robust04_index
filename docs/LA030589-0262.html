			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'WOMEN BLITZED BY PRO-LIFERS'  </P> <P> In her Feb. 13 Notebook ("Women -- Pregnant or Not -- Blitzed by Pro-Lifers,"  Orange County section), reporter Dianne Klein uses third-hand quotes and  opinions from Planned Parenthood about what Randy Adler, pastor of Stone  Mountain Church, supposedly said as one of the speakers at a pro-life rescue  rally last month.  </P> <P> I was at that rally. Pastor Adler did indeed refer to a possible loss of life  in the conflict over abortion: Those who do not flinch at tearing babies limb  from limb will hardly think twice about murdering those who peaceably stand in  their way. Yet Klein obligingly provides quotes comparing Adler to the infamous  Jim Jones. Obviously, asking Planned Parenthood about the pro-life rescue  movement is like asking Adolph Hitler about the French Resistance.  </P> <P> Klein writes that when she approached an abortionist's office, she was met by  peaceful people who gave her a smile, information about unborn life and an  offer of help. She is offended that anyone would tell a pregnant woman that an  unborn baby is more than just a blob of "uterine contents."  </P> <P> Klein is outraged that anyone would dare to show a pregnant woman exactly what  that defenseless baby looks like before the scalpel and the vacuum get to it.  When will Klein have the journalistic honesty to show what that baby looks like  after the abortionist gets through with it?  </P> <P> Klein and The Times would have us believe that unborn children are less than  human -- the property of their mothers, to do with as they please. They protest  that it is illegal to stand between a pregnant woman and the abortionist's  knife. Well, as we all know, 150 years ago some Americans were legally termed  less than human and the property of others. Thank God that the abolitionists  and the Underground Railroad were willing to risk arrest and their very lives  to do what was right, not what was "legal." May we all have that same insight  and courage today.  </P> <P> IRINA McGUIRK  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Gold market surges still higher GOLD CONTINUED to hold centre-stage on the world commodities scene this week as options-related activity added to the upward momentum generated at the end of last month by the concerted operations of two high-profile international investors. Most buyers seemed to have taken the day off on Monday following last week's exertions, but with producer selling not making its expected appearance the market was still able to edge up a few cents. That bolstered the buyers confidence and they had little trouble pushing the price through resistance at Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the way to Wednesday's 27-month high of Dollars 384.50 an ounce on the London bullion market. That was more than Dollars 40 above the level ruling four weeks ago when the market learnt that Sir James Goldsmith had sold Dollars 400m worth of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest US gold producer, to Mr George Soros and had used some of the money to buy gold options. A retracement from the mid-week peak was linked by some New York traders to unconfirmed reports that Mr Soros had been selling gold. They said the reports had 'spooked' the market, although analysts were generally highly sceptical about them. 'They haven't achieved any credibility,' Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers told the Reuter news agency. But he thought they might nevertheless be doing the market a service by helping to 'shake out some of the silly money'. The shake-out, which took the gold price down to Dollars 372 at one stage, seemed to be over yesterday, however, when it consolidated to end at Dollars 375.15 an ounce, up Dollars 1.90 on the day and Dollars 7.35 on the week. Traders thought the short-term technical outlook remained bullish and there was optimism for the longer term. In a report issued yesterday Union Bancaire Privee, a Geneva-based private bank, suggested that a further rise in the gold price to between Dollars 380 and Dollars 400 an ounce looked justified in coming months. It said market fundamentals had improved with production levelling off, demand picking up and sales by Russia and central banks likely to diminish. Looking still further ahead Mr Paul Lennie, deputy managing director of Mase Westpac, a leading bullion house, told mining analysts in London that he expected the bull market to be maintained over the next year. In the absence of central bank selling and with diminished forward sales by producers the gold price had to rise, he said, and heavy overhead resistance at Dollars 440 an ounce was likely to be tested 'sometime in the next 12 months'. At the London Metal Exchange copper prices continued last week's rally, helped by a 6.7 per cent rise in April US housing starts, but failed to break resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,850 a tonne for the three months delivery contract. That level was briefly exceeded yesterday as the market continued to defy bearish fundamentals and shrugged off a further rise in exchange warehouse stocks to a nine-year high. But the price slipped back to just below Dollars 1,840 a tonne at the close. In sterling terms the three months position was Pounds 37 up on the week at Dollars 1,201.50 a tone. Lead was again the weakest LME market as warehouse stocks rose to a fresh record of 254,125 tonnes. The three months price slide another Pounds 9 on the week to a 6 3/4 -year low of Pounds 265.25 a tonne. Three months tin reversed an early rise to end Dollars 37.50 down on the week at Dollars 5,505 a tonne. It had touched Dollars 5,500 yesterday morning before finding support. The market derived little encouragement from a meeting last weekend of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, from which officials were reported to have emerged confused about what action to take to try to shore up world prices. Mr Redzwan Sumun, the association's executive secretary said its members, who account for about 60 per cent of world tin production, were debating whether it was worthwhile carrying on with their export quota scheme. The ATPC estimates world tin stocks at about 40,000 tonnes, double the level it had originally set as the target for the end of this year. Producers outside the ATPC, like Peru, Burma, Vietnam and Portugal, have been increasing their tin exports, while the foreign exchange-hungry former Soviet Union, which used to be a big importer, has become an exporter. London's robusta coffee market put in a stronger performance as short positions were covered against the possibility of progress being made at weekend producer talks on proposals to withhold beans from the market in an effort to push prices to more a remunerative level. The July position finished at Dollars 947 a tonne, up Dollars 19 on the day and Dollars 61 on the week. Technically-inspired selling weighed down raw sugar prices and New York's October futures contract was trading late yesterday at 12.31 cents a lb, down 0.50 on the week, having moved below 12 cents at one stage. Nearby prices are still some 30 per cent higher than they were three months ago but investors are looking for signs of improved demand before restoring the uptrend. On the supply side there was more bullish news this week when C. Czarnikow, the London broker, cut its forecast of world production in 1992-93 by 3m tonnes to 111.6m tonnes. It now predicts a supply deficit of 2.84m tonnes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium       +4,625      to      1,796,975 Copper          +2,125      to        413,675 Lead            +3,275      to        254,125 Nickel          +2,154      to         94,656 Zinc            +6,875      to        655,375 Tin               -125      to         20,360  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

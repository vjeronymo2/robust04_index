			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Former BCCI executive in US on fraud charges Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, appeared on fraud charges in a US court yesterday, after being flown to the country on Saturday. Mr Naqvi, who was number two at the bank under Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder, had been in custody in Abu Dhabi since soon after the bank was closed in a worldwide swoop by regulators in July 1991. US prosecutors secured his extradition in a January deal with Abu Dhabi authorities. In federal court in Washington yesterday, Mr Naqvi pleaded not guilty to four counts of fraud. These cover BCCI's alleged attempt to gain secret control of a US bank, First American Bankshares, along with three other financial institutions in the country. If convicted, he could face a maximum of 31 years in jail and a Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 503,000) fine. Mr Naqvi was taken to jail pending a further hearing on June 15. He has already pleaded guilty to fraud charges in Abu Dhabi, but has not yet been sentenced. If sentenced to jail in both countries, he would serve the US term first.</p>

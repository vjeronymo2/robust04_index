			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has expressed on  Monday a bewilderment in connection with the pronouncements on  the problem of human rights in Latvia and Estonia made by the  U.S. President Bill Clinton during his visit to Moscow.    "There are no violations of human rights of the sort which  was alleged to", the Latvian president stressed at the briefing  devoted to a regular meeting of the Council of National Security  of the republic.    The results of the meeting of the U.S. and Russian  presidents  and the Partnership for Peace program in the NATO framework were  discussed at the meeting.    "I cannot believe that the two superpowers have finally  decided the fate of small countries" said G. Ulmanis answering  the questions about the attitude to the references of B. Clinton  and B. Yeltsin to the Baltic states, in particular to the  dependence of the schedule of withdrawal of Russian troops from  Latvia and Estonia on the solution of the human rights problem.    The president thinks that "a law on citizenship must be  passed as soon as possible in Latvia which would exclude any  speculations on the subject of human rights". Ulmanis said that  he was expecting information from the Russian and American sides  on the final deadline of withdrawal of Russian troops from  Latvia and Estonia and on the conditions of keeping a Russian  radar station on the territory of Latvia.    In the nearest future, said Ulmanis, Latvia will send a  letter to the NATO leadership with agreement to participate in  the Partnership for Progress [as received] in accordance with a  decision taken at the Council of National Security meeting.    The president emphasized that in view of joining the  Partnership for Progress, where Russia will also participate,  Latvia must "carefully review its relations with Russia".    G. Ulmanis also said that the Latvia's joining of NATO is "a  remote prospect".</p>

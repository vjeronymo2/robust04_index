			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lithuanian land reform yields crop of problems - Undersized farms are unable to meet output requirements LITHUANIA'S agricultural economy proves the trite maxim that the trick is in the construction. Destruction was the easy part. In 1991, the largest Baltic state started breaking up the collectives. The stated goals were: first, to make a dislocated sector competitive; and, second, to raise output by returning land to former owners. On both counts, the approach has failed, and not repeating its mistakes may be the lingering lesson for former Soviet-bloc states in similar straits. Speed was never a problem. The 1,058 collectives were quickly split up into 413,000 plots of no more than 3 hectares each. So far about 80 per cent of state agricultural assets have been privatised. The generous land restitution scheme has created 104,000 new private family farms - in a country of only 3.7m people. Production plummeted last year. The 1992 grain and potato harvests, for example, were down to 66 per cent and 72 per cent of the 1991 level respectively. Expectations for 1993, a wet season, are only slightly better. Other sectors reveal similar drops. 'The collectives have been destroyed. What instead? No one knows,' says Mr Czeslaw Okinczyc, a former member of parliament. 'Chaotic agricultural reforms have brought down the industry.' But low output figures, seen across the former Soviet Union, were expected, if not to this extent. Lithuania, under Soviet rule, was assigned to produce surplus meat, milk and poultry products and to depend on grain shipments from other republics, mainly Ukraine. Autonomy does not come overnight. Western aid - now totalling Dollars 48.7m, of which Dollars 3.80m comes from the European Community's Phare program - is helping to develop private production, free-market principles and broader trading links. These were anticipated problem areas. The Achilles' heel has been land reform. The state unilaterally promised to restore owners, and their numerous offspring, to their pre-1939 plots. So large tracts of land were broken up into small farms, many of which cannot compete in either the domestic or foreign market. The average farm size dropped to 9 hectares this summer, but it has not bottomed out. Demand for plots appears to be insatiable: 450,000 applications for land restitution are still pending. At this rate Lithuania may be severely crippled. A healthy agricultural economy, according to western experts, requires average farm sizes comfortably above 10 hectares. Of course, products like strawberries and flowers need little space, but self-sufficiency demands diversity. 'If they continue dividing land for privatisation's sake,' says Mr Johannes Ostergaard, an EC consultant at the Ministry of Agriculture, 'they'll go down to 6 hectares - and that's not reasonable'. Denmark, a small but developed country, is often used as the benchmark for the Balts. Average farm size in Denmark is about 40 hectares and rising. Lithuania may be wise to match that figure, post-Soviet politics permitting. The new government, dominated by the old nomenklatura, understands the predicament. Parliament recently prohibited division of farmland below 20 hectares. Other forms of compensation now have to be found. They do not have to look far. In Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic states, land was sold to the highest bidders while former owners were compensated with shares in industrial enterprises. But Lithuanian officials deny that the process went too fast and too far. 'We believe people will work better now,' says Mr Virgilijus Skulskis, privatisation director at the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Our people don't understand their enterprises are private yet.' Indeed, psychology rather than economics resonates more powerfully, even among experts. 'All farms in the United States and Denmark started small,' explains Ms Onute Babraviciene, the country director for the US non-profit group, Volunteers in Overseas Co-operative Assistance. 'They have to feel what it's like to be private. People are so proud to be farmers.' Co-operatives, now a political hot potato, are a possible future solution. Ms Babraviciene, whose group promotes this idea, says 'people who can see that's difficult to be alone will be the leaders of the future'. Ultimately, however, the open market may provide the answer. "Farmers with 2 or 5 hectares will not want to be farmers,' said Mr Skulskis, who hopes large agribusiness concerns eventually will consolidate many small farms. Yet with unexpected hurdles put in the way, the transition to a healthy agricultural economy may now take more than the one or two years originally expected.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lithuanian Crop Yields (tonnes per hectare)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------               1995(f)  1994(f)  1993(e)   1992    1991    1990    1989  --------------------------------------------------------------------- All grains       2.70     2.60     2.20   1.91    3.08    3.00    2.91 wheat (winter)   3.29     2.92     2.68   2.97    3.15    3.39    3.61 wheat (spring)   2.60     2.40     2.30   1.48    2.98    2.55    2.89 barley           2.69     2.44     2.12   1.66    3.25    2.99    2.78 oats             2.20     2.10     2.00   0.82    2.87    2.63    2.24 potatoes        17.00    15.00    14.00   9.60   14.20   14.00   16.10  --------------------------------------------------------------------- (f) = forecast; (e) = estimated.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lithuanian Ministry of Agriculture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

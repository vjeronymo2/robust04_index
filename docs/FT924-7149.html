			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Executive salary rises 'slowing' EXECUTIVE pay increases have slowed by 50 per cent over the past 12 months, approaching the same level of increases as other employees, according to data from the Monks Partnership, executive pay analysts. But Mr John Major's appeal for pay restraint in the boardroom was not welcomed by Lord King, British Airways chairman and one of the UK's highest-paid chairmen, who said top businessmen needed competitive salaries to reflect productivity. Lord King said: 'I think we should be careful about going back to the awful mistakes of the Heath days. We must have the freedom to run our companies, and if we want to attract talent we have to be able to pay for it.' Other industrialists welcomed Mr Major's call, which was made at the Lord Mayor's Banquet on Tuesday night. The latest estimates from Monks' clients suggest that directors and senior managers will this year receive basic increases of about 4 per cent, down from the 5 per cent to 6 per cent predicted in July. Monks calculates that directors and senior managers last year received basic rises of about 8 per cent. However, the latest signals emerging from the private sector are mixed, in spite of government calls to follow its public-sector pay limit of 1.5 per cent. National Power, the privatised electricity generator, has approved a basic pay rise of 3.95 per cent for about 9,000 staff, most of whom also received a Pounds 2,000 lump-sum payment for accepting a new deal on preformance pay and flexible working hours. The main industrial unions support the deal, meaning it is almost certain to be accepted. Mr Doug Rooney, of the AEEU electricians' and engineering workers' union, said the performance element was unusual for industrial workers. Meanwhile, several GEC subsidiaries have imposed pay freezes, including GPT, the telecommunications group, and GEC-Ferranti. Others, including the Anglo-French engineering group GEC Alsthom, have awarded small pay rises. The TUC public services committee met yesterday to co-ordinate opposition to the government's 1.5 per cent limit for the public sector, but few union officials predict industrial unrest. The TUC wants to meet the prime minister over the matter. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the public service union Nupe, did not rule out strike action.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 5 March  carry items on the possible impact on the ROK economy of the  United States' revival of the Super 301.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 carries an 800-word  editorial entitled "U.S. Economic Hegemonism." The editorial  begins: "The U.S. Clinton administration revived `Super 301,'  the foreign trade retaliation law, despite the world's  consistent opposition to it. We cannot help expressing grave  concern over this unilateral trade strategy taking the world  free trade hostage. The United States and Japan, which led the  situation to this consequence, should feel responsible for it as  major economic powers and resolve the dispute in a reasonable  way." The editorial says the U.S. action runs counter to the  multilateral Uruguay Round system, adding: "The Uruguay Round  system is faced with a crisis of withering to death even before  its official signing." The editorial then notes: "The Super  301 is aimed at Japan and may cause little impact in view of the  fact that ROK-U.S. trade is balanced and there are few pending  issues between the two countries. However, in the long run, it  can be used as a weapon to pressure us to open our goods and  services market wider. Moreover, this `economic hegemonism' can  incapacitate multilateral negotiations and curb the world's free  trade development, bringing about considerable loss for  exporting countries like us." The editorial then says: "We can  appreciate the super-tough position the United States is taking  in view of the fact that the United States has a more than $110  billion trade deficit (in 1993) over half of which comes from  its trade deficit with Japan." The editorial then stresses that  Japan should open its market wider, and urges the United States  to make internal efforts to improve the deficit situation.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 5 carries an 800-word  article by reporter Yang Ki-tae entitled "What Impact Will the  Super 301 Have on Our Economy?"    The article begins: "Although the U.S. Super 301 is aimed,  in the first place, at Japan, it can cause direct and indirect  shockwaves to our foreign trade and industries. We could even  become an object of retaliation to the same degree as Japan."  The article then notes: "The United States is putting  continuous pressure on the ROK to open financial and  distribution markets, the market areas for which the Uruguay  Round negotiation has not reached settlement, and, therefore,  the Super 301 could be used to pressure the ROK to make  additional market openings." The article then concludes: "Some  observers, however, think that the revival of the Super 301 may  not necessarily be a disadvantage to us. Since sufficient  dialogue is made between the ROK and the United States on  pending trade issues through such channels as the Dialogue for  Economic Cooperation (DEC) and since the ROK government is  moving toward lifting restrictions in various areas and toward  internationalization, there will be little chance of the ROK  being subject to retaliation by the Super 301."    The independent, moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 4  carries an 800-word article by reporter Kim Chong-hyon entitled  "Our Countermeasures." The article notes: "Although this Super  301, different from that of 1989 and 1990, is limited as an  administrative decree and is characterized as primarily aimed at  Japan, since the `revival' itself could cause enormous shock  wave, our government is very perplexed." The article then adds:  "Since the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the  United States has been requesting the ROK, through such channels  as the DEC, to more widely open the service market consisting of  nine areas; to open the financial market earlier; to ensure fair  competition; to eliminate discrimination against imported cars;  and to reinforce the protection of intellectual property rights.  Therefore, the ROK can be classified as a priority negotiation  list country."    The article then adds: "If the United States takes a  retaliatory measure with its Super 301, the government intends  to resolve the issue through such channels as the dispute  settlement procedure of the World Trade Organization (WTO),  while making efforts to persuade the United States by presenting  our internationalization program, which includes market opening  schedules." The article then notes a remark by Han Yong-su,  director of the Trade Cooperation Division of the Trade,  Industry, and Resources Ministry: "Although the United States  has a degree of complaint about its trade with the ROK, the  United States thinks well of ROK efforts for openness, including  our opening of the rice market. Even if the Super 301 is put  into operation, there is little possibility that the United  States will place the ROK on the priority negotiation list."</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Fresh blows rain on to Tokyo's brokers: The year-end accounts reveal the full misery of Japan's securities industry The stirrings of recovery in Tokyo share prices in the past month had prompted some securities houses to believe the worst of the market collapse was over and the time had come for investors to 'accumulate'. But the confidence-building lasted only until Friday, when the Nikkei stock average dived, 12 of the country's 14 leading brokers announced losses for the financial year ended March, and the market talk was of which houses would be most vulnerable in the tough year ahead. The accounts revealed the full misery of the Japanese securities industry and, in particular, the fragility of some second-tier brokers, whose once ambitious plans for expansion have been replaced by survival strategies. In the first of what may be a succession of rescues, Yamatane Securities confirmed on Friday it would be assisted by Sakura Bank, formerly Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. But the bank is unwilling to embrace the troubled broker until former executives leave the board. Yamatane and other brokers are in trouble because the Nikkei average fell 26.4 per cent during the past financial year, while daily trading value last calendar year was Y435.4bn (Pounds 1.84bn), down from Y716.7bn in 1990 and Y1,308bn in 1989, when the market's surge peaked. At the same time, individual investors lost faith after a series of scandals, including the compensation of large corporate clients for trading losses, dealings with gangster groups, and the shuffling of stocks from one client account to another to avoid booking losses. The costs of slump and scandal were unevenly distributed, with Nomura Securities, the largest house, showing its strength, and two of the other Big Four brokers, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, weakened but able to report pre-tax profits for the year. Yamaichi Securities, the remaining member of the quartet, is less healthy, reporting a large loss on its stock dealings, Y36.9bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y36.5bn, after a profit of Y67.6bn in the previous year. Another important measure of brokers' health is provided by a Ministry of Finance capital-to-assets ratio, which takes into account unrealised gains on securities holdings, asset quality and operating expenses, and sets thresholds for government intervention. Warning lights are activated when the ratio passes below 200 per cent, while brokers with 150 per cent or less are forbidden from opening new branches, and the ministry is supposed to begin daily monitoring of a broker at 120 per cent. The Big Four reported falls in their capital ratios, with Nomura down from 615 per cent to 580 per cent over the year, and uncomfortably large declines at Daiwa, down from 360 per cent to to 288 per cent, and Yamaichi, from 357 per cent to 302 per cent. But the most troubling falls were in the second tier, where Sanyo Securities, which had visions of itself as a big-league broker, was down from 256.8 per cent to 141.1 per cent. Not surprisingly, Sanyo said on Friday that three overseas offices, Madrid, Milan and Toronto, would be closed over the next month. Two other brokers fell below 200 per cent. Cosmo Securities was down from 257 per cent to 182 per cent, and Yamatane Securities plunged from 422.1 per cent to 183.3 per cent. Dai-Ichi Securities, at 202.2 per cent, was just above the line, as was Kankaku Securities at 212 per cent. Ms Alicia Ogawa, at SG Warburg Securities (Japan), said capital ratios were under pressure because the brokers were cutting costs, but 'their income is falling even faster'. She says a typical second-tier company requires a daily turnover of at least 600m shares to ensure profits - last year the Tokyo average was 373m shares, down from 877m in 1989. Commission income fell at all leading houses, with the larger houses more active than the medium-sized in the public and corporate bond market. At Yamaichi, for example, underwriting of bonds rose 12 per cent, while commission revenue at the bond division fell 15 per cent, compared with a 40 per cent fall in stock commission revenue and a 22 per cent fall in investment trust commissions. Net losses on securities dealings were reported at six of the 14 largest brokers. Four houses lost on bond dealings, but biggest losses, as expected, were on stock trading accounts. Top of the ladder was Yamaichi which lost Y36.9bn, followed by Daiwa with Y19.4bn and Kankaku with Y11.8bn. The largest loss on bond trading was reported by New Japan Securities - Y11.4bn. Operating expenses were cut by all 14 brokers, with the largest decline at Dai-Ichi Securities (23 per cent), Yamatane (18 per cent), Nomura (16 per cent), and Okasan Securities (16 per cent). But, at Nomura, for instance, the biggest cut was in interest expenses (down 54 per cent), and not in selling and administrative costs (down 11 per cent). At Sanyo, the latter expenses were down only 6 per cent, and at Kankaku they actually rose by 1 per cent. However, Japanese brokers are still confident that trimming expenses will tide them over until the market climbs again. That optimism is reflected in Nomura forecasts of a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profit this year on a 2 per cent rise in operating income. Yamaichi expects its Y36.5bn loss to become a Y30bn profit on a bullish 21 per cent lift in operating income. Nikko and Daiwa aim at 3 to 4 per cent gains in operating income. But, as Friday's fall in the Nikkei showed, the market is still delicate, and in the current year, already weakened companies may have to do more than revise ambitious profit forecasts and make superficial cuts in costs.  ------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS FOR JAPANESE BROKERS  -------------------------------------------------------                                End fiscal   End fiscal                                 1991 (%)      1990 (%)  ------------------------------------------------------- Nomura Securities                579.8         615.1 Daiwa Securities                 288.0         360.0 Nikko Securities                 340.2         376.2 Yamaichi Securities              302.0         357.0  ------------------------------------------------------- Second-tier  ------------------------------------------------------- New Japan Securities             228.0         223.0 Sanyo Securities                 141.4         256.8 Kankaku Securities               212.0         240.0 Wako Securities                  270.9         333.5 Kokusai Securities               268.0         358.0 Okasan Securities                220.0         237.0 Cosmo Securities                 182.0         257.0 Tokyo Securities                 414.0         399.0 Yamatane Securities              183.3         422.1 Dai-Ichi Securities              202.2         260.9  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

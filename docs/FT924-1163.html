The licence is for both oral and injectable versions of the drug which generated sales of Pounds 43m in the year to June 30. Imigran is one of Glaxo's three new products that have been labelled 'blockbusters' - capable of generating more than Dollars 1bn income a year. Glaxo said it would launch the drug as soon as possible in the new year. It declined to detail the drug's price in Germany, but it is likely to be similar to that elsewhere in Europe.

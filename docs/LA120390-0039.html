			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Who'll Take the Rap: A format change may be planned for KDAY-AM (1580), the  nation's leading rap station, purchased recently by Realtor Fred Sands.  Although the sale is not yet final, Gary Price, general manager of heavy metal  station KNAC-FM, which is also owned by Sands, said that a study is being  conducted to determine what format the powerful station should have. Retaining  the rap music format is one possibility, Price said. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

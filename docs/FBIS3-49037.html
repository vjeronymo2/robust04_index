			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jiri Skalicky, minister for the </F> administration and privatization of national property, by Olga  Skalkova; place and date not given: "Most of the Property Will  be Privatized Before the End of This Electoral Term"]    [Excerpts] [Skalkova] In the near future, the definitive  list of the enterprises offered in the second and the last wave  of coupon privatization will be published, and this will close  an important stage in the transformation of the economy. How  much state property has been privatized so far, how much is left  to be privatized, and what is the share of the private sector in  the generation of the gross national product?    [Skalicky] These questions are very difficult to answer in  precise figures. The problem is that we neither know the exact  value of the property that remains in the hands of the state,  nor do we have precise numbers on the property already  transferred to private hands in the framework of restitutions.  We only know that more than 100,000 real estate properties have  been returned, for instance, in the framework of the small-scale  restitution on the level of enterprise-authorized persons.  Another property transfer took place by means of the so-called  small-scale privatization that is to end with this year. It was  an insignificant amount from the point of view of the entire  process of denationalization -- the book value lies somewhere  between 20 and 25 billion korunas, the yield is approximately 33  billion korunas.    Practically all the property that had been registered in  time  was included in the large-scale privatization. The book value  of the property that entered the two privatization waves  totalled about 1.2 to 1.3 billion korunas. Some of the  enterprises on the list ended in bankruptcy and liquidation even  before the privatization projects were submitted and assessed.    The value of the property being privatized is lower by this  amount. We do not precisely know the book value of the property  that, as decided, will not be privatized for five years, and the  same applies to the property that is to remain in public or  state ownership. [passage omitted]    Much more important than the value of the property in the  state or private hands is, however, the data on the development  of the share of the private sector in the generation national  product. It has already reached 57 percent, which indicates  even more favorable development than corresponds to the real  pace of privatization. Namely, private firms not only emerge  from privatization but also on "green sites."    [Skalkova] Can you at least give the ratio between the state  property privatized for remuneration and the share of property  for which the state does not collect any financial means?    [Skalicky] The property transferred free of charge in the  form of the coupon privatization is estimated at 400 to 450  billion korunas. Another significant share of the property --  about 60 to 100 billion korunas -- was transferred to  communities in the form of shares of certain enterprises that  represent environmentally, for instance, a burden on the region  or are of key importance for its infrastructure.    The value of property that has been sold directly or in the  form of shares to domestic or foreign investors -- or the sale  of which has been decided -- amounts to only 200 to 250 billion  korunas. That is a surprisingly low amount if we compare it with  the value of the property transferred free of charge. [passage  omitted]    [Skalkova] How do you foresee the development in investment  funds?    [Skalicky] They will go basically in two directions. A part  of the funds will tend to the role of the traditional  institutional investor, i.e. stabilize its average proceeds by a  broad portfolio. These funds will not have any ambitions of an  influential owner. The other part of the funds -- and I put my  hope with respect to the influence exertion on the enterprises  in these funds -- will limit the diversity of the portfolio to a  special sector or a group of enterprises. Therefore, in the  future, we will have to consider the abolition of the 20 percent  limit to the capital participation of these funds in  stockholding companies. [passage omitted]    [Skalkova] Lately, the share of foreign investments seems to  be ceding to the portfolio investments, but this type of capital  does not bring any know-how or new technology, which the  enterprises need to be competitive. What, in your opinion, is  the contribution of such privatization?    [Skalicky] I would not underestimate this type of  privatization, because the foreign investor must have decided  for it in order to influence the enterprise. The only thing is  that this form is less obvious and -- similarly to investments  in enterprises made prior or after the privatization --  manifests itself only gradually. I actually consider this trend  desirable because now, when the conditions for normal  development of the economy have been created, we definitely need  foreign capital. One of the greatest current problems are the  excessively expensive credits. The portfolio investments,  however, are not a part of the privatization process but rather  -- and I insist -- a beneficial result of the gradual  privatization. They certainly would not enter anonymous state  enterprises in the same scope. [passage omitted]    [Skalkova] What will the privatization process be like after  the second wave of privatization is completed?    [Skalicky] I would characterize this period by saying that  it will be the post-privatization cleanup. We want the founding  sectors to now submit a list of property for additional small  privatization waves. We are going to collaborate on a similar  task with the district offices. There is also some state  property established by the communities. We intend to involve  the district privatization commissions in the search for the  unattached property. There will not be much, but some will  certainly be found. [passage omitted]    There is a relatively broad scale of methods at our  disposal,  so the privatization process can reach its end as quickly as  possible. It should happen before the end of this electoral term.</p>

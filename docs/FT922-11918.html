			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: Deals take on different perspectives Sir, Your article 'US under attack by Brussels' (April 10) includes the allegation by the EC that the US is tending to reach for bilateral deals with such countries as Japan. Wonderfully juxtaposed in the column just to the left of this story is 'EC asks Japan to cut exports of cars by 100,000'. This would appear to be a bilateral deal in the making initiated by the EC with Japan. Speaking of the 'pot calling the kettle black. . .'

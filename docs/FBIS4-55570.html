			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 14 May on  page 4 carries an 800-word interview with legal expert Ernest  Valko, former chairman of the CSFR Constitutional Court, by Jana  Pankovcinova, entitled "After 20 January 1994, the Slovak  Information Service [SIS] Is No Longer Entitled To Issue  Screening Certificates." In the interview, the place and date  of which are not given, Valko argues that, after 20 January  1994, the SIS is no longer entitled to issue screening  certificates and that any screening certificates issued after  that date are illegal. As the interviewer observes, the  continued issue of screening certificates by the SIS was  admitted by SIS Director Vladimir Mitro in an interview  published in the 12 May issue of the Bratislava daily NOVY CAS.    Valko explains that, on 20 April 1993, the Meciar government  authorized the SIS to issue screening certificates; the validity  of the then government resolution was limited to nine months,  however, so this authorization expired on 20 January 1994. The  expert asserts that there is currently no body in Slovakia that  is entitled to carry out screening and that any certificates  issued by the SIS after 20 January 1994 are "invalid." He even  contends that those who received a positive screening  certificate after that date can sue the SIS "because the SIS did  not have the right to issue those certificates, and it was its  responsibility to let it be known that it no longer has this  authority."</p>

This umbrella program will focus a variety of resources on implementation of a comprehensive delinquency prevention and intervention program in order to enhance public safety and provide a continuum of care for at-risk and delinquent youth. The program will fund a range of services designed to meet the multiple needs of young people in their communities and support capacity-building at the local level to ensure the long-term sustanibility of youth-supporting efforts. Programs services would range from prevention through aftercare for youth returning to their communities from out-of-home placements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Safe Futures Program offers a ``concentration of effort'' approach to cities and rural areas much like the Administration's Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program. The effort builds a continuum of care based on the model presented in OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under this strategy, communities systemically assess the risk factors present in the environment that are known to foster delinquent behavior in children. A community then develops a strategy to reduce identified risks for delinquency and increase protective factors that promote healthy and productive behavior. In addition, the community develops a full range of graduate sanctions, beginning with immediate interventions, that are designed to hold delinquent juveniles accountable to the victim and the community, ensure community security, and provide a continuum of services that responds appropriately to the needs of each juvenile offender. While many communities have begun this process on their own, others throughout the country are engaged in the assessment process as a part of OJJDP's Title V Prevention Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Safe Futures Program, units of local government, or combinations thereof, will have the opportunity to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Build upon a comprehensive delinquency prevention and intervention plan developed by a community planning team. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Focus resources and commitment on a geographical area or areas of substantial need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coordinate and develop effective programs to fill in gaps in delinquency prevention, intervention, and treatment services according to a community-developed comprehensive plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Grant Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through a competitive process, OJJDP would select five units of local government or combinations thereof (three urban, one rural, one Native American) that propose to establish a continuum of care for the jurisdiction's at-risk and delinquency youth and their families. If the size of makeup of the applicant's local unit(s) does not make jurisdiction-wide services practical or desirable, assistance resources may be focused on a localized identified area(s) or neighborhood(s). The applicant would provide evidence of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comprehensive delinquency prevention, intervention, and graduated sanction plan for their jurisdiction developed by a broad spectrum of community leaders and residents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The presence of risk factors for delinquency in the selected area(s) or neighborhood(s), such as high rates of crime, poverty, teenage pregnancy, child abuse and neglect, dysfunctional or single parent families, school drop-outs, unemployment, or such other factors as the grantee identifies in the community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A needs assessment and a statement of the problem, describing the issues as they pertain to that community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A capacity and commitment to leverage state, local, and private resources and coordinate the necessary systemic changes to both the juvenile justice and social service delivery systems in order to create an ongoing, comprehensive, community-based system of care. The grantee would develop, and submit as part of the application process, memoranda of understanding from those resources included in the continuum of care. These memoranda should demonstrate the community's interest in solving the problems confronting the community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant must develop a proposal which either demonstrates the role each of these programs will plan as components in a comprehensive plan, or shows that these program areas are currently in place in the selected community(ies). The grant programs listed below are described in greater detail under each of the goal areas of the fiscal year 1995 Program Plan: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Let us listen to a report by our special envoy  Gary Belizaire, live from the parliament.    [Belizaire] Lieutenant Gen. Raoul Cedras is expected this  afternoon in the Senate of the Republic. The Justice, Interior,  and Defense Commissions of the Senate have invited the Army  commander in chief to provide explanations today of events such  as those that occurred (?in the south) two weeks ago. If we are  to believe what Senator Ebrane Cadet said, Gen. Cedras will be  required to address the Senate about the upsurge of violence in  the country. This invitation to Gen. Cedras proves that the  parliament is working, added Sen. Cadet who did not explain  whether this convening is part of the surprise he said would  occur within 24 hours.    Meanwhile, the 18 January parliamentarians and the  dissidents  of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] are awaiting Gen.  Cedras' arrival. The general will most likely attend the session  because everything has already been arranged for the holding of  this session. The electricity company of Haiti has provided  power, whereas the area is usually deprived of electricity at  this hour. Let us point out that the senators of the  constitutionalist bloc are not present because they have not yet  acknowledged the second office of the Senate of the Republic.

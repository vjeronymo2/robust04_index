			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (21): Australian battle begins - The gradual introduction of intensified competition Mr Frank Blount, the former AT&amp;T executive who runs Telstra, the large government-owned telecommunications group, is forthright about where the Australian market is headed - 'competition will intensify: this is just the warm-up,' he says. Few industry observers would disagree. As recently as the late-1980s, the Australian telecoms market was essentially government-controlled and dominated by three entities. There was the Australian Telecommunications Commission, which ran the domestic telecom services; the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), which provided international services; and Aussat, which was responsible for Australia's satellite communications system. Already, there have been significant changes. The first two entities were merged to form Telstra (which goes by the Telecom name in its home market) and is still wholly-owned by the federal government. Aussat, meanwhile, was sold to Optus, a new second telecom carrier licenced in early 1992. Having started by competing with Telecom in cellular telephone market, Optus moved into long-distance services in late-1992. To improve Optus' chances, a series of ballots were held in Australia's larger cities, giving customers a well-publicised opportunity to choose between the new carrier and Telecom for their international and national long distance services. This process is still continuing, although it has begun to move on to 'second-line' cities such as Bendigo/Ballarat in Victoria where balloting starts on October 12. Responses have varied, but in the key Sydney market almost 20 per cent of subscribers opted to move away from Telecom. In Melbourne, the figure was 14 per cent. At the same time, selective opportunities have been available for overseas players. The UK's Vodaphone won entry into the mobile phone market last year, for example, initially offering services in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. A number of international companies have also entered the 're-sale' market. Last month, Pacific Star, a joint venture company established by Telecom NZ and Bell Atlantic, signed a deal with Optus under which the latter will supply long-distance services to Pacific. But, as Mr Blount says, this limited opening-up of the telecoms sector is almost certainly just the start. The duopoly system in the long-distance market was always intended to be an interim arrangement, and the federal government's declared aim is to move towards full network competition by the middle of 1997. Earlier this year, in a speech to the annual conference of the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group, Mr Michael Lee, federal minister with responsibility for the industry, indicated post-1997 regime would have Canberra playing only a 'minimal' role, 'protecting consumers and facilitating competition.' The government appears to envisage the introduction of new legislation, setting out the ground-rules for this liberalised environment, in the back-half of 1995. That would then give companies seeking to enter the Australian market an 18-month window in which to develop their plans. Among the many issues which the post-1997 planning will need to address is what long-term role, if any, should be played by Austel, the industry watchdog. As Australia moves to greater competition on numerous fronts, Mr Lee has noted: 'It is quite clear that . . . the role of specialist industry regulators like Austel will have to be examined.' For Telecom, liberalisation of the Australian telecommunications market has posed big management questions. The business has not always been held in high regard by its customers, nor has it fared particularly well in terms of international benchmarking studies - especially in some key areas, like labour productivity. Telecom's image was dealt a blow when Austel published its report on the 'Casualties of Telecom' affair earlier this year. The CoT group was a self-styled band of protesters, mainly made up of small businesses, who claimed that the company had failed to take their service complaints seriously and, in some instances, caused them significant financial loss as a result. Although Austel handed its judgment down in moderate language and the CoT-related complaints were a minute proportion of the total business handled by Telecom, the impression left by the report was highly unfavourable. Telecom, the regulator decided, had failed to take some complaints seriously and its behaviour was 'less than that of a model corporate citizen.' But if the challenge of imbuing Telecomwith service values whilst cutting staff numbers without damaging morale, look formidable, the financial picture is more satisfactory. Last month, Telstra unveiled an after-tax profit of ADollars 1.7bn after tax and exceptional items - up from ADollars 905m in the previous year - on revenues 5.6 per cent higher, at ADollars 13.4bn. Since half of Telstra's after-tax profits are now paid to its shareholder by way of a dividend, meaning an inflow of ADollars 738m into government coffers. But even on this score there are problems. Some observers question what sort of return is appropriate for a government-owned utility. Others ask whether Telstra should really be in the private sector. Mr Blount, unveiling the results, declined to be drawn on the thorny, highly-politicised privatisation issue, beyond noting that ministers have said that the business will not be handed over to the private sector in the term of this government. He did, however, note that 'the development of a world class Australian telecommunications network requires massive investment.' Over the next three years, Telstra plans to spend over ADollars 3.5bn. One of the biggest single investments will be in digital equipment to modernise the network. The company has also pledged to take its fibre optic and coaxial cable network into 1.1m Australian home by the end of 1996 at an investment cost of ADollars 710m - suggesting that cable pay-TV may then become a serious rival to the currently more advanced satellite availability. For Optus, the issue is how to capitalise on Telecom's weaknesses. The newcomer is owned by a mix of domestic and international institutions and acquired a new shareholder in Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, the leading commercial TV network, in March. Nine Network paid ADollars 318m for a 15 per cent stake. Optus has said that it expects to float at least part of its equity on the stockmarket during the next calender years, and brokers have already been appointed. As a private company, Optus does not release full earnings reports. However, it makes no secret of the fact that it ran at a loss in 1993/4, although Mr Bob Mansfield, chief executive, has said it should break even in the current 12 months and move into profit thereafter. Revenues in the year just ended have been estimated at well in excess of ADollars 800m, and possibly over the ADollars 1bn-mark in annualised terms.</p>

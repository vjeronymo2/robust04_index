Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NO PROGRESS IN KOREAN TALKS  </P> <P> The North and South Korean prime ministers met today to pave the road to Korean  unity, but each side apparently rejected the other's main proposals and agreed  to meet again Thursday.  </P> <P> South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon joined his northern counterpart,  Yon Hyong Muk, for the two-hour session.  </P> <P> Kang proposed that the Koreas allow cross-border travel on major holidays,  restore communications and travel links, reunite families and reduce armed  forces to equal levels.  </P> <P> But North Korea said "military and political confrontation" on the peninsula  should be ended before all else.  </P> <P> Yon demanded that Seoul release three dissidents jailed for illegal trips to  North Korea, end annual joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers and share a  single seat at the United Nations.  </P> <P> South Korea said that was not acceptable.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-JUSTICE NAMED GRAND JURY COUNSEL  </P> <P> Retired California Supreme Court Justice Otto M. Kaus on Wednesday was  appointed special counsel to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury to direct an  investigation into whether local law enforcement officials have misused  jailhouse informants.  </P> <P> County Counsel Dewitt Clinton said the county has agreed to pay up to $250,000  for the services of Kaus and other members of his firm and, in addition, will  provide Kaus with an investigative staff.  </P> <P> Kaus, who served on the state Supreme Court from 1981 to 1985, said he will  head a team of lawyers composed of Warren L. Ettinger and Dan Marmalefsky. All  three are partners in the downtown Los Angeles law firm of Hufstedler, Miller,  Kaus &amp; Beardsley.  </P> <P> "I'm going to meet my client, the grand jury, tomorrow," Kaus said Wednesday,  "and we'll give them a vague outline of how to proceed. None of us has ever  done this before."  </P> <P> Kaus added, "We do not consider it our mission to establish in individual cases  that one individual prisoner is entitled to a new trial. . . . We are engaged  in helping the grand jury in its statutory task of smoking out wrongdoing in  the county."  </P> <P> Kaus, who was appointed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp after the grand jury  requested a special counsel, said he expects the investigation to take months.  </P></p>

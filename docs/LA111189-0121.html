Year-to-date sales for 1989 declined 19%,  to $37.9 million from $46.9 million.  </P> <P> EECO attributed the lower sales levels in 1989 to price erosion in the keyboard  business and a decline in volume in all its businesses due to the inability to  meet customer demand. That was caused by disruptions resulting from facility  moves and inadequate material planning and control, the company said.  </P> <P> EECO manufactures computer keyboards, electronic key pads, electromechanical  switches and hotel computer systems worldwide.  </P></p>

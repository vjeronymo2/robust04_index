			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE CONTROLLER, LOTTERY AT ODDS OVER PROBE OF KEY LOTTO CONTRACTOR  </P> <P> The state controller and the California lottery are at odds over what began as  a joint investigation into accusations of wrongdoing by the lottery's main  contractor in the Lotto numbers game.  </P> <P> The controller's office, distancing itself from the lottery's finding that all  is well with the Lotto contractor, GTECH Corp., is launching a separate,  broader audit of the lottery, said Edd H. Fong, spokesman for Controller Gray  Davis.  </P> <P> As a result of the dispute, the report on the investigation by the lottery and  controller, scheduled for release a month ago, will not come out at least until  this week, and the controller will issue a separate statement when the report  is issued, officials said.  </P> <P> Fong said the controller's office agreed with the lottery that the audit  produced no evidence of wrongdoing by GTECH, which has a $100-million-plus  contract to run California's Lotto 6/49 game. But the controller contends that  there may be insufficient oversight by the lottery of the Providence, R.I.,  company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report's Conclusions  </P> <P> As the report is now written, there is no mention of a need for more monitoring  of GTECH, said Roland Bowns, the lottery's chief counsel.  </P> <P> Fong said the controller would not endorse a December draft of the report  because "the lottery wanted to put in some (inappropriate) personnel  information regarding two employees who made the allegations."  </P> <P> "When it got to the point where the lottery people wanted to include some  information that we felt was inappropriate, we were no longer involved in the  drafting of the report," Fong said.  </P> <P> Adding to an already touchy situation, Randy Troxel and Emmitt A. Allison, the  lottery computer technicians who raised questions that led to the GTECH  investigation, have sued the lottery, contending that they have suffered  on-the-job retribution for coming forth.  </P> <P> On Nov. 28, lottery officials proclaimed that a joint investigation by the  controller and the lottery showed that accusations against GTECH were unfounded  and said the report would be released during the first week of December.  Lottery officials now say the report will not be released at least until this  week.  </P> <P> "I don't know that the controller needs to sign off on the report," Bowns said.  "It was an investigation requested by the director of the lottery. Certainly,  the controller's input and presence is nice, for lack of a better word. But it  is a report to the director of the lottery."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controller's Jurisdiction  </P> <P> Lottery spokesman John Schade said the lottery invited the controller to join  the audit to add to its credibility and because the office has jurisdiction  over allegations of "loss of funds."  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office reviewed the report last month and called  for changes to "avoid litigation," Bowns said. The lottery's lawyer said a  deputy attorney general expressed concern that the report as written may have  violated "the rights of the informants," prompting the lottery to excise some  language about Allison and Troxel.  </P> <P> Allison and Troxel were hired as computer technicians in October, 1986, with an  assignment to help monitor GTECH. They found what they thought was evidence  that GTECH was routinely under-reporting the amount of time that Lotto computer  terminals were working improperly.  </P> <P> Under GTECH's contract with the lottery, the company must pay up to $4,000 a  minute for each minute that the Lotto 6/49 computer system is not working and  lesser amounts when individual terminals are not working.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Whistle-Blowers' Suit'  </P> <P> In a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Allison and Troxel say they  reported their discovery to the lottery but were pressured to ignore it,  prompting them to go to the controller's office.  </P> <P> Troxel and Allison alleged that when their superiors at the lottery learned  that they had gone to the controller, they were placed on unpaid leave. They  have since returned to work but have little responsibility, the suit says.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Allison said that through its action against Troxel  and himself, the lottery is telling its workers to "shut your mouth, close your  eyes and draw your paycheck."  </P> <P> GTECH, meanwhile, is pressuring the lottery to release the report. Pete  Morrissey, senior GTECH vice president in charge of its California contract,  said he wrote to the lottery in November asking that it intercede and get "the  two Lotto boys to stop making the allegations." The lottery responded that it  could not prevent them from speaking out.  </P> <P> "I realize you can't stop people who feature themselves as whistle-blowers, but  I think they should limit it (what they say) to the proper authorities,"  Morrissey said.  </P> <P> Morrissey said that although the charges are "farfetched," contracts that GTECH  won in Michigan and Illinois were delayed partly because of the investigation.  </P> <P> "It certainly doesn't help the company's image to have this kind of thing go on  and be protracted," Morrissey said.  </P></p>

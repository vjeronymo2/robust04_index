			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Warning to Names as Lloyd's records Pounds 2.9bn loss LLOYD'S of London yesterday reported losses of Pounds 2.91bn - its highest ever - and warned that resources to compensate thousands of its worst-hit Names were limited. At the insurance market's annual meeting Mr David Rowland, chairman, told 1,200 Names - individuals whose assets support Lloyd's - that the losses for 1990 represented a 'low point' in its 305-year history. The figures reflected 'an overall level of performance' which was 'unacceptable and must never be repeated', he said. The loss is the third in succession for Lloyd's, which reports results three years in arrears. It follows a deficit of Pounds 2.06bn in 1989 and Pounds 510m in 1988. Several thousand Names trading at the time of the losses face financial ruin as a result and are suing the agents who handled their affairs and managed syndicates. Mr Rowland said he wanted 'to see that proper recompense is made to any who have been wronged by their agents or others'. However, he urged Names to support Lloyd's in its efforts to achieve out-of-court settlements to these disputes. 'The prospect of years of costly litigation for some pot of gold seems to me to have virtue for but a few,' he said. Mr Rowland also warned that moves by some Names to press new corporate investors to pay for past losses through high introductory fees were neither 'practical nor timely'. Lloyd's announced in a business plan, published in April, aimed at restoring market profitability that it hoped to attract companies to participate as 'incorporated Names' next year. 'I have no intention of selling participation in the society at a foolish price (but) if we want new capital we have to compete for it with other attractive investments which do not carry with them the same track record,' added Mr Rowland. 'It is dangerous rubbish to portray any other possibility.' Reserves rise sharply, Page 10 Editorial Comment, Page 21 Lex, Page 22</p>

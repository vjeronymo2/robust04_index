			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Property: 'If we sell we sell, if we don't we don't' - Helga Drummond recommends that house sellers appear unconcerned when they are dealing with potential buyers Successful selling in today's property market means taking charge of your destiny. It is vital to capitalise on potential advantages and to meet difficulties with a clear strategy. Success starts by choosing an estate agent carefully. How accessible is the office? Are the displays attractive? Does the agent employ viewing staff? If so, do they work evenings and weekends? How knowledgeable and helpful are the office workers? Above all, how many houses a week does the agent seem to sell? Attracting instructions is one thing, the real sign of competence is the proportion of 'sold' to 'for sale' signs. It is also prudent to match the agent to prospective purchasers. If it is an upmarket home then it may be helpful if the agent commands a certain eclat. Conversely, a property likely to appeal to first time buyers of modest means requires an agent who is approachable and supportive. Estate agents' valuations can vary tremendously so formulate your ideas about price in advance. Estate agents are well used to declamations such as: 'Surely it's worth more than that]' Rarely do they meet a client who asks them to explain how they have arrived at their valuation, still less one who produces charts and other comparative data as a basis for discussion. The price must combine ambition with realism. Buyers tend to confine searches to price bands, and if you set the price just outside the critical range you could miss your market. So find out from the agent about local buying behaviour. A daring ploy is to set a reasonable asking price and then advertise it as non-negotiable. In a market where sellers are desperately under-cutting one another and many properties are marked 'reduced,' a non-negotiable tag arouses curiosity which is likely to produce viewers. Further, it alleviates prospective purchasers of the need to negotiate. Since negotiation is stressful they may be relieved by a simple 'take it or leave it' proposition. It may be gratifying to see your house described as a showpiece, but it is safer to insist that the sales literature understates the property slightly. Overstatement can lead to disappointment. Although your estate agent's job is to represent your interests, they only normally make money if the house is sold. The difference to the agent on a 1 per cent commission between selling a house at Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 95,000 is only Pounds 50. Be circumspect, therefore, about what you reveal to the estate agent about your circumstances. Apart from the danger of such information being disclosed to the buyer, the estate agent might also try to use it to lever you into accepting a lower offer in order to secure the sale - particularly if you use more than one agent. Commissions, incidentally are often negotiable though estate agents may not advertise the fact. Beware, however, of the agent offering a slightly lower rate on condition that you market the house at a discount. They might be sacrificing thousands of pounds of your money in order to help them meet their quarterly targets. Circumspection is equally advisable when dealing with prospective buyers. Some buyers use the viewing as an opportunity to test the vendor's commitment to the advertised price. Oblique questions and comments are best ignored. Answer overt approaches with: 'Lets leave that until later shall we.' Such a veiled warning lowers the other party's expectations without resorting to aggression. Avoid giving any signal which might be interpreted as an indication of flexibility. For instance, statements such as, 'we might leave the carpets and curtains if we get the asking price,' suggests the existence of a fallback position. The best stance to project is: 'If we sell, we sell. If we don't we don't' Provided such apparent unconcern is reflected in your behaviour, it will signal to prospective buyers that there is little room for manoeuvre and may dissuade them from even attempting to bargain. Try and flow with the other party: if a prospective purchaser notes that the lounge faces north, it is better to acknowledge the fact rather than try to convince them it catches the sun all day. Argument stimulates resistance and suspicion whereas harmony makes the other party feel in control. They are much more likely to make buy if they feel the decision is theirs, not yours. Although sellers are vulnerable to last-minute demands for concessions, both parties have grown committed to the deal. Do the purchasers really want to begin the process of house hunting again? How much are they prepared to sacrifice in abortive surveys and search-es? House buying involves emotions as well as money. A seller's most potent card is the property itself. If someone has become attached to the idea of living in your house then you are in a strong position indeed. Signs of commitment are often betrayed unwittingly: they are hooked if they give one another a congratulatory hug as they walk away, or if they return to the property, or better still, bring relatives to see it. The best response to a demand for concessions is a show of Thatcherite inflexibility. Point out that the state of repair is reflected in the asking price. If the buyers claim that they cannot afford the house or that their researchers indicate that it is over-priced call the bluff by telling them to look elsewhere. You can buttress your position by invoking your solicitor. Let it be known that you have been advised against accepting the other party's terms. This de-personalises the issue and reflects the other side's greed back to them. Such an initiative puts the onus back on the other party to justify every item of its claim. If necessary, ask to see at least two detailed estimates for every item of work they say is required, quibble over details, seek second opinions and so on. The aim is to wear them down by maximising delay and uncertainty. Simultaneously, you are warning the other party that negotiations are not going to be easy. The ultimate protection against a bad bargain rests in the setting of limits and the possession of alternatives. Decide in advance the lowest price you are prepared to accept and what you will do if you fail to realise it within a given time. Failure is frustrating but it also creates opportunities. Remember, pursuit of the unattainable is at the expense of the possible. Helga Drummond lectures at the University of Liverpool's Institute of Public Administration and Management.

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Andalucia makes eurodollar debut as activity steps up The eurobond market saw an acceleration of activity yesterday with a number of new offerings launched into difficult market conditions. Comunidad Autonoma de Andalucia, the southern Spanish province, launched its debut eurodollar issue, with a Dollars 260m offering of bonds due January 2000. The bonds offered a coupon of 8 per cent and were priced to yield 47 basis points over US Treasuries, although this spread widened slightly after the bonds were freed to trade. Joint lead manager Goldman Sachs reported strong demand from investors in Asia/Pacific, UK institutions and continental European retail investors, who were attracted by the relatively high five-year coupon. Deutsche Bank, the other lead manager, saw strongest demand on its books from Swiss, German and UK investors, with French banks also showing interest. The proceeds from the offering are to be used mainly for infrastructure financing, Goldman Sachs said. The proceeds were not swapped out of dollars, market sources said. At the shorter end of the dollar sector, Hewlett-Packard Finance, another relatively infrequent borrower, launched a Dollars 250m offering of three-year bonds priced to yield 25 basis points over US government bonds. The bonds were sold mainly to retail investors in Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium and to institutional investors in the UK, lead manager Deutsche Bank said. The bank said that the offering was launched partly as a result of the demand for three-year dollar paper following the launch of a similar offering by Deutsche Bank Finance last week. The proceeds from the offering were believed to have been swapped into floating rate dollars, market sources said. The pricing spread widened to about 28 basis points after the bonds were freed to trade. However, Deutsche Bank said that it expected the offering to follow a similar pattern to that of the Johnson &amp; Johnson three-year issue launched last week at 15 basis points over but which has since tightened in price. Hewlett-Packard Finance last tapped the dollar sector in 1992, Deutsche Bank said. In the D-Mark sector, Depfa launched a DM750m offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 30 basis points over German government bonds. Joint lead manager UBS said demand from institutional investors was better than expected, with about two-thirds of the bonds going to European institutions. Depfa is Germany's largest mortgage bank and 85 per cent of its new loan business is to the public sector. It has raised about DM15bn since January and plans to raise a further DM2bn this year, although this is likely to be in the domestic market rather than the public euromarket, Depfa said. The proceeds, to be used for general funding purposes, were not swapped out of D-Marks.</p>

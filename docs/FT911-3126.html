			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Smith &amp; Nephew will move research centre SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the international health care company, is to move its group research centre from Essex to a science park to be built at the University of York. The Pounds 15m research centre will be the first and largest tenant on York Science Park, it was announced yesterday. The 21-acre park, next to the university's Heslington campus, is a joint venture between the university and P&amp;O Developments, the property subsidiary of the P&amp;O shipping group. Mr John Robinson, Smith &amp; Nephew chief executive, said the company expected to sell its research centre at Gilston Park, Essex, for about Pounds 5m. It would spend Pounds 5m fitting out the centre in York and then pay Pounds 1m a year in rent. The university and P&amp;O expect to spend Pounds 23m developing the science park in three phases up to the end of 1994. The first phase, including the Smith &amp; Nephew centre, is scheduled for completion in November 1992. Some 200 scientists and technicians will move from Essex to York.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Acas angry over plan to make users pay for services ACAS, the arbitration and conciliation service, yesterday accused the government of threatening its independence by introducing new powers that could force it to charge users. A clause added by the government to the employment bill, which is going through the House of Lords, means that Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, would have reserve powers to make Acas charge for its arbitration and conciliation between employers and employees. The idea of charging for Acas's activities came out of a Department of Employment review last year into how the service could save money. The annual budget of Pounds 19m is under strain because the recession has driven up Acas's workload. For the second successive year, Acas handled a record number of cases last year, with inquiries rising to almost half a million. The steepest rises have been in sex discrimination claims which have increased nearly threefold in two years. Other areas of Acas's activities are also being modified by the employment bill. The existing statutory obligation for the service to promote collective bargaining is being scrapped and, as part of the economy drive, a specialised work research unit is being dismantled. In its annual report, published yesterday, Acas said Mrs Shephard's reserve power on charging 'could well be regarded as a continuing threat to seek to influence or govern the ways in which . . . the service exercises any, or all, of its statutory duties'. Acas's ruling council has written to Mrs Shephard protesting strongly about the new powers. It said its concerns 'were not eased by being told that the secretary of state had no current plans to exercise such a power'. Mr John Hougham, Acas chairman and former Ford UK head of employee relations, said there was already consideration being given to charging for some publications and conferences. However, he said any suggestion that arbitration or conciliation should be charged for 'begins to get extremely close to challenging Acas's independence and would severely affect the way in which parties coming to us in all the areas of our work would regard the service'. Charges would make the service less accessible to employees and, because employers would generally end up paying any costs, the objectivity of Acas 'would be called into question'. The Department of Employment said Mrs Shephard's proposed new powers were 'purely precautionary' and did not end Acas's independence. The new law would also require the employment secretary to consult Acas's council before any charges were introduced.</p>

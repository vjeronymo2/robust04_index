			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: From Big Bang outwards - Tuesday BBC2 starts its usual coverage of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, given this year by theoretical physicist Professor Frank Close. He starts from the Big Bang and works outwards (2.50pm). Then there is Richard Strauss's last opera, Capriccio, again on BBC2, starting at 7.15pm. Kiri Te Kanawa plays the countess in a story about words versus music in opera. Or if you simply want to lie back and giggle weakly at the antics of silly foreigners, there is yet another of those compilations of commercials which have become so familiar in programmes fronted by Chris Tarrant and Clive James. This one, called Carrott's Commercial Breakdown 3, is of course presented by comedian Jasper Carrott. Mainly, however, the schedules are packed with old movies: 18 of them on the four main networks alone. Several of the American works are worth watching. The first occurs as early as 8.55am: Bachelor Knight, known in its homeland as The Bachelor And The Bobbysoxer, is a 1947 comedy with Myrna Loy, Cary Grant and Shirley Temple. Another comedy, Speedy, though 20 years older and silent, is by general consent one of the best works by Harold Lloyd (3.15pm C4). Born On The Fourth Of July (9.50pm BBC2) is Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning film, based on a true story, of a young man who volunteers for Vietnam, is wounded, paralysed, and joins the anti-war movement. In Horse Feathers, the Marx Brothers are at Huxley College and the high point is a football game against a rival university. One of their best (1.15am C4). Red River is a John Wayne cowboy film all about cows; a classic western (1.35am ITV).</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 20 January carries the program  "Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The  program features the platforms of the Peasant Party of Ukraine  and the Socialist Party of Ukraine. Each party has been given a  10-minute slot on the program during which it can present its  views.    The announcer begins by introducing the Peasant Party of  Ukraine and the Socialist Party of Ukraine whose candidates have  been nominated to run in the upcoming election to the Supreme  Council. The Peasant Party is represented by its chairman Serhiy  Dovhan, and the Socialist Party by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of  its political council, and Volodymyr Marchenko, member of the  political council presidium.    The Peasant Party, according to its chairman Dovhan, has a  membership of more than 70,000 members among rural working  collectives. He says that the party decided not to join any  election alliances with other political organizations. "Our  party's position is strictly centrist." He continues: "If our  plans and our program are shared by other parties and movements,  we are ready to join forces to solve the global task of working  out a political and economic course to take Ukraine out of its  deep and prolonged crisis."    This anti-crisis course, in the Peasant Party's view, must  start with the provision for a steady development of the  agrarian sector. "Our party has a specific program and will be  able to take Ukraine out of the difficult economic crisis within  the next two years. We will ensure that our people are provided  with food at the level of 1992, and then make sure that Ukraine  progresses to a higher grade and becomes a serious food producer  on the world market."    The party's election objectives are outlined as follows:  "First of all, to provide legislation guaranteeing accession to  civilized market relations as opposed to the current wild  market. Our party recognizes the right to maintain different  forms of ownership and economic activity. Unlike some  ultra-reformers, we do not advocate the destruction of state  enterprises, and state and collective farms during the  transition to market relations. They need to be reformed in a  speedy and popular way, rather than an elite privatization, and  transformed into associations, cooperatives, and joint-stock  companies."    The Peasant Party supports private farming, however; it  believes that forming the necessary legislative and technical  base for its development would take many years.    "The Peasant Party believes that land should be owned only  by  those who work it and take care of it. Legislation must confirm  the peasants' unconditional ownership of land along with the  right to pass it on to their heirs and each peasant's right to  sell and buy its share of land within a collective of  land-users. Each must have the right to own a garden plot."    The party will use all its powers to prevent sale of land  for  "next to nothing" to corrupt government officials and "capital  owners, including foreign ones."    The party will press for more government support and  subsidies, for "a parity of prices between industrial and  agricultural products, without the domination of self-invented  credit lines." It will insist on the reduction of taxes imposed  on agricultural enterprises, retaining only the tax on land  property.    The Peasant Party believes that small and medium businesses  should be encouraged to help convert Ukraine's industrial  facilities to upgrade food processing, attracting also foreign  investment for the purpose.    The party's main goal, Dovhan says, is the stabilization of  Ukraine's economy which, in turn, will strengthen its  sovereignty.    "In this noble cause, the Peasant Party of Ukraine appeals  for unity, national concord and solidarity of all: democrats,  Communists, Liberals, or Socialists -- all constructive  associations and movements in the name of preserving and  developing our sovereign state.    "I appeal to my colleagues, party activists, agricultural  managers and specialists, please, by all means, nominate a  representative of the countryside in every constituency. I call  on electors to support the peasants. If we fail to do this, we  are in store for the worst."    Chairman of the Socialist Party Oleksandr Moroz begins his  election broadcast with an attack on his anti-Communist rivals:  "What party should you vote for? Who should you give your  preferences? Think of what I'm saying. The Peasant, Socialist,  and Communist parties are parties of the working people. The  others, with rare exceptions, whatever they say, are advocating  wild capitalization. Thus, these parties are anti-popular."    The party has grown and strengthened its ranks "without the  help of the West" in the three years of its existence, Moroz  says. Although Ukraine's Government rejected the Socialist  party's anti-crisis program proposed two years ago, some of its  points are being used in the government's present policy, he  says.    The Socialist leader appeals for "love and pride for  homeland," jobs, and the security lost with the fall of  socialism, in contrast to the current situation. He says:  "Today's liberalization, privatization, and hyperinflation are  mechanisms of robbing the people. It is a planned and conscious  robbery by the power of the mafiosi." Some of the proposed  privatization plans are viewed as part of that robbery.    "We are against turning land into an object of sale and  purchase. Look at Russia: in Voronezh, six hectares were sold to  the Germans, and these six hectares have already been shipped  abroad in wagons. Is it a return to 1942?" Other socialist  objectives include the freezing of prices and wages.    The present government is being wrongly described as  Communist, Moroz says, and its policies should not be confused  with the Communist or Socialist party ideas. "It's a lie that  Communists are in power. Without touching the president's  closest circles, I will name a few from the top power echelon,  you make your own conclusions: Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, Lanovyy,  Zhulynskyy, Morozov, Ryabchenko, Chernyak, Yemets, Kostenko,  Talanchuk, (?Sheshchyn), Markulov -- they are the ones who are  deciding our foreign and home policy."    "We are accused of being in opposition to reforms," adds  Volodymyr Marchenko in conclusion. "It's a lie. We are against  the robbery described as reform. We are in favor of reforms  that benefit honest people, not the ones executed at their  expense. We are for the kind of reforms which will bring power  and property to the people."</p>

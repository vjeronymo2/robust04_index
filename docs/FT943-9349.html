			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei improves on bond market rally Share prices gained ground on arbitrage buying and purchases by public funds, and the Nikkei 225 average closed higher in spite of a lack of news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally ahead 180.03 at the day's best of 20,770.25, after dipping to a low of 20,584.82 in the morning session but supported throughout the day by buying orders from domestic financial institutions and arbitrageurs. Volume, however, remained low as investors other than public fund managers stayed on the sidelines. A total of 274m shares changed hands, against Tuesday's 256m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.35 at 1,661.50 and the Nikkei 300 firmed 1.14 to 302.15. Advances led declines by 549 to 398, with 203 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.83 to 1,349.66. A rally in the bond market, depressed since last week on the rise in the dollar and prospects of an imminent economic recovery, relieved some traders. Some investors feared that a sell-off in the bond market would prompt profit-taking in equities to cover losses on bond portfolios. Overseas investors stepped up their buying of chemical shares on expectations of higher ethylene prices, although some of the gains were trimmed by selling by domestic institutions. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y10 to Y554 and Showa Denko added Y5 at Y372. Steels, leading the day's activity, were supported by public funds. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, gained Y2 at Y370, while NKK moved up Y4 to Y285 and Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y418. Maruha, a fishing company, forged ahead Y26 to Y452 on reports that it will start the world's first tuna fish farming project. Mitsumi Electric dropped Y160 to Y1,550 on reports of a decline in half-year operating profits, while prospects of falling CD-ROM disk drive sales hit Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics, which lost Y90 at Y3,130. Speculation that overseas investors will sell blue chip electricals depressed leading high-technology stocks. Toshiba dipped Y8 to Y768 and NEC Y10 to Y1,240. But consumer electronics stocks were higher, with Matsushita Electric Industrial up Y10 to Y1,780 and Sony adding Y80 at Y5,980. In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 36.32 to 23,053.52 in volume of 71.6m shares. The index was supported by a rise in retail and drug stocks. Roundup The region's markets generally improved yesterday. HONG KONG advanced as strong general buying pushed stocks up sharply following a good rally in Hong Kong issues in London. The Hang Seng index moved forward 171.65, or 1.8 per cent, to 9,618.08. Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 4.28bn, against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 2.99bn. BOMBAY closed at a 27-month peak on general buying by speculators, with the BSE index strengthening 45.92 to 4,365.00. Brokers said the rise was fuelled by across the board purchasing by investors who believed that the market was poised to climb on the back of excellent corporate results and good monsoon rains. SHANGHAI's A share index for domestic investors shrugged off Tuesday's losses to soar on expectations of an infusion of bank liquidity. The index finished 95.23, or 14.35 per cent, ahead at 759.17 in turnover of Yn9.72bn. Shanghai's B share index rose 1.84 to 78.87 as market sentiment remained good. SEOUL moved up, helped by reports that the central bank would loosen its tight grip on monetary policy. The composite index improved 12.71 to 930.21 as a technical rebound following recent falls further strengthened sentiment. KUALA LUMPUR gained 1.8 per cent in the strongest market volume since mid-June, of 425m shares. The composite index closed at a five-month high, up 19.2 at 1,092.8. Plantation shares were in demand as funds rerated the stocks to reflect firm palm oil prices. United Plantations appreciated 70 cents to MDollars 7.10. MANILA saw share prices stage a good rise, spurred by investors positioning for an expected surge next month when Petron shares are listed.

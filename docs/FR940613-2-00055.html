			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This approach raises the question, `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Which  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> organizations?''_which could be extremely hard to answer. As with the matter of dividing up the value in the first place, leaving the decision to the trustees places a burden on them. Nevertheless, under this approach, the trustees are the ones to decide. If no appropriate vehicles existed, a trust might be established to receive the transferred value and make grants over time. The responsibility for allocating funds is borne by thousands of trustees of colleges and hospitals and foundations and charities all over the country; there are plenty of examples to follow_and laws to prevent abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative to endowing a new or existing charitable organization is for the converted institution to accept special obligations to serve the convenience and needs of the community for banking services. This is a very broad subject, which we are not prepared to explore exhaustively here. We would make three basic points, however. First, while all banks clearly have public obligations, it seems likely that imposing different burdens on institutions which are otherwise direct competitors will ultimately create safety and soundness concerns. For that reason alone we would oppose this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the value transfer inherent in an institution's voluntary acceptance of a special obligation to the community_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a promise to make affordable housing loans, or to open branches in distressed neighborhoods_is difficult to measure against immediately cashable value delivered to depositors or others. We think it would be difficult for trustees to know what they'd actually done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the history of mutual savings banks does suggest that organizations to which any portion of the value of a converting institution might be transferred should be locally focussed, and should have the encouragement of self-help as a major objective. To give only two of many possible examples, helping to capitalize a community development bank, or establishing a day care facility which permitted single mothers to work, would have satisfying historic resonance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> No Entitlement; No Forced Conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The idea that some of the value of a converting institution should be delivered to the ``community'' it was chartered to serve is as strongly opposed by some as it is supported by others. This is another excellent example of the political (rather than regulatory) character of the issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At least two arguments against a ``community'' share have been advanced. The first is that the ``wrong'' charities and community organizations would be chosen_wrong from the speaker's point of view, that is_because of their skill and persistence in lobbying the board. The second is that such organizations, seeing latent wealth available, would put pressure on boards to convert.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This second argument is also advanced, as it was in the early '70s, against giving  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> depositors  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transferrable rights: if value is ``available,'' they will put pressure on institutions to convert.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Being  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exempt  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from constituent ``pressure'' is unhealthy for any organization. Legislators have to face the voters. Independent agencies are subject to oversight. Stock organizations can be taken over. We do not believe that the trustees of mutuals should be allowed to ignore completely the views of those the institution exists to serve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, we would emphasize that however one decides the value-distribution issue, that does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> answer the (misguided) question, ``Who owns a mutual?'' It does not, in our view, give anyone standing to demand that an institution convert_any more than a group of private citizens could demand that the Red Cross ``convert''! Conversion is a decision for the trustees, and until they make such a decision, the FDIC will not get involved_except where inadequate capital makes it desirable from a safety and soundness standpoint. Mutuality has a distinguished history in America. In the aggregate, mutuals have cost the FDIC proportionately less than have stock institutions. We would not endorse a system that compelled mutual institutions to change their character.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> New Form of Transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having adopted  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> answer to the question, ``Who gets the existing value?'', the problem of delivering that value is easier to address. We would suggest the following approach:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The trustees decide how much capital they need to raise as a business matter. (There is no ``appraisal'' process.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The trustees hire underwriters to conduct an initial public offering_and an escrow agent for the purposes described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Rights to subscribe for the stock of the converted institution are distributed to ``rightholders'' in accordance with the principles outlined above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Each of these rights will have value. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth elected to raise $20 million, and distributed 4 million rights to buy 4 million shares (at $5 each), and the market valued the converted institution at 80% of resulting book (or $96 million), the shares would trade at $24 each, and the right to buy a share for $5 would be worth $19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The rights would be ``transferrable'' only in the sense that, at the end of the subscription period, the escrow agent would exercise on behalf of any rightholder who had not done so, turn the stock over to the underwriter for sale, give $5/share of the proceeds to the company and send the difference to the rightholder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

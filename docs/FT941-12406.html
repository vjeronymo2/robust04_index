			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Marchais successor in pledge on policy Mr Robert Hue, elected at the weekend to lead France's Communist party, called for broader participation in policy-making as the way to reverse the party's electoral decline. But he indicated there would be no marked departure from the policies pursued over recent years by Mr Georges Marchais, the veteran party leader who stepped down after 22 years as general secretary. 'I will be the leader of continued change,' Mr Hue said in a newspaper interview. Mr Marchais, unexpectedly, will retain a seat on the party's national committee, the top executive body. Mr Hue, however, stressed that he would be independent in his leadership. 'Georges is not trying to cling on, and I am not under the guidance of anyone,' he said. According to Mr Hue, the party congress in Saint-Ouen, a Paris suburb, had agreed to 'confirm and extend the renovation of the party' which has seen its vote fall from almost 25 per cent in the early-1970s to 9 per cent in the first round of last spring's general election. 'We must do everything for and by democracy, through the development of the participation of workers, citizens and the people,' said Mr Hue. The congress voted to approve new statutes which say policy must now be built on a diversity of opinion, representing a move away from the principle of democratic centralism. But the move was not enough for some reformers within the party who have urged a bigger break from the orthodox Communist policies pursued by Mr Marchais, and who blame his hardline views for the party's decline. Mr Charles Fiterman, a former transport minister and a leader of a reformist faction within the party, announced at the congress that he would quit the party leadership because of its failure to modernise. Mr Hue hinted at the possibility of co-operation with the Socialist party but said all parties of the French left needed to rethink their strategies. 'The Socialist party was in power and its policies were massively condemned by the people,' said the Communist leader, adding that the left 'has to start anew'. Mr Hue, 47, is little-known outside the Communist party, which he joined at 16. A male nurse by training, he became a full-time party bureaucrat and has been a central committee member for six years.</p>

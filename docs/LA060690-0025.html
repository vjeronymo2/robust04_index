			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG LOSER IS KIM'S REPRESSIVE REGIME  </P> <P> A few days ago a clearly stunned North Korean government expressed incredulity  at the prospect of a meeting between the leaders of South Korea, its hated  rival, and the Soviet Union, its most important international patron. Now,  Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Mikhail S. Gorbachev having indeed met in San  Francisco, the Pyongyang regime likely finds itself in a state of political  shock.  </P> <P> For what Gorbachev and Roh agreed is that Seoul and Moscow would work to resume  the diplomatic ties they last had in the early years of this century, before  either the Soviet Union or the Republic of Korea had come into existence.  Meanwhile, they will expand their economic, trade and cultural relations. From  a conversation in San Francisco lasting only about an hour has come yet another  milestone in this era of remarkable international change.  </P> <P> The historic significance of the Roh-Gorbachev agreement lies in the fact that  the Soviet Union was, quite literally, the creator of the North Korean  Communist state that to this day actively menaces its southern neighbor.  </P> <P> The division of the Korean peninsula at the 38th Parallel was a tragic and  unintended consequence of the Allied victory in World War II, the almost-casual  result of an administrative decision that the Red Army should accept the  surrender of Japanese forces in northern Korea. Once there, though, the Soviets  refused to get out, withdrawing only after they had cemented in power the  Stalinist Kim Il Sung, whose dictatorship goes on. The costly three-year war  that Kim launched against the south in 1950 was fully supported by Moscow.  </P> <P> For Seoul, improved ties with Moscow can only work further to isolate Kim's  repressive and increasingly friendless regime. For Moscow, the major appeal is  a chance to benefit from South Korea's burgeoning economic development and  expertise. The Soviets are eager for Korean help, especially in joint ventures  to develop Siberia. In recent years, trade between the two countries has  expanded markedly, from $600 million last year to an expected $1 billion this  year. South Korea could provide much of the high-quality, low-cost consumer  goods the Soviets desperately want.  </P> <P> It's too early to assess the full implications of closer Seoul-Moscow ties.  Plainly, they could reach far. For example China, which already does billions  in trade with South Korea, is also eager to attract Korean investors. Beijing  may now feel compelled to pursue its own closer ties with Seoul. Peace isn't  about to break out on the Korean peninsula; the demilitarized zone between  north and south remains the world's most heavily fortified border. But the  regional political rearrangements now under way can only work in time to erode  that barrier.  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Personal View: Russia's window of opportunity Today, the Russian economy is struggling under the combined effects of high inflation, declining output, demilitarisation, political instability, and a restructuring of virtually its entire industrial base. The transition to a consumer-oriented market economy is creating economic and political turmoil. Never before has so large a country attempted to recreate itself over so short a time; there is no use understating the scale of the upheaval or the enormity of the challenge. Yet with little fanfare from abroad, Russia is now engaged in the most sweeping effort to change its economy since Peter the Great built St Petersburg, his 'window on Europe', nearly three centuries ago. Some 5,000 large and medium-sized enterprises are heading for privatisation as Russia hurries to build a market economy based on private property, entrepreneurship, and economic opportunity. Last December, the first auctions for shares in privatised enterprises began. By the end of this month, more than 700 enterprises will have entered private hands, creating thousands of shareholders and property owners. The process began last year with the distribution of a total of 150m privatisation vouchers to every man, woman and child. Each voucher, with a face value of Rbs10,000, can be exchanged at privatisation auctions for shares in large enterprises until the last day of this year, when the vouchers are set to expire. At the first auctions, each voucher bought an average of 3.7 shares. Each share has a face value of Rbs1,000, which corresponds to its historical book value. The inflation-adjusted book value is probably 20-30 times higher. So, on average, early-bird investors were able to exchange each Rbs10,000 voucher for shares representing Rbs74,000-Rbs110,000 worth of property. The enterprises up for auction run the gamut from small, high tech companies such as the microelectronics concern Eleks, in Vladimir, to Gornozavodsk Cement in the Urals. All leading industries, from manufacturing to services, from chemicals and food processing to textiles and jet engines, are represented. The early successes of Russian privatisation are a direct result of the government's commitment to stand clear and let investors operate free from bureaucratic meddling. To buy shares in privatised enterprises, investors have only to show up at auction centres with vouchers in hand and place their bids. There is a large and liquid market for vouchers on exchanges found in big cities throughout Russia, ensuring that vouchers are easily purchased in bulk. Both Russian citizens and foreign investors may buy and sell vouchers and participate in the auctions at any time and place. Both play by the same rules. There are no elaborate regulatory barriers, no special fees, permits, or conditions. With most enterprises offering 30 per cent of their shares for sale at auction and no limit on the number of shares any single investor may purchase, investors can acquire large stakes. And soon investors will be able to bid for shares in enterprises anywhere in Russia from computer-linked auction centres. Meanwhile, hundreds of entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity offered by Russia's privatisation law to launch mutual funds (called 'investment funds') for purchasing shares in privatised enterprises. The funds offer voucher holders a way to spread their risk over a portfolio of enterprises. Foreigners are free to establish new investment funds or to invest in existing ones. Eventually, with the shares of thousands of enterprises available for trading, the embryonic exchanges which have sprouted up from Moscow to Vladivostok will finance new business formation, investment, and job creation. With privatisation in effect bringing thousands of initial public offerings to market this year, the time may not be far off when the Moscow stock exchange will become a great magnet for international capital. Russia's experiment with entrepreneurial capitalism faces daunting obstacles. But few countries can match its combination of a highly-educated workforce, a first-class science base, a far-flung communications and transportation infrastructure, and vast reserves of untapped natural resources. Nowhere is the potential for growth so great and barriers to foreign investment in privatised enterprises so few. With privatisation auctions under way almost continuously, a new Russian economy is rapidly taking shape. When the auction centres close at the end of this year, an historic window of opportunity for investors will close with it. Only those who seized the chance to become charter shareholders will reap the full dividends of Russia's new millennium of freedom.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mukhammat Sabirov, prime minister of </F> Tatarstan, by Zhanna Khidiatullina; date, place not given: "We  Must Find Our Own Path"]    [Text] At their 19th session the deputies of the Tatarstan  Supreme Soviet approved the republic budget on condition that a  program to get the economy out of crisis is presented for their  consideration before 30 May. A TATAR-INFORM correspondent asked  Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov to say what the  government is doing in this brief period to prepare for an  extraordinary Supreme Soviet session to discuss the document  that will determine the future course of the republic's economic  development.    [Khidiatullina] The Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet of  Ministers is working on an anticrisis program. Is the economic  situation that dire?    [Sabirov] We have probably not chosen the most felicitous  terms. I would not say that our economy is in a stage of  crisis. Of course, many enterprises are close to it, but a  number of sectors are developing perfectly well. Although the  situation has been getting increasingly serious month by month  since the beginning of 1994.    It must not be forgotten that the integration of the  Tatarstan economy in the Russian economy is so great that we are  bound to be affected by all its fluctuations. We only have the  power to influence the acuteness of the problem of defaulting on  payment and the speed at which it develops. I am referring  above all to the situation that has developed over reciprocal  default. Since last year Republic of Tatarstan President M.  Shaymiyev and members of the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers have  been trying to persuade the Russian leadership to opt for  reciprocal settlement.    No way would you call it a market measure, of course. But  Moscow could not come up with any other solution either. And in  the meantime everyone has fallen into debt. Even those who were  producng continuously and selling products. The "Tatneft"  association was forced to dismiss people or send them on  administrative leave, because it had no money to pay them. This  enormous enterprise is unable to get the 400 billion rubles [R]  it has earned. Reciprocal debt between enterprises in Tatarstan  and Russia now totals approximately R2 trillion.    Many people are asking banks for credit. You are well aware  of the interest rates -- 21 percent and more. They double if  payment dates are not met. Naturally, enterprises include these  payments in the cost price -- a familiar chain of events! Some  organizations and small plants are now being refused credit (the  banks also fear for their money) and they, having spent their  circulating capital, are beginning to "eat into" their fixed  capital.    We are able to support only the firms that are producing  products essential to the republic. We will do this  irrespective of the form of ownership of the enterprise. Some  of them will be declared bankrupt. What can you do? Tatarstan  cannot solve this problem alone, of course. Particularly where  plants of the former military-industrial complex are concerned.  It is great, of course, that we are now producing practically  no weapons at all, but the vast machine tools that used to  produce aircraft wings or warship hulls are not ready to produce  irons or washing machines.    But we can do something. The construction of a tanker  fleet will provide long-term orders for the plant named for  Gorkiy in Zelenodolsk, helicopters made by our specialist  company are still in demand, and the Kazan Aircraft Plant has  called to say that a Russian Federation government decree had  placed orders for the new Tu-330 cargo aircraft, which can carry  20-30 tonnes.    But enterprises such as the Lenin Science and Production  Association, try as they may to keep their heads above water by  producing linoleum or artificial leather, cannot resolve the  problems of conversion. Russia needs to start meetings its  commitments as set out in the treaty and the intergovernmental  agreements. But, despite all our efforts, we have not yet been  able to secure the necessary measures.    [Khidiatullina] So Tatarstan needs a practical program to  solve its problems?    [Sabirov] Absolutely. But everything must be done to gear  this program to the future. Only a madman would dream of a  return to the past. We have not seriously attempted to consider  what the economic system in our country is going to look like.  Although for a year now the Cabinet of Ministers has been  working on "Basic Guidelines for the Economic and Social  Development of the Republic of Tatarstan in Accordance With the  new Republic of Tatarstan Constitution." Academics and  practical experts have been involved in this work. The draft is  now ready. It is being examined by foreign experts. Together  with the Republic of Tatarstan Constitution, the treaty between  Russia and Tatarstan, and the government program it will form  the basis of the program currently being devised to stabilize  the Republic of Tatarstan economy. The main aim is to ensure  that any turn of events has as little effect as possible on our  people.    We are considering the economic situation in many countries  and are copying the positive experience of Germany, Hungary, and  Turkey. But none of these states has specific solutions to  offer. For example, Turkish private enterprises are doing a fine  job and their products are competitive. But we cannot help  being worried by the rate of inflation and the appearance of  large numbers of impoverished people there. That is not for us.  We must plow our own furrow.    [Khidiatullina] How is work on the document that is to be  submitted for discussion by the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet  deputies proceeding in practice?    [Sabirov] All ministries and departments are now engaged in  elaborating their own proposals. Every five days the members of  the government meet to discuss progress in implementing this  important task. We were prepared to examine several alternative  versions. When we began to listen to the ministers' and vice  premiers' proposals we realized that there was no sharp  disagreement. Basically, everyone recognized an identical  objective. Differences arose when the tactics for attaining it  were discussed.    The program will include a number of practical measures.  Moreover, we are working on a mechanism for implementing it --  normative acts, draft laws, draft edicts. Adopting another  declaration would be a waste of time. It is conceivable that  the Supreme Soviet could grant the president special powers for  the period of the document's implementation, whereby his edicts  would have the force of law. Without this, rapid decisions and  vigorous measures are impossible.    [Khidiatullina] Will you be able to complete all the work by  30 May?    [Sabirov] Had the Cabinet of Ministers not been working on  the problem for, I repeat, nearly a year, it would have been  impossible to do so in such a hurry, in a matter of days. But I  am confident now that on 30 May the deputies will start  discussing the program for the stabilization of the Tatarstan  economy.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Tories face debates on sell-offs Privatisation and tax are likely to dominate the Tory party conference this week with an announcement that Railtrack is still on course to be sold in spite of the three-month signalling dispute. A powerful group of cabinet ministers is continuing to press for partial privatisation of the Post Office, although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday said the government had yet to make a decision. The DTI is said to be encouraged by the consultation process which ended last month. Mr Heseltine said he had not changed his mind about the conclusions of his green paper, which advocated a 51 per cent sale of the Royal Mail. While the cabinet is still expected to back the controversial sale Whitehall officials privately concede that those who want to keep the Post Office in the public sector have gained ground in recent weeks. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will warn against privatisation for the sake of it when he addresses a Tory Reform Group fringe meeting. He is said to remain in favour of partial privatisation of the Post Office, although he is less enthusiastic about the sale than Mr Heseltine or Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, will announce tomorrow that the government intends to press on with privatisation of Railtrack, the signalling and track company. He believes the outcome of the signalling dispute, which led to the introduction of new working practices, makes the sale more likely. However, many in the City question whether the company can be privatised without two years of accounts. The issue of tax cuts will be raised by the rightwing Conservative Way Forward group, which yesterday called for 2p off the 25p basic rate of tax in next month's Budget. Ministers on both the right and left of the party yesterday indicated that the government might have to go into the next election without tax cuts. Mr Redwood, who is to address the Conservative Way Forward group this week, said the time to resume 'our normal course' of cutting taxes might not be until the middle to late nineties.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Friends on the Right I ENJOYED myself this week. I attended the morning editorial conferences at three of Britain's finest national newspapers: Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and Sun. I do this occasionally. It keeps me in touch with right-wing opinion. The reason I am welcome at editorial conferences is that I am related to, or acquainted with, all the top editors. What is more, I have a VIP card that speeds me past the security guards and sniffer dogs that now patrol the corridors of all our great newspapers, to protect journalists from readers. On Wednesday I visited the Mail. The editor of the Mail is a grand and knighted person, terrifically shrewd and witty, who works unceasingly to keep the Conservatives in power and the red hordes at bay. What a super paper. The conference was hushed and reverent, and started with the editor analysing that morning's issue. 'Not bad,' he said, pointing to the front page. ''LABOUR SCARES LOW-PAID VOTERS - Many of the poorest families fear they will pay more tax under a Labour government, it is revealed today. An astonishing 44 per cent of the lowest-paid workers . . . believe they will be worse off . . .' 'I think I like that. It has all the ingredients that I am constantly on about. Neil Kinnock. Pensioners. Taxes. Frightening. Mr Major twice as popular. Dustmen and road repairers. Socialists. Frightening. Taxes. Frightening. 'I also liked this other story: 'Trident safe with us says Major.' And there is good material inside. I particularly like the Comment column for explaining why it is that for every three voters who would trust Labour to handle the nation's finances, five place their faith in the Tories. And there is a remarkably good letters page which hits home hard against the homosexual lobby in the British film and theatre industry, and spotlights the appalling cost to the NHS of removing tattoos. 'But I want more variety. I'm tired of the tax story and so are the readers. There must be thousands of reasons why people shouldn't vote Labour yet all we have done is scratch the surface. I want blood, guts and toil. This is a newspaper I'm running, not some holiday camp.' On Thursday I dropped in at the Telegraph. What a super paper. The Telegraph's editor is a tremendously imposing figure, erect and bespectacled, with a penchant for military history. He brings his morning conferences to order by banging his desk with his swagger-stick and shouting: 'Gunners]' He had mixed views about Thursday's Telegraph. 'A wholesome front page,' he said. ''Wedding at Windsor for Lady Helen.' That's the ticket. And there are stories inside that do not displease me. Page 3 is excellent: 'Judge spares husband who strangled nagging wife.' 'And I am expressly pleased with this Page 5 headline: 'How sausages save the Queen when rat is on the menu.' Perfectly barking. Precision gunnery. 'Fashion is OK. Ditto obituaries. Business limps. Sport looks tired. What really vexes me, though, is the leader-page spread. We've got Claudia FitzHerbert babbling on about Book Aid for Russia when we all know that our distinguished visitor this morning, fellow from the FT' - he waved in my direction - 'did that last Saturday with considerably greater poise. And we've got this piece about racial discrimination in working men's clubs. 'But where is the election? We seem to have forgotten it. Mislaid it. Overlooked it. Not good, gunners. Not good at all. I suggest we recommence the heavy pounding. Then bring up the cavalry. I take it they've been primed. This election will be tight. We don't want Neil Kinnock and Clare Short trampling all over us. What? What?' Yesterday I called at the Sun. What a super paper. Naturally, the editor was delighted with yesterday's performance on the kidnapping of pretty estate agency salesgirl Stephanie Slater, 25 - page after page of super copy, pics and maps. And he drooled over the topless lovely on Page 11: 'Sexy Amanda Jayne Forbes is always an uplifting experience' (nudge, nudge). He also liked the pictures with the Sun's continuing 'News Special' (ho-ho-ho) on superthug Mike Tyson: 'Tyson stripped me with one hand and said: We will have a baby.' But he was infuriated by another limp Nigel Mansell story on Page 35. 'What's Mansell ever done?' roared the editor. 'He was born a runner-up.' (I have deleted all expletives and sarff London terminology). And he demanded a progress report on Operation Bimbo. 'The American presidential election's got smoking bimbos coming out of its ears, so what about our election? Find some. I don't care how but get me bimbos.'</p>

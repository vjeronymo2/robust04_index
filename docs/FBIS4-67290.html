			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Money Laundering Law Is Needed"] </F>   [Text] The call for a money laundering prevention law has  drawn greater attention from the general public following the  seizure of the property in the United States of a Thai MP who  was accused of being involved in marijuana trafficking in that  country. At present, Thailand has no law for the prevention of  dirty money laundering, while such legislation has already been  enforced in many countries, including by our neighbors, such as  Singapore. The money laundering prevention law will enable the  authorities to probe into the financial status of any suspicious  persons to determine the sources of their money and related  transactions.    As a matter of fact, the examination of assets and  liabilities of suspected individuals is nothing new to Thailand.  Following the previous coup, the then ruling National  Peacekeeping Council issued a special order for the examination  of assets of suspicious politicians. As a result, the people  were informed of politicians who received gifts of checks and  individuals who gave such gifts to them. This is another type  of money laundering law once enforced in Thailand. But this  peculiar measure was unacceptable in a democratic society  because of its discriminatory enforcement.    Looked at from another angle, the money laundering law can  also affect individual rights. However, if too much emphasis is  placed on personal rights, the whole society can suffer adverse  consequences. It is imperative that the state place the  interests of the society over that of individuals. Without this  law, it is feared that Thailand can become a haven of dirty  money which is normally earned from narcotics trafficking, the  contraband goods trade, and other illegal activities.    Financial institutions might find it hard to swallow if such  a law is enforced. Their business and liquidity can be hampered  should the money of their clients be ordered frozen pending  official investigation. But they should consider the adverse  consequences the country has to bear without this law.  Switzerland was once labelled as one of the places where dirty  money was deposited.    The current situation and present trends in the world and  society have warranted a money laundering prevention law for  Thailand. Hence, the authorities will be able to examine the  money of suspicious individuals. Otherwise, Thailand will  become a haven of dirty money from law breakers in the country  as well as from unscrupulous individuals abroad. However, if  the law makers themselves also have wounds on their backs that  need covering, it is very likely that such legislation will  never be promulgated.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (7): More efficient look - French component groups still have a long way to go to catch up FRANCE'S CAR component industry, Europe's second largest, has played an essential part in supporting the campaign by Renault and Peugeot to reduce their productivity gap with Japan. Michelin, the tyre group; Valeo, the diversified components maker; the glass maker, Saint Gobain; ECIA, the Peugeot components subsidiary; and Hutchinson, the maker of rubber parts and sealants, have made significant improvements in costs and quality in recent years. This has been partly in response to pressure from their car-making customers, seeking to improve efficiency at all stages of the process. But it is also a result of the rigours imposed by the weakness of car demand, down by 0.6 per cent in France in the first four months of this year, according to the CCFA car makers' committee. As a mark of just how far productivity has advanced, the French component industry's output grew by 25 per cent in real terms in the four years to 1990, while the number of employees fell by more than 2.5 per cent, according to a recent survey* by SAC Enterprises, the UK consultancy. Yet, in line with their European counterparts, French component groups still have a long way to go to catch up. According to France's Fiev, vehicle component makers' federation, European companies' annual sales per employee are still a mere FFr630,000 (Dollars 119,000), less than half their Japanese competitors' equivalent of FFr1.33m. Even so, France's largest components groups are significantly leaner and more efficient than they were only a few years ago. Valeo announced a 30 per cent rise in operating profits last year, reflecting productivity gains of 5 per cent. It was recently awarded top marks by Moody's, the rating agency, which classed Valeo's treasury bills as prime one, and described the French group's plants as 'among the most efficient in Europe's auto components industry'. As a supplier to Nissan, Honda and Toyota, the company has shown that it can match rigorous Japanese demands. Michelin returned to operating profit last year, after having incurred heavy losses in the downturn, worsened by the costs of having to digest its 1989 acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich. Since then it has trimmed stocks, made heavy job losses and introduced production efficiencies. French component makers have been helped by the fact that French car makers have taken to buying in more of their components from suppliers, rather than making them in-house. So it is that bought-in components have risen to just over 60 per cent of total operating costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at Renault, a steep rise over recent years, and will go on rising in both cases. This is happening partly because Peugeot and Renault have both moved away from their old strategy of integration, and instead see themselves primarily as designers and assemblers of cars. The rise in car makers' outsourcing also reflects their increasing demand for high-technology components, such as anti-lock brakes and catalysers, which they have no interest in making themselves. This means they need suppliers that are prepared to design and produce a significant part of a vehicle themselves, in return for a long-term contract. An example is Epeda Bertrand Faure, asked to handle to whole of the seating of the Renault 19. All this signals a rethink of the traditional adversarial relationships between car makers and suppliers, in which pricing formed the most important part of purchasing decisions. The battleground has now shifted, so that French car makers have instead become more demanding on quality and delivery times, to enable them to practise just-in-time stock control, an essential part of their productivity gains. Peugeot and Renault have, for example, for the past five years been running joint audits to keep component suppliers' quality up to the mark, grading them according to ability to do their own quality control. They are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity, too. The winners in the shift towards quality and higher technology have been the largest players, while smaller suppliers are increasingly being forced into a secondary position, selling parts to the large component groups instead of directly to the car makers. 'Not all of the French suppliers have the R&amp;D resources to meet these requirements. Some . . . will become second-tier suppliers,' says SAC. Many already have. Renault plans to reduce its number of suppliers from 1,100 last year to around 600 or 700, while Peugeot has already cut back from 1,700 suppliers in 1984 to 740 last year, according to the study. This is still many more suppliers than Japanese producers tolerate - Nissan has 160, for example - which suggests that the shake-out has much further to go. If the big players are doing well, the middle and lower ranks of the French components industry shows worrying lack of dynamism, says SAC. For one thing, the industry tends to be too centred on the French market, with the obvious exceptions of the top players such as Valeo, Michelin and Saint Gobain. This is a disadvantage when car makers are becoming more global. At the same time, French car component companies are facing increasing competition in their own market. In recent years, several German companies have set up in Alsace, to take advantage of the relatively cheap labour costs, while ACG Europe, the GM subsidiary, has opened a chassis centre near Paris. In 1990, NGK, the Japanese spark-plug maker, announced plans to open a plant in the Loire valley; and Koyo Seiko, a Toyota subsidiary, took a stake in Renault's steering systems division. Given France's continuing sensitivities over competition from Japan, observers do not expect a French repeat of the invasion of the US car components industry achieved by Japanese suppliers. For the moment, the French automotive component industry appears to be holding its own internationally, as is shown by its continuing healthy trade surplus. However, the SAC study argues that the international exposure among medium-sized and small suppliers could be a serious handicap. Crucially, the French industry is weak on electronic components, which form a growing proportion of the market as cars become more sophisticated. New products here are being increasingly developed outside France - and the growing number of foreign competitors in France could suggest that French suppliers are losing their technological edge, it warns. * The Outlook for the French Automotive Supplier Industry in the 1990s, price Pounds 550, SAC Enterprises, 24 Northfield Avenue, London W13 9RL.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A New York pharmaceutical company recalled a generic anti-hypertensive drug  because it said company employees misrepresented samples of the drug submitted  for government inspection. Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., also  said it suspended sales of two other government-approved drugs while  investigations into them continue. The recall of Par's generic version of the  high-blood-pressure drug Maxzide marks the second time this summer a drug  company has informed the Food and Drug Administration it had misrepresented its  product to the agency. In each case, the companies marketed formulations of  their product that were different than those approved by the FDA.  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Latest annuity rates ANNUITY RATES have been falling, with cuts from Generali, Prudential, Royal life and London Life over the past few weeks. Peter Quinton, of the Annuity Bureau, says: 'These rates are linked to long-term interest rates, and it is these rates which determine the rates insurance companies pay. 'The average gross redemption yield on the British government high coupon 15-year stock has fallen from 8.56 per cent on June 16 to 8.2 on July 6, which compares with approximately 9.06 per cent for the same period last year.' Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity Direct, adds: 'Many people are holding back from buying annuities because they expect that gilt yields will rise as future expectations of inflation increase. 'However, there is room for yields to fall even further, as the fear of inflation is being talked down and, with the strength of sterling, foreign investors are being encouraged back into the market.' The figures in the table above were provided by the Annuity Bureau, Enterprise House, 59-65 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ.

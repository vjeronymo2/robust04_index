			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 12 MEN ARRESTED IN PROSTITUTION SWEEP  </P> <P> Twelve men were arrested on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute in a Friday  night sweep of Harbor Boulevard north of the San Diego Freeway in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The men were arrested after allegedly propositioning two female undercover  officers who were decoys in "Operation Bellhop," according to Lt. Gary Webster.  The police operation in the past has concentrated on prostitution and drug  arrests, particularly at hotels along Harbor, Webster said.  </P> <P> "There were many customers for those arrested," Webster said. "Once arrests  began taking place, those in the area could see what was going on. They took  off."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel has jailed more than 5,000 Palestinians without trial since the uprising  began in the occupied territories 17 months ago, "the vast majority in harsh  conditions," according to Amnesty International. A report by the London-based  human rights movement said Israel's policy of "administrative detention," or  imprisonment without trial, is being used against non-violent opponents,  denying them adequate legal counsel and violating "fundamental human rights."  The group said that most detainees are held for six months.  </P></p>

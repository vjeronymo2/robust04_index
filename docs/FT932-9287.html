			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: New Visions, New Voices - Opera May has become London's month for bold new opera ventures, or so the theory runs, as both the Royal Opera and English National strive to prove that they have the future health of the genre at heart. Another round of the Royal Opera's Garden Venture is due in two weeks; ENO promises a package of its 10-minute 'Soundbites' next Monday and Tuesday at the Donmar Warehouse, while 'New Visions, New Voices' has been organised under the auspices of the Baylis Programme this week in the Royal College of Music's Britten Theatre. Such a flurry of earnest activity continues to paper over the real problem  -the absence of a regular London outlet for small-scale new opera by established composers. It's all very well for the Garden Venture to pat itself on the back for providing young composers with an opportunity to attempt a theatre piece, but it blithely ignores the reality that the gap between such gimcrack pieces and a fully fledged score for the opera house remains unbridgeably vast. Far better for Covent Garden to devote those same resources to a regular season of works that would be inappropriate in the ROH itself, yet would properly complement the programme in the main house. At least ENO now appears to have in place a career structure of sorts for its composers; the collaboration with the Almeida Theatre for a summer festival (with new works by Julian Grant and Kevin Volans this July) should offer the serious chamber dimension, 'Soundbites' occupies the experimental niche, while 'New Visions, New Voices' is aimed at the real beginners; the four works mounted at the RCM were selected from the 100-plus submitted in response to a public appeal for new talent last year. Once again, however, sincere intentions seem to have blurred the clear focus of the final product. The range of ability and ambition in the works chosen for 'New Visions, New Voices' seemed impossibly wide. At one end of the spectrum was Melissa's Maelstrom by the 16-year-old twins Dina and Rosabella Gregory, showing a promising ear for word setting (in a style that rather alarmingly combined elements of Michael Nyman and Lloyd Webber); at the other was the slick The King Comm by Fabienne Audeoud, who has already presented her own multi-media shows across Europe and has clearly acquired a full complement of post-modern pretensions to go with them. Somewhere between came Richard Chew's Still, to a text by James Yarker, which was both confused in its period-hopping dramaturgy and uncertain in its musical stance, and Tom Green and Todd McNeal's Inspector Otto and the Long-haired Bicycle Maniac, an eco-parable which at least managed not to take itself too seriously. They all made, though, for an over-extended and depressingly routine evening. Each work was at least 15 minutes too long, and the self-congratulatory air of the whole enterprise seemed to have prohibited any suggestion of self-criticism. The productions (two by David Sulkin, one each by Stephen Langridge and Rebecca Meitlis) were solid enough, and the casts of student singers from the RCM included some sterling performances, especially from the mezzo Lilli Paasikivi and the tenor Michael Hart-Davis. For those at least, one could be grateful. ***** The National Theatre's 'Springboards' season, its showcase of studio work in the Cottesloe, also finds room for a new chamber opera, presented in collaboration with the Leicester Haymarket. Andrew Poppy's Baby Doll transforms Tennessee Williams' screen play into a continuous 90-minute piece; Fiona O'Neill takes the title role, Simon Masterston-Smith and John Upperton play the husband Archie Lee and the seducer Silva respectively. Poppy is a graduate, if that's the right word, of the very first Garden Venture in 1989, which included his The Uranium Miners Radio Orchestra Play Scenes from Salome's Revenge. What he has carried over from that experience, apart perhaps from a need for shorter titles, is hard to discern; certainly not a greater flexibility or purpose in his vocal writing, which flattens every hint of humour or irony from Williams's lines, or a lighter touch with his instrumentation, which clumps along in a fractured minimalist way. Baby Doll, the opera, seems a thoroughly pointless exercise, which really made one wonder whether all these new outlets for that notional reservoir of untapped operatic potential are fostering any worthwhile talents whatsoever. 'New Visions, New Voices', sponsored by British Gas, at the Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music; further performance tonight. Baby Doll at the Cottesloe Theatre; further performances tomorrow and at the Leicester Haymarket from May 18</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP ENDORSES DEMOCRAT  </P> <P> The California Abortion Rights Action League has endorsed Democrat Irene Allert  in her bid to win the northern San Fernando Valley Assembly seat being vacated  by Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge).  </P> <P> Allert will face Republican real estate broker Paula Boland, who opposes  abortion rights, in the November general election.  </P> <P> CARAL Executive Director Robin Schneider said Wednesday that her group, which  has 100,000 members, has endorsed Allert but has not yet "decided the level of  support" it will provide. The group typically contributes money and volunteer  campaigners to candidates it backs.  </P> <P> Allert said abortion, growth and education will be the major issues in the  campaign for the 38th Assembly District seat, which covers the Valley from  Hidden Hills to Tujunga. La Follette is retiring after 10 years in the  Legislature.  </P> <P> Asked her reaction to the CARAL endorsement, Boland said: "So what? It doesn't  mean anything to me."  </P> <P> She said such issues as crime and breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School  District are more important to voters than abortion rights.  </P> <P> "If she wants to run on one issue, that's her choice," Boland said. "But there  are many important issues. I've never been a one-issue candidate and I'm not  going to be one now."  </P></p>

If, as a result of its reviews, the Board determines that an imminent or severe threat to public health or safety exists, the Board is required to transmit its recommendations directly to the President, as well as to the Secretaries of Energy and Defense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's enabling statute, 42 U.S.C. 2286, requires the Board to review and evaluate the content and implementation of health and safety standards, including DOE'S Orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating to the design, construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE's defense nuclear facilities. The Board must then recommend to the Secretary of Energy any specific measures, such as changes in the content and implementation of those standards, that the Board believes should be adopted to ensure that the public health and safety are adequately protected. The Board is also required to review the design of new defense nuclear facilities, and to recommend changes necessary to protect health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, hold public hearings, gather information, conduct studies, establish reporting requirements for DOE, and take other actions in furtherance of its review of health and safety issues at defense nuclear facilities. The ancillary functions of the Board and its staff all relate to the accomplishment of the Board's primary functions, which is to assist DOE in identifying and correcting health and safety problems at defense nuclear facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This public meeting is being held to obtain information from the Department of Energy that will assist the Board in preparing its fifth annual report to be submitted to Congress under 42 U.S.C. 2286e note.

The role of oversight and enforcement of safety requirements in regulating DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This discussion should provide the Board with an understanding of DOE's recently revised policy and programs for oversight and enforcement dealing with contractor noncompliance with DOE's health and safety Orders, rules and regulations. The presentation should include DOE's assessment of the impact DOE's past oversight and enforcement programs have had upon DOE's efforts to protect the public and safety at its defense nuclear facilities and any prospective changes that may be contemplated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board specifically reserves its right to further schedule and otherwise regulate the course of the meeting, to recess, reconvene, postpone or adjourn the meeting, conduct further reviews, and otherwise exercise its power under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert M.

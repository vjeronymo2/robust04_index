			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Credit where it's due for Clinton trade proposals Sir, Your leader, 'Mr Clinton's trade agenda' (January 14), criticises the US for remaining in the unilateral camp rather than the multilateral camp. It is true he has proposed that competition policy, trade-related environmental issues and workers' rights should be on the future agenda for world trade negotiations. While you endorse the idea of competition policy for a future agenda, you make much of the point that neither workers' rights nor environmental issues are clearly desirable trade subjects. However, you do not mention that Mr Clinton's proposals are for the new World Trade Organisation agenda, which comes into being on July 1 1995. That group can sort out the issues for the agenda. Mr Clinton ought be given credit for raising these subjects now for truly multilateral consideration. In the US we are patiently waiting for the European Union's ideas on subjects for future trade negotiations. The seven-year Uruguay Round, while successful, dealt primarily with issues from the 1970s and 1980s. It's catch-up time: we need to start addressing issues of the 1990s. The leader also criticises the long-standing US policy of trying to pry open Japanese markets for all exporting countries, and suggests it be referred to the WTO. No mention is made of the US goal - opening markets for all exporters. Those efforts have gone on for years and a few years' delay so that it can be raised in the WTO is simply not on when Japan continues to run such a huge trade surplus against most of the rest of the world. In discussing Mr Clinton's trade policy, no mention is made of his pledge to Caribbean and Latin American countries to enter negotiations to ensure those countries are not discriminated against by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nor is mention made of the Clinton administration's commitment to negotiate a bilateral trade pact with Chile as a harbinger of future liberalisation in many countries of Latin America.

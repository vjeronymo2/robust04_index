			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters supported the labeling of products with safe handling instructions. Several commenters objected to mandatory labeling stating either that other methods of educating consumers would be more appropriate, that the required labeling would be ineffective, that labeling is not a substitute for proper training of safe food handling, that requiring a simple label can not guarantee any consumer will follow that label, or that some products currently include sufficient safe handling instructions which make the proposed safe handling label unnecessary. Seven commenters stated that many existing products contain much more helpful and meaningful handling and preparation information than that required by the proposed regulation. One also questioned whether the information contained in the proposed statements is so demonstrably more effective than the safe handling instructions currently in use on meat and poultry so as to justify the millions of dollars in conversion costs. They also suggest that to prohibit alternative language is unnecessarily restrictive and may preclude a more effective way of conveying the message intended. Five commenters suggested that labeling is only one option and point-of-purchase materials or other types of signs may be equally effective or more effective in instructing the consumer about safe food handling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS does not agree with these comments. The focus-study research asked participants about other alternatives for safe handling instructions. Participants in the focus-study research expressed a preference for safe handling instructions to be on the package label and felt other labeling, such as pamphlets or in-store signs, should only be used to supplement package labels, but not replace the package labels. The safe handling instructions are not meant to substitute for comprehensive training of safe handling procedures either in the home or food service setting. The instructions primarily alert food preparers that there is a risk of illness if products are mishandled or improperly cooked, and it addresses four broad parameters of food safety. Finally, FSIS does not believe that current handling instructions on labels will make safe handling instructions unnecessary. The safe handling instructions are not meant to replace more comprehensive cooking instructions found on products. In addition, current labeling may cover the four broad parameters of food safety, but does not include a rationale statement explaining to food preparers why it is important to follow the instructions. The focus-study research found that the rationale statement was an essential feature of the label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officials from two retail stores and two retail associations suggested that the regulations have a sunset provision and that the effectiveness of the regulation be studied periodically. Five additional commenters suggested that the effectiveness of the regulation be evaluated. Several suggested annual reports be sent to the Secretary of Agriculture for review and one requested that FSIS publish a method to measure the effectiveness of the regulation as part of the final rule. There are no changes in the final rule in response to these comments. The Regulatory Flexibility Act already provides that Agencies will periodically review regulations. While this does not have the same effect as a sunset provision, it does insure that the continuing appropriateness of regulations will be assessed. Further, there is no way to quantify the effectiveness of the regulation. It is impossible to determine how many cases of foodborne illness were prevented by the inclusion of these instructions on the labels of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve commenters addressed the four sets of ``Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A's)'' that FSIS disseminated between August 20 and September 15, 1993. Suggestions included codifying the Q&amp;A's as part of the final rule, adding the Q&amp;A's to the proposal and reopening the comment period to allow all interested parties an opportunity to comment on the Q&amp;A's, and including specific responses either in the regulatory language or the preamble of the final rule. Four issues specifically cited were the status of export products, retroactive labeling of products, placement of information on hang tags and on the bottom of trays, and safe handling information requirements for multi-component products which include a meat or poultry portion that is fully cooked or otherwise processed so as to render it ready-to-eat. FSIS does not believe that these Q&amp;A's need to be part of the regulatory language of the final rule. The Q&amp;A's either cited other regulations within Title 9 or provided interpretations of how the safe handling regulation would be applied in specific situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Q&amp;A's, in large part, related to the interim rule, which was withdrawn. However, we will address the specific questions raised by the commenters. Regarding the need for export products to carry safe handling instructions, the condition under which deviations from labeling requirements are permitted are already set out in 9 CFR 317.7 and 9 CFR 381.128. FSIS will not require retroactive labeling of products, products labeled on or after the effective date will be required to carry safe handling instruction on the label. Products labeled prior to the effective date will not require the addition of safe handling instructions. For example, products in frozen storage, labeled prior to the effective date but shipped afterwards, will not be required to add the safe handling instructions. Regarding the placement of safe handling instructions on hang tags or the bottom of trays, FSIS has considered hang tags to be an extension of the label and consequently they may contain required label features such as safe handling instructions. Also, the instructions may be placed on the bottom of trays as long as they are visible at time of purchase. This is evident in the language of the proposed and final rules that state the safe handling instructions, ``shall be prominently placed with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary consumer under customary conditions of purchase and use.'' Finally, as to whether safe handling instructions need to be on products that include a fully cooked meat filling but where the total product requires cooking, e.g., a fully cooked meat filling in uncooked dough: the rule does not require safe handling instructions on products where the meat or poultry portion is fully cooked or otherwise processed to render that portion ready-to-eat. However, while such products do not require safe handling instructions they are not considered ready-to-eat products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

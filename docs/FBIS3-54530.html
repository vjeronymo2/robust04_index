			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A large force of soldiers and policemen this  evening evacuated the settlers who seized a deserted house north  of Qiryat Arba' declaring it a settlement. Our correspondent  Gil Litman reports that before the evacuation started, the Army  declared the area a closed military zone. Our correspondent and  four other representatives of the media were among the first to  be arrested. The Qiryat Arba' settlers showed passive opposition  to the evacuation. Some 20 of them were arrested, and the rest  fled to the surrounding hills.</p>

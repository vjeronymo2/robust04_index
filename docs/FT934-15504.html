			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Belarus finds breaking up is hard to do: Matthew Kaminski and Anthony Robinson report on a state which had independence thrust upon it THE British government is giving a high profile welcome this week to Mr Piotr Krauchanka, foreign minister of Belarus, a state which had independence thrust upon it by the break-up of the Soviet Union. The UK side will show appreciation for the Belarus decision to relinquish its inherited nuclear weapons and give assurances that London values the independence of the new state. But the Foreign Office will be wary of giving open support to Belarus in its competition with the Czech Republic for a seat on the UN Security Council. Unlike the Baltic states, which were freed to return to their historical and cultural roots, Belarus never had an independent identity and faces an unclear future, with few resources and no natural borders or clearly defined reason for existence. Until recently, oil and raw materials, imported mostly from Russia at subsidised prices, fuelled heavy industry, which accounts for 56 per cent of national income. But trade links with the former Soviet states have been disrupted, leading to a 10 per cent drop in production and a trade deficit of 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product last year. An unstable currency adds to the anxiety of the republic's 10.7m people. The Belarus payment coupon, printed last year to cover a shortage of Russian roubles, has lost 30 per cent of its value against the rouble and 120 per cent against the dollar since mid-summer. Inflation hit 32 per cent in July, and unofficially went above 40 per cent in August, mirroring the spiral in Ukraine, another economic basket-case beyond the southern border. Until the break-up, Belarus boasted the former Soviet Union's highest living standards and, even last year, GDP fell only a relatively modest 4.6 per cent. But a lack of monetary control, declining oil supplies from Russia and a breakdown in the inter-state payments system have contributed to 13 per cent decline in GDP since January. Economic hardship has encouraged many of the republic's Soviet-era political leaders to try to re-establish closer links with Russia and the other former Soviet states. On September 7, Belarus signed a currency union treaty with Russia and three central Asian republics. On September 24, it joined an economic union pact with nine republics. Under both arrangements, the government in Minsk would leave monetary, tax, trade and bank policy to Moscow. Belarusian politicians across the country's monochromic spectrum openly hope that economic fidelity will salvage preferential trade treatment, including an estimated 50 per cent subsidy on Russian oil imports. This would underline dependence on its eastern neighbour, which supplies 70 per cent of all imports, and take some of the urgency out of efforts to restructure its economy, particularly the industrial sector. But, with debts to Russia of around Rbs340bn for oil and Rbs100bn for natural gas, and an expected Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn balance of payments deficit this year, the still largely unreformed economy offers little alternative. Recent history, however, points against successful reintegration. The Commonwealth of Independent States, headquartered in Minsk, the Belarus capital, failed to stem the drop in trade and Moscow seems increasingly unwilling - and unable - to foot the bill for a return to an expensive old-style union. The latest economic pacts still have to be approved by the respective legislatures. Unlike the neighbouring Baltic states, Belarus has a weak base for nationalism, although Mr Zenon Pozniak, leader of the opposition nationalist Popular Front party, has tried to rekindle a sense of nationhood separate from Russia. Unreconstructed Communists control the government and economic reform, stuck in the mud, has not yielded needed tax and bankruptcy laws. A voucher privatisation programme, passed by parliament this summer after 18 months of debate, is only due to start next July. Prices are grudgingly being liberalised. On October 1, rent and hot water bills rose ten-fold and threefold, respectively, and were accompanied by an 85 per cent minimum wage rise. But higher energy prices last month only brought them up from 5 per cent to 20 per cent of cost. Western advisers advocate setting up an independent currency but Belarus seems scared to take the plunge, largely because old hands at Gosekonplan, the central planning agency, hold more power than the weak national bank and Finance Ministry, the two centres of reformist effort. A heavily militarised industrial base, and broad swathes of farmland heavily contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, are the main legacies of the Soviet past which need correcting. Output at military plants was halved last year but conversion to civilian products lacks money and ideas. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has given up nuclear missiles on its territory, prompting praise but only Dollars 75.3m in aid from Washington - strengthening anti-reform and pro-Moscow tendencies in the government which argue that Belarus has surrendered its potential nuisance value and received little in exchange from the west. Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the conservative prime minister, leads efforts to forge a military union with Russia, over the objections of Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, parliamentary speaker and head of state. However, Mr Shushkevich, a centrist, lacks a political base. A no-confidence motion, albeit lacking a quorum, gained an overwhelming majority in July. Parliament may try to topple him from office again this autumn, further frustrating reform. Public discontent is rising. A recent survey showed 75 per cent of the people reporting a falling standard of living and only 1.5 per cent claiming an improvement. Mass protest has never been a staple of Belarusian politics. But concern that economic hardship could push both Belarus and Ukraine back into a reconstituted Russian imperial structure have jump-started western aid, and aroused concern among long-term western planners. The International Monetary Fund in July approved a Dollars 98m credit, the first tranche of a Dollars 193m systemic transformation facility, for unspecified use, and the World Bank is continuing negotiations on a Dollars 120m rehabilitation loan.</p>

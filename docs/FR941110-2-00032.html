			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for Koyo's contention that initiation of a below-cost investigation is improper, see our position on Comment 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Regarding Use of BIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Timken asserts that in all instances BIA for missing data should be based on adverse inferences. Timken points out that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhone Poulenc Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (899 F.2d 1185, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 1990)) the Federal Circuit upheld the Department's use of the highest prior margin as BIA. In this instance, however, Timken notes that for those home-market models lacking variable cost of manufacture (VCOM) information, the Department set the difference in merchandise (difmer) to 20 percent, the maximum difference allowed for matching bearings under the Department's model-match methodology. Timken claims that this approach infers that the match is otherwise valid, and, in practice, provides an incentive for respondents to manipulate the model-match process. Timken concludes that the Department should apply the highest rate in any previous administrative review to any U.S. sales that are missing cost data. In Timken's view, such a choice would reflect ``a common sense inference that the highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of current margins because, if it were not so, the [respondent], knowing of the rule, would have produced current information showing the margin to be less'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhone Poulenc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that at the time that the VCOM data were submitted in this case the Department did not use a 20-percent difmer as BIA, and, therefore, respondents had no incentive to selectively report VCOM information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We disagree with Timken's contention that setting the difmer equal to 20 percent when home-market sales lack VCOM data provides an incentive for respondents to manipulate the model-match process. We have no reason to believe that such manipulation is taking place. As a result, we do not agree with Timken that the highest rate from a previous administrative review should be applied to U.S. sales which match to home-market sales for which respondents did not provide VCOM data. Rather, for these final results we have set the difmer equal to 20 percent. We have used this approach in previous TRB reviews (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 26057 (June 6, 1991),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs I, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 4986 (February 11, 1992),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 64731 (December 9, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : NSK disagrees with the Department's application of NSK's rate for the April 1, 1978 through July 31, 1978, period as BIA for these reviews. NSK argues that the Department should not have used as BIA a weighted-average rate resulting from a four-month period. NSK contends that the Department has never relied on a rate from a prior administrative review that covered such a brief period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken notes that the Department frequently applies as BIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins from LTFV investigations, which generally cover six-month periods. Timken argues that NSK has not offered any evidence that a BIA rate from a four-month period should be deemed unreliable, particularly where the underlying determination has been through judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken. As stated in our preliminary results, the Department sought to use, as BIA, the highest rate NSK received in a previous POR, which in this instance was a rate for a four-month POR. In the final results of review covering the 1974 through 1980 period the Department found a rate of 23.43 percent for the period August 1, 1977 through July 31, 1978 (55 FR 369, June 1 1990). NSK challenged those results and the CIT remanded them to the Department with instructions to use Treasury master lists for sales made from August 1, 1977, through March 31, 1978, and to recalculate the margin for the remaining (non-master list) period in accordance with the CIT's instructions. Thus, the margin from the previous review covered four months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that NSK has not cited any instance where the Department deemed a rate from a four-month period to be unsuitable as BIA. Furthermore, NSK has not provided evidence that the rate in question is not representative of the rate that we would have obtained from a longer POR. Therefore, for U.S. sales for which we have relied on BIA, we have applied the margin from the four-month POR, since it is the highest margin for NSK in a previous segment of the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 34:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken states that as a result of Koyo's model-match exercise it became clear that Koyo failed to provide VCOM data for a number of U.S. and home-market part numbers. In these instances the Department applied a 20 percent variable-cost differential as BIA. Timken suggests that splitting the variable costs of the sets would provide VCOMs for those cups and cones which lacked variable costs in the preliminary results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo acknowledges that there may still be some part numbers for which no VCOM can be found after correction of the VCOM error. However, Koyo submits that the Department's present BIA approach is more efficient and reliable than the alternative of set-splitting advocated by Timken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In our calculations of FMV we did split the variable costs of the home-market sets. There were four TRB sets sold in the home market with no reported cost data which resulted in four cup and cone models with no reported VCOM after set splitting. For these sales we have continued to calculate a 20-percent VCOM differential as BIA. There were no models of cups and cones sold in the home market for which Koyo did not report a variable cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the variable cost of models sold in the U.S. was missing, we did not use BIA to calculate a difmer adjustment to FMV. For U.S. sales of those models with no variable cost information, we either matched them to identical home-market models or we have used CV as the basis for FMV pursuant to &sect;773(a)(1) and &sect;773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 35:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken argues that the Department should base NSK's margin on total BIA. Timken contends that NSK failed to submit complete home-market sales data on a sale-by-sale basis, despite a specific request from the Department to do so. Timken notes that NSK reported only home-market sales with quantities equal to five percent or more of the corresponding U.S. sales, and generally utilized its own model-match criteria, which deviated substantially from those currently applied by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken further argues that the Department should determine that NSK was ``non-cooperative'' and should apply first-tier BIA to NSK for all periods ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  use the highest margin calculated for any respondent in either prior or concurrent periods of review).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that there are no grounds for the Department to base NSK's margin on total BIA. NSK contends that the Department verified that the home-market sales list reported by NSK was complete. NSK contends that the Department, after verification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not challenge or further investigate the model-matching method employed by NSK.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

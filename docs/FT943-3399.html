			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fall in gambling profits leaves Crockfords at Pounds 8m Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last year, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8.12m for the 28 weeks to July 17. However, the previous half included Pounds 1.93m in movements in provisions for discontinued activities - a hangover from TV-am. Operating profits from its gambling business fell by 40 per cent from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 7.9m. The shares closed down 5p at 146p after recovering from a low of 132p. Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. The turnover, or the casino's win from gamblers playing there, fell from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 24.9m. Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman, said that just as many players were coming through the doors as last year, but the casino had won a smaller proportion of the money staked. Operating costs rose from Pounds 5.82m to Pounds 9.63m. Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 11.71p to 5.89p. An interim dividend of 2p is being paid. Mr Nesbitt said the company expected to pay a final of 6p.</p>

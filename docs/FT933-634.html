			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CLM sees strong return within four years A VEHICLE for injecting corporate capital into the Lloyd's insurance market has estimated that it could be generating underwriting returns of 10 per cent a year within four years. CLM Insurance Fund is projecting an underwriting return and dividend of 10 per cent in the fourth year of operation of its proposed Lloyd's investment trust. The details emerged in the pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday - the first such document to be issued by the 12 or so institutions sponsoring funds to exploit the possible introduction of corporate capital to Lloyd's. The figures assume investment portfolio growth of 7.5 per cent gross a year, investment return of 4 per cent gross and that 100 per cent of pledged capacity is taken up by syndicates. The fund is backed by CLM Advisers, a division of Sedgwick and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which is also sponsoring the placing and offer for subscription. Money will come through an investment trust, with the shares offered at 100p each. The final number of shares on offer will not be determined for several weeks until syndicates at Lloyd's have estimated their capacity for corporate capital. The principle of introducing corporate capital must be ratified by Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - at an EGM on October 20. Provisional details of another Lloyd's corporate capital fund were circulated yesterday. The HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust will place up to Pounds 100m on the insurance market. If approved, it plans to underwrite conservatively, with an initial overall premium limit of 150 per cent of money raised net of expenses.</p>

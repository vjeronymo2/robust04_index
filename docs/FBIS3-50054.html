			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Virgil Lazar report: "The Gypsies Threaten Reprisals"] </F>   [Text] The Cluj city branch of the Caritas  money-multiplying society [Ponzi scheme] has again moved its  headquarters to the building of the Mining Institute situated on  Tudor Vladimirescu street in the village of Baciu. According to  the rumors, the headquarters was moved hastily to that building  on the outskirts of Cluj because of the danger of a conflict  with ethnic Gypsies who have invested money in the scheme but  have not been paid their dues on time. A few days ago a group  of Gypsies, who had driven all the way from Suceava, caused a  disturbance in the center of Cluj, where the Caritas  headquarters had temporarily moved to, namely in the building of  the daily MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN, a paper that advertises Caritas  and publishes its notices and lists of winners.    Furthermore, the same sources within Caritas have disclosed  that last week the leader of the ethnic Gypsies, Emperor Iulian  of Sibiu, had personally come to Cluj to talk to Gheorghe Stoica  [founder and owner of Caritas]. Unable to meet Stoica, Iulian  became infuriated and threatened to return later to Caritas at  the head of an army of 30,000 Gypsies if Stoica does not make  the payments that he has pledged.    Meanwhile in Cluj, certain supporters of Caritas have been  circulating all kinds of rumors, even by means of the local  newspapers, claiming that all the participants in the scheme  will experience a miracle. That lie was so exaggerated that Mr.  Stoica himself felt compelled to issue a communique in MESAGERUL  TRANSILVAN, saying that solely the news published by that paper  may be considered accurate. That is, he indirectly rejected the  rumors that had been circulated by the Pro Caritas Foundation  with the purpose of tempering the anger of the deceived  participants in the scheme.    Apart from this, the lists of the winners have become rather  short. Currently they are paying out the winnings of investors  whose names begin with the letters P and R, and who paid in  their money on 5 July. Meanwhile the selling of Caritas slips  continues in Cluj, as many investors believe that there are a  sufficient number of people naive enough to pay cash for  winnings that are uncertain. Here are some examples selected  from the MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN: "Offer: 50 Cluj Caritas  receipts dated 11 and 19 July in exchange for a bachelor flat."  Or: "Will exchange 500 Caritas receipts dated September for a  one- to three-bedroom apartment or individual house," and so on.  And finally, here is a question that is typical of how Caritas  makes its payments: "We ask the leadership of Caritas to clear  up how they intend to pay the winnings of the investors who paid  in their money on 3 July and who have been skipped over during  recent payments." That is a good question: What happens to all  those who have been skipped over, even though their payments are  long overdue?!</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Fujimori hails result of power grab PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru claimed yesterday that his closure of Congress and the courts exactly one year ago had made possible the capture and conviction of Abimael Guzman, leader of Shining Path, the Maoist guerrilla movement, AP reports from Lima. Shining Path itself marked the anniversary by bombing a shopping centre in Lima's middle class district of San Luis, killing a security guard and shattering windows. The previous day guerrillas killed 11 members of the armed forces in the northern Andes. Mr Fujimori, in a 20-minute television and radio broadcast, said Peru now presented an image of security for investors after the capture of Guzman and other high-ranking guerrilla leaders. 'For 10 years Guzman and his followers mocked the state and its institutions. . . . while the country filled up with its dead,' Mr Fujimori said. 'But now the most ferocious terrorism in the west is being defeated without a bloodbath.' Mr Fujimori said he planned his coup after he realised that a hostile opposition in Congress and the judiciary were blocking his efforts to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. He also rejected criticism that he was authoritarian. 'I like results. Let the others strike poses,' said Mr Fujimori, who was elected in 1990.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Substantial premium at Virtuality THE FIRST day's trading of shares in Virtuality Group excited the City, with the price hitting 315p at one point, a substantial premium to the placing price of 170p. The shares finished the session at 289p. The price of the flotation, which placed 7.43m shares to raise Pounds 9.45m for new product development, gave a market valuation of Pounds 44.4m for the company, which designs and produces virtual reality computer software and equipment. But the group ended the day with a much higher valuation of Pounds 75.7m. Mr Jon Waldern, managing director and founder, owns 10.4 per cent of the shares. Analysts attributed the heavy trading in the shares - a total volume of 5.7m shares was traded - to several factors. One was that the placing was with some 80 institutions, and that a number of them decided to take quick profits. Another was the considerable amount of interest generated by a strong public relations campaign; about half of the shares on offer yesterday ended up in individual rather than institutional hands. The interest was even more surprising considering that Virtuality has made it clear it does not intend paying dividends in the medium term, preferring to plough profits back into more research and development. Motorola and IBM Europe have taken stakes of 3.8 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Apax Partners, the venture capital company, has a 50.9 per cent stake. Virtuality, previously known as W Industries, had turnover of Pounds 5.24m last year, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 217,000 and earnings per share of 1.1p. Virtuality's flotation is one of a number planned for October and November, including Badgerline, the bus company, Gartmore, the fund manager, and the BSM driving instruction group.</p>

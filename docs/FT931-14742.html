			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Strong interest shown in Lilley contracting arms RECEIVERS to Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group which collapsed last week, said yesterday that offers had been received for the majority of its contracting businesses. Mr Iain Bennet, of Price Waterhouse, said: 'Even where offers have not been made for the entire business, bids have been submitted for the major contracts so that following successful sales of these contracts, value will be obtained and there is a realistic pros-pect of jobs being secured while these contracts are completed.' Mr Bennet said it was too early to announce the details of completed sales because negotiations were continuing over the weekend. It was hoped that the sales would be completed early next week.</p>

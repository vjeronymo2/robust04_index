			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LIEBERTHAL HITS 2 HOMERS TO KEY PAIR OF WESTLAKE VICTORIES  </P> <P> Westlake High's Mike Lieberthal hit two home runs and drove in seven runs  Friday to lead the Warriors to two wins in the Chaparral tournament in Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> Lieberthal, a senior catcher who has signed to play with Arizona State, was two  for three and hit a three-run home run as Westlake beat Basic of Nevada, 14-3,  in its first game of the day. Lieberthal added a grand slam in an 11-6 win over  Serra of California. The games were limited to six and five innings because of  a time limit.  </P> <P> Lieberthal's 10th and 11th home runs of the year give him the lead among area  players.  </P> <P> Westlake, which lost for the first time this season in its tournament-opening  game Thursday, amassed 19 hits and improved to 17-1. Westlake entered the  tournament as the top-ranked Southern Section 5-A Division team.  </P> <P> "We started slow in both games, but rose to the occasion when we had to,"  Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. "You could hear the guys in the dugout  saying, 'Hey, we can't get beat again' "  </P> <P> Against Basic, Westlake erupted for six runs in the third inning and added  eight in the sixth. Keith Hess was two for three and hit his fourth home run,  and James Jones drove in four runs. Mike Eby, a senior left-hander who has  signed a letter of intent with UCLA, allowed seven hits and improved to 6-0.  Eby is within one win of tying the school record for wins in a season, which  was set in 1987 by John Chiaramonte.  </P> <P> In the second game, Rob Neal was three for four with a triple, and Rick Wolters  added two hits for the Warriors, who committed seven errors and allowed five  unearned runs. Lieberthal's grand slam, his seventh homer in nine days,  highlighted a four-run fifth that allowed Westlake to extend a 7-6 lead.  </P> <P> In other baseball games:  </P> <P> Las Vegas Bonanza 6, Simi Valley 4 -- Simi Valley rallied for two runs in the  seventh inning on Aaron Fischer's two-run single, but the Pioneers' four errors  proved costly in a second-round game in the Chaparral tournament.  </P> <P> Fischer was three for four with a double, and Jeff Sommer and Tyler Nelson each  had two hits for Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Kenny Hood had his hitting streak snapped at 19 games, one short of tying the  school record.  </P> <P> Las Vegas Clark 11, Simi Valley 7 -- Aaron Fischer, John Sawyer and Darryl  Hernandez each had two hits for Simi Valley (8-8), which used 19 players.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley 11, Las Vegas Bishop Gorman 0 -- B. J. Petersen and Rick  Nickols combined on a six-hitter, and Matt Chaffin pounded two doubles to lift  the Antelopes (6-9) in the third round of the Chaparral tournament.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley 3, La Salle 2 -- With the Antelopes leading, 2-0, in the second  inning, Chad Eberhart doubled home Tony Abrams with what proved to be the  decisive run.  </P> <P> Oakwood 14, Avalon 4 -- Nat Perlof hit two home runs in one inning to lead  Oakwood (5-2, 2-1) in a Liberty League game at Avalon. Perlof hit a two-run  homer and a three-run blast to key a nine-run fourth inning.  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Mid Valley ARC 61, Team Los Angeles 39 -- Mid Valley advanced to the final of  the 17-and-under division of the Easter Classic at Nevada Las Vegas. Camarillo  High junior David Harbour scored nine points for Mid Valley, which meets the  Orange County Express tonight at 7.  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL  </P> <P> San Jose City 6, Canyons 2 -- Charlie Fowlks had two RBI singles but the  Cougars were unable to generate any more offense in the third round of the  Hancock tournament.  </P> <P> Canyons center fielder Ron Robart was hitless in four at-bats to end his  17-game hitting streak. Robart was also hit by a pitch for the 17th time this  season.  </P> <P> MEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge d. Brigham Young, 15-10, 15-8, 15-9 -- Neil Coffman had 14  kills and Raphael Tulino added 10 digs to lead the Matadors (13-10, 8-8) in a  Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match at Provo, Utah.  </P></p>

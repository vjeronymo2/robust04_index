			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Limitations of economic analysis on road pricing Sir, Giles Keating's article 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll' (February 11) rightly concludes that the practice of charging directly for roadway usage would, if implemented, '. . .offer a way of slashing the PSBR, while reducing congestion and pollution and creating the base for a world class high technology industry'. In attempting to urge this policy on to the British political agenda, the author cites the German government as one body which has already awakened to the 'almost overwhelming' economic arguments in its favour. However, in a separate article appearing in the same issue ('German motorway charge drives into trouble'), the reader is told of deep-felt and widespread opposition to the German road pricing plan. Apparently, even the Greens are opposed to the idea] (According to their rather inane claim, motorists would actually increase highway usage in response to the charges 'to get value for money'.) As an economist, I am well acquainted with the theoretical arguments put forward by Mr Keating, and quite sympathetic to his views. One should also, though, be aware of the limitations of economic analysis. As a social science, economics is much better at providing ways to approach problems than it is at finding solutions. When individuals have preferences only over the goods they consume privately, then one can talk (in theory, at least) about 'efficient' solutions to economic problems. But when individuals also have preferences about the method by which those products are allocated (ie of means as well as ends), then economic considerations must be balanced against political ones. Economic arguments notwithstanding, 'free' road provision is (by definition) a more efficient system for generating revenue and allocating road space if it is universally preferred to other such systems.

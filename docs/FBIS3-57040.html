The enemy, who undertook an onslaught in the directions  of Ter-Ter and Fizuli- Beylagan has been eager to set up control  over railways of Goradiz in order to prevent Azerbaijan to  provide food stuffs and fuel to the blockaded Nakhichevan.    According to the information available, in several sectors  of  the front the Azeri armed forces could repulse the enemy from  the earlier occupied territory and take more advantageous  positions. The Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan considers that the  recent failures of Armenians forced them to spread rumours about  firing, which has ostensibly taken place between the units of  the Azeri army.</p>

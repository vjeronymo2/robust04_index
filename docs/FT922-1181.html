			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Alternatives to violence - CSCE commitments to protect national minorities must be linked to economic benefits The news from central and eastern Europe gets more depressing every week: The long agony of Bosnia-Hercegovina continues, while it is anyone's guess whether the next Yugoslav war will erupt in Kosovo or in Macedonia, or both at once. In either case the chances of containing it within the frontiers of the old Yugoslavia seem slim. Czechs and Slovaks agree to break up a state which had seemed one of the most hopeful and civilised in the region. At least there is no bloodshed between them, so far; but the dissolution of the state, combined with the problem of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, the bitter Slovak-Hungarian dispute over the Danube dam, and lurking Hungarian aspirations to recover territory lost after the first world war, provides all the ingredients for a pre-1939-style border conflict. And Hungary could at any moment find itself in a similar conflict with Serbia or Romania. In Georgia and Moldova separatist groups look to remnants of the Soviet army for support, and President Boris Yeltsin threatens Russian intervention if fighting continues. The Baltic states and Ukraine, still hosts to unwanted Russian troops as well as large Russian-speaking minorities, look nervously on. Fighting continues between Armenians and Azeris in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. Within the Russian federation Chechen-Ingushetia and other ethnic enclaves are defying the central government. Throughout the region, high unemployment is eroding support for economic reform, while politicians are locked in Byzantine power struggles incomprehensible to ordinary people, but often envenomed by selective leaking of 'evidence' from secret police files. It all seems a far cry from the euphoric autumn of 1989, even if few really imagined at that time that history had ended and we should all live happily ever after. In fact just about every one of these problems was foreseen then, which makes it all the more frustrating that so little seems to have been done to solve them. Of course many east and central European politicians are behaving very foolishly, and they should not be allowed to escape responsibility for the tragic consequences of their actions. Nor is it true that the west has done nothing. Significant sums of money have been and are being provided. Not adequate sums, perhaps, but what would have been adequate? Even the extraordinary transfers from west to east Germany seem barely to suffice, and assistance on that scale to the whole of eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union, would imply trillions of dollars annually. One area where the west, and especially the European Community, has clearly fallen short is market access. Even the three central European states which have signed association agreements find the west European market all but impenetrable to goods they can produce at competitive prices, such as steel and food; and that in turn discourages private investment. A more generous policy in that respect might not yet have had a direct impact on living standards; but it would have contributed to a more hopeful atmosphere in the region, in which the inevitable ethnic conflicts might have been easier to defuse. Above all, I believe that a greater effort should have been made to link western assistance to intraregional co-operation, building on the example of the Marshall Plan. That applies to co-operation between states, but could also apply to inter-communal relations within states. In the case of Croatia the EC tragically missed its opportunity: for a long time it refused to contemplate recognition and then, when war had been raging for months, it rushed to recognise, brushing aside its own arbitration committee's report that conditions on minority rights and civil liberties, formally set by the EC itself, were not yet adequately fulfilled. Had those conditions been posed at the outset they might have given the EC some real leverage over the Croat leadership, and hence also some credibility in the eyes of the Serbs. But then a similar error was perpetrated in the Bosnian case, recognition being made conditional not on agreement between the communities but on a referendum which only dramatised and polarised the difference between them. Since similar conflicts are now erupting or about to erupt in many other parts of central and eastern Europe, it is not too late to learn some lessons from the Croat and Bosnian tragedies. Slovakia resembles Croatia in many respects. It will need recognition and help from the EC, and that fact must be used to ensure that the Hungarian minority is adequately represented and protected, and that disputes between Slovakia and Hungary are settled peacefully. In the former Soviet Union, it is becoming very urgent to dissuade Mr Yeltsin, who is clearly under intense pressure from Russian nationalists, from behaving like the Serbian leader, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. If he imagines that his new love affair with Washington would survive a Russian military intervention in Moldova or Georgia he should be disabused without delay. The problem of the Russian minorities in other ex-Soviet republics is a real one, but the worst possible solution would be a series of Russian military expeditions to support them. The Russian foreign ministry is aware of this, and has been seeking alternative solutions, notably by supporting measures to give stronger international protection to minority rights at the Helsinki follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which is now nearing its climax. The Dutch proposal to appoint a CSCE high commissioner on national minorities, whose job would be to give early warning and where appropriate take 'early action' to defuse minority issues that threaten to develop into conflict, is now the subject of detailed negotiations and has a good chance of being adopted. So has a British proposal to expand the range of available procedures for resolving disputes, including disputes within states, 'which have the potential to develop into armed conflict'. (Since most such disputes in Europe involve national minorities, the two proposals are closely related.) A further step, which might be considered at a future meeting, would be to establish a prototype agreement between a national minority, the state where it resides, and the state (if any) with which it has an ethnic or linguistic affinity. Such an agreement could spell out the obligations as well as the rights of the minority, and enable the 'protecting' state to contribute to a solution of the problem without questioning the sovereignty or borders of the state in which the minority lives. No state could be obliged to sign it, and in each case the parties could agree to vary its precise terms to suit their particular circumstances; but having a standard prototype available might give both sides greater confidence that they had something to gain from a negotiated solution. But all such devices depend ultimately on the willingness of parties in dispute to make use of them, and to avoid resorting to violence. Too often the slide to war outpaces the diplomats, whose good intentions are nullified by political pressures at home. In such situations CSCE commitments will only be taken seriously if states that have something to offer - the US, Japan, above all the EC - make a clear connection between observance of those commitments and tangible economic benefit.</p>

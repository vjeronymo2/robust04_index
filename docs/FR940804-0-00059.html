			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Scenarios Illustrating First Change. The following five scenarios illustrate how sanctions can be deferred and/or stayed following SIP disapprovals and nonimplementation findings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  They are provided to clarify change one discussed above. (Section III.A. discusses how the States and the public will be kept informed of the status of sanction application.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Note that in the five cases discussed below in the ``scenarios illustrating first change,'' sanctions would apply or reapply when a conditional approval converts to a disapproval just as they do when a proposed full approval is reversed to a disapproval. Note also that, unlike full approvals, the mandatory sanctions process would not cease upon final conditional approval. Following a disapproval, as indicated above, if EPA proposes full approval of the State's revised plan, resulting in the deferral and/or staying of sanction application, and then takes final, full approval action, the mandatory sanctions process ceases. However, if the scenario were one where EPA was conditionally approving the plan, the final conditional approval does not stop the mandatory sanction process because it does not represent EPA's final determination that the SIP is adequate. The EPA will make that determination when it reviews the revised plan the State commits to submitting as part of the conditional approval. Ultimately, of course, if the State fulfills its commitment and EPA approves the State's plan revision, then any sanction clocks are permanently stopped and no sanctions are applied or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reapplied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, if, before month 18, EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP and that action is reversed 24 or more months after the finding, at which time the 18-month clock has expired, application of the offset sanction is deferred until EPA's proposed approval or proposed finding that the State is implementing its SIP is reversed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For both types of findings, the offset sanction applies on the date EPA reverses its preliminary finding. Following disapprovals, where EPA proposed to fully approve the SIP, the reversal would be either a proposed or final disapproval in whole or in part, whichever occurs. Following disapprovals, where EPA proposes to or finally conditionally approves the SIP, the reversal would occur as described in subsection (1) above of this section II.B.3.c. Following findings of nonimplementation, the reversal would be either a proposed or final finding, whichever occurs, that the State was not implementing its SIP. For both disapprovals and nonimplementation findings, the highway sanction applies 6 months from the date the offset sanction applies, unless EPA determines within that period that the State corrected the deficiency prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule in &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(i), (d)(3)(i), and (d)(4)(i).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This scenario assumes that EPA proposes approval prior to 18 months and that EPA's positive finding is reversed after 24 months. In that instance, after 24 months, only the 18-month clock has expired (and not the 6-month clock) because the 6-month clock is not triggered until the offset sanction applies. (Section III.A. below discusses how the section 179 sanction clocks function.) Therefore, in this scenario, the 6-month clock does not start until EPA reverses its positive finding after 24 months. The next paragraph and Figure 1 give an example of how this functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion and Figure 1 provide an example of how this process functions with respect to a sanctions clock started by an initial disapproval. The process would function in the same manner where the initial finding was a finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA issues a SIP disapproval, initiating the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP to EPA which EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve, prior to 18 months from the date the sanctions clock started. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, making a finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, the application of the offset sanction would be deferred. Now suppose that, at month 25, EPA reverses its preliminary determination. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 25 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction applies. The highway sanction then applies 6 months later at month 31 (or, for final actions, shortly thereafter, as appropriate), if within that period EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d626 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER04AU94.000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

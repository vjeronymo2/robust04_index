			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "RKTRK--...There Is No Alternative"] </F>   [Text] A Japanese sociologist once said: "With the  development of television, Japan will be transformed into a  country of 100 million fools." In our Homeland the situation is  much better--at least the population and its growth rates give  us hope: The fate of the Japanese does not threaten us.    The president's edict of 5 April "On the Creation of the  Republic Corporation 'Television and Radio of Kazakhstan'  [RKTRK]" was a surprise to those in the know. The fact is that  the former State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, in the  hands of its chairman Sherkhan Murtaza, has long held its  rightful place in the country's information space, properly  performing its role as a mouthpiece for state policy. And the  proposed rules of the game were unquestioningly accepted on the  other side of the screen: The majority of Kazakhstan television  viewers took advantage of the services of commercial television  channels, tuning in to State TV only in extraordinary situations  (the introduction of the national currency, price increases,  earthquakes, etc.).    Recently a certain amount of excitement among the viewers  was  caused by the election of Mr. Murtaza to the professional  parliament, in connection with which the candidacy of his  successor was actively discussed. But in fact everything turned  out not to be so simple. Even from the first point of the  president's edict it follows that the upstart "telemonster" will  dominate the republic air waves, since it is being created "as a  part of the State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, and  also other enterprises and organizations included in it on a  voluntary basis." According to certain preliminary information,  TAN and KTK [expansions not indicated] intend to merge with  RKTRK (nothing is known so far about the other commercial  channels). Be that as it may, it is TAN and KTK that are the  most popular among television viewers of the capital today. And  if the "statization" of the former is not especially surprising,  taking into account the appointment to Murtaza's position of the  former TAN chief, Leyla Beketova-Khrapunova, the mooring at that  same dock of the ship of Mr. Fidel looks somewhat strange. In a  word, in a country where the three branches of power do not  always manage to separate themselves from one another, this kind  of symbiosis within the fourth should come as no surprise.    And, judging from certain nuances, they did not come up with  this alliance just yesterday. According to unverified  information from sources close to the leadership of the former  Gosteleradio, the draft of the aforementioned edict was prepared  at the end of last year. And after the official electronic  press, precisely in keeping with the scenario, won the role  allotted to it in the election campaign, the document was  blessed with the president's signature.    Observers regard this innovation as another step to the  achievement of the cherished dream of domestic authorities:  agreement of opinion that is "democratic" in form and  authoritarian (at best) in content. If in addition to all this  they manage to realize the age-old plan of the "higher-ups," to  organize Russian-language broadcasting on the Russian channel,  the television viewers will very soon be able to see the irony  of the well-known commercial: With all the wealth of choice  there is no alternative...</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKSHELVES CAN BOTH STORE AND SHOW OFF HANDSOME VOLUMES;  </P> <P> LIBRARY: DESIGNER FINDS A VARIETY OF WAYS TO MAKE BOOKS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR  REFERENCE AND READING.  </P> <P> True bibliophiles can easily become overwhelmed by their collections, finding  themselves frustrated by boxes of books packed away in attics or garages.  Disintegration is worrisome but being cut off from a wealth of information and  inspiration is torturous.  </P> <P> Roxann Johnson of Spatial Expressions, a total design service whose "side  specialty" is built-in entertainment centers, recently encountered a client  with "tons and tons" of books in storage.  </P> <P> "The challenge was to find a place to put them," Johnson says. "Fortunately,  the living room of the family's Anaheim Hills home has a 20-foot-high vaulted  ceiling.  </P> <P> "We created a library by building a railed balcony at one end of the room that  extends out by 5 feet. A miniature spiral staircase leads up to walls of  built-in shelves, a small seating area and a nice view as well," Johnson says.  </P> <P> "When books are used and not just displayed, a nearby reading area is  important," Johnson explains. That means, at the minimum, that a chair, a table  and good lighting are required. In the Anaheim Hills project, Johnson provided  a cozy reading nook by extending one end of the balcony with a slight curve.  </P> <P> In another situation, Johnson created a handsome and substantial room divider  to update a home built in the '60s that featured a lava-stone column by  "cantilevering" bookshelves 2 inches from floor to ceiling between the columns.  </P> <P> In a different home, Johnson found a way to make a hallway closet do double  duty. The 24-inch-deep closet backed up to a bedroom. After taking off the door  and moving the back wall of the closet a foot forward, shelves were installed  on both sides of the new wall, providing a double-sided bookcase accessible  from either the hall or the bedroom.  </P> <P> Creative solutions are available for more modest book collections as well.  Mini-libraries of paperbacks can be housed in the alcoves created by finishing  a knocked-out portion of a wall and placing narrow shelves between the studs.  Or, Johnson suggests extending the end of a kitchen countertop 12 inches and  adding a row of cantilevered shelves below it to hold a collection of  cookbooks.  </P> <P> If your book collection is sparse, art objects, plants and stereo equipment can  fill in the shelf space for a practical and eye-catching display. "Just  remember," she says, "bookcases are visually heavy." For that reason, walls of  books should be offset by large pieces of furniture such as sofas.  </P> <P> "Books are nice, homey and sound-insulating," says Johnson, who recommends  placing bookshelves on a common walls separating a bedroom from a dining room  or kitchen. For the same reason, a wall of books in a noisy family room softens  sounds.  </P> <P> When planning a bookshelf, Johnson offers these suggestions:  </P> <P> Add backs to bookcases that are against outside walls or near windows to  protect the books from moisture and extremes in temperatures.  </P> <P> Keep books away from windows and skylight because sunlight fades covers and  dries pages.  </P> <P> When selecting finishes, Johnson notes that because painted surfaces chip and  scratch easily they do not hold up well under the weight of heavy books. "The  most traditional material for bookcases is wood," she says, "but keep in mind  that dark stains will show more scratches than pale finishes."  </P> <P> "Melamine and laminated surfaces are more modern-looking as well as durable.  For a more traditional look, add wood molding to the edges," Johnson advises.  "Or, treat wood with polyurethane to protect it."  </P> <P> Johnson also recommends building bookcases slightly deeper than needed and  providing low-intensity track or recessed lighting to shine on titles. "Strip  lights and shelf lights are practical and attractive ways to display a fine  collection," she adds. "For small areas, heavy glass shelves that allow the  light to shine through are another possibility."  </P> <P> Most bookshelves measure about 1 inch thick, 12 inches deep and 30 inches wide,  but allowances should be made when extra-heavy or large books need to be  stored.  </P> <P> Provide thicker shelves or extra supports between shelves for heavy books like  encyclopedias, she says. Oversized books need more "headroom" as well as a  wider shelf. Mix books with lightweight accessories to avoid sagging shelves.  </P> <P> For those who decorate with neutral tones because they are afraid of using  color, Johnson offers this advice: "Books add a nice touch of color to many  otherwise bland rooms. When using books solely for effect, cover them with  paper and fabrics in color and textures to suit the decor."  </P> <P> If you aren't an avid reader, but want to grace your home with the warmth and  charm associated with books, an inexpensive way to gather a decorative  collection is by shopping garage sales, thrift shops and used book stores.  </P></p>

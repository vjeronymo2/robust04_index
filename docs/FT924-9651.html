			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Redundancies at Pru offshoot Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, a subsidiary of Prudential Corporation and the UK's biggest reinsurance company, will be making some of its underwriters redundant later this week following the downturn in business. Further redundancies among support staff are also likely before Christmas as part of a package of measures to reduce costs. Mr John Engestrom, the chief executive who took office in July, said that staff would be informed later this week. He added that there were 132 underwriting staff out of 1,500 total employees worldwide. The job losses follow a statement from the company at the beginning of last month that rating levels in primary insurance were insufficient and reinsurance costs had been raised particularly as a result of the London market excess (LMX) reinsurance spiral and the claims related to hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.</p>

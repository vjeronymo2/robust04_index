			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;  </P> <P> FUNDING THE ARTS  </P> <P> By a vote of 175 to 249, the House rejected a conservative-sponsored crackdown  on National Endowment for the Arts funding of sexually explicit artworks. The  House later passed legislation (HR 4825) authorizing $175 million in fiscal  1991 for the endowment.  </P> <P> The billincreased federal scrutiny of artists receiving public money but left  questions of obscenity to the courts.  </P> <P> The rejected amendment sought, in part, to deny funding of projects that depict  sexual conduct such as masturbation and sadomasochistic abuse or that tear down  a religion.  </P> <P> Sponsor Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) said: "When it comes to federal tax  dollars, we have a right to set a standard. . . . "  </P> <P> Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said: "This amendment is brought to you by  the book burners in the country and in the Congress."  </P> <P> A yes vote was to keep taxpayers' money from funding sexually explicit art.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Bates (D): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Hunter (R): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Lowery (R): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Packard (R): Yea  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> To Uphold Textile Veto  </P> <P> By a vote of 275 to 152, the House fell short of the two-thirds majority needed  to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill limiting the growth of textile and  apparel imports to 1% annually. The measure (HR 4328) also sought to freeze  non-rubber footwear imports at 1989 levels. Canada and Israel would be exempted  from the bill.  </P> <P> Supporters said the bill would protect jobs and factories against unfair  foreign competition, while opponents said it would mask industry inefficiencies  and raise retail prices.  </P> <P> A yes vote was to protect the domestic textile, apparel and non-rubber footwear  industries.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Bates (D): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Hunter (R): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Lowery (R): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Packard (R): Nay  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> YELLOW RIBBON CIVIL WAR REMINDER  </P> <P> Entertainer Tony Orlando feels something special for those yellow ribbons, the  ubiquitous symbol of hope for loved ones held captive.  </P> <P> The singer known for "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree" said in a  telephone interview last week that he discovered the song's deep emotional  effect shortly after it was released.  </P> <P> It was in 1973, and the group Dawn, featuring Orlando as lead singer, was the  opening act at a Bob Hope show at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. About 400 or 500  former prisoners of war were seated in front of the stage.  </P> <P> The song is based on a Civil War story about the homecoming of a Union soldier  from a Confederate prison. In the song, the man is welcomed by yellow ribbons  as he comes home from a stint in prison. The message moved the former POWs.  </P> <P> "I'm on stage and I'm singing this song and all of a sudden it was the most  spine-chilling moment," he said. "Up they got, off their chairs, and they're  coming toward the stage and they come on stage and they begin to sing the  song."  </P></p>

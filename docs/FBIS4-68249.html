This is the second transition period in the 20th century.  The  first, which began with the revolution of 1917, ended in  December 1922 with the transformation of Russia into the Soviet  Union. With the Union's creation, a delayed-action mine was laid  beneath its foundations in the form of the disparity between  form and content and specifically between the declared equality  of all peoples (with nations' right to self-determination right  up to separation) and the state's totalitarian essence.    Such a disparity doomed the USSR either to lifelong,  hopeless  totalitarianism or to future reform. Reforms did not promise to  be smooth, but the shocks which befell us proved excessively  painful. These shocks were caused not by democratization,  glasnost and pluralism in themselves, but by the fact that they  developed with a hint of our boundlessness, irresponsibility,  recklessness, the populism of politicians, and the  indiscriminate fault-finding with everything. The absence of a  proper legislative and legal base gave these phenomena an  uncontrollability and at times even an absurdity.    Union leadership proved unready for such a development of  events and attempted to solve the new problems by old methods,  aiming both to acquire capital and maintain innocence, as they  say. That is how the events in Tbilisi, Baku and Vilnius became  real facts. At the same time, the Union leadership was  encouraging claims of components at a lower level (autonomies)  to their own sovereignty and independence (South Osetia,  Abkhazia, the Dniester region, Gagauzia and so on), which  whipped up the process of reckless sovereignization even more.    With great difficulty the center finally found an algorithm  for solving the problem, a new Union treaty, which seemed to  suit the majority of republics more or less. In my view,  unjustified sluggishness was allowed in realizing this plan.  Nevertheless, society as a whole was ready for legitimization of  a fundamentally new Union by 20 August 1991. But this event was  not destined to come about, since on 19 August we all became  witnesses, and many also participants, of quite different events.    I believe that this date (19 August) became a unique point  of  reference for the next transition period in our history. It was  after the August "flatulence" that many components of the USSR  lost faith in the center's declarations and interest in its  initiatives.    Some did so because of the center's inability to solve the  problems which had come to a head in a civilized manner. Others  felt they would be able to get by without such a center. All  attempts to reanimate the Novo-Ogarevskiy process after August  1991 failed. Many problems hung in the air and a general crisis  was imminent.    Society naturally could not be in a state of uncertainty for  long. It always needs supports--legal, organizational, moral.  The Belovezh agreement on establishing the CIS, developed in  Alma-Ata, became one such rather unstable and far from perfect  support. It can be viewed as a landmark in the new transition  period.    The imperfection of the CIS model lies in the fact that on  the one hand it took into account existing realities, and on the  other hand it left many questions unresolved. In other words, a  new form of mutual relationship of states seemingly had been  found, but there was no substance. A painful search for it  continues to this day. Life was supposed to have become  considerably better for people in the CIS than in the USSR. The  importance and nobility of this task are obvious; the difficulty  of its accomplishment also is obvious. How is it to be fulfilled?    Above all, don't hurry. Don't pull down everything to the  foundations. Don't turn an evolutionary process into a  revolutionary one. And most important, don't forget just what  the CIS is--a zigzag of history or a historical necessity.    I consider it more important, advisable and necessary to  engage in perfecting the form and content both of the  Commonwealth itself as well as of the cooperation of peoples in  it--without arrogance, without extremes, without shocks. And  these steps must be taken above all by those who initiated and  legitimized that which we have today. Now we are experiencing a  dramatic moment in the struggle between national consciousness  of former components of the USSR on the one hand, oppressed in  the past and now hypertrophied, and collapsing imperial  ambitions on the other.    Certain states go to the point of absurdity in their  aspirations for absolute sovereignty. If it is a fuel crisis, it  is their own; if it is hunger, it is sovereign; if it is  currency, then it is whatever you like, just not Russian, and so  on. The impression is created that our fully revved up  independent states, not having a clue as to what conditions  there will be at the destination, have made a dash toward the  point of no return. The important thing was to cross it.    As I see it, the reasons for this lie in the fact that a  certain portion of leaders of sovereign states are prisoners of  the ambitions of small groups of people of a certain leaning who  adjure that absolute sovereignty is a panacea for all  troubles--economic, political and social.    Things have reached the point where politicians declaiming  for closer integration into the CIS fear to speak loudly about  their aspirations, since they will be tagged without delay as  traitors to national interests by nationalists of all colors and  hues, who obviously never are to understand that the main reason  for an economic slump lies specifically in a severance of ties  between states and peoples.    I never will forget a television report from Kharkov, when  one elderly man was asked: "How's life?" He responded: "There is  nothing to eat here, and they are making missiles." All the  unpretentious wisdom of our people is contained in this.    A foreign journalist compared the USSR with a large swimming  pool. Formation of the CIS divided this pool with bars: The  water in it is common, but swimming is restricted. Further  disintegration may lead to where the CIS will have to be  compared with a large preserve in which each inhabitant will  have his own absolutely independent cage. It is difficult to  give recommendations and advice in our time, but why pull down  that which is not falling in, break what is not breaking, or  tear up what is not tearing, and specifically our age-old  spiritual ties, our habits, our way of thinking and life?    Some state figures evidently are indifferent to the fate of  those who are not finding their place on the expanses of the CIS  today and of those who will live after them. But in spite of  everything, one-sixth of the earth will survive; it is obligated  to survive. It will take its worthy place in the universe.    If we gaze beyond the year 2000, it is not hard to see the  following power centers in the future world:     -  North American continent;    -  Western Europe;    -  Japan and  China;    -  the Muslim world.        With a weak Russia or CIS, the aforementioned power centers  naturally may direct their interests here. But in view of the  enormity of expanses (Catherine II contended that Russia is the  universe) and the unreceptiveness of our peoples to various  kinds of diktat of foreigners, a weak Russia, like a gigantic  crater, will be capable of swallowing up all these power centers  along with their interests. Herein lies the strength of a weak  Russia. Thus, the danger of Russia to the world lies in its  weakness.    Conversely, a strong Russia together with other CIS states  is  capable of serving as a unique balance, equalizing the universe  and safeguarding it from ruin. Herein lies the strength and  security of a strong Russia.    Russia is a bridge between East and West. It will remain a  house for many peoples who rested against it and bowed down  before it. Herein lies their fate and Russia's. It will continue  to be the keeper of world peace and the security of peoples who  populate the Commonwealth.    Being the largest element in a disintegrating but still  functioning system, it keeps others afloat like a pontoon  bridge--some by grain, some by timber, others by oil and natural  gas, and still others by the ruble, but each and every one by  hope.    By the very fact of its unsinkability, Russia is capable  also  of pulling out others, who, not being able to swim on their own  and clinging to each other, most will likely drown if they  become uncoupled from Russia.    It is of course possible to catch hold of someone else, but  what will be the payment for help?    New market-dollar relations are formed relatively easily,  but  there is that which does not lend itself to recarving. It is  spiritual space, which never was replaced by force and gold. The  new helpers of course may offer a hand, but they will not pull  you out. It is advantageous for them to keep everyone  semisubmerged.    In my view, the disintegration of Russia is the most  dangerous among other negative phenomena. Here too one sees the  boundless desire of certain components to cross the point of no  return as speedily as possible in general confusion.    Not only the autonomies, but also the krays, the oblasts,  and  even the cities have begun speaking of their sovereignty. It is  easy to imagine that as soon as federation components begin to  be called states, they immediately will be tempted to acquire  all state attributes--army, currency, foreign policy, customs  and so on.    It is difficult to answer this question, but it can be  asserted that Russia will not survive its own CIS, or whatever  it will be called there--it will turn into a kind of "black  hole" which will swallow up the Russian state, natural  resources, and possibly also peoples. New conquerors with old  schemes will rush here, and we or our descendants will be forced  to begin everything from the beginning, if we do not lose  vitality.    The simplest, most tested method of stopping this element of  disintegration is to stand everyone up at attention; whoever  does not obey, "sort it out" and punish them. But this already  has occurred. The present time, I am sure, will give birth to  politicians capable of solving the most difficult and tangled  problems by peaceful means alone. They will serve as a worthy  counterweight to those who, having become accustomed to the  smell of powder and blood today and having lost all faith in any  authority, raise up their peoples with frenzy and doom for a  struggle in "hotspots."    The most worthy way out of the situation at hand in Russia  appears to be one in which a federal center and components of  the federation accommodate each other. On this path some are  obligated to cast off the armor of hegemonism and chauvinism,  and others the armor of separatism and nationalism. But these  cast-off "isms" should not be viewed as losses on the  battlefield. Most likely this is harmful ballast needed by no  one and restricting maneuver; having gotten rid of it, both will  acquire confidence and mutual trust.    Simultaneously with this, it is necessary to work out a  legislative and legal base together on key problems of our  existence, coordinated to the maximum and acceptable to the  components.    The common legislative and legal base in turn must not level  out the morals, customs, traditions and other national features  of federation components. These laws, common for all, must  preclude such phenomena as, for example, establishment of an age  qualification for the marriage of young people; an instruction,  let's say, about what memorable dates to celebrate in federation  components, except statewide ones; establishment of movie ticket  prices, and so on. In other words, in the many-sided process of  creating a new federalism, it is necessary to single out the  general and the special. The general unites the center, the  special is regulated locally. The general makes our society  monolithic, and the special makes it flexible.    By virtue of originality, multinationality, and other purely  Russian features, our future social and state system should not  be driven artificially into the framework of American, British,  Swedish, Japanese and other systems of regulating life, no  matter how attractive and civilized they may seem to us.    Naturally, we must study and take in the experience of  others, but today we are obliged to display our civilized nature  above all in the ability to cover this most difficult transition  period in our history without a scuffle, without blood, without  tears and sufferings of the people, for the good of our children  and grandchildren, who must live neither in a large cage nor in  small ones.    We can and are obligated to create such a moral, legal,  sociopolitical, economic and intellectual climate in Russia that  many peoples, and not just of the CIS, would consider themselves  lucky to live in it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Archbishop Monsignor Monsengwo, speaker of </F> the Zairian Transitional Parliament, by Didier Grogna in  Brussels; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Monsignor Monsengwo, architect  of the dialogue, is currently in Brussels. The president of the  Higher Council of the Republic [HCR]-transitional Parliament  agreed to answer our questions at a time when he has decided to  distance himself from the political mission he has fulfilled  since his election as head of the Sovereign National Conference  [CNS] more than two years ago. The archbishop of Kisangani also  replies to those who have criticized his action in recent weeks.    [Grogna] Are the new institutions capable of bringing about  reconciliation?    [Monsengwo] I obviously have confidence in the  HCR-Transitional Parliament because the desire of people from  all sides to form part of it shows a real desire for  reconciliation, agreement, and harmony. Partisan interests have  been set aside. In addition, this Parliament was installed  following the institutional order of the CNS. There is no  reason why it should not go well.    [Grogna] How is the situation developing?    [Monsengwo] The commissions have been formed, the committee  for the drafting of the transitional institutional text has been  set up. Its work should not take too long. The work will  probably be completed in 10 days' time. We will then be able to  proceed to elect the prime minister and form the government.    [Grogna] What was the decisive factor in bringing together  the opposition and presidential circles?    [Monsengwo] Everybody realized that they were dragging their  feet. The country could not remain in such a situation for any  longer. The legitimate government had no real power. This  state of affairs did not allow the country to function normally.  In addition, the monetary reform precipitated economic decline.  The politicians realized the urgent need for a compromise.  <H5>  Involvement </H5>   [Grogna] The CNS had already met with President Mobutu in  July 1992 and a text had been published. It was recognized by  all. That did not prevent deadlock. What enables you to say  now that the problems have been smoothed over?    [Monsengwo] I think that the deadlock arose because a  section  of the Zairian authorities, rightly or wrongly, did not feel  sufficiently involved in the institutional order of the CNS,  although it had been adopted by all groups. The MPR [People's  Movement of the Revolution] and the army did not sign. This  situation made it impossible to run the country in harmony.  There was fairly deep discord. We therefore advocated  political negotiations with all groups to arrive at a "common  agreement" -- a purely political reconciliation.    [Grogna] Do you really believe in Mobutu's involvement?    [Monsengwo] He has publicly pledged to be involved and knows  that the whole nation is watching him. His honor depends on him  keeping his word.    [Grogna] Is it not possible to fear new obstacles with the  election of the prime minister, especially in view of the fact  that Tshisekedi's UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress]  does not seem to be prepared to join the HCR?    [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the UDPS does sit on the HCR.  I do not see why Etienne Tshisekedi should not admit it. On  the other hand, I am surprised that when discussions are taking  place in Kinshasa, some people claiming to support the UDPS are  staging demonstrations in Europe. There is reason to wonder  what the point of that is.    [Grogna] Can Tshisekedi still be prime minister?    [Monsengwo] In a democracy, exclusion must be avoided. As a  priest, I do not want to enter into arguments over individuals.  I leave it up to the politicians to deal with this problem.    The opposition will choose its candidate. He will form a  government which will seek the HCR's confidence.  <H5>  Referendum and Elections </H5>   [Grogna] What timetable will the HCR establish?    [Monsengwo] The transitional Parliament will have to carry  out a vote of confidence in the government. When that has been  done, the government and the HCR will draw up a minimum economic  program which will enable the partners to help us. When that  program has been drawn up, we will have to think of the  constitutional referendum. Then move on to elections:  Parliamentary and presidential elections first, then regional  and local elections.    [Grogna] How long will that take?    [Monsengwo] That will have to be discussed. In the draft  agreement, we made provision for 15 months to arrive at the  Third Republic. But we have already wasted four of them....    [Grogna] Is it reasonable to think of holding credible  elections in Zaire?    [Monsengwo] It will obviously be very difficult. It will  take at least a minimum of preparations relating to  telecommunications, media access for all groups, the repair of  short-wave radio, a minimum of opportunities to travel around  the country, observers.... The government and the National  Elections Commission will have to examine the possibilities with  the help of friends.   <H5>    Keeping in the Background </H5>   [Grogna] You told the diplomatic corps that you were leaving  room for secular people. Does that mean that you will leave the  political stage?    [Monsengwo] Yes. Gradually. My mandate is due to run  throughout the transitional period, but, in the absence of a  major crisis, the presidency of the HCR will be ensured by the  vice presidents in turn. I will keep in the background more and  more.    [Grogna] Will you be able to abandon the HCR when the  reconciliation starts?    [Monsengwo] If there is reconciliation, there is no longer a  need for me. I intervened for almost a year to try to settle  the crisis. If they reach agreement, the state will be able to  function normally.    [Grogna] What do you expect from Belgium?    [Monsengwo] Belgium and the other partners have said that  they are prepared to help Zaire when a credible government is  installed. I think they will do so. However, they will probably  wait until the administrators prove their honesty.  <H5>  Political Troubles </H5>   [Grogna] Amnesty International thinks that Zaire is in  terrible trouble and many ethnic disturbances are taking place.  Is this the result of the country's decline or a real political  will?    [Monsengwo] The Amnesty International report does not  surprise me. The country has never been in such a situation,  even at the height of President Mobutu's tough regime.    In addition, I have never known ethnic troubles which were  not of partisan political origin. It does not come from the  people.    [Grogna] What do you say to those who accuse you of being  the  president of higher presidential circles or of having betrayed  the CNS ideal?    [Monsengwo] I do not know whether those people have much  information about Zairian politics. When those people were  making those statements, we were reaching agreement in Zaire. I  think that those people have never read the document containing  the constitutional provisions. They do not know the spirit or  the letter of it and have not followed the strategy established  to ensure that the CNS is not betrayed.    [Grogna] In particular, some people have accused you of  having sent faxes to Butrus Butrus-Ghali to advise him against  allowing the Tshisekedi government delegation into the UN  General Assembly....    [Monsengwo] I have not sent faxes to the UN secretary  general. I have only written to him once, in reply to a question  on the dispatch of humanitarian aid.    If there are other faxes, they are forgeries and there is  reason to wonder why some people want to deceive the world and  disrupt public opinion.</p>

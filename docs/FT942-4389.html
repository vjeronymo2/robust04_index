			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Contented Luxembourgers look for more of the same: David Gardner finds the prosperous Grand Duchy, one of the six founder members of the Euro-club, upbeat on the question of European integration Luxembourg comes across as a tonic for a Europe fed up with recession. Dripping with prosperity after an almost unbroken 10-year cycle of growth, with unemployment a quarter of the EU average, the tiny Grand Duchy, exploiting its niche at the conjunction of France, Germany and Belgium, outwardly looks very self-satisfied indeed. Proud of its role as one of the six original founders of the Euro-club, its people's commitment to Europe is not in doubt. But nor is it any longer unquestioning. Turnout in the June 12 elections to the European Parliament will be deceptively high at nearly 90 per cent. As in Belgium, voting is compulsory, and uniquely, Euro-polls coincide with national elections. In the latter, the coalition between the Christian Socialist and Socialist parties, in power since 1984, is expected to be returned, with a modest bruising from the liberals of the Democratic Party, more Greens alongside them, and perhaps a first seat for Luxembourg's small but threatening far Right. At European level, where Luxembourg has a generous 6 seats in Strasbourg for its 400,000 people against, for instance, Germany's 99 seats for 81m inhabitants, the existing configuration should also hold steady. The Christian Socialists have three MEPs, the Socialists two, and the liberals one - although the newly unified Greens might just win one seat. Green MP Jup Weber, standing for Strasbourg where he already advises Green MEPs on forestry conservation, sums up the views not only of a small party but a small country when he says of the European Parliament that 'it is a fantastic instrument for networking.' But behind this placid exterior the Luxembourgers worry a bit more about Europe's direction. 'Luxembourgers know that we need Europe, especially after the last war,' says Mr Francois Biltgen, the Christian Socialist chief whip. 'The question is what sort of Europe we want.' The trauma of the second world war is scarred deeply in Luxembourg, which suffered proportionately the highest losses on the allied side except the Soviet Union. The post-war embrace of European integration was and is seen as its guarantee of peace and sovereignty. But there are now undercurrents of concern about issues such as European citizenship and voting rights for foreigners; impact of the Single Market; perceived threats to Luxembourg's thriving financial centre; and fears that the EU's 1996 constitutional review could downgrade the rights of small member states. Maastricht allows foreigners to vote in European, and eventually, local elections. In Luxembourg, one third of the population and half the workforce is foreign. The government therefore won a derogation requiring five years' residence before eligibility to vote, and 10 years before eligibility for office. This mostly deprived xenophobes of their market, and in practice only 6,000 foreigners have registered to vote. In Dudelange, a neat industrial town of 16,000 near the French border, Mr Mars di Bartolomeo, the Socialist mayor and former parliamentary chief whip  -himself the grandson of Italian immigrants - argues that Luxembourg is a living example of integrating Europe's peoples. 'You have the Europe of the institutions and you have the lived, practical Europe,' he says. 'That's what you see around you here, and we're proud of it.' But many Luxembourgers are less enchanted with the border-free Single Market, sold as a way of expanding into a hinterland of 10m. But bordering areas are more down-at-heel, and it is foreign companies moving into Luxembourg which are getting the best end of the deal, putting pressure on the Grand Duchy's mostly small- to medium-size industries. European harmonisation, moreover, could close the loopholes that enabled Luxembourg to become a tax haven and satellite broadcasting centre. 'Our partners tend to think we became rich essentially at their expense, by exploiting loopholes,' acknowledges Paul Helminger, deputy mayor of Luxembourg city standing for the Democrats for both parliaments. With decisions of this magnitude increasingly taken at EU level, 'it is not surprising that people are questioning the wisdom of dismantling the nation-state,' Mr Helminger says. The Democrats, traditionally the party of Europe, which provided Gaston Thorn as Commission president in the early 1980s, have sprouted an influential Euro-sceptical wing to reflect this. And all the main parties are determined to preserve Luxembourg's position in the 1996 review of power-sharing and decision-making in the Union. 'Our position is that we need Europe, but that too much Europe could be harmful for a tiny country,' says Mr di Bartolomeo.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Mobile phones meet a consumer barrier - Market penetration is still some way off It is a cellular industry platitude that the consumer market is about to dawn. New connections are booming; in several western countries - including the UK, Italy and Scandinavia - the number of new cellular connections is already outstripping fixed-line connections. The latest figures from the FT's mobile communications newsletter show that more than 12 per cent of Swedes now have a cellular phone. Finland, Norway and Denmark are not far behind. The rest of Europe lags, but subscriber growth across western Europe was 60 per cent in the year to August 1, with the penetration rate across the region now up at three per 100. Cellular telephony is also booming in the US and Asia-Pacific. One in three people in Hong Kong have access to some form of mobile communicator, with cellular phone penetration running at more than five in 100. Add to that projections of global growth continuing at 50 to 60 per cent a year, and the clear beginnings of marketing targeted at mainstream consumers, not just 'city slickers', and the mobile age seems simply a matter of waiting and ensuring sufficient capacity. After all, who would not want a mobile phone at the right price? In reality, of course, it is not going to be that simple. A look at the UK, which with 4.6 cellular subscribers per 100 people is at the leading edge of the developed world's mainstream cellular industry, gives a fair picture of the market in transition. From the figures, growth appears unbounded. It took the UK's cellular operators eight years from their launch in 1985 to attract their first 1.4m customers. The number of subscribers has almost doubled since the start of 1993, with the increase running at more than 50 per cent a year. Recent advertising campaigns by mobile operators have been pitched at mainstream consumers, and one of the four networks - Mercury One-2-One  - claims to be in direct competition with BT by offering free local mobile phone calls on its networks in the evenings and at weekends. Analysts expected that the mobile phone tide would ebb after Christmas, but apart from January, and a customary lull in the depth of the summer, demand has remained strong. It would be misleading, however, to believe that the mass market has dawned. Visit a mobile phone shop, or talk to a dealer, and it becomes evident that the mobile phone is not advancing into the consumer market as a whole, but rather penetrating deep into discrete sections. The most obvious is the high-earning professionals. Much of the current boom is caused by the fact that large numbers in this group are buying phones for their personal use, or for their spouses to use. Two other discrete growth segments are the self-employed blue-collar workers and vulnerable social groups - in both cases mostly equipped with cellular phones at the behest of employers or agencies. A survey late last year by Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex University, highlighted this trend, citing utilities which now equip their repair staff with mobiles and police forces providing them for women at risk. 'The stereotype is being turned upside down. And though the number of 'non-professional' users is still small, the fact that mobile phones are being seen in the hands of ordinary people is vital to creating a mass market,' says Ms Wood. However, the key words are 'upside down': there is still not much of a market between the better-off professionals and their families, and the blue-collar workers who need the phone as part of the job. The operators are aware of this. Mr Richard Goswell, managing director of Mercury One-2-One, frankly admits that PCN handset prices have still to come down by at least half - the cheapest currently retail for Pounds 199 - before the 'bulk' of the consumer market can be attracted. Still more starkly, he says that usage tariffs 'will have to migrate a great deal further towards BT's tariffs' before the goal can be achieved. With call tariffs anything up to 50p a minute on low-usage schemes designed to attract the consumer, that suggests a long trek ahead. Ironically, One-2-One makes the consumer barrier more obvious, despite its free evening local calls, because of the high handset prices. By contrast, established analogue operators Cellnet and Vodafone have experienced serious problems with 'churn' - the number of subscribers leaving the network as a proportion of all subscribers - in part because of the cheap high street handset deals now available. Mr Hans Snook, managing director of Orange, believes churn could before long turn into an 'industry crisis', although like all operators he is careful to exclude his own network from the crisis. According to BIS Strategic Decisions, an information technology consultancy, churn is now running at an annual rate equal to about 30 per cent of the number of mobile subscribers. BIS estimates that about half of all churn is caused by people moving between mobile phone companies or between different calling plans offered by the same operator. However, that still leaves half due to a combination of fraud and the inability of customers to keep up with their bills. Ms Gail Kirby, a BIS analyst, says: 'Churn is a serious problem, and it's getting more serious for the network operators as the number of subscribers rises so dramatically. The numbers churning are equal to the entire cellular population of a few years ago.' The three months to the end of June saw the churn rate rise for the fourth successive quarter. Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, was worst hit, with a disconnection rate equal to 34 per cent of its subscribers over a full year. Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's corporate affairs director, says: 'We have had problems with fraud, and are tightening our credit-checking system to reduce it.' He said some of the fraud appeared to be organised systematically, with some dealers stealing bonuses paid for new subscribers by means of fake subscriber names and personal details. But he conceded that 'part at least' of the churn was probably caused by customers unable to keep up with their bills. As one dealer puts it, neatly summing up what could become a serious industry predicament: 'Many people who buy mobile phones don't have a clue how much it actually costs to keep a mobile phone going - particularly if you use it.'</p>

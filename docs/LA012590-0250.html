			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U OF M HOOPSTER ROBINSON CENSURED FOR REF CRITICISM  </P> <P> Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany has issued a reprimand and censure order for  Michigan's basketball player Rumeal Robinson for public statements he made  about officials after last week's Michigan-Iowa game.  </P> <P> Delany said Robinson broke conference regulations when he criticized referees  in a postgame news conference after Michigan's 78-76 loss last Saturday.  </P> <P> A spokesman from Delany's office today would not comment on what comments  Robinson made.  </P> <P> But the Iowa City Press-Citizen on Sunday reported that Robinson complained  that the game's referees showed preferential treatment to Iowa.  </P> <P> "Everyone wants to play level basketball, and the referees tilt the game toward  one team," the Press-Citizen quoted Robinson as saying.  </P> <P> "I think this is a sorry league for referees to begin with," Robinson  continued. "The job they did was poor. They shouldn't even be paid for this."  </P> <P> Michigan interim director of athletics Jack Weidenbach and men's basketball  coach Steve Fisher reportedly also took disciplinary action against Robinson.  </P> <P> Mike Murray, a spokesman at the athletics department in Ann Arbor, Mich., said  he had no information on the alleged actions.  </P></p>

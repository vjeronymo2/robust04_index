			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Litigation too costly and futile, says Bingham - Legal Briefs Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls in the UK, has attacked the cost and delay in litigation in countries such as Britain, the US and Australia. He said that judges and lawyers in these countries, which share a common approach to law, were talking of 'a crisis of epic proportions'. Sir Thomas told an audience of judges and lawyers at the Centre of Advanced Litigation, Nottingham Law School, last Friday, that much legal activity was costly and futile. 'One very often sees actions come to the Court of Appeal where one feels dismay - I would use coarser language - about how a case has been handled.' He said that litigation, like complex surgery, would always be expensive, and for much the same reasons. The Master of the Rolls said he was trying to make the Queen's Bench Division, which handles large contract and tort disputes, more efficient by introducing the judge-directed timetables which have been so effective in the Commercial and Official Referees' (construction) courts.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Crackdown on Chinese CDs Authorities in China's Guangzhou province reported at the weekend that they had cracked down on the city's 19 compact disc producers in an effort to stamp out piracy. Two producers had been suspended for 'copyright violations' and 11 others had been required to 'get rid' of their counterfeit discs. Six producers had passed inspection. According to China Daily, 7,700 stores selling CDs in Guangdong were inspected and 1.26m pirated discs seized. The reported crackdown coincides with increased international pressure on China to stamp out widespread intellectual property rights violations. US officials last week concluded the latest in a series of negotiations with China aimed at bringing it into line on the copyright issue. The US has made it clear that China's accession to the Gatt depends on real progress in stopping violations.</p>

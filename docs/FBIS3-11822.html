			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- Enrique Gorriaran  Merlo, a former leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement  (ERP) and current member of the All for the Fatherland Movement  (MTP), has charged that a campaign "orchestrated by the  government and spread by the media, and in one way or another  answers to it" is being waged against him.    Gorriaran sent a letter -- signed by "Enrique H. Gorriaran"  and dated 14 March -- to MTP leaders to request a leave. In it,  he denounced reports that connect him to the super gang, the  holdup of an armored car, and the planting of bombs at automatic  teller machines    The letter says: "In my particular case, they have managed  to convince those who believe whatever people say to think that  I am either crazy or a criminal, and many others, who only  believe part of these reports, to doubt that I am a  revolutionary and to suspect that I belong to an intelligence  service."    Gorriaran asserted that this campaign against him has  intensified since the La Tablada events when a subversive group  assaulted the barracks and were bloodily quelled.    He complained that "many books that together add up to some  2,000 pages have been written since then to cater to 300,000  readers interested in politics, and this is without taking into  account hundreds of newspaper articles read by millions of  people."    The former ERP member alleged that, as a MTP member, "this  campaign seeks to damage the development of the political  organization" of this political movement.    "These ill-intentioned reports are seeking to cast a slur on  the memory of an entire generation of fighters from the 60's and  70's who have either died or been reported missing in order to  belittle their examples of dignity and their libertarian  sacrifices."    To that effect, he pointed out that he could not let more  time pass "without responding to these and other infamies," and  he considered it "his duty" to devote some time "to reply to  accusations that have been circulating."    To conclude, Gorriaran asked to be relieved of his party  affiliation for a time "due to the limitations of being  underground." This suspension will "depend on the time I take  to draft and order my testimony."    The request was accepted at a plenary session of the MTP,  which "reiterated its trust in the revolutionary example that  Comrade Gorriaran has been giving throughout all these years of  militancy."    "Gorriaran went underground in January 1988 when a sector of  Raul Alfonsin's administration accused him of being one of the  promoters of the raid on the 3d Infantry Regiment headquartered  at La Tablada, during which more than 20 people died, including  MTP leader Jorge Banos."</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Schering merger given go-ahead Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday won approval from shareholders to merge its agrochemical division with Hoechst. The merger, which will allow Schering to concentrate on the core pharmaceutical business, will create a group with a combined annual turnover of DM3bn (Dollars 1.75bn), making it the world's second-largest company in this sector. Hoeschst will be the majority shareholder with 60 per cent of the capital. The joint venture, called Hoechst Schering Agro, will have an equity of DM700m. Mr Guiseppe Vita, chairman of Schering, said turnover in the company's agrochemical sector had fallen 8 per cent since November last year. He said earnings for 1993 'would not reach the expected after-tax level of DM11m'. The company blamed the decline on the fall in plant protection sales. Hoechst expects a net profit of DM42m from its own agrochemical divisions this year, rising to DM117m in 1994. The announcement of the merger yesterday coincided with a fall in Schering's shares after Behringwerke, a subsidiary of Hoechst, said it would next week present the first results of trials for a new multiple sclerosis drug. Analysts said the trials could pose competition for Betaseron, Schering's multiple sclerosis treatment.</p>

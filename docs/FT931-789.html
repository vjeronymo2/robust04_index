			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: A question of value for Lineker the logo - Soccer / The rules of the game played on a sales pitch HAS Gary Lineker read Francis Fukuyama? In The End of History and the Last Man, Fukuyama celebrated the victory of liberal democracy over other forms of government. He added, though: 'The decline of community life suggests that, in the future, we risk becoming secure and self-absorbed last men; devoid of thymotic striving for higher goals in our pursuit of private comforts.' (Thymos is Fukuyama's word for the spirited part of the soul). This, then, is the question for England's nicest last man. Has he given up the pursuit of higher goals in favour of a feather-bed of yen? If the visit to Singapore last week of Lineker's Nagoya Grampus Eight team is anything to go by, the problem is not that Lineker has sold out for a less demanding soccer life. Of course, he has. What is more worrying is that he does not appear primarily to be a footballer at all. He is an advertising logo: a Ronald McDonald for Toyota. No one should be surprised that all the media attention in Singapore was on Lineker's tanned, if tired, looks. He handles the microphone and the notebook effortlessly. He is patient, courteous, pleasant. But so is Ronald McDonald. And when Ronald has to shoot a commercial, he has plenty of takes to get it right, plenty of breaks in filming, plenty of opportunity to fix his lipstick. What Lineker learnt in Singapore was that the commercial in which he is appearing is on the field of play. He might have thought he had done his bit for Toyota with his media performance. But to maximise its investment (officially to guide and protect), the company has assigned Lineker a minder who refuses to leave his side. In Singapore, Lineker begged a local journalist: 'I can't get this bloke off my back. Is there anywhere we can slip out after the game for a quiet drink?' There was. Tentative arrangements were made. The game destroyed them. Lineker struggled. Within 20 minutes, he was limping. He had warned that he had a thigh injury. By half-time, he had touched the ball perhaps half a dozen times (although, of course, he got a cheer every time he did). Twenty minutes into the second half, he had managed to score from a penalty but was in distress, signalling to the bench for a substitution. The bench, consisting of an extremely corporate-looking manager and a young, timid coach, ignored him. You cannot remove the logo from a commercial. And there were more than 35,000 potential Toyota buyers out there. Lineker then removed himself to the touch-line nearest the bench. That did not work. In the end, he stood for fully three minutes ignoring his supporting cast, glaring at the coach, remonstrating, pointing to his thigh and stretching out his arms in unbelieving supplication. The management relented with 10 minutes to go. 'I was injured and I could hardly breathe. But they wouldn't take me off,' said Lineker, angrily. He even ignored supporters' requests for autographs. Very un-Gary. Before the game, which Nagoya lost 4-3, I asked him if he thought footballers would become like golfers and tennis players - rarely needing actually to win but making a fat living by artfully dodging money from corporate coffers. 'Not at all,' he said. 'I think 98 per cent of players are not paid a lot of money. In no way are they in a position to be secure when they retire.' What is a lot of money? 'Well, that depends on your life style . . . my house in St John's Wood (London) cost a lot of money. But then, I've won a few games.' Lineker's experience is part of the latest attempt by business to take over soccer. But Bernard Tapie and Silvio Berlusconi bought Marseilles and AC Milan to fuel their egos rather than to sell cars. Toyota, not its chairman, owns the largest share-holding in Grampus Eight. It is paying Lineker Dollars 6m (Pounds 4.2m) over two years. But company officials refuse to be drawn on whether Lineker's success will be measured in terms of goals, crowds - or sales. Lineker believes, with great sincerity, that he is having a new adventure, in a new league, in a country that will one day be a soccer power. But Pele said similar things about a team called the New York Cosmos. Will Lineker look back in two years' time and discover that, in 1993, he retired from soccer and became a car salesman?</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for a proposed or final rule if the rule would have significant economic impact on a substantial number of ``small entities'', i.e. small businesses, small non-profit organizations, or small governmental jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The responsibility for meeting the requirements of the regulations proposed in this NPRM is on the State agencies and to a lesser extent on area agencies. Actual delivery of services may be provided in some circumstances by proprietary, public, and not-for-profit agencies or organizations under grants or contracts from State or area agencies. Although area agencies and most service delivery agencies and organizations are ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Act, this rule will impose no significant burdens on State agencies, area agencies or other affected parties and will provide flexibility to State and area agencies in implementing the provisions of the Act. For these reasons, the Secretary hereby certifies that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule contains information collection requirements which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

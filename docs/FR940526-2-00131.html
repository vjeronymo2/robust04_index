Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation, and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington, DC, area. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program. OPM, or its representative, conducts annual surveys to determine living cost differences. OPM conducts full-scale Background Surveys approximately once every five years to review the appropriateness of items, services, and businesses covered in the annual Price surveys. Elements of the Background Survey may be repeated annually on a limited basis as part of the maintenance of and preparation for the annual Price Surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM uses the Background Survey to identify the services, items, quantities, outlets, and locations that will be surveyed to collect living cost data within the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The Background Survey also is used to collect information on local trade practices, consumer buying patterns, taxes and fees, and other economic characteristics related to living costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Data Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Full-scale Background Surveys are conducted approximately once every five years.

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING'S YOUTHFUL ZEAL AGAINST PORN, OBSCENITY  </P> <P> I had a hearty laugh when I read ("Mapplethorpe Show Bumps Into a City's Legacy  of Conformity" by David Wells, Calendar, April 23) that Charles Keating, as a  young Cincinnati attorney full of religious zeal, founded Citizens for Decent  Literature and was later appointed by President Nixon to the Federal Commission  on Obscenity and Pornography. The obscene greed displayed in the S&amp;L  scandals is beginning to make sense.  </P> <P> G. BORDING MATHIEU  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

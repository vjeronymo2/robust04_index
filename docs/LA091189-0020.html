			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERIOUS STRANGER SWIMS AWAY WITH LA JOLLA ROUGH WATER TITLE  </P> <P> He came and left quietly, but his performance in the water was anything but  silent.  </P> <P> Bari Weick, 28, of Mountain View, Calif., was in Arizona attending a retirement  party for his father last week when he decided to enter Sunday's 59th La Jolla  Rough Water Swim.  </P> <P> "I had friends in San Diego who I wanted to see on my way home, and I decided  to enter," said Weick, winner of the men's 25-29 masters one-mile swim at La  Jolla Cove. Weick finished in 20:39 for the fastest masters (out of nine  divisions) and overall time of the day.  </P> <P> "I didn't know who he was," said Del Mar's 29-year-old Alan Voisard, who  finished second for the second consecutive year with a 21:08, 50 yards behind  Weick.  </P> <P> Weick, a distance swimmer for Stanford from 1979 to 1983, was a geographical  enigma. He was listed as a Solana Beach resident (he's not) and some thought he  was from Arizona, but three-quarters into the race, the pack of lead swimmers  just knew he was in front of them.  </P> <P> "At the second leg, he was only two or three body-lengths ahead of me," Voisard  said, "but then he surged. He just took off."  </P> <P> Neither Voisard nor the other 767 men in the masters divisions -- there were  1,264 total swimmers -- had a chance to congratulate Weick. Thinking the race  was Saturday, he had booked an afternoon flight to San Francisco. He didn't  stay long to chat.  </P> <P> "It was a lot of fun," Weick said. "My stroke is suited to long distances, so I  just stretched it out and took off."  </P> <P> Water conditions were perfect -- smooth and warm -- and Weick's only complaint,  echoed by other competitors, was the amount of kelp in the water.  </P> <P> "It was the worst thing and the best thing," he said. "The worse the conditions  are, the better I like it because I can concentrate on my stroke."  </P> <P> Beth Knight had to concentrate on just getting to the race. Knight swam the  one-mile leg of a coed relay team that took second in the Bud Light Triathlon  of San Diego Sunday morning in Solana Beach.  </P> <P> Knight, 30, of Del Mar, had time to go home and rest for 45 minutes before she  entered the Pacific Ocean for the second time within four hours -- and won her  sixth consecutive title.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel the effects," said Knight, who swam a 22:22 for a triple  victory. Her finish won the 30-35 women's masters, the combined masters and the  overall best time of the day for women.  </P></p>

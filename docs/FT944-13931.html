			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Adia in black for nine months Adia, the Swiss temporary employment group controlled by Mr Klaus Jacobs, has reported net income of SFr25.1m (Dollars 19.4m) in the first nine months of 1994 compared with a loss of SFr112.2m in the same period of 1993. Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, forecast that net income in the full year would exceed SFr30m, a large increase on the SFr20m forecast he made in July. Revenues were up 11.3 per cent to SFr2.59bn, or 18 per cent in local currencies. Adia attributed almost all of the growth to a higher volume of temporary hours sold. Mr Bowmer said the gathering pace of recovery in continental Europe had fuelled 'our excellent results'. The French operations had performed well in spite of extensive restructuring. Swiss business was running over 50 per cent ahead of last year in hours sold. Revenues in Germany and the Benelux countries were well ahead in the third quarter. Business growth was strong in the US, the UK and Australia, but growth in these markets was slowing as the economic recovery matured. Mr Bowmer said Adia had reached an agreement in principle for the settlement of litigation challenging the terms under which it has agreed to acquire the 19 per cent of Adia Services, its US subsidiary, that it does not own.</p>

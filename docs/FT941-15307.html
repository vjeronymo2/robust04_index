			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Nordic exchanges have a hard act to follow - Prospects for 1994 The Nordic stock exchanges had an exceptionally good year last year - so much so that the performance will be virtually impossible to repeat in 1994. Finland, Sweden and Norway were western Europe's top performing bourses in local currency terms, and, even the region's worst performer, Denmark, managed a near 40 per cent gain. Finland, with a 91 per cent rise in the HEX index to 1,582, came out of best of all. Norway had its best year since 1983, after its main index spurted 65 per cent to 613, and the Swedish Affarsvarlden index rose 54 per cent. The region-wide rally was supported by many common factors. Interest rates fell to levels not seen for at least a decade and clear signs of economic recovery emerged. Many of the big export-orientated companies, which are particularly dominant on the Swedish and Finnish bourses, started to show the benefits of corporate restructuring. And earnings were helped by a surge in exports, which has accompanied the weakening of the Finnish and Swedish currencies. Lastly, it was apparent that the worst of the region's banking crisis was over. The scale of buying was accentuated by the downturn that had preceded it. One reflection of the pent-up state of demand was a massive growth in turnover. Average daily volumes in Stockholm surged to SKr1.4bn (Dollars 171m) and SKr1.7bn respectively in November and December from SKr820m and SKr670m in 1992, while in Finland average turnover was FM186.6m (Dollars 14.82m) a day, more than four-times the previous year's figure. Volumes and price rises were helped by a surge in foreign buying. Foreigners were primarily attracted by the valuation argument, but in the case of Sweden and Finland momentum was assisted by the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership. In Sweden foreigners were net buyers of SKr29.0bn worth of shares in the 11 months to November, compared with SKr11.3bn in the same 1992 period. In Denmark foreigners bought a net DKr6bn (Dollars 890m) of equities during 1993, compared with just DKr0.3bn a year earlier. There should be little surprise that best-performing sector across the region was banks, as 1993 was the year that the Nordic financial crisis abated. Banks that at the start of the year looked set to collapse without government support were by the year-end standing strongly again on their own two feet. The Swedish banking index led the way with a 250 per cent increase in 1993, followed by the Finnish index - up 138.5 per cent - and the Norwegian index, which climbed 135 per cent. Shipping company shares in Norway and Denmark also had a good year, even though the state of the tanker market was hardly encouraging. The Oslo shipping index advanced 82 per cent, while shipping stocks climbed 57 per cent in Denmark. This year has begun well, with a new weight of money piling into the Nordic markets during the opening days of the new year. This is partly traditional, partly a reflection of special factors, such as the change to corporate taxation rules in Sweden. It is clear that domestic money is supporting the continuing rally to a greater extent than in the recent past. But can the upturn be sustained? Most commentators believe the mood of optimism is likely to hold for at least the first half of the year, as Nordic countries bring down their interest rates further in response to the downward trend throughout Europe. The Bank of Finland yesterday decided to cut its base rate to 5.25 per cent from 5.5 per cent from February 1 amid growing optimism that the country would achieve positive economic growth for the first time since 1990 this year. 'It's difficult to see any of the Nordic markets declining in 1994,' says Mr Klas Andersson, Scandinavian equity analyst with Goldman Sachs in London, 'However, the pace will slow down, because most of the interest rate cuts have already occurred, particularly on the long side.' Goldman Sachs expects all four markets to outperform the European average. There are plenty of uncertainties, particularly how the German economy performs and the likely impact of a strengthening recovery in the US. If US interest rates go up, some of the money invested in foreign markets is almost certainly going to be pulled back. Any significant share disposals by foreign investors will have a much greater impact now that foreign ownership levels are higher. Prospects for the Norwegian market will, as ever, hinge on the development of the oil price, while market participants in Finland will be keeping a nervous eye on political developments in Russia. In fact, political factors will be a significant influence on all the Nordics in 1994. Elections will take place in Sweden and Denmark in the second half of the year, and Sweden, Finland and Norway are likely to hold referenda this year on their bid to join the European Union. The markets may well be upset if the generally negative sentiment towards membership becomes a firm No at the polls.</p>

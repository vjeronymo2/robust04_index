			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: A sad loss for South Africa Yesterday's announcement of the impending departure of Mr Derek Keys as South Africa's finance minister presents Mr Nelson Mandela with the first serious challenge of his presidency. There is no reason to doubt Mr Keys when he cites 'personal reasons' for deciding to hand over his portfolio in October: he had always made clear that he did not see a long-term future in politics, and that once he had overseen the economic transition from apartheid to a government of national unity he would want to leave public life. He can justly claim that his budget of June 22 set the seal on such an orderly transition. It demonstrated that the new government intends to live within its means - by keeping the budget deficit to about 6 per cent of gross domestic product - as it struggles to redress the legacy of apartheid with a reconstruction and development plan. It underlined, above all, that stability would have to take precedence over fulfilling expectations of dramatic change. Nevertheless, Mr Keys's departure leaves a large hole. Former President F W de Klerk apart, no other individual has done as much to reassure the local business community and international investors during the past two years of tumultuous change. His greatest achievement has been to win and maintain the confidence of the African National Congress during the transition. Although he was chosen by Mr de Klerk, the force of his personality and his reputation as an apolitical pragmatist played a vital part in the ANC's abandonment of socialist economic policies. Compounding the loss was the way in which the resignation emerged - through a premature leak that unsettled financial markets. Mr Mandela's announcement last night that Mr Christo Liebenberg, a respected banker, will succeed Mr Keys goes some way to limiting the damage. But Mr Mandela must also reaffirm that his government intends to persevere with Mr Keys's policies of fiscal discipline and market reform. Ideally, such a reassertion of principles would be accompanied by equally unambiguous statements from the two other key members of the team administering economic policy, Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, and Mr Jay Naidoo, responsible for the reconstruction plan. They have already played a critical role, arguing as vigorously as Mr Keys for financial discipline, and their background in South Africa's trade union movement will give their words added weight. The jittery market reaction to the rumours that preceded yesterday's announcement should in itself provide Mr Mandela with a salutary lesson: that South Africa's new leadership still has a lot to prove in economic policy. If the episode of Mr Keys's resignation reinforces awareness that the policies he bequeathes are vital to domestic management and international confidence, it may yet turn out to have served a useful purpose.</p>

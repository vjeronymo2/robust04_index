			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Talks between Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Foreign Minister of the Yemeni  Republic Muhammad Salim Basindawa who arrived in Moscow on  Wednesday, began at the building of the Russian Foreign Ministry  today.    It is expected that later today the head of the Russian  foreign office will hold talks with South Yemeni emissary --  Deputy Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Yemeni  Socialist Party Saleh Saleh Muhammad.    Valerian Shuvayev, head of the section of countries on the  Arabian Peninsula and the department of the Middle East and  north Africa of the Russian Foreign ministry, told ITAR-TASS  about Moscow's position at the talks.    These contacts, he said, are being carried out within the  framework of Russian diplomacy's efforts aimed at reaching a  ceasefire between the confronting sides in Yemen which would  become the first step towards halting a bloodshed.    All internal problems of this Arab country must be resolved  at a negotiating table. We are prepared to coordinate our  actions with all who seek to achieve the same aims, both on a  bilateral basis and within the framework of the United Nations  to promote the soonest stopping of the senseless fratricidal  war, the Russian diplomat pointed out.</p>

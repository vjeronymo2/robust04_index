			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Encouraging development for local policymaking Sir, Hurrah for Mr Martin Easteal, the chief executive of the Local Government Commission for England, in his Personal View ('Power must return to the provinces', February 4). All power to his elbow. The opportunity for citizens to participate in meaningful decisions affecting their communities is being extended in this part of the country by the use of 'consultative committees'. These allow elected representatives to receive advice from specialists working within the local community and is helping to improve policymaking. It is a development that should be encouraged. Many people will agree with Martin Easteal's final sentence - if the principle of 'subsidiarity' is right for Europe, why is it not also right for Britain? Let us hope that the work of his commission will result in power returning to the provinces. Michael Gardiner, 32 Old Vicarage Green, Keynsham, Bristol BS18 2DO</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Analysis of monetary union in danger of missing real benefits Sir, It is disappointing to witness how the debate on European monetary union risks being reduced to an exchange of non-objective views by the nostalgic representatives of one or another conviction. It simply does not do justice to the facts for Prof Martin Feldstein to reduce the gains to the UK from monetary union to those arising from the fact that a single currency would 'simplify UK business dealings within the EC,' (Personal View; 'The ultimate opt-out', December 9). Or to assert that those 'are small in comparison with the higher average cyclical unemployment in Britain that would result from the loss of a national monetary policy and of a currency that responds to market forces to maintain competitiveness'. First, even supporters of Emu recognise that savings from transactions costs under Emu would amount to, at most, 1.5 per cent of GDP. But this is beside the point, because these are a by-product rather than an objective of Emu. The most important benefit for UK business is the removal of long-term exchange rate uncertainty, which under the current system of floating rates increases the risks of doing business in EC countries and for which forward facilities barely exist at all. The main benefit for the UK economy as a whole is the prospect of escaping from the inflationary boom-and-bust cycles that have characterised economic policy in the past. The larger credibility of an independent European central bank makes it likely that this goal can be reached at lower cost than is possible under present arrangements. Prof Feldstein claims that UK unemployment would increase as a result of the loss of national monetary policy. Why should it? It is well known that the UK is characterised by real-wage rigidity, and that the temporary gains in competitiveness from devaluation are quickly eroded through higher inflation. Britain cannot price itself back into world markets simply by devaluing. Prof Feldstein's other claim, namely that under Emu monetary policy might be determined by politicians and not by central bankers, has even less factual basis. The ECB will be more independent than the Bank of England is at present - if he fears politically motivated interventions into monetary policy, the ECB is the best way to reduce this danger. Weighing up publicly the pros and cons of a big decision such as Emu is crucial - but it is time that the debate is again based on facts and analyses.

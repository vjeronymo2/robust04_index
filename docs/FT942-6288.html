			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Athens stays volatile after last week's two-year low - The battle to avoid devaluing the drachma is giving Greek equities a hard time Greece's long drawn-out battle to avoid devaluing the drachma drove the Athens stock exchange to a two-year low last week. The index dropped 5.5 per cent to 806.73 on Wednesday as local institutional investors liquidated holdings in order to buy 'repos' - fixed-term, repurchase agreement instruments - at interest rates approaching 100 per cent. By Friday it had recovered to 855.4, following indications that the government intends to permit a faster depreciation of the drachma over the next few weeks. But yesterday it fell 10.10 points to 845.33. Mr Yannis Tegopoulos, chief analyst at Midland-Pantelakis Securities, says: 'The market is going to stay volatile so long as the drachma crisis persists.' Last week's flight into 'repos' could be followed by another into government bonds. New issues of Ecu and US dollar linked bonds next week will carry higher interest rates, and a one-month Treasury bill may be issued at around 25 per cent. Brokers said there was heavy selling of stocks by mutual funds last week as investors rushed to reedeem their holdings in order to buy 'repos' or the new bond issues. The hardest hit were the newly listed construction stocks, with several now trading below their issue price. Few big government contracts have been awarded in recent weeks and fears are growing that budget problems may result in spending curbs on public investment. In dramatic contrast to the oversubscriptions of recent months, the underwriters of a Dr1.2bn offering by Ergas, a construction company specialising in Middle East projects, were left holding 36 per cent of the issue. It remains to be seen whether listings by several more construction companies, already approved by the bourse, will be postponed. On the other hand, the prospect of a devaluation of the drachma has boosted demand for export-led companies such as cement and textile producers. Greek textile manufacturers, who use locally grown cotton, are forecasting much-improved profits this year following a rise in international cotton prices in 1994. Even if the government's efforts to defend the drachma by raising interest rates to record levels succeed in staving off devaluation in the short term, the outlook for the Greek currency still appears uncertain. Analysts are concerned over the Finance Ministry's apparent unwillingness to intro-duce new fiscal measures to bring the budget deficit under control. The cost of interbank lending is being passed on to customers: Greek companies must cope with a sharp rise in interest rates on working capital, from 25 per cent to more than 40 per cent. Mr Dimitris Verriopoulos of Alpha Brokerage says: 'The market is waiting to see a fiscal package introduced that tackles the underlying economic problems. Until that happens, confidence cannot be restored.' The bourse had already discounted the government's decision - announced last week - that 25 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, would be floated on the Athens bourse this year, he says. The flotation, due to take place in October, is expected to raise Dr250bn, with half the offering to be placed with institutional investors abroad. In the meantime, the government is examining ways of speeding up partial privatisations of other public utilities, such as the state oil and gas corporation, in the hope of raising additional revenues this year.</p>

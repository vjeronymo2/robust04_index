			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Survey shows gold investment rallied strongly in 1993 Some 348 tonnes of investment gold, the highest level for more than ten years, was bought in 1993, compared with only 69 tonnes in 1992, according to the latest survey of the market by the Gold Fields Minerals Services research group. A revival of interest in gold was sparked among American and some European investors by the well-publicised activities in April and May last year of two high-profile international financiers, Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros. They helped to end a five-year bear market in gold and lift the price by Dollars 60 a troy ounce, or about 18 per cent, during 1993. On the other hand, a combination of higher prices and economic weakness in Europe and Japan caused the first fall in the use of gold in fabrication in the western world since 1987. The drop was particularly noticeable in the jewellery sector - which accounts for more than 70 per cent of gold demand and used almost 7 per cent less gold: 2,302 tonnes against 2,474 in 1992. Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS managing director, pointed out yesterday that speculators and investors could drive the market either way this year, depending on such things as their perception of whether the US authorities had inflation under control. This made it impossible to make sensible price forecasts. Nevertheless, 'based on figures for the first quarter of 1994, it appears that consumers in the main Asian markets have adjusted to the higher price levels, and there is now good support for gold in the Dollars 370 to Dollars 390 an ounce range'. Mr Murray admitted some producers might find it worrying that with the average price for the year only 4.6 per cent up from 1992 a record 516 tonnes of scrap supply was encouraged into the market, mainly from the recycling of old jewellery. However, he said the flow was not surprising, given the rapid rise in the past few years of the 'pool' of gold jewellery. Last year there were special factors such as many Indian investors turning temporarily from jewellery to bars of gold, property and equities. Also many of the Saudi Arabian sales were to exchange old jewellery for items of more modern design. Other points from the survey, the fifth since GFMS - which is financially supported by Gold Fields of South Africa, that country's second-largest gold producer, and Newmont, the biggest North American producer - took it over, include: Mine production outside the former eastern bloc countries rose only 2 per cent to 1,891 tonnes, the lowest growth in output since 1980; Both average western world cash and total mine production costs fell by 5 per cent, to Dollars 233 an ounce and Dollars 285 respectively; Forward sales by gold mining companies increased to their highest level since 1990 and the second highest level since 1980 - 180 tonnes against 165 in 1992; Central bank sales added a net 475 tonnes to supply, down from 626 tonnes. Gross sales totalled 608 tonnes involving 22 central banks or other government organisations. In 1992 some 18 official organisations sold 978 tonnes, including 600 tonnes sold between them by the Belgian and Dutch central banks; Global supply was slightly down, from 3,570 tonnes to 3,538, even though output in the Commonwealth of Independent States is estimated to have held up well at 244 tonnes against 237 tonnes; The so-called 'global gap' between supply and physical demand narrowed from 700 to 300 tonnes. Mr Murray asked: 'Will private or official holders fill the gap as they did last year or will the price have to rise to tease the gold out?'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Short commentary" by station observer Mulatov; from the </F> "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program]    [Text] Listener friends: A Russian parliamentary  delegation, led by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, is continuing  its visit to China. The Russian lawmakers met and held talks  with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing. The delegation will  also visit Shanghai and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.  Here is a short commentary by station observer Mulatov:    The Russian parliamentary delegation's visit to China is yet  another step toward expanding good-neighborly cooperation  between the two countries. Actively strengthening contacts  between the two parliaments is part of the constructive  partnership between Russia and China. Foreign observers have  noted that the parliamentary delegation's visit to China  precedes the official visit by a delegation headed by Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin. The Russian prime minister will visit  China from 26-29 May. During the visit, some documents on  expanding concrete areas of Russian-Chinese cooperation will be  signed. A second Russia-China summit will be held later on,  probably in late summer or early autumn. The first summit was  held in December 1992, when President Yeltsin paid an official  visit to China. This time, Chinese President Jiang Zemin will  reciprocate the visit. Holding a second Russia-China summit  will promote and raise to a new high the constructive  partnership between Russia and China.    The development of Russian-Chinese relations on the basis of  good-neighborly and wide-ranging cooperation has gradually  become an important positive factor that has a bearing on the  international situation, in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the  world at large.    In conclusion, Station observer Mulatov says: To Russia,  which is a large Eurasian country, its equality-based  partnership with China is of great importance as is its new  relationship with West Europe and the United States.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROSSING THE BORDER  </P> <P> Robert A. Jones' column "Last One Over the Border, Turn Out the Lights" (Part  A, Feb. 27) was a cruel, insensitive and misleading look at a daily event which  is extremely dangerous, technically, illegal, but paradoxically uplifting.  Jones trivializes the suffering endured by those undocumented workers. Those  people of both sexes and all ages who risk life and limb so that they and their  families can escape crushing poverty, were portrayed as "winners" of a "Game"  in which "the score is about 3 million to zip." Certainly, the tactics used by  the Border Patrol, such as razor wire and now, blinding light, should not be  characterized as " . . . something to mix things up a bit and keep the veterans  interested." Jones forgets that when similar tactics were used near the Berlin  Wall, no one called it a "Game."  </P> <P> The stakes in this "Game" are higher than Jones cares to admit. Recently other  media have reported the terrorizing of undocumented workers near the border by  various vigilante groups. The actions of these groups range from harassment to  murder, rape and robbery. Fox Television's "The Reporters" (Feb. 24) showed the  Border Patrol encountering and yet failing to stop a group of ROTC high school  students near the border. This group was dressed in full camouflage gear and  armed with paint- pellet guns and BB rifles, out on "patrol" near the border.  The Border Patrol's inaction amounts to tacit approval of this activity.  </P> <P> Jones ignores these facts, stating, "After all, this is The Game and not to be  taken too seriously." If murder, rape and robbery are not taken seriously by  Jones and your newspaper, it is time for all who sympathize with the plight of  undocumented workers to find other reading material. As always, the  disenfranchised are powerless against bullies, but we are not.  </P> <P> MAURICE SANCHEZ  </P> <P> Past President  </P> <P> RICHARD ARMENDARIZ  </P> <P> President, Orange County  </P> <P> Mexican-American Bar Assn.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Dyno Industrier doubles pre-tax profit to NKr476m Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, plastics and explosives group, more than doubled nine-month pre-tax profits to NKr476m (Dollars 73.2m) from NKr234m, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The advance was attributed to improved profitability of methanol operations in the Netherlands, increased supplies to the automotive industry and expanded deliveries of explosives and resins. Group revenue rose by 20 per cent to NKr7.3bn while operating profit doubled to NKr597m. Mr Arild Ingjerd, Dyno's president, warned, however, that margins were coming under heavy pressure from higher prices for raw materials, such as methanol and ammonia. Apart from producing methanol outside Norway, Dyno consumes 300,000 tonnes of the chemical a year. It also expressed concern over rising prices for plastics raw materials. This effects its plastics division which, among other things, supplies fuel tank systems to the automotive industry.</p>

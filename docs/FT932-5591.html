			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / BA seeks meeting with union leader TALKS aimed at averting a strike by British Airways cabin crews and ground staff were adjourned yesterday, with management maintaining that some progress had been made. BA is now seeking a meeting with Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, in an effort to resolve the dispute over pay and conditions. 'Talks were constructive and we made definite progress on one issue and now seek further talks on the outstanding issue,' the airline said. A union spokesman, however, said there was still 'a big chasm between both sides'. The dispute arose following the introduction of new pay and conditions for staff at Gatwick Airport following BA's takeover of Dan-Air last year. The main issue, which is over conditions for BA's Gatwick staff, remains to be resolved. Yesterday's meeting lasted five hours, and followed a ballot of TGWU members last week which resulted in 62 per cent voting for a strike. No immediate action was taken by the union but Mr Morris said that if no agreement was reached a strike would be called. The TGWU was not commenting on the talks last night. It is understood the union does not want to say anything ahead of the proposed meeting between BA and Mr Morris. The result of a ballot of 3,000 BA pilots on industrial action over what they claim is an attempt to introduce poorer pay and conditions is expected to be announced on Friday.</p>

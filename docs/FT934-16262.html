			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Technology: Geared for economy - Fiat is bucking the trend with its Punto, a mass-market car with six speeds Motorists wanting to develop their left leg muscles should try out Fiat's Punto small car, to be launched in Italy, France and Germany - three of Europe's biggest car markets - in early November. While most automobile makers, including Fiat itself, have been developing increasingly sophisticated automatic transmission technologies, especially for smaller models used for stop-start urban driving, Italy's leading car marque has come up with an interesting alternative. The new Punto range, which is widely seen as being as crucial to Fiat's success as its predecessor, the Uno, was in the 1980s, includes models with a standard five-speed gearbox as well an innovative continuously variable transmission, due next spring. But the company has also unveiled a novel six-speed gearchange on one the most basic and least powerful of its Puntos. Six-speed boxes are nothing new. 'Supercars' such as the Corvette Stingray and BMW's fast and luxurious 8-Series sports coupes already offer them to performance-minded drivers. More recently, six-speed transmissions have appeared on more modestly priced, but still potent, sports cars such as the most powerful version of Vauxhall/Opel's Calibra. In a matter of months, Fiat itself will be offering a six-speed transmission on a new, high-performance four-wheel drive version of its sporty Alfa Romeo 164 saloon. However, the relatively low sales volumes of the six-speed supercars mean the gearboxes have all been bought in from specialist manufacturers, usually Germany's Getrag, rather than being produced in-house by the car makers themselves. The Punto marks the first time that a mass-market car will offer a manufacturer-built six-speed box. It will also be the first time a six-speed transmission has been used in a car with such a small engine. The Punto version involved has a 1100cc motor, developing just 55 hp (40 kw). In a car likely to be chosen predominantly for city driving, where frequent gear changes are essential, what was the point? Nicola Malara, head of gearbox development at Fiat's car subsidiary, explains. 'We designed the six-speed box largely for young drivers, who may have only just passed their driving test, but want to have the sense of fun associated with a bigger car. The six-speed Punto isn't a turbo or a car which goes terribly fast, it's more the feeling of a sports car.' The six-speed transmission is a marriage of marketing and technology. A number of countries, such as Italy, limit the engine capacity of cars which can be driven by newly-qualified drivers. Even where there are no such restrictions, many prospective Punto buyers would not be able to afford higher-performance cars. The six-speed transmission is intended to let drivers get the most out of the modestly powered engine by making them work harder themselves. 'Its qualities are particularly evident in mixed-condition driving or going up hills, where the driver has a suitable gear ratio for every situation,' according to Fiat. Frequent use of the clutch may not put off many prospective buyers just making the transition from two to four wheels, reckons Malara. 'For those used to driving 50cc or 125cc motor scooters, six gears are nothing new; manufacturers have used them for some time to maximise performance.' And in Italy, where motor racing is almost a religion, the idea of frequent, snappy gear changes may appeal to sports-minded public. Malara thinks the model will also catch on in Germany and Spain, where drivers also value 'performance motoring'. But Malara denies the six-speed box is just a gimmick to draw first-time drivers to the Punto. 'The six-speed box, if used properly, will lower fuel consumption compared with the five-speed version.' And although its appeal may seem limited at present, Fiat may offer the new transmission on other small models, such as a successor to the Lancia Y10, he hints. Either way, the company should benefit. As the six-speed box was a spin-off from the new five-speed Punto gearbox, development costs were modest. The six-speed transmission is only slightly heavier and required only modest additional engineering, says Malara. On the other hand, if the six-speed transmission catches on, the company will have stolen a march on its competitors, who may feel obliged to develop six-speed boxes of their own. 'We'll be ahead, and theirs won't be a novelty any more,' says Malara.</p>

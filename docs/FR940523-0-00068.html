These costs may include but are not necessarily limited to expenditures for work necessary to comply with applicable requirements to conduct groundwater remediation, treatment or containment of contaminated soil, disposal of process wastes, removal actions, air pollution abatement measures, mill and equipment decommissioning, site monitoring, administrative activities, expenditures required to meet necessary regulatory standards, or other requirements established by NRC, or an Agreement State. Costs of remedial action must be supported by reasonable documentation in accordance with the requirements of Subpart C of this Part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means work performed which is necessary to comply with all applicable requirements of UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable requirements established by an Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the United States Department of Energy or its authorized agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dry short tons of byproduct material  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the quantity of tailings generated from the extraction and processing of 2,000 pounds of uranium or thorium ore-bearing rock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal reimbursement ratio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the ratio of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material to total dry short tons of byproduct material present at an active uranium or thorium processing site on October 24, 1992. The ratio shall be established by comparing Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material to total dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site on October 24, 1992, or by another means of attributing costs of remedial action to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States which the Department determines is more accurate than a ratio established using dry short tons of byproduct material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means dry short tons of byproduct material that was present at an active uranium or thorium processing site on October 24, 1992, and was generated as an incident of uranium or thorium sales to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Generally accepted accounting principles  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means those principles established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which encompass the conventions, rules, and procedures necessary to define accepted accounting practice at a particular time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inflation index  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI&hyph;U) as published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Labor Statistics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a site owner licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2092, 2111) by NRC, or an Agreement State, for any activity at an active uranium or thorium processing site which results, or has resulted, in the production of byproduct material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maximum reimbursement amount or maximum reimbursement ceiling  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the smaller of the following two quantities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The amount obtained by multiplying the total cost of remedial action at the site, as determined in the approved plan for subsequent remedial action, by the Federal reimbursement ratio established for the site; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its predecessor agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Offsite disposal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the disposal, and activities that contribute to the disposal, of byproduct material in a location that is not contiguous to the West Chicago Thorium Mill Site located in West Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with a plan approved by, or other written authorization from, the State of Illinois or NRC provided the activities are consistent with the ultimate removal of byproduct material from the West Chicago Thorium Mill Site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plan for subsequent remedial action  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a plan approved by the Department which includes an estimated total cost and schedule for remedial action, and all applicable requirements of remedial action established by NRC or an Agreement State to be performed after December 31, 2002 at an active uranium or thorium processing site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reclamation plan or site reclamation plan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a plan, which has been approved by NRC or an Agreement State, for remedial action at an active processing site that establishes the work necessary to comply with applicable requirements of UMTRCA, or where appropriate with requirements established by an Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

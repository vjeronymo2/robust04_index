			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's rural  waterpower generating capacity has reached more than 2,000 kw,  with an annual electrical energy production of over 59.4 billion  kw.    An on-going meeting on national rural hydropower  construction  revealed that 14 out of 200 counties selected to undergo full  electrification by the State Council in 1991 have now attained  the goal ahead of time.    Over the past three years, rural areas of the country have  added a generating capacity of 3.77 million kilowatts, according  to the meeting.    Also, the total generating capacity of waterpower projects  which are now under construction is expected to reach about 9.6  million kilowatts this year.    Controls on electricity prices for users on rural hydropower  networks have been lifted, and newly-built power stations have  adopted a new price system of capital repayment with interest.    According to the meeting, the nation's total investment in  waterpower construction in 1993 was seven billion yuan.    It also said that agricultural banks throughout the country  provided loans of 8.64 million yuan to build medium- and  small-sized power stations, 6,855 of which have been put into  operation and more than 400 of which are still under  construction.    The focus of the hydro-power construction drive over the  past  few years has been on the development of local electricity  networks and joint stock companies.    More than 40 trans-county regional companies have been set  up, and nearly 150 companies have been reorganized or rebuilt in  line with the share-holding system or joint stock system.    The electrification in recent years has boosted economic  development in rural areas, in mountainous areas in particular.    The average area of irrigated land per capita in the  initially electrified counties increased to nearly half a  hectare, with an average grain output per capita reaching more  than 360 kilograms, according to the meeting.    The electrification drive enabled 33.2 million farmers in  poverty-stricken mountainous areas to use electricity, the  meeting said.</p>

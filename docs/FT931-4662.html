			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: Thick, and proud of it - Television The proletarianisation of British television is proceeding apace. This is, perhaps, no great surprise; after all, television in the US, commercial in tooth and claw from the very beginning, has always been aimed straight - and almost exclusively - at the tabloid market, and in the UK the writing has been on the wall for five years. Like so many politicians, Thatcherites never liked broadcasters whom they saw as unelected troublemakers. When Mrs Thatcher was Prime Minister, Norman Tebbit (so charming, so civilised, so urbane in BBC2's interview with David Dimbleby on Sunday) was set loose to savage the broadcasters as only he knew how, while Mrs T herself listened to the opinions of her favourite mass media mogul, Rupert Murdoch. It was Mr Murdoch who, at the 1989 Edinburgh Television Festival, declared that much of what passed for quality on British television - snobbish old fashioned drama, for instance - was really no more than a reflection of the values of the narrow elite which controlled broadcasting and had always believed that its tastes were synonymous with quality. Just how these pointy-headed snobs tricked the viewing millions into watching Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In The Crown was something he did not explain. He did, however, make it pretty clear that what was needed was a lot more channels like his own, Sky, an opinion which he presumably impressed upon his friend Margaret Hilda. Whether or not we are talking here about direct cause and effect, a few years later we find ourselves with a newly arranged broadcasting system in which Channel 4 has to compete for ratings in a manner which was never previously necessary, and the ITV companies are driven into a vortex of market competition in order to find the money to pay back the millions which they had to bid at auction to acquire their franchises, not to mention the Treasury tax. The BBC meanwhile declares that, as a result of the changes in the industry, it will inevitably lose a third of its audience over the next few years. The outcome, on screen, is that the Reithian principles on which broadcasting in this country has traditionally rested are now being turned upside down. Reith believed that you should aim programmes slightly above the intellectual level of your expected audience and thus keep encouraging people to improve themselves. A growing number of programmes now appearing on our screens do the opposite: rather than helping the audience up, they drag the subject down, seeking a level where it can appeal to the most casual channel zapper. Thus Harry Enfield's Guide To Opera on Channel 4 is got up to look quite literally like a comedy. Enfield and Paul Whitehouse who have been so hugely successful in such double-acts as Smashie and Nicey, the disc jockeys in Harry Enfield's Television Programme, appear here as Dad and Son, a couple of cheeky chappy cockneys (apparently the sort of people we should admire for liking opera) and also as The Opera Ponces who enthuse over the more arcane aspects of opera in public school accents (and therefore, it seems, deserve our contempt). Mr Murdoch should be delighted. The opening episode contained lots of famous extracts, interestingly using Opera North and Paul Daniel as the 'resident' company rather than the ENO or Covent Garden as might have been expected, and it was very funny. Enfield's thumbnail sketch of a typical opera - 'Act 1, bird comes on, warbles . . . Act 3, mixture of snogging and violence . . . Act 4, one of the blokes has a bit of a sing by himself, reads a letter from his mum . . .' was hilariously accurate. Perhaps the series will, indeed, induce some of those who know opera only via the World Cup signature tune and the Three Tenors concert to buy some CDs or even a ticket for an actual performance. But you can hardly miss the dramatic contrast in tone between this series and, say, Civilisation which, though made 25 years ago, has continued to typify - or serve as the great example of - arts programmes on British television until now. Kenneth Clark would not have referred to an opera audience as 'smug gits in dinner jackets', one of several phrases from Enfield which reeked of snobbery, albeit the inverted sort. Would smug gits really become more worthwhile in his eyes if they wore shell suits from C&amp;A? A similar attitude of 'I'm thick and I'm proud of it' has permeated the first two episodes of A Year In Provence on BBC1. In previous years a series about a couple throwing up middle class life in London to live in an old stone farmhouse in southern France would probably have accepted Provencal life on its own terms and enthused over the unfamiliar culture. But that would hardly have held the attention of the channel-hopping soccer fan, would it, so here we get the soccer fan attitude to abroad. Froggies are daft foreigners who insist on speaking a barmy foreign language, they're all wind and show, incapable of sticking to a job for more than a day, and everything from their driving to their weather is deeply doubtful. Subtitles, as Mr Murdoch would doubtless explain, are disgracefully elitist, and so we have two embarrassingly awful substitutes: Lindsay Duncan as the wife translates anything which is spoken in French, so that the dialogue moves at snail's pace, and John Thaw as the husband speaks Franglais: 'Le problem is les pipes. Burstez' or 'Qui est le woman maniac avec le black voiture?' The appeal is to precisely that sort of xenophobic mentality which has become so familiar in recent years from television's coverage of the British soccer fan abroad. The dragging down of the level of appeal is not limited to arts programmes and drama. More and more television journalism is now concerned primarily with entertainment. Much of it, such as Life and CD, as was noted here two weeks ago, is bitty and sensational. Even among more serious programmes such as ITV's Disguises there is a concentration on 'human interest' which is certainly attractive and may at first seem quite reasonable but which proves on subsequent inspection to involve the abandonment of that contextualisation and analysis at which British current affairs programmes had become rather good. For the first two programmes in the Disguises series Adam Holloway has played a schizophrenic living rough and seeking medical help and accommodation. They have provided a vivid illustration of the failure of the 'care in the community' theory which the government used to close down so many wards in mental hospitals. But they have not extended thought beyond that vividness. If this is the evidence on screen a mere 10 weeks after the introduction of the new system, how will matters look after 10 months? It seems clear already that the increase in competition for audiences is going to become keener yet. Perhaps Alan Yentob, who has done such a good job with BBC2 and now been asked to take over BBC1, will manage the amazing feat of improving quality on the corporation's more popular channel without losing too large a proportion of the audience. But that still leaves ITV and Channel 4 to worry about, and of course the satellite and cable networks which - we are now assured - could be offering 500-channel systems, thanks to digital compression, in a matter of months rather than years. The claim has always been that when the technology finally overcomes network scarcity we can all stop griping about programme quality because the choices will be infinitely varied: television, like print, will provide everything from a solid diet of pornography or comic trivia to a balanced diet of grand opera, serious journalism and high quality drama. I wonder.</p>

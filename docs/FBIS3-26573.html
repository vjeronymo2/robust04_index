At that time, Shiyijie had just  "dispensed with using primitive picks to excavate coal and  wicker baskets for miners to carry coal by crawling along the  tunnel on all fours." With the help of pneumatic drills and  electric carts, they had managed to "create" an output of 1.688  tonnes per worker per shift -- a record high across China.    The "mechanization" of the Shiyijie coal mine was worthy of  representing the Chinese coal industry's level of modernization  in the early 1960's. At that time, some developed countries  already had begun to adopt comprehensive coal mining technology,  which integrates coal drilling, the haulage system, and shaft  support in a single, systematic operation. In China, however,  only some individual mines were equipped with mechanized coal  mining equipment imported from the USSR. To Chinese miners,  comprehensive coal mining was, beyond a doubt, a dream that  would come true only in the remote future.    Shiyijie today serves very well to demonstrate the level of  modernization in China's coal mines with its entirely new  feature: The degree of mechanization is 100 percent, with  comprehensive mining having replaced pneumatic drills. Last  year, the Shiyijie coal mine, which has entered the aging  period, continued to turn out 4.141 tonnes per worker per shift.    Today, modern mines like Shiyijie have spread all over  China.  By the end of 1992, the degree of mechanization in China's key  coal mines had reached 72 percent, of which comprehensive mining  equipment accounted for 40 percent, and four mines enjoyed an  annual output of more than 2 million tonnes. The highest level  of output exceeded 8 tonnes per worker per shift. This showed  that the modernization level of China's coal industry was next  only to the United States and Australia, and had come to the  fore. It is noteworthy that all such comprehensive mining  equipment was made in China, and that it has been exported to  the United States.    Of course, the task is still heavy and the road ahead  remains  a long one for the modernization of China's coal industry. The  degree of modernization in local state-owned mines, which  account for 17 percent of China's total coal output, remains at  25 percent as of today, whereas the degree of mechanization of  many town and township coal mines, the output of which is equal  to that of key state-owned coal mines, has reached the degree of  mechanization the Shiyijie coal mine achieved 30 years ago. In  1993, China's coal output was 1.14 billion tonnes; the industry  had 7 million workers and staffers; and the efficiency rate was  1.4 tonnes per worker per shift, which was lower than that of  Shiyijie 30 years before. Australia, in contrast, turned out 210  million tonnes of crude coal in 1990, the whole industry had  only 29,970 workers and staffers, and output was 24 tonnes per  worker per shift.    The fundamental way to change this 1.4:24 ratio is to  achieve  mechanization, cut the number of workers, and improve  efficiency. The Ministry for Coal Industry recently set out that  from now on, the level of mine mechanization must maintain an  annual 2-3 percent growth rate, while the work efficiency of all  personnel must improve by 5 percent each year.</p>

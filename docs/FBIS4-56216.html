			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Radio Rebelde answering machine calls with host Roberto </F> Cavada -- passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] [Cavada] I have a caller in connection with the  Miami far right attacks against Lawyer Magda Montiel. Good  morning.    [First unidentified speaker] Good morning, Cavada. I wish  the  Miami people were listening to Radio Rebelde right now to tell  them that the Cuban people are very proud to have welcomed Mrs.  Montiel to Cuba. She is an honorable woman and she is  demonstrating right now the character of Cuban women such as  Mariana Grajales. She is righteous, and will not let anyone  intimidate her.    Something else. I want to tell [Tomas Garcia] Fuste and that  fat, bald, and blabber-mouth Angelito [Martin] guy, both of whom  had Fidel dead and buried, that even if that were to happen and  if our commander in chief was dead, we would be the first ones  who would not let the likes of them set foot in Cuba. They are  fascists, and so filled with hate that they will never be able  to live side by side with the Cuban people. We seek love. We do  not seek the hate that permeates them. They even say obscenities  and insult people on the radio. They are a bunch of old bags  that ought to keep quiet and yet they babble a lot.    The Cuban people have to support Magda Montiel, have to  support her so as to let the Miami lot know that we support all  those who came here seeking peace and love among Cubans. That  ought to be stressed day in and day out, Cubans ought to call  the radio so they can see that we are not the bad guys, they are.    [Cavada] Thank you very much. Next, I have several more  calls  to the answering machine. Good morning.    [Second unidentified speaker] "Good morning and thank you  very much for this opportunity. Why does this Cuban lawyer there  -- where human rights, liberty, and freedom of the press,  speech, and movement are so touted -- not present a report to  the Human Rights Commission explaining this problem? They say  that here we violate every human right, yet: What are they doing  right now? Do they not say that there is a lot of freedom, and  that everything is free there. Well, they should also go before  those dubious human rights commissions."    [Perez] "Good morning. My name is Ana Perez from Cerro  Boulevard. I want to give my opinion regarding the interview  with the journalist [as heard] who visited Cuba. I believe that  those who are doing this in Miami are not even Cubans. I have  relatives in Miami. And I believe that my relatives's dearest  hope is to be able to come to Cuba and live together with us  again. I do not believe these people are even Cubans, but  two-bit politicians that want to live off politics and  corruption. I have visited Miami and seen it on the television.  I believe these people are not even Cubans nor love Cuba. They  are shameless people. There is no need to be attacking anyone  there, in addition to everything they do everyday. I think that  what they are doing is abhorrent. Coming to Cuba is no crime."</p>

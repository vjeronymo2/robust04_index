			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> unidentified correspondent on 21 March]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] French and  foreign newspapers are still talking this morning about Germany  and France. Can you tell us something about Franco-German  relationship? What is the situation like?    [Juppe] Things are going very well indeed. I will tell you a  secret. I spoke on the phone with German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel for half an hour yesterday evening. We discussed the  forthcoming European meetings. There is one in Brussels  tomorrow, and another over the weekend [26-27 March] in Greece.  We want France and Germany to have a common position. Bilateral  ties are doing well at the level of foreign ministers, prime  minister and chancellor or president. So, what are the reasons  which made you ask such a question? First, in a bilateral  relationship, this does not mean that sometimes you can't have  different opinions. This happens to couples, as we know. We are  absolutely determined to preserve the link between Germany and  France. It is the foundation for construction of the European  Union [EU]. There are no problems, either in France or in  Germany. But sometimes we have different opinions. Second,  elections are being held in Germany. When there are elections,  there can be an internal debate and sometimes it is about the  relations between France and Germany. But I am absolutely  convinced that nothing really important has changed -- both as  far as the people are concerned and, more importantly, as far as  real issues are concerned.</p>

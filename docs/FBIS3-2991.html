Being listed as Japan's 36th appointed foreign securities  market marks the major progress which Shanghai Stock Exchange  (SSE) has made in integrating with the world market.    Under Japanese securities laws and regulations, its  individual investors are only allowed to buy and sell in  appointed overseas markets, which are selected by the national  securities association and approved by the Japanese Government.    The other approved markets include the big securities  exchanges in New York, London and Amsterdam.    The move not only opens the door for Japanese investors to  try their luck in Shanghai, but also makes it possible for  Japan-registered trust funds to invest in Shanghai and for  Shanghai-listed companies to raise money by issuing stocks in  Japan.    Under the current Chinese situation, Japanese investors are  limited to "B" shares on the Shanghai exchange.    Encouraged by Nomura Securities Co. Ltd, one of the four  largest in Japan, the three-year-old SSE applied for the status  last December, and was approved within two months, after an  overall field inspection made by Japanese experts.    The approval has set two records: it is for the youngest  exchange so far and the fastest process of approval.    To date, Shanghai equity market has 148 listed enterprises,  501 member securities companies and more than 5 million  registered investors. With the highest daily transaction of  over 3.9 billion yuan, the SSE has stocks totalling over 260  billion yuan in market price being traded.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Forecasts Sir, Gordon Mitchell (Letters, June 14), invites the Financial Times to publish forecasts of share prices. But that is exactly what the FT does. Need I remind him that in the absence of non-public information the best forecast of tomorrow's price is today's price? I hope Mr Mitchell is not wasting his money trying to guess which companies will outperform the market. Nobody should be picking individual shares now that the superiority of a diversified portfolio is well-established. Roland Davis, Woodcot, Brook St, Cucksfield, W Sussex</p>

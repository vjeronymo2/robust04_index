			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Almos Kovacs, vice president of the </F> Hungarian National Bank, by Gabor Ferencz; place and date not  given: "To Curb Inflation Through Self-Restraint?"]    [Text] Almos Kovacs, vice president of the Hungarian  National Bank, expects inflation to decline this year. In his  opinion, the inflation rate this year will only be about 17  percent. An economist, he believes that changes in wages play a  key role in the development of inflation. Therefore, employees  are no better off when their trade unions focus attention on  higher nominal wages. When interviewed by our reporter, Almos  Kovacs dwelt on the inflationary threat that compensation poses.  His conclusion is that the extent of this threat is inversely  proportional to the compensation notes' quoted price on the  stock exchange.    [Ferencz] When economic research institutes and central  agencies prepare their inflation forecasts, they often arrive at  different conclusions. How exact are the methods of estimating  the inflation rate?    [Kovacs] In the final outcome, the inflation rate is a  weighted average that reflects the rise of various types of  costs. Hence it follows that, when estimating the inflation  rate, certain assumptions must be made regarding the changes in  costs--including wages, interest rates, taxes, and imports.  Changes in wages play an eminent role in calculating the  inflation rate. Namely, the changes in wages affect inflation  not only through the changes in production costs, but also  through changes in consumer demand. Interestingly, during the  past three years--even though central wage regulation had  ceased--very accurate estimates have been made of the  development of wages, and of the extent of the resulting  inflationary pressure. The market mechanisms appear to be  working well in this area: Wages have not "run away" in the  competitive sector.    [Ferencz] In Hungary, are the effects of wages on inflation  the same as in textbook economies?    [Kovacs] Superficially, the proportion of wages among the  costs would not seem excessively high. But in the final outcome,  if there were no import, the rise of every cost could be traced  back to changes in the costs of the primary factors, namely  capital and labor. This is a classical Marxian theorem, but it  happens to be true.    [Ferencz] Then will it depend on the employees'  self-restraint whether or not inflation takes off?    [Kovacs] The economy's gross domestic product, or rather the  proportions of earned incomes and capital incomes within it,  determines the level of real wages. Thus our only option is  whether real wages are obtained at a lower or higher rate of  inflation, and hence at nominal wages expressed in smaller or  larger numbers. The trade unions are not giving up anything even  when they accept smaller increases in nominal wages, because the  inflation rate will be lower and thus the same increase in real  wages will be realized. It is worth noting that in  Hungary--despite all appearances to the contrary--the proportion  of earned incomes within GDP has increased considerably since  1990, while the proportion of capital incomes has declined  substantially! Which shows that the employees' situation  relatively improved, while GDP declined.    [Ferencz] How does the forint's devaluation affect  inflation?  According to a frequently cited rule of thumb, every percentage  point of devaluation raises the inflation rate by half a  percentage point.    [Kovacs] This rule is based on the assumption that the  higher  costs resulting from devaluation are reflected in the prices and  are then passed on. But the question is whether this rise in  costs actually has a ripple effect? It is indisputable that  imported materials become more expensive after a devaluation.  However, it is not so certain that the prices of finished  products containing also import materials will likewise rise.  For a rise in the prices of such finished products depends also  on changes in other factor costs (including wages, among  others). What happened in Italy in 1992 is very edifying:  Despite a devaluation of the lira by more than 20 percent, the  inflation rate was lower than in the preceding year. Behind this  was the trade unions' self-restraint. They realized that, in  order to maintain the country's competitiveness and preserve  jobs, they had to accept a redistribution of incomes favoring  the exporting industries.    [Ferencz] Usually compensation is included among the factors  causing inflation. Is not the effect of the mass of compensation  notes, by now more than 100 billion forints' worth, the same as  printing money?    [Kovacs] Let us assume one extreme: None of the recipients  of  compensation want state assets, all the compensation notes are  converted into cash, which is then spent on consumer goods. In  this case the cash (the proceeds from the sale of the  compensation notes at the quoted market price, and not the  notes' combined total face value) constitutes additional  purchasing power and generates inflation. If some of the  recipients of compensation use their notes to buy state assets,  the inflationary effect will be that much smaller. But the  critical question is whether the purchasers of compensation  notes, who then use those notes to buy state assets, are  deferring their consumption? If they are, then aggregate demand  will increase only slightly or not at all, and inflationary  pressure will subside. And if we assume the other extreme--that  the investors defer their consumption by exactly as much as the  recipients of compensation who sold their note increase theirs;  or that all the investors are foreigners--it may even be said  that the inflation rate does not increase at all. Obviously, the  real case lies somewhere between these two extremes.    [Ferencz] Does this mean that the lower the market price of  compensation notes, the smaller the threat of inflation?    [Kovacs] In the final outcome, yes. In my opinion, however,  it is not at all the state's intention to suppress the market  price of compensation notes. After all, the expansion of the  scope of assets that can be bought with compensation notes has  the exact opposite effect.    [Ferencz] Will the state budget's rising deficit not cancel  the optimistic estimates of the inflation rate?    [Kovacs] As a percentage of GDP, the state budget's deficit  will be lower than last year. A large deficit is undesirable  primarily because it ties down savings in the economy, diverting  them from the entrepreneurial sphere. The deficit's magnitude in  itself is not an inflation-generating factor. What leads to  inflation is the deficit's increase, at least an increase of the  deficit as a percentage of GDP. When the budgetary deficit as a  percentage of GDP increases from one year to the next, this  indicates a rise in aggregate demand, which is a potential  inflationary threat. In any case, it produces negative effects.  However, we cannot automatically conclude even from this that  the inflation rate will rise; because domestic savings could  also increase--that was the situation in Hungary in 1992--or  import could expand--as happened in 1993--and, instead of the  inflation rate's rise, the balance of payments could worsen and  the structure of demand could change unfavorably.    [Ferencz] What can be said of the domestic inflation rate's  trend? The rate's steady decline that was typical of previous  years seems to have stopped.    [Kovacs] Hungary's inflation in recent years stemmed to a  decisive extent from the fact that price ratios had to change.  In theory, of course, this can also be accomplished in such a  way that some prices decline, other rise, and the price level  remains unchanged. But this has never succeeded in practice. In  most areas, however, the price increases were commensurate with  the cost increases and with the dismantling of price subsidies.  These factors could fully explaine the price increases, and an  inflationary spiral of the Latin American type was not  triggered. From which it also follows that henceforth the rise  in consumer prices is able to be in line with the change in  producer prices. During the past two years--due to a number of  factors that include, for instance, also the change in VAT  [value-added tax] rates--there has developed an estimated  10-percent difference between the rise in producer and consumer  prices, respectively. But this year we do not have to reckon  with such "deflecting" effects. Consequently, the inflation rate  could even drop as low as 17 percent.</p>

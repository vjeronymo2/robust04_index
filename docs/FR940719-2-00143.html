AAI and the Plan represent that the Plan trustees have determined that the proposed transactions are in the best interests of Plan participants, and are consistent with the policies and purpose of the Plan as recited in various Plan documents, including its registration statement. In this regard, AAI and the Plan represent that the Plan trustees have determined that the Fund's Money Market Portfolio has substantially the same investment objectives as the Plan's money market investment portfolio and, likewise, that the Fund's Total Return Portfolio has substantially the same investment objectives as the Plan's balanced portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. AAI and the Plan represent that Plan participants will benefit from the fact that the expense of liquidating Plan assets, purchasing Fund shares with cash, and reinvesting the cash in substantially the same assets, would be avoided. AAI and the Plan further represent that, to the extent that the Plan trustees have determined that the Fund's Money Market Portfolio and Total Return Portfolio should replace the Plan's current money market portfolio and balanced portfolio, respectively, the proposed transactions would greatly diminish the expense of this replacement to Plan participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41. AAI and the Plan represent that the proposed transactions are consistent with the provisions of ERISA regarding reporting and disclosure, participation and vesting, funding, fiduciary responsibility, administration and enforcement that are applicable to defined contribution plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42.

AAI and the Plan request an order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the Plan to purchase certain classes of shares of the Fund with investment securities of the Plan.

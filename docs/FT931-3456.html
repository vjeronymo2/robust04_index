			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Assault on the state's frontiers: The privatisation of French industry will accelerate sharply if, as expected, the conservative parties form the next government The French state's industrial frontiers have slowly, sometimes painfully, receded over the past decade as economic deregulation has started to take root in what has long been one of Europe's most interventionist countries. The conservative team expected to succeed the Socialist government after the general election at the end of this month is preparing to surrender yet more of the state's role as a manager and owner of industry. Just how far the alliance of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF is prepared to let go will set the tone for French industry pol-icy for the life of the next government. Conservative advisers are putting the finishing touches to an ambitious privatisation programme to raise up to FFr200bn (Pounds 25.1bn) over four to five years according to the most optimistic opposition plans. It will mark a sharp acceleration of the partial privatisations under the Socialists, worth FFr16bn last year, and aims to complete the privatisations started by the conservatives during their last government from 1986 to 1988, when FFr120bn worth of state companies were sold. All state-owned banks, insurers and industrial companies will be on the block, promises the opposition. The candidates for the first round of sales include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group; Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company; and Banque Nationale de Paris, the second-largest state-owned bank. All three of these groups are already partly privatised and performing well. One of the three big state insurers, UAP, AGF or GAN, is also expected in the initial batch of sales. The government will choose the rest of the disposals from the uncompleted privatisations on its 1986 hit list of 65 companies, of which 29 were sold. The list includes stars such as Pechiney in aluminium and packaging, which is already quoted on the stock market. But there are already some industrial headaches like Bull, the loss-making computer group which last week announced a FFr4.7bn loss for 1992, and Thomson, the struggling electronics company. There will also, say opposition advisers, be one important new candidate not on the 1986 list: Renault, the carmaker, which three years ago started on the road to privatisation by exchanging minority stakes with Volvo, the Swedish automotive group. The privatisation of Renault would be an important step in the decline of interventionism because the group has been used as a crucible of industrial and social policy experiments by successive postwar governments. 'We have no doubt that Renault will come on to the market, perhaps after the first wave of new privatisations. It is highly symbolic and also happens to be one of the state's best assets,' says Mr Willy Douin, president of CS First Boston France, the Paris branch of the Swiss merchant bank. The actual candidates will be published in a privatisation law, to be presented to the national assembly in the spring. Partial privatisations of state utilities such as France Telecom and Electricite de France are also under study, although these are thought to be a few years off. The threat of recession facing the French economy means this round of privatisations will be more difficult at first than the last round of wholesale sell-offs. This took place over an economically euphoric 14 months, ended by the 1987 stock market crash and the conservatives' political defeat. Yet the signs are that the new sell-off candidates could pass more completely into the private sector than the last lot. In many cases, the former right-wing government managed to keep some control of privatised companies by selling stakes in them to so-called noyaux durs or hard cores of companies owned by Gaullist RPR party support-ers. The Socialists tried to dismantle these groups by enlarging the ownership of state companies, although they maintain the principle that some kind of national control is needed. The Socialist-appointed chairman of Renault, Mr Louis Schweitzer, for example, argues that his company must remain majority French-controlled, if privatised. But this time, it will be harder to press-gang noyaux durs into action. Corporate France has less spare cash in these tough economic times than in the late 1980s. The growth in foreign investment in French companies means their boards now have to concentrate more on increasing earnings than keeping on the right side of their political friends. Some noyaux durs members received a poor return on their investments in the last round of privatisations - both in profits and power - and so are cautious over being drawn in again. Big French corporate investors in new privatisations, therefore, will be motivated more by industrial, rather than political logic. One example is Alcatel Alsthom, the privatised telecommunications and engineering group, whose chairman, Mr Pierre Suard, is close to the RPR. He says he is interested in taking a stake in France Telecom, the state telecommunications operator. Other privatisation candidates might use this opportunity to speed up their strategy of seeking share exchanges with foreign partners, like BNP and its existing German partner, Dresdner Bank. Despite the problems, few doubt that the privatisations will get off the ground, cautiously at first because of the fragility of the Paris stock market's recovery since the beginning of the year, but faster as the economy picks up. The programme is likely to be successful for two reasons. First, the political will is there. The new government is likely to get a record majority in the national assembly and should be able to impose its policies with ease. Second, there is more than enough pent-up demand. France's top industrial companies are far less represented on the Paris stock exchange than their competitors are on their domestic markets. The capitalisation of the Paris stock market is equivalent to just 30 per cent of gross domestic product, less than half the 65 per cent of US GDP represented by US stock markets, estimates CS First Boston. On the political front, Mr Edouard Balladur, who as former finance minister masterminded the last round of right - wing privatis-ations and might be the next prime minister, believes the process is essential. He argues that it will make it easier for former state sector companies to raise capital independently of the cash-strapped state; that it will encourage more efficient management; and that the proceeds from the programme will help the government fund the tax cuts needed to stimulate France's flagging economy. Privatisation is prominent on the joint RPR-UDF election manifesto, where it commands more of a consensus among an otherwise divided coalition than other economic matters, such as monetary policy. This is no surprise, for Mr Balladur's sell-offs were one of the few real successes of the last conservative government. On the demand side, the opposition has several reasons to be optimistic. First there is the FFr1,300bn of mainly private investors' savings now sitting in lightly taxed Sicav money market funds. A lot of that cash is likely to be seeking a new home in future, because the ceiling below which Sicav disposals are tax-free was reduced in January from FFr317,000 to FFr158,000 a year. For the first time in three years, the total invested in Sicavs has started to fall, also helped by the launch of a tax-exempt equity savings plan. A fall in interest rates, plus the extra tax breaks for long-term private investments promised by the opposition, would push more of French households' savings into equities. Foreign institutional investors will be another big source of demand, if they continue to increase their exposure to the French stock market. According to the Banque de France, 28 per cent of French publicly quoted shares are now in foreign hands, up from 21 per cent two years ago. If foreign investors believe, as most analysts in Paris do, that the opposition will be able to hold the line on the 'franc fort' policy, they will have a clear interest in buying more shares in well-managed privatisations on the brink of recovery. What is unclear is just how much the new government will be able to curb the temptation to meddle in its newly privatised companies. 'French industry is still run by members of a small elite who move in and out of industry and pol-itics,' explains a US securities analyst. He adds: 'They need to purge the system, because it is so alien to what their competitors are doing, but they are not ready to let go.' Here the opposition is divided both on generational lines and between the free-market UDF and the more interventionist RPR. Some of the older leaders still believe in a degree of state intervention, while young reformers, among them Mr Alain Madelin, former UDF industry minister, are strong upholders of free markets. An important test of whether or not the urge to intervene has receded will be just how many Socialist-appointed public sector company chairman the conservatives decide to throw out after the election. At least half a dozen bosses of state companies will be particularly anxious about the first few weeks of the next French government.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- French privatisation: stepping up sales  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock performance of French privatised companies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    Date of     Share price at  Current        Absolute                 privatisation  privatisation  Share price  performance                                                               per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Saint Gobain       Nov 1986        310            541             74.5 Alcatel-Alsthom  April 1987        323            656            103.1 Havas              May 1987        187            471            151.9 Societe Generale   Jun 1987        407            654             60.7 Suez              Sept/Nov 1987    261            305             16.9 Paris CAC Generale  Nov 1986       383.6          528.5           37.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CS First Boston, France  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Some of the leading companies proposed for privatisation by 1986-88 right wing government but not sold off yet  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Bull * Pechiney * Rhone-Poulenc * Elf Aquitaine * Thomson * L'Union des assurances de Paris * Group des Assurances generales de France * Banque nationale de Paris * Credit Lyonnais  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

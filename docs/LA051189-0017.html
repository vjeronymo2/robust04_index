			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: COLLEAGUES SORT GLAMOUR ITEMS FOR SALE  </P> <P> The Colleagues and their two support groups, Les Amies and C.H.I.P.S., are  prepping for their 34th Glamour Sale from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the  Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. President Marjory Miller and the three co-chairs  -- Patsy Stecher, Katrina Cord and Margaret Vandegrift -- have been busily  sorting Chanels, Adolfos and couture by Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and David  Hayes. The 60 members hope to net more than $200,000 for Children's Institute  International from sales of jewelry, antiques, furniture, art and clothes.  </P> <P> Last week, though, the Colleagues were feted when Gianmaria Buccellati and his  wife, Rosie, and his handsome offspring darted into Beverly Hills to open their  French paneled jewelry salon at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, amidst teas and  black-tie dinners.  </P> <P> The Colleagues got the bid for dinner. Elegant it was with Buccellati handmade  silver pheasants and seals and gold flowers set among the centerpieces on  Italian linens. In the swank crowd: Marilyn McDaniel, Joan and John Hotchkis,  Erlenne and Dr. Norman Sprague, Gen. Gywnn and Natalie Robinson, Onnalee and  William Doheny, Amen Wardy, Ann and Frank Johnson, Patricia Sheinbaum, Giney  Milner, Flora Thornton, Italian Consul General Alberto and Suzy Boniver.  </P> <P> RED-LETTER DATE: Mannequins of the Assistance League of Southern California  entertain at their "Afternoon With Eve" California tea, Elizabeth Arden fashion  show and presentation of honorees Wednesday at a Holmby Hills estate.  </P> <P> Mannequin chair Terry Francis and benefit chair Linda Blackburn are completing  details with Katie Osterloh and Barbara Karl, awards chairmen.

The foundation's Founding Associates hosted the  event. Gala chairman Bonnie Green and Dorothy Kirsten French, founder of the  foundation (and the wife of the late John Douglas French, who died recently  after years with Alzheimer's), proudly revealed an estimated net of $200,000.  </P> <P> Dudley Moore at the piano was extraordinarily funny, as was Norm Crosby with  his malapropisms ("Mothers should be put on a pedestrian"). Pia Zadora was the  finale, bringing on her 4-year-old, Katie (she wants to be a rock star), for  some songs and a deep bow. When host Alex Trebek joked that he had never been  served such a generous portion of beef (some were asking for doggie bags), he  noted that Marty Paseta was commenting, "My cholesterol is about 465 tonight  after this."  </P> <P> Dorothy Kirsten French invited Sen. Pete and Gayle Wilson to sit with her, and  at the same table were dinner chairman Roy and Betty Anderson. Adjacent were  Richard and Eileen Eamer, big supporters, and their guests Lester and Carolbeth  Korn.  </P> <P> All night, Founding Associates chairman Catherine Chester moved non-stop on  arrangements, and so did Betty Resnick and Genevieve McSweeney. In the crowd:  Bill Siart, Hannah Carter, Dody and Otis Booth and Eleanor Wasson, who is  moving to Santa Cruz soon. Guests left with favors -- little china heart-shaped  dishes etched with forget-me-nots to tie in with the foundation's motto,  "Forget not those who cannot remember."  </P> <P> ENOUGH TENT: Is there enough tenting?

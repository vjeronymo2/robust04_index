			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: Different view of relationship between CAP reform and Gatt Sir, Your editorial 'Time for a Gatt deal' (May 26) and several of your preceding stories have misled readers in terms of the relationship between Common Agricultural Policy reform and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. First, the CAP reform does not reduce subsidies to EC farmers; it changes the form in which the income transfers occur. Its major impact should be to increase domestic consumption of cereals and livestock products and reduce the need for ever increasing subsidised exports. Second, the reformed CAP is not distinctly better than US policies regarding distortion of production. The US programmes froze yields used to calculate deficiency payments in 1985. In the 1990 Farm Bill and Budget Act, payments are limited to 85 per cent of acreage covered by the programme. Moreover, US producers can get payments without producing any of the crops in question (0-92 provision). Thus, the US programme results in a significant output of programme crops which receives no payments. Finally, the CAP reform was a necessary and significant change in EC policy for internal reasons which moved in the direction the US began in the 1960s. Why should it exempt the EC from agreeing to international rules on reductions any more than US reforms exempt the US from such rules? The CAP reform should make it easier (not harder) for the EC to accept the limits on export subsidies and internal support suggested by the Dunkel proposal. (Reductions in producer support since 1986-88, together with the set-aside, should enable the community to meet the proposed 20 per cent cut in internal support with only modest changes even if compensation for future price cuts is included.) To suggest that the EC subsidies should be exempt from cuts is to miss the point of the entire Gatt negotiation which is about reducing support and protection.

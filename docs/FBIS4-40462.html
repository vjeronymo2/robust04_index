			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Lantsman under the "Reform" rubric: </F> "Machine Builders Press for Pro-Inflation Measures To Save Them  From Structural Reform"]    [Text] According to the forecasts of the Russian  Federation Government Working Center for Economic Reforms, the  tendency for inflation to stabilize at 8 percent of GDP will  persist no longer than 1.5 or 2 months. In midsummer the  government is "sure to take a series of pro-inflation measures  to rescue the country's machine building industry." This was  announced by Sergey Pavlenko, head of the Working Center, at a  press conference at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel.    In addition to the supposed government measures, some other  factors too point to increased inflation, Pavlenko said. For  example, cash emission went up by a factor of 2.5 or 3 in April.  Nevertheless, the three-month financial stabilization yielded  indisputably positive results. First and foremost it gave the  population an opportunity to adapt to economic change. A normal  reaction by citizens can be seen in the growing sums in savings  accounts, control of which is confidently switching from the  Russian Federation Savings Bank to commercial banks (the Savings  Bank share has fallen to 50 percent). The population's trust in  the government's financial policy can also be seen, according to  Mr. Pavlenko, in the lower proportion of hard currency savings.  According to Sergey Vasilyev's [as published] forecast, if the  existing draft budget is adopted for implementation the  population will continue to have faith in the financial policy  of the state and the future inflationary surge will not exceed  the 10 percent of GDP ceiling planned for the year's end.    Assessing the aftermath of the production crisis in Russia,  Mr. Pavlenko pointed out that, despite the psychological shock  the government experienced at the absolute figures for the  production decline in January, the crisis reflects what is now a  definite pattern -- a decrease at the start of the year, some  recovery of production in May through June, another decline in  the fall, and a rise toward the year's end. Today, according to  the Working Center, there is a slight recovery in the fuel and  energy complex, in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, and in  some sectors geared to the consumer market. The steady negative  indicators in machine building are natural and point to the need  for structural reform. The important thing, the Working Center  experts think, is for Chernomyrdin's cabinet not to panic.    Analyzing the current state of the Russian economy,  Professor  Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, who is in  charge of a group of foreign advisers at the Working Center,  pointed out that the main problem with the state budget is  insufficient tax revenue. Budget revenue in the first quarter  of the current year was 36 percent of the planned level.  Assessing the real consumption figures, Mr. Layard said there  is insufficient official information. According to the method  used by the State Committee for Statistics (real incomes minus  real savings), social consumption has grown 11 percent. If you  rely on the results of a households study, the figure will be 18  percent in the first quarter of the year.    Analyzing the labor market, Mr. Layard stated that Russia  has  discovered a unique method of regulating unemployment. Open  unemployment has not grown more than 1 percent this year. The  main levers to regulate it are the great differentiation of  wages in various sectors and methods of latent unemployment  (enforced vacations and shorter workweeks). In the first  quarter shorter workdays affected 2 percent of people in  employment, and enforced vacations affected 4.4 percent. As  little as 1.5 percent were affected by personnel reductions out  of 25 percent of the total number employed in production.  During the same period, the number of people hired for jobs  amounted to 21 percent of number already in employment. For the  time being enterprises are managing to preserve jobs by cutting  wages. But this tendency, Mr. Layard thinks, will not last  long. Then open unemployment will grow, but it will be lower  than in the Eastern European countries, the English professor  hopes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan will send former  Ambassador to the United States Nobuo Matsunaga to Paris as a  special government envoy to attend a forthcoming ministerial  meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD), a trade ministry official said Friday [3  June].    Matsunaga will attend the two-day conference, which begins  next Tuesday, in place of the three cabinet ministers who have  been forced to skip the OECD meeting due to a tight  parliamentary schedule, the official at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry said.    It has been customary for Japan to send the chiefs of MITI,  the Foreign Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency to the  annual OECD meeting.    All of the Group of Seven major industrial countries except  Japan will dispatch cabinet ministers to this year's gathering,  which will focus on three key topics of growth and employment,  reinforcing multilateral trade systems and a new role of the  OECD amid the rapid change in the international situation.</p>

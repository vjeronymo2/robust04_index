			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hertz faces legal action over daily surcharges HERTZ, the leading car rental company in the US, is facing legal action from New York City and New York State over its decision to impose a daily surcharge on renters in four of the five NYC boroughs, writes Nikki Tait. The two authorities allege the surcharge represents illegal discrimination and will weigh unfairly on areas where there are large ethnic groups. Hertz claims its action reflects the underlying cost situation - with rentals from these areas tending to result in more accidents and suits from pedestrians and others injured.</p>

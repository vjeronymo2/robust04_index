			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A police officer, Captain Kobus Chappies Klopper,  who has been identified by police sources as the informer known  as Q who alleged the involvement of three police generals in a  so-called third force, has denied being the person involved.  This is according to an English-language morning newspaper.  The paper quotes him as saying he will deny that he is Q, and  that he will also deny all allegations against him. However,  police sources maintain that it is Captain Klopper who provided  the information. Captain Klopper says it is irresponsible of  these sources to make him the scapegoat, and of newspapers to  publish his name.</p>

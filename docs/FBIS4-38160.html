			<p>BFN     [Text] The deputies of the Islamic Action Front [IAF] have  reiterated their principled rejection of negotiations with the  Zionist enemy.    In a statement on the resumption of the Jordanian-Israeli  negotiations in Washington and the agreements signed by the  trilateral Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee, the deputies said  they think the sub-agendas reached in Washington reflect a  Jordanian retreat from the constant principles stressed time and  again by Jordanian officials. These principles stipulate  rejecting a unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab  character of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return to  their country and territories from which they were expelled by  the usurper Jews.    The statement warned against making the same mistake as the  Palestinian negotiator by throwing himself into the lap of the  Zionist entity. It also warned of falling into the trap of  Jewish deceit.    The statement also asserted the IAF's condemnation and  rejection of the approach being pursued by the Jordanian  Government contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian people,  who reject all these concessions. The opinion of the Jordanian  people and their representatives of the negotiations was not  sought, even though these negotiations target their land,  destiny, and the future of their generations.    The statement added that the agendas stemming from the  meetings of the trilateral committee represent clear recognition  of the Zionist entity and its right to security, stability, as  well as to the region's waters, resources, and chaste land.  These agendas also reflect recognition of international borders  and joint maps which we teach to our sons on which the State of  Israel appears. This is what the Jews have been dreaming of for  thousands of years.    The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party and the  Jordanian People's Democratic Party, HASHD, have also issued a  statement in which they said the sub-agendas divide the Security  Council resolution, give Israel the right to interpret this  resolution the way it wants, and abandon the principle of a  comprehensive solution on the basis of land for peace, regaining  the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and the  national rights of the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese people in  the occupied Arab territories.    The statement said these sub-agendas confirm beyond any  shadow of a doubt that relinquishing sovereignty issues is  continuing. This applies to waters, security, and territory.  Normalization has also started by transferring the negotiations  to the field without Israel making a commitment to implement  Security Council Resolution 242, especially with regard to  withdrawal from all the 1967-occupied territories, including  Jerusalem.    The statement called for canceling the Jordanian-Israeli  agenda as an indispensable step to restructure the negotiating  process on foundations that truly respond to the resolutions of  international legitimacy.    The statement urged the people, their institutions, and  political forces to stand up to the the agreements of submission  and normalization to preserve the independence and sovereignty  of the country.    The Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party also issued a  statement in which it said: At a time when we were expecting to  consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination between our  beloved Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious,  decisive stage of the peace talks -- to which the Arabs were  dragged since the Madrid conference -- and after their positions  were weakened by the Oslo accord, the new Jordanian position to  resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as  a destructive turning point for the Arab position on its  stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front.    The front said that our Jordanian people were surprised at  this dangerous turning point which was peddled while the people  were preoccupied with what preceded the recent cabinet reshuffle  and while they were listening to their statements about further  coordination and cohesion between Syria and Jordan. They,  themselves, have stated that this coordination enhances the Arab  negotiating stand to a level that can force the occupiers to  submit to the international legitimacy resolutions and withdraw  from all the occupied Arab territories.    The new stand of the Jordanian Government, whose head had  led  the negotiations before he assumed the premiership, constitutes  an imminent threat to Jordan and the Palestinian cause and harms  the cooperation and coordination between the Arab brothers in  Syria and Lebanon.    The statement added that it is as ridiculous as it is  lamentable to justify the Jordanian policy of rushing toward  capitulation to the occupier on the pretext of fear that  Jordan's role will be marginalized. What role do we fear will  be marginalized, and what national rights will we save by giving  in to the will of the usurpers of Palestine and to the pressure  of those who adopt two yardsticks, those whose pressure and  interference are rejected and condemned even by Haiti?    Our Jordanian people are well aware that when those who  flout  their will and encroach on their dignity speak about Jordan's  interest, they mean only their personal interests. For these  people, Jordan is a plantation and not a homeland, and the  Jordanians subjects and not citizens.    The Jordanian government's new policy will lead us to an  inevitable national catastrophe. Jordan, in terms of people and  land, has no interest in disavowing its brothers. On the  contrary, its interest lies in aligning and coordinating its  steps and policies with those of its brothers in Syria. The  statement called on all political parties and figures, and on  national groupings and institutions to decisively and  courageously ward off this catastrophe to save Jordan from what  is being planned for it in the dark mazes of deviation and  humiliating capitulation.    In a statement it issued on the Jordanian-Israeli agreement,  the central committee of Fatah-the Uprising said:    1. The agreement is in response to the Zionist-U.S.  conditions and pressures on Jordan, which have escalated since  the announcement of the Oslo conspiracy.    2. It is in response to the Zionist-American enemy's efforts  to consolidate the liquidatory Oslo-Cairo conspiracy and to  incorporate Jordan and the agent authority in Gaza and Jericho  into the Zionist vital space and its security and economic  program called the economic triangle. This means an official  Jordanian participation in this hostile U.S.-Zionist project.    3. The agreement is a new U.S. and Zionist penetration of  the  Arab nation's front and has weakened and confused the opposition  forces within our nation, thus facilitating separate dealings  with each of Syria and Lebanon.    4. The agreement impairs and violates the nation's security  and its national interests and constants, not to mention that it  greatly harms the nation's present and future.    5. The agreement greatly harms the Jordanian people's  political, economic, and social achievements.    6. By acknowledging the mandate borders with the Zionist  entity, the Jordanian government recognizes the enemy's  occupation and usurpation of Palestine, harms our people's  national rights, and abandons Jerusalem's Arab affiliation.</p>

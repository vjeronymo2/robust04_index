			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Can Tories deal themselves a fifth ace?: Britain's two main parties are plotting the next hand of electoral poker. Perhaps they have something up their sleeves . . . As a wise old Conservative owl remarked over dinner this week, four aces will be played at the next general election. Two are held by Labour. We know what they are without taking a peek. They have a popular leader, and most voters have had more than enough of the Tories. The two other killer cards are in John Major's hands. His government will cut taxes, and fly the Euro-sceptical flag. That concludes your weekend executive summary of the current condition of British politics. It will need changing if Tony Blair loses his magnetism, as wise-owl thought the Labour leader was beginning to do in the debate on the Queen's speech on Wednesday. We will have to think again if the Conservative coalition really does break up over Europe, as opposed to merely threatening such a disaster. Apart from that no other aces can be found in either hand. None. Zilch. Mr Major may remain prime minister, but he is not likely to regain the full measure of authority associated with the office. Grandstand plays such as his threat to dissolve parliament if a particular European finance bill is lost demonstrate weakness, not strength. One fine day Mr Blair may produce a few policies, and thus become vulnerable to attack, but he has so far shown no sign of hazarding anything quite so foolhardy. Like the prime minister, he is busy doing nothing. In short, the outcome of a contest that does not need to be held until the late spring of 1997 is unpredictable. We can see no further than two Labour aces against a pair of Tory aces. Hold on. Poker in any variation is rarely less than a five-card game. What about the 'feelgood factor?' Surely that is a high court card, a king indeed? Possibly. If people are fat and happy, secure in their jobs and confident that their economic circumstances will improve they might stick with the government. Yes yes. If you believe that two more years of steady growth combined with low inflation will turn this traditional indicator Tory-wards, go ahead and factor it in to your calculations. Before doing so, consider a rather different equation, the feelTory factor. This is nothing to do with allegations of improper behaviour. It is more serious than that. Let me explain. Those of us who inhabit the fringes of politics sometimes find themselves in a roomful of Conservatives. On other occasions everyone standing around is, if not socialist, at least a non-Tory. The two experiences are distinct, unmistakably different. It is not only a matter of clothes, accents, champagne, or commonplace manifestations of wealth or lack of it, but of what is said, and the manner of saying it. Conservative chambers contain laughter, politically incorrect phrases that can offend, hints of harshness and cruelty. Labour salons can be serious to the point of dullness, marked by ethnically sensitive use of language, expressive of concern for this or that unfortunate group, sometimes tinged with collectivist menace. The Tories are usually more fun. The tribunes of the people are often nicer. Evidence published this week suggests that many voters feel culturally comfortable among Tories, in spite of their apparent distaste for the government. The numbers are to be found in the 11th British Social Attitudes survey, published by Dartmouth on Thursday. This is a collation of answers to annual questionnaires sent to a random sample of some 3,600 people. Many of the results are unsurprising, indicating that voters want social services (paid for by other people's taxes?), public transport (but cars for themselves) and so on. The chapter that grabbed my attention is about the 'authoritarian personality,' a concept invented in Berkeley, California soon after the second world war. We need not detain ourselves with the historical implications of that. What concerns us today is the set of responses to the 1993 survey. These indicate a general bias against libertarianism and a rejection of values associated with the 1970s left. Asked whether schools should teach children to obey authority, 88 per cent say yes. Censorship of films and magazines is supported by 65 per cent. Homosexual relationships are disapproved of by 64 per cent. Capital punishment is thought right by 65 per cent. By boiling down the answers to all 15 relevant questions Daphne Arendt and Ken Young, the authors of this chapter, create a neat index of hard-nosed attitudes. They conclude that 40 per cent of respondents have a 'most' authoritarian world-view, with 12 per cent 'least' and the rest in the middle. This is an improvement on 1989, when 50 per cent were placed in the 'most' category. As you would guess, younger and better-educated people are more liberal-minded than their older or less-schooled fellow-citizens. The key correlation might also have been anticipated, but it is nevertheless stunning. Of respondents who identify themselves with the Labour party, some 30 per cent are marked with a 'most authoritarian' outlook. The equivalent figure for self-identified Conservatives is 52 per cent. Chew over that for a moment. It is an uncannily good fit with the ambience at Conservative party conferences. It is the measure of the feelTory factor. I suspect that Mr Blair understands this concept. He has positioned himself, and possibly his party, against laxity in schools and in favour of families run by two parents, one of each sex. He is famously tough on crime. Has he got it right? The Arendt-Young account suggests a softening of British attitudes in several important areas, notably welfare benefits. Others who favour traditional attitudes long for order and security. Some accept that neither can be guaranteed. The prime minister comprehends the feelTory factor, but he overdid it with 'back to basics'. There is time to get it right. The party that aligns itself with the values of the 1990s will hold three aces.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Irish party in disarray as 4 MPs resign Ireland's main opposition party, Fine Gael, has been thrown into disarray following a challenge to Mr John Bruton, the party leader, from four frontbenchers within his party. The move comes in the build-up to the European elections and follows the publication of an opinion poll which shows support for the party at its lowest in 70 years, and Mr Bruton trailing all other party leaders in his personal popularity with the electorate. The four frontbenchers asked Mr Bruton to resign on Thursday evening, and when he refused they handed in their own resignations. A parliamentary party meeting is to vote next Tuesday on whether Mr Bruton will continue as leader. If he loses, it will be the third change at the top of the party since 1987. Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support, but since the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January 1993, it has had difficulty deciding whether to become more social democrat in outlook, or turn further to the right. The opinion poll, in the Irish Times last Monday, showed Fine Gael with only 16 per cent support, down from 25 per cent at the time of the last general election in November 1992 when the party lost 10 seats in the Dail (parliament). Mr Bruton, who became party leader in 1990, survived a confidence vote last year. He said yesterday: 'I am defending the integrity of the Fine Gael's party positions. I am fighting for a party that will take a decision, stick to that decision and implement it, in other words for a party that can be taken seriously.' Last October Mr Des O'Malley resigned as leader of the other main opposition party, the Progressive Democrats, and was replaced by Ms Mary Harney. The latest opinion poll shows Ms Harney is currently Ireland's most popular politician, alongside Mr Albert Reynolds the prime minister.</p>

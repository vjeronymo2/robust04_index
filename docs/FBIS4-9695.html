			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iraima Gomez Ramirez] </F>   [Text] Within the next few days constitutional reform will  be the fundamental issue that Congress will consider. This  debate is expected to be heated, with marked difference of  opinion among the political groups now dominating Parliament.    This Wednesday [16 Feb], the Bicameral Conference Committee  will meet with experts from the Legal Advisory Service of  Congress to determine whether the constitutional debate will  start from zero, or if it will use the work done by the former  legislature, in which deputies approved the first and second  readings of the constitutional reform bill, and the Senate left  its second reading pending. On this matter there are a number of  divergent opinions among members of Congress. Some believe the  debate should start from zero, but taking as a base the previous  work done.    In light of the political panorama the National Congress now  presents, Causa R [Radical Cause] believes the constitutional  reform debate should start from zero, but first the present  Congress should be dissolved.    Causa R is actually working on a new Constitution, convening  individuals and groups for a national debate. The constitutional  reform debate was conducted inside the walls of Congress, and  the people did not take part in that debate. A new Constitution  requires the people's views and direct participation.    Pablo Medina, the head of Causa R's parliamentary group,  objects: "Is this fraudulent National Congress going to debate  the Constitution? The country does not want this Congress: we,  the way things are going...When we hold all these debates on  choosing the Treasury inspector and prosecutor, the people are  going to call for the dissolution of Congress. We are going to  request the dissolution of Congress and the holding of a  referendum so the people can decide whether or not this Congress  should continue to lead the discussion of bills and the  constitutional reform." He added that this Congress has no moral  or political authority to debate constitutional reform, as this  Congress is the product of a fraud. "There are a million invalid  votes. AD [Democratic Action] and COPEI [Social Christian Party]  added 40 deputies and that is what gave them a majority.  Therefore, they have no legitimacy. This is an illegitimate  Congress. It has no legitimacy to function, much less to reform  the Constitution."    He explained that although the present Constitution does not  include a provision for a dissolution referendum, it is possible  to conduct a vote of the nation on whether or not the people  want this Congress to be dissolved.    "In Colombia a Constituent Congress was held and the  Colombian Constitution did not include that possibility. They  did it for political reasons: it was right for the country. We  are considering how to do this, but we are convinced that this  Congress should go; it should be dissolved."    According to Senator Humberto Celli, the work done by the  former legislature on constitutional reform was not exclusive to  that legislature, and so it should be considered by the new  Congress. He believes that recent years have been quite eventful  and the nation's present situation is completely different,  "even the political makeup of the chambers is completely  diffent, and all this requires a new study which this Congress  needs to undertake, while also taking into account the work done  by the former Congress." The deputy leader of the COPEI group,  Nelson Chitty La Roche, thinks the new definition of the  political and parliamentary landscape requires that the  constitutional reform debate be started anew.    "The parliamentarians who have been chosen by our people to  represent them must offer their views, their opinions on the  constitutional issue, for we have to realize that our political  life is not a two-party system now; the political map is now  divided into four, and the social constitution now being debated  in the streets is permeated with the spirit of society. It must  have some influence on determining what the constitutional  reform debate will be."    Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche believes that some of the  issues of importance which will have to be dealt with in the  constitutional debate are revocation [or dissolution] referenda,  the media oligarchy, the military justice system, and the  decentralization process.</p>

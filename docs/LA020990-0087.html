			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 U.S. WOMEN PILOTS CAME UNDER HEAVY PANAMA FIRE;  </P> <P> COMBAT: THE DISCLOSURE IS A NEW INDICATION OF THE EXTENT THAT WOMEN TOOK PART  IN THE INVASION.  </P> <P> Two women helicopter pilots shuttling soldiers into combat during the early  hours of the U.S. invasion of Panama came under gunfire so fierce that one of  the choppers had to be grounded, Army officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> In recognition of their performance under fire, the two have been recommended  for the Air Medal with a "V" for valor. They would become the first women to  receive the decoration with the valor designation.  </P> <P> The account of the two pilots flying UH-60 "Blackhawk" helicopters through  skies alight with tracer bullets provided a new indication of the degree to  which women soldiers in Panama found themselves caught up in combat, from which  they are barred by Army policy.  </P> <P> A senior Army official emphasized that the women had been assigned to the  shuttle mission over Panama City with the expectation that it would involve  only normal aviation duties, but "it just so happened that they found  themselves in a situation where there was gunfire."  </P> <P> "At night, when you see the tracer bullets coming at you, you realize you could  end up giving your life for your country," one of the women, Lt. Lisa  Kutschera, told the Associated Press, which first reported the incident.  </P> <P> Kutschera and Warrant Officer Debra Mann encountered the gunfire as they rushed  paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division in the early morning of Dec. 20  from their initial landing site at Torrijos International Airport to various  objectives around Panama City, military sources said.  </P> <P> After one such trip, Mann's helicopter was discovered to have been hit by  several rounds and damaged so badly that it was grounded, the Army officials  said.  </P> <P> Mann told the AP that she and the rest of the crew had "heard the shots but  didn't even know we had been hit." Their commander, Capt. Thomas Muir, who was  shot in the head during one of the operations, said the women "took a  tremendous amount of fire."  </P> <P> Soldiers who were shuttled on the helicopter missions have described the  gunfire they encountered while in the air as some of the heaviest they faced in  Panama, with bullets flying from unexpected directions as Panamanian soldiers  fought from the streets.  </P> <P> In particular, paratroopers who were ferried toward the hilltop Panama Defense  Forces garrison of Tinajitas said their helicopters were riddled with automatic  weapons fire from surrounding bluffs as they approached the appointed landing  zone.  </P> <P> It could not be learned exactly which missions the two women participated in,  and Army officials said they did not know whether the helicopters returned  fire.  </P> <P> Debate about excluding women soldiers from combat missions has surfaced with  new vehemence in the aftermath of the Panama invasion, which provided evidence  that the distinction between combat and noncombat roles might be artificial in  modern warfare.  </P> <P> The issue gained attention after press accounts, later repeated by White House  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, reported that Army Capt. Linda Bray led a force of  30 military police in a three-hour gun battle with elements of the  now-disbanded Panama Defense Forces.  </P> <P> Army officials said later that the accounts were inflated and that the exchange  of fire lasted only 10 minutes, causing no casualties.  </P> <P> As a result of action seen by Bray and other Army women, Rep. Patricia  Schroeder (D-Colo.), has called for legislation directing the Army to move  toward permitting women to serve in all military jobs, including combat.  </P> <P> An Army official said the two women helicopter pilots were nominated to receive  the Air Medal for the "extraordinary manner in which they performed their  duties as air crewmen," and have also been recommended for an additional "V"  decoration for their valor.  </P> <P> The men in the Ft. Ord-based unit also were recommended for medals, the two  women told the AP. Final decisions about the medals are to be made by Army Lt.  Gen. Carl W. Stiner, who acted as operational commander during the invasion.  </P> <P> A third helicopter pilot, Warrant Officer Caryl Newberry, was also nominated to  receive an Air Medal after she came under small arms fire while flying a  helicopter on a logistics mission Dec. 21, an Army spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Canadian issues hit by debt downgrading PRICES in Eurobonds issued by Canada and Canadian provinces fell sharply yesterday, when the Government of Canada lost its AAA foreign debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's. Eurobonds issued by the Canadian provinces were among the worst casualties, even though they were not downgraded. The yield spread of Province of Ontario's 10-year dollar global bond issue widened from 70 basis points to 75 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond, traders said. Only foreign debt issued by Canada and by sovereign-guaranteed agencies like the Export Development Corporation and the Federal Business Development Bank is affected by the downgrade, but the news reawakened worries about the creditworthiness of the Canadian provinces, heavy borrowers in the Eurobond market. The outlook for the ratings of Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec is described as negative by S&amp;P. Canada, once an active issuer in the Eurobond market, has not tapped the sector since 1986, so its outstanding issues are no longer actively traded. In addition, the news of the downgrade reawakened worries about the economic problems facing other sovereign issuers, particularly Scandinavian borrowers and Italy, whose paper could come under further selling pressure. Eurobond spreads in Canadian provinces ballooned last month, on worries about the outcome of the October 26 national referendum on the constitutional framework governing federal/provincial relations in Canada. But the wider spreads had attracted asset swappers, able to switch fixed-rate bonds into floating-rate assets. Now, renewed concerns about creditworthiness could halt this process. Several borrowers, such as Metropolis of Tokyo and Kansai Electric Power Company, which had been eyeing the Canadian dollar sector of the Eurobond market could switch to the dollar market as a result of Canadian market turmoil. Moody's said it may downgrade the long-term debt ratings for Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- Chief of the  Russian Counter-Intelligence Service, General Colonel Sergey  Stepashin, and Moldovan Security Minister, General Vasile  Calmoi, met today with Aleksandr Lebed at the 14th Army Command  in Tiraspol. They discussed the maintenance of security in the  region. Stepashin did not specify whether yesterday's  cooperation agreement pertained to Eastern Moldovan districts.  Stepashin stated to BASA that the 14th Army  counter-intelligence service head, Colonel Nikolai Zlygostev,  was dismissed. Unofficial sources say that Zlygostev was  dismissed for his relations with the Tiraspol security and in  particular with the former minister Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeev).  The 14th Army command did not deny this allegation. The  Dniester acting security minister Oleg Gudymo was not allowed to  take part in the meeting. He waited for Stepashin outside  command headquarters hoping to plan a meeting with him at the  Tiraspol Security Ministry building. Stepashin refused to have  any discussions with the Dniester special services. He told  reporters that he is visiting Moldova at the Chisinau  Government's invitation.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT PROMPTS CALL FOR CIVILIAN REVIEW OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES  </P> <P> A stinging report from the San Diego County Grand Jury documenting assaults of  jail inmates by deputies has sparked calls for the creation of a civilian  review board to monitor the County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Jim Butler, one of the inmates allegedly beaten in the County Jail in Vista,  said he appeared before the Grand Jury on Wednesday and repeated the call for a  review board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Human Weaknesses'  </P> <P> "I told them that, because of human weaknesses, it is necessary to have checks  and balances with a police review board," he said. "And I told them that, if we  don't have that, then power will continue to corrupt and we will have a police  state."  </P> <P> The Grand Jury report, released Tuesday, lambasted the Sheriff's Department for  its operation of the six county jails.  </P> <P> The panel found that inmates were frequently assaulted by deputies, that  internal cover-ups were conducted to conceal those activities and that Sheriff  John Duffy and his top leaders did not assert adequate leadership to  investigate the allegations and stop the abuse.  </P> <P> Using the El Cajon jail as an example, the Grand Jury said a "Rambo Squad" of  deputies roamed the jail and routinely assaulted and harassed inmates in  conduct that was "totally reprehensible and inexcusable."  </P> <P> Duffy has been out of town this week and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> His spokesman, Lt. Alan Fulmer, said the sheriff will hold a press conference  soon to address the concerns in the 20-page report.  </P> <P> On the issue of a civilian review board for the department, Duffy has in the  past said he is opposed to allowing his staff to be scrutinized by any  outsiders. Instead, he has defended his in-house Internal Affairs Division as a  capable unit for investigating misconduct.  </P> <P> Though the Grand Jury did not call for an independent civilian review board,  the panel's report did conclude that the Internal Affairs Division is woefully  understaffed and unable to properly ferret out misbehavior by deputies.  </P> <P> The report noted that the sheriff's Internal Affairs Division has one  lieutenant and three sergeants for a department of 1,200 deputies, whereas the  San Diego Police Department's counterpart has two lieutenants and 12 sergeants  for a force of 1,700 officers.  </P> <P> The report also noted that the sheriff's unit recently had a 50% increase in  its caseload. And, the report added, "the backlog is building."  </P> <P> In the last two years, the issue of civilian review has dogged the San Diego  Police Department. One panel was created but then sharply criticized for being  weak and ineffective. Now, officials are attempting to determine whether one or  both of the two new proposals for a city review board should be carried out, as  approved by voters in November.  </P> <P> John Crew, director of the Police Practices Project for the ACLU in Northern  California, said that, though review boards are increasingly being established  to oversee local police procedures in the state, he knows of no panels to  monitor deputies in jail settings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Reasons Why  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "In the jail, it's a closed society," he said. "And the complainants are often  considered less credible because they are inmates.  </P> <P> "And misconduct is difficult to prove when you're dealing with people  incarcerated in jail. Witnesses will be less likely to speak up. And there is a  built-in bias against people who are incarcerated."  </P> <P> For a review board monitoring jail activities to be successful, he said, the  panel must be granted subpoena powers. It should also hold open public  hearings, make final decisions on misconduct and decide whether discipline is  warranted for errant officers.  </P> <P> Crew discounted common complaints by peace officers who argue that review  boards are no good because civilians cannot be properly trained to study police  practices.  </P> <P> "Come on," he said. "This is not brain surgery. Civilians already make  decisions about water bonds and streets and sewers. So why should a police  agency be an exclusion from democracy?"  </P> <P> Michael Crowley, a San Diego attorney, helped set up a special telephone hot  line for victims of jail abuse after the allegations began surfacing. And he  said many of the victims who called the hot line have expressed frustrations  because they feel as though no independent watchdog has monitored the Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> "We have every indication that the abuse is continuing and has been non-stop,"  he said. "And now, we are demanding that, based on the Grand Jury's report, a  review board be established."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Charges Noted  </P> <P> Tom Adler, another lawyer who has represented inmates allegedly beaten by  deputies, said the frustrations have deepened because federal and state  prosecutors have refused to file criminal charges against deputies.  </P> <P> "No one has been watching what's been happening in those jails," he said. "A  handful of lawyers have filed lawsuits over brutality cases. Occasionally, the  Grand Jury issues a report like this. But other than that, the U. S. attorney  has turned his back on the problem, and the county district attorney doesn't  want to get involved.  </P></p>

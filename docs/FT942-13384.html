			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / S Korea's cabinet in firing line South Korean President Kim Young-sam will decide this week whether to carry out a cabinet reshuffle following the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Lee Hoi-chang on Friday. Mr Lee Yung-dug, minister for unification, is expected to receive parliamentary approval today as the new prime minister in spite of being rejected by the main opposition Democratic party. Prime Minister Lee, who had earlier led the government's anti-corruption campaign, resigned after only four months in office in a dispute over his authority under South Korea's presidential system. The search for a new unification minister could trigger a general reshuffle of the government's senior foreign affairs officials, who have been criticised for pursuing an inconsistent policy on the North Korean nuclear issue. The wavering on North Korea reflects disagreement over whether Seoul should adopt a conciliatory policy toward Pyongyang or pursue a hardline stance. Mr Lee Yung-dug has advocated a tough response to North Korea's refusal to accept inspections, leading to speculation that prominent moderates, such as Mr Han Sung-joo, the foreign minister, may be replaced. Mr Lee demanded last week that he should approve all decisions taken by the North Korean policy group as part of an attempt to increase the prime minister's power in cabinet deliberations. The office of prime minister is regarded primarily as an administrative position, with the president making most key decisions. The president of the state-controlled Korea Exchange Bank, listed on the Seoul bourse earlier this month, resigned at the weekend after the bank was accused of tampering with its bidding price for shares in Korea Telecom that were auctioned last week. Mr Huh Jun is the second KEB president to resign within a year. His predecessor was sacked last June during the government's investigation of official corruption. The episode raises questions about the government's procedures for auctioning state companies as KEB was commissioned to handle the bids for a 5 per cent stake in Korea Telecom while simultaneously bidding for some of the shares.</p>

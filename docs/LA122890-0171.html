			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRO BOWLER PETE WEBER DRAWS SUSPENSION FOR CONDUCT VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> Pete Weber was suspended from the Pro Bowlers Tour for six months today, but  will continue to compete pending appeal.  </P> <P> Commissioner Joe Antenora said the suspension, for violating the PBA's  standards of conduct, was automatic because Weber was on probation.  </P> <P> Antenora would not disclose the alleged violation "because the matter is under  appeal."  </P> <P> Weber told the Professional Bowlers Assn. he will appeal, and the matter could  be unresolved until late spring.  </P> <P> Antenora said Weber was on probation for three conduct code violations during a  12-month period.  </P></p>

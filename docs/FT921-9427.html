			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: International stock trading falls at LSE THE trading of international stocks in London fell last year from its peak recorded in 1990, according to figures published yesterday by the London Stock Exchange. The value of overseas share transactions reported to the exchange during the year was Pounds 275bn. This was down from the record Pounds 294bn of 1990. Apart from foreign currency adjustments (all shares are traded in their local currency), the decline reflects the fact that London's share of international equity business may have peaked. Greater competition from other financial centres, particularly in Europe, has begun to stem the flow of business to the City, according to the exchange's figures. The UK domestic stock market, by contrast, had a better year in 1991. Customer turnover (not including trades between market makers) rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 234bn.</p>

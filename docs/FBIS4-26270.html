			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- A leading German  construction company, the Philipp Holzmann, is to build a  "European square" in Beijing.    A letter of intent was signed a month ago by the company and  the Beijing municipality, involving 200 million U.S. dollars.    Chinese senior leader Li Ruihuan had a brief meeting with  Holzmann's chairman Lothar Mayer here this afternoon, praising  the company for involving itself in this and other important  projects in China and hoping that construction of such projects  will be completed in time and with high quality.    These projects also include the Yansha Center in Beijing, a  section of the express highway in Shanghai, a key water  conservancy project in Sichuan Province and another one in the  middle reaches of the Yellow River.    Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, told the visitor  that during the past 15 years the Chinese Government and local  authorities have given top priority to the fast-growing  construction industry, resulting in a drastic face-lifing in the  major cities.    Li expressed the conviction that Holzmann will get full  support in China.</p>

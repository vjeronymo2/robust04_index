			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Swiss vote narrowly to embrace the IMF and World Bank THE Swiss took a big step off their traditional isolationist pedestal yesterday as a slim majority voted in a referendum to endorse their government's desire to join the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. As has become customary in Swiss plebiscites, the turnout was a feeble 39 per cent, and only 55 per cent of those voted were in favour. Still, the result will give a big boost to those Swiss who believe that their country's future lies in abandoning isolationism and joining more international and European institutions, including ultimately the European Community. Within the next year, two tough referendum battles on European issues are expected. The first, in September, is to approve the construction of new rail tunnels through the Alps. The second, not yet scheduled, is to ratify a recent agreement that would bring together the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association, including Switzerland, and the European Community into the European Economic Area (EEA). The result of the IMF referendum, which would make Switzerland the Fund's 157th member, will come as a relief to officials of the Swiss National Bank who have long been embarrassed that a country with as large a stake in the world economic and financial systems was unable to participate in the deliberations of the Bretton Woods institutions. It may also give a boost to the Swiss franc, which has been uncharacteristically weak in recent months. The vote on the IMF confirms a substantial shift in Swiss sentiment since 1986, when voters decisively rejected a government proposal that the country join the United Nations.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Separatist swears his allegiance QUEBEC separatist leader Lucien Bouchard swore allegiance yesterday to Queen Elizabeth II, Canada's formal head of state, despite his avowed aim of leading his French-speaking province to independence, Reuter reports from Ottawa. Mr Bouchard had to take the oath to gain his seat in Canada's House of Commons and become the official leader of the opposition as head of its second largest party. His Bloc Quebecois swept up 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in last month's general election, promising to lead the province to a referendum on sovereignty in 1995. The Bloc's success has placed new strains on Canadian unity and, ironically, earned the party the official title of 'Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition'. Mr Bouchard has refused to live in the official residence of the leader of the opposition in the Canadian capital.</p>

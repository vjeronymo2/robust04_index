			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: One for MMC to look at Sir, Last week I rang three different insurance brokers to seek a quotation for insuring my house. Each quoted on behalf of a different insurance company, and yet the three quotations were identical - and represented an increase of almost 40 per cent on last year. I trust that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and/or the Office of Fair Trading will want to investigate what looks suspiciously like a cartel.

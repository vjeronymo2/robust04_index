			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, April 7 KYODO -- Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co. has developed new model-based three-dimensional  human image synthesizing technology, the company said Thursday  [7 April].    A senior company researcher said if a programmer inputs  general data on the character of a model -- for instance, a  model with weak characteristics -- into a workstation, the  computer automatically outputs facial expressions and motions  suited to the character on the basis of that data. He said the  new technology will probably be put to practical use in the  field of game software in a few years, and eventually in the  field of motion pictures and broadcasting.</p>

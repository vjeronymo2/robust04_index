			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The fate of Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rescue rights issue, which closes on Wednesday, is touch and go. Last week the share price collapsed to 288p - perilously close to the rights issue price of 265p. The value of the nil paid shares slumped to 13p in heavy volumes. There must now be a real danger that underwriters will be left with a large slug of shares. And given that institutional investors have shown little enthusiasm for the stock to date, that could depress trading after the issue. If Eurotunnel's shares remain subdued in the longer term, the company could even find itself back in financial difficulties before long. Nearly half its financial cushion is predicated on the assumption that investors will exercise Pounds 200m of warrants next year. But that is unlikely unless the shares bounce. There is a more comforting scenario, based on a repeat of what happened during the previous 1990 rights issue. Then too, the share price fell to within a whisker of the rights price but recovered in the nick of time. Subsequently the shares raced ahead as speculators who sold short were caught on the wrong foot. Some brokers detect the same pattern of short-selling this time round. But others believe the shares would have fallen even further if the issue's supporters had not been buying the shares during much of last week. Given the current swirl of speculation, it is hard to tell which scenario is the more credible.</p>

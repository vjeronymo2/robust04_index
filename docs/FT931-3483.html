			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (34): The financial thriller stays out in the cold THE INSIDERS by Judi Bevan Piatkus Books Pounds 14.99, 385 pages GOLDSCAM by Peter Miller Lindsay Ross Publishing Pounds 14.99, 430 pages WITH THE end of the Cold War dealing a terrible blow to the conventional spy-thriller, publishers are searching for a new genre. What other professions can furnish the spy's best-selling combination of exotic locations, high living, beautiful women, skulduggery, dirty tricks, esoteric jargon and the sense of being on a secret inside track behind the headlines? FT readers will know the answer. Enter the 'Financial Thriller'. Surely international business is the very stuff of unputdownable drama - or ought to be. But it is not working: there is no sign of the Deighton or the Le Carre, even the Ludlum or the Follett, of the tombstone and the blue chip. The two latest examples are depressing confirmation of my point. Judi Bevan gives us the sad story of Jack Armstrong of Butler's Biscuits, an ultra-ambitious MD of the mid-1980s and a financial innocent who ventures into the City to launch a mega takeover bid where he is out of his depth in the world of concert parties, insider trading, smooth merchant bankers, share support indemnities - that sort of thing. Bevan is a financial journalist and her book can no doubt be read as a roman a clef, though she is careful to provide walk-on parts for Seelig, Saunders, Ronson, Halpern, and all the rest of the '80s crew. There has never been a novel in which the FT was more frequently quoted (and my Lex colleagues so taken in vain). The detail, whether of Savoy lunches or the changing figures on the Topic screen, will have its own fascination for many FT readers. Goldscam relies on the same verisimilitude of detail. Here's a geologist/consultant with a Midas touch recruited to help a South African mining house move offshore. Peter Miller all too evidently knows his Southern Africa and also this world of orebodies in which the central scam distinguishes between 'parts per million' and 'ounces per ton'. But there's no way to evade the point . . . You can't write a Financial Thriller if you can't write. Judi Bevan may be a competent financial journalist but - I'm sorry - she's not a novelist. Peter Miller may well be a brilliant metals analyst but he's no Joseph Conrad, nor Nadine Gordimer either. Bevan and Miller are adequately convincing in their own fields but they both insist on writing about things like sex, in which they are both cringe-makingly appalling. Takeover bids are eminently suitable subjects for a novel; sex - and love - are more difficult, as the world's better novelists know.</p>

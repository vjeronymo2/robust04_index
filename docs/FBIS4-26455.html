			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Japan today denied that  it is capable of producing nuclear weapons, saying the nation  "does not have any expertise or experience in producing nuclear  weapons."    "Japan has highly advanced technology for the peaceful use  of  nuclear energy," however, mere possession of high-level nuclear  technology and scientific technology does not amount to  production ability, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada  told a regular press conference.    Terada's denial of Japan's nuclear potential came days after  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata acknowledged that Japan has the  capability to produce nuclear arms but said it has not done so  in line with its international treaty obligations.    "It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to  possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," Hata told  Japanese reporters inside the Diet building last Friday.    Terada said Japan's nuclear power activities are restricted  to peaceful purpose by the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the  atomic energy basic law and others.    As the only country that suffered from atomic bombing, Japan  strictly upholds a so-called three no's principle -- no  possession, no manufacturing and no introduction of nuclear  weapons, he said.</p>

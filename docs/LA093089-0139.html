			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY RIPS WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> COUGARS' SOLLIDAY SUCCESSFULLY TAKES TO AIR IN 31-12 VICTORY  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School tried something new Friday night. Usually a team  that grinds it out on the ground, the Cougars took to the air and defeated  Westminster, 31-12, at Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Before Friday's game, Capistrano Valley quarterback Tony Solliday had attempted  39 passes in three games. Solliday threw 29 against Westminster, completing 19  for 263 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said passing more is necessary if the  Cougars (4-0) are to continue winning.  </P> <P> "We came out there expecting to air it out and try some things," Patton said.  </P> <P> That the Cougars felt they could do some experimenting might have something to  do with their opponent, the winless Wildcats (0-4).  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley took a 24-0 lead in the first half behind the passing of  Solliday and the catching of Dave Poltl, who had eight catches for 96 yards in  the first half. Poltl finished with 10 catches for 134 yards.  </P> <P> The Cougar ground game was far from quiet. Running back Paul Shaheen gained 93  yards in eight carries in the first half and scored the Cougars' first  touchdown on a 14-yard run. Shaheen carried the ball only once in the second  half, gaining 15 yards.  </P> <P> Some of the best hits of the night happened after the ball was dead. Numerous  unsportsmanlike penalties were assesed to both teams. The game threatened to  get out of hand as a couple of sideline clearing brawls almost erupted.  </P> <P> That the game was physical seemed to fire up Westminster. The Wildcats, who  couldn't do much against Capistrano Valley in the first half, outscored the  Cougars, 12-7, in the second half.  </P> <P> Westminster running back Bruce Tran scored on a 16-yard draw play in the third  quarter and quarterback John Shipp threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Dave  Spence in the fourth. But by that time, Capistrano had largely turned the game  over to reserves.  </P></p>

At the same time, Ivan Yermakov spoke emphatically against the  transfer of the Crimea to Russia: "One should not rush events  and promise the unfeasible. This would lead to critical  developments," Yermakov said. He spoke in favor of Ukraine,  Russia, and Belarus joining in a political and economic union.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TO GET STATE FUNDS FOR 3 PROJECTS  </P> <P> The Moorpark school district will receive state funds early in 1991 to build a  middle school, a continuation high school, and additional classrooms and a  performing arts facility at Moorpark High School, officials said.  </P> <P> "It's good news for us," Supt.  </P> <P> Tom Duffy told the school board Tuesday.  </P> <P> In November, the district's $25.5-million bond issue for new construction was  rejected by voters. However, the state's $800-million bond issue for new school  construction was successful.  </P> <P> Moorpark will receive more than $29.5 million after the cost estimates, done  two years ago, are adjusted for inflation, Assistant Supt. Carmela Vignocchi  said.  </P> <P> Although Duffy said it is possible that construction could be going on at all  three sites at the same time, the most pressing need is for 32 classrooms and a  performing arts facility, estimated to take two years, at Moorpark High.  </P> <P> The middle school, to be on property in the east part of the city, will also  take two years to build. The continuation high school will be in an industrial  park and should be completed in one year. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

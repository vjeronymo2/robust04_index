			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Sony announces relocation plans SONY (UK), the distributor of Sony electronic products in the UK and Ireland, yesterday announced plans to relocate its headquarters to a business park at Weybridge, Surrey, Vanessa Houlder writes. It has agreed to pay Pounds 29 a sq ft for a 180,000 sq ft building on the Brooklands Park on which construction will start this summer. Trafalgar House, the developer, says it is the largest office pre-let on a UK business park. About 550 Sony staff will relocate to the building at the end of next year. Sony UK said it had taken two years to pick its new location from a variety of options in west and southwest London. Trafalgar House also said it was buying British Aerospace's 50 per cent interest in the joint venture company set up in 1987 to develop the site. It did not disclose the price.</p>

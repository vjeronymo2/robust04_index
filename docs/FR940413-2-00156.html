			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the MSRB's proposed rule change is not deficient merely because it does not include affiliated banks and bank holding companies. Because of the sensitivity to constitutional and other concerns, the Commission believes that the coverage of the proposal is no broader than is necessary to effectuate its purpose and that extending the scope to cover affiliated banks and bank holding companies is not necessary. <FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will monitor closely the implementation of the proposal and its effects on the market, and if it determines that abusive practices continue to exist, will encourage the MSRB to expand the scope of the rule. In response to the suggestion that financial advisers be required to register as municipal securities broker-dealers and be subject to the proposal, the Commission notes that such a recommendation is beyond the scope of this proposal. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , letter from Vivian Altman, Altman &amp; Co., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (January 31, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. De Minimis Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators recommend that the proposal increase the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  amount that municipal finance professionals may contribute. <FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>  Several commentators recommend that the rule should provide a ``good faith'' exemption for inadvertent violations. <FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>  One commentator recommends that the rule provide a ``safe harbor'' provision for certain contributions. <FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>  Another commentator believes that the proposal should exempt contributions made for legitimate purposes. <FOOTCITE>86</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These commentators express concern that inadvertent violations by municipal securities dealers or associated persons covered by the rule may prevent dealers from participating in an underwriting, and, thus, raise the cost of a municipal securities issuance. For example, one commentator states that ``we are concerned that your rule could deprive a state or local government of the opportunity to work with a company which may be offering the most desirable rates simply due to a technical infraction.'' Letter from Jerry Abramson, President, The United States Conference of Mayors, Sharpe James, President, The National League of Cities, Barbara Sheen Todd, President, The National Association of Counties, and Bonnie R. Kraft, President-Elect, the Government Finance Officers Association, to Arthur Levitt, Chairman, Commission (February 18, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, one commentator states that ``[c]learly, the tradition of broker-dealer regulation in the U.S. is based upon the requirement that securities firms have adequate policies and procedures in place to assure compliance with laws and regulations not that each broker-dealer be guarantor of perfect compliance.'' Letter from William H. Ellis, President and Chief Operating Officer, Piper Jaffray Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). Another commentator believes that the proposal, ``consistent with many other rules and regulations applicable to the securities industry, may achieve its purposes but temper its remedy for firms with adequate compliance procedures and supervision.'' Letter from D. Kelly, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Raymond J.

Specifically, municipal securities professionals will be denied the ability to support politicians who champion their personal beliefs or corporate concerns. For example, a firm headquartered in New York City whose president and employees live on Long Island would be unable to send a representative to a dinner for the mayor of New York City or for the mayor's political opponent. Yet the mayor's decisions on issues such as zoning, corporate taxes, and transportation policy significantly impact the company's viability.'' Letter from Carolie R.

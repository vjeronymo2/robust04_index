			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Maciej Jankowski, leader of Solidarity's Mazowsze  region, who was guest of the "Sygnaly Dnia" [Signals of the Day]  morning program on Polish Radio's First Program, said that  today's strike is nationwide but not general because public  services are not joining the strike. Maciej Jankowski added  that the strike should not interrupt everyday life in towns and  cities.    [Begin recording] [Jankowski] I suppose that about 1,000  enterprises will join the strike. In Warsaw alone, all of the  big enterprises expressed readiness and are prepared for it.  These are: the FSO [small car plant], the Warsaw steelworks,  Elemis, the Wola-Rawar arms enterprise, and Ursus [tractor  enterprise], as always.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a classic strike?.    [Jankowski] Yes, a strike including the halting of  production. In tens of enterprises, sirens will be sounded,  flags displayed, and rallies organized. All large leading  enterprises have stopped because there is no other way. [end  recording]    According to Maciej Jankowski, the strike was announced  because there was no will on the part of the government to  implement solutions put forward by the Solidarity and approved  by specialists.

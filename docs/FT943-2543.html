			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: Film/Video Should comedy comfort or disturb? If you have never entered the world of Czech animator Jan Svankmajer before, you should try his Faust, opening in London this week. The most inventive model-worker and puppeteer in modern cinema, his last feature was a black-comedy version of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Faust takes marionette mayhem even further: bizarrely stylised faces and figures; bits of nightmare surrealism; pastiche touches of 'antiquity' - Svankmajer approaches Christopher Marlowe as if by a route through Spitting Image and Hieronymus Bosch. If you prefer your humour without a hint of the hellish, there is the new City Slickers 2. Raved over across the Atlantic, this second cowboy comedy has Billy Crystal again as star-screenwriter, plus a Jack Palance still going strong after those Oscar show press-ups when he won Best Supporting Actor for Slickers 1. Peter Greenaway's The Falls is the video treat of the week and ideal for those who like their comedy neither black nor wacky, but very dry. Three hours of spoof research into a group of 'mysterious' accident victims, the 1980 film was made before Greenaway slipped into mainstream movie-making with The Draughtsman's Contract. But it has all his gnomic wit, his love of the absurd and his eye for jewelled, eccentric imagery. Nobody does comedy better than Woody Allen: even when there is little to smile at in his own life. With his new film, Bullets Over Broadway headed for late-year British release after delighting audiences (including me) at the recent Venice film festival, why not limber up by re-seeing the 20-year-old Annie Hall and the one-year-old Manhattan Murder Mystery? Both are at the National Film Theatre this week. With MMM also out on video, you can make up your mind whether Allen's humour has really hit the skids - as American commentators inferred from the film's poor performance at the US box office - or whether scandal has simply clouded everyone's minds. In my view, he is still the funniest man in the world, and his newest comedies among his best.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Charles understands the Morse code: The Prince of Wales, says Dominic Lawson, is not taken in by all the tabloid fairy tales THE PRESS Complaints Commission, so trenchantly rubbished by Sir David Calcutt's report on press and privacy, seems still to show signs of unintelligent life. This week it invited Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, to complain to it about the publication of tape recordings alleged to be between the heir to the throne and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles. The Prince, of course, will do no such thing. His advisers over recent years may not have been the most brilliantly perceptive of their generation of Sandhurst graduates but even the most inbred of equerries is surely not so moronic as to plunge the Prince voluntarily into further controversy with the press. It is, besides, condescending of Lord McGregor, the accident prone chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, to imply that the Prince and his staff would not already have considered and rejected such a suicidal course of action. They had decided months ago, when the Daily Mirror first revealed the existence of the tapes, that to take any action against newspapers considering publication of them, on grounds of an invasion of privacy, would be to acknowledge that the tapes were genuine. For it is not far-fetched to suggest that most ordinary people - that is, those who do not write for or run newspapers - regard what they read in the tabloid press as fantasy. Often hugely enjoyable fantasy, but fantasy nonetheless. The coverage of the Royal family in particular has come so much to resemble a soap opera, that most readers will be too bemused and confused to know what is real, what is based on reality, and what is sheer fiction. The soap opera effect is greatly enhanced by the press's increasing tendency to cover the lives of fictional television characters as if they were real people. This week even the serious broadsheet press carried on their news pages reports of the fate of a an invented television detective called Chief Inspector Morse. As for the tabloid papers, they had whole pages devoted to convincing their readers that, somehow, Chief Inspector Morse is a real person, rather than just a lucrative part of the repertoire of the actor John Thaw. This tendency of the press to write about television characters as if they were real people is merely an exploitation of popular wishful thinking. We have always warmed to the story-teller's art of confusing fact and fiction. The success of such long-running radio series as The Archers is precisely because many listeners regard the script-writers' inventions as the dialogue of real people, overheard, as if through a particularly porous neighbour's wall. The Prince of Wales's advisers should take heart from this phenomenon. Indeed so should the whole Royal family. They should - if they do not already - recognise that there are two public views of them, coexisting, but mutually contradictory. First, there is what the public see at Royal occasions: processional, full of pomp and circumstance, immaculately choreographed by centuries of tradition. This looks and is real (indeed the public can go and watch it) even though it is denounced by such Labour MPs as Jack Straw and Marjorie Mowlem as out of place, not of this century. Second, there is the Royal family as it is written about in the popular press. This is not real, because it is not tangible, it does not correspond to what we see of the royal family on our television screens, in officially sanctioned programmes such as Elizabeth R. Such programmes are denounced by the new realists as a public relations gloss, a deception upon the public. But they are far more powerful in forming the public image than any amount of hostile investigative journalism. Newspapers are right to pander to the television image of Chief inspector Morse: they know that the public believes what it sees, not what it reads. So the Prince of Wales is right to steer well clear of the Press Complaints Commission. That is part of the world of fantasy which has not got the power it thinks it has to take away his right to the throne. Instead he should continue to stick to processions, grand gala openings, and polo. That is the real world, or at least the one we all want to believe in.

Presiding over a cabinet meeting on Thursday morning, Yi  said  street violence should not be allowed to occur again, noting  some 300 people were injured in Tuesday's demonstration, his  Press Secretary Kang Hyong-sok said. He also instructed that  strict controls be imposed on elections for farm, livestock and  fisheries cooperatives, saying they have already shown signs of  corruption and rigging.    Yi told Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok to pay  special attention to price movements so that prices do not rise  before Lunar New Year next week, while instructing Labor  Minister Nam Chae-hui to see that workers' wages are not held in  arrears during the holiday. He also stressed the need to ensure  safe land and coastal transportation during the holiday.</p>

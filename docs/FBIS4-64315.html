			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure </F> by Anne Fulda; place and date not given: "Lamassoure: `The  Maastricht Battle Is Over'"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fulda] Your opponents think  that the arrival of new competitors on the world market [as a  result of the recent GATT agreement] will threaten entire  sections of French industry.    [Lamassoure] The real situation is different. With average  customs duties of 6 percent, the European market was already  largely open. Now the others have agreed to open up and bow to  the rules of international trade. Take the example of South  Korea. It is a country with a population four times that of  Greece and with the same standard of living. South Korea, which  had customs duties of 50 percent, has agreed to reduce them by  40 percent! And it has just bought the TGV [high-speed train]  from us. Our companies have benefited greatly from the European  Common Market because two-thirds of our exports are now to the  European Union [EU], as against only 5 percent to the Asian  countries. However, in the next 10 years, half of world growth  will be in this region of the world. It is here that the new  markets are to be won, and hence new sources of jobs for France.    [Fulda] Is that not likely to result in job losses in  France?    [Lamassoure] Some jobs will disappear, but many more will be  created. We must decide whether, like the Germans, the  Italians, the Americans, and the others, we accept progress, or  whether our objective is to make France a new Albania. At all  events, increases in productivity and the emergence of new  products are inevitable. In 1985, our exports represented 5  percent of world trade; in 1994, we are nearing 7 percent, an  absolute record for 50 years! We have absolutely nothing to  fear from world economic competition provided it is carried out  in conditions which guarantee fair competition.    [Fulda] With regard to your second objective -- the  restoration of peace on the European continent -- are you  satisfied?    [Lamassoure] With regard to the restoration of peace, two  important things have been started. First, the division of  roles between Europe and the United States with regard to the  security of the continent has been revised to take account of  the new sources of instability which have emerged on our  continent.    Second, the beginnings of a common EU foreign policy have  been established. Of course, these are only the beginnings, but  Europe now exists as a diplomatic player. In the Yugoslav  crisis, for the past year, it is at the initiative of France and  Europe that all the Security Council resolutions have been  adopted, and it is the EU's peace plan which is now the only  undisputed basis for an overall settlement to the quagmire in  the former Yugoslavia.    Another example: At Edouard Balladur's initiative, the EU  has decided to organize a conference on stability covering the  whole of the European continent. It is an exercise in  preventive diplomacy aimed at urging the European countries  which have problems with good neighborly relations to sit down  at a table, either bilaterally or in a regional framework, with  European mediation. [passage omitted]    [Fulda] To what extent will the government be involved in  the  European election campaign? What will your role as European  affairs minister be?    [Lamassoure] It is primarily the majority's union list,  i.e.,  that of Valery Giscard d'Estaing's [UDF--French Democratic  Union] and Jacques Chirac's [RPR -- Rally for the Republic]  parties, which will lead the campaign. It is therefore for these  parties to decide on the campaign. In this respect, the  government, which supports the list headed by Dominique Baudis,  welcomes the threefold agreement reached by the UDF and RPR:  agreement on the program; agreement to sit in the same group in  Brussels; and agreement on a single union list headed by  Dominique Baudis.    As far as I am concerned, I intend to play an educational  role throughout this campaign, to explain the real choices  facing us. For instance, today, it is no longer a question of  whether or not we must open up our trade borders -- this has  been an established fact for 30 years -- but of examining how we  can open up other countries' borders with a view to creating new  jobs in France. I will try to show where the real issues lie.    [Fulda] What do you think of Philippe de Villiers list,  which  is being presented as the majority's "other list?"    [Lamassoure] The Maastricht battle is over. The radically  new problem is whether, and how, a political Europe of 24 states  can be made to work. Dare we hope that this campaign will be  something other than a purely domestic debate in which attempts  would be made to settle scores within each political family on a  European pretext?</p>

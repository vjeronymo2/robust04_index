			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Lamont says Britain will not follow German lead MR NORMAN LAMONT made it clear yesterday there was little immediate prospect that he would follow the Bundesbank's lead and cut British interest rates again. Amid fears in Whitehall that lower German rates might provide only a temporary respite for the pound, the chancellor of the exchequer told MPs that he was not prepared to jeopardise the government's anti-inflation policy by risking a new sterling crisis. 'Markets should remember that interest rates can go up as well as down,' he said. His comments came as the Treasury prepared to reassure financial markets about its medium-term economic strategy with the announcement of the most sweeping review of public spending for more than a decade. The review, led by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will aim to convince the markets that the government has a coherent framework to reduce a budget deficit which is forecast to reach Pounds 50bn next year. The relative calm which returned yesterday to London's financial markets did little to dispel doubts at Westminster over Mr Lamont's future as chancellor after the March 16 Budget. Mr John Major sidestepped a question in the House of Commons on whether Mr Lamont would deliver the second Budget of the year in December. Mr Major replied: 'I can't imagine anyone other than the chancellor of the exchequer presenting a Budget.' In an attempt to dispel the impression of disarray in the government's economic strategy, Mr Lamont repeated that the recent cut in British borrowing costs to 6 per cent had been 'fully justified' by the inflation outlook. 'It was based on the advice of the Bank of England. It was based on what is happening to the money supply and to asset prices,' he said. Appearing alongside the chancellor, Mr Portillo brushed aside suggestions that the pound's recent fall would translate into an acceleration of inflation. However, Mr Lamont said that the Treasury would continue to take the exchange rate into account in its interest rate judgments. Mr Lamont sought to lift the economic gloom prompted by this week's failure of Leyland Daf, the commercial vehicle maker, by pointing to signs of an upturn in the housing market. But neither he nor his Treasury colleagues would rule out the possibility of tax increases in the March Budget.

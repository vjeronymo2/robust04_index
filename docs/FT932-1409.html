			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Tariff row puts G7 trade reform deal in jeopardy A BITTER ROW over tariff protection for the US textiles industry yesterday is threatening hopes that a big trade liberalisation package could be presented for approval at the summit next month of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The disagreements among trade ministers from industrialised countries meeting in Tokyo also damped expectations that the long-delayed Uruguay Round of talks on worldwide tariff cuts could be completed this year. In the last 'quad' talks - involving the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - before the G7 summit, top trade negotiators maintained official silence about progress. Talks continue today, with no formal statement expected until this afternoon in Tokyo. However, participants admitted privately last night there had been a setback. 'The US and the EC have been unable to find a fit,' one said. 'There's a perception on everyone's part that the proposed package of tariff cuts is unbalanced against them, and they are unable to go further. 'It is difficult to believe that anything can be salvaged, and that throws into jeopardy the entire Uruguay Round,' he added. Difficulties in the quad talks have cast a further shadow over the G7 summit, following the Japanese political crisis prompted by the government's defeat last week in a vote of confidence. Hopes of a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round talks, which have faltered for two years, were raised at a ministerial meeting this month of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, when Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, noted: 'We are at last in striking distance of the largest market access package in history.' Sir Leon Brittan, his EC counterpart, said at the same time a 'ray of hope' was emerging, and that a big market access package was a 'realistic aim'. But in Tokyo yesterday, one participant said Sir Leon had effectively pulled back earlier concessions, arguing they had originally been made on the assumption of big cuts from the US on its high textile tariffs. These range from 20 to 40 per cent. There had been hopes these would be halved on average. When the US textile proposal was received by the EC last Friday, it averaged cuts of about a third, with many exclusions. 'The offer is simply unsellable,' one participant noted yesterday. 'I don't think we will get any further here. Mr Kantor has to go back to Washington and say there is a failure in prospect if he does not get any more authority than he has now.' Differences remain over Europe's refusal to eliminate tariffs on non-ferrous metals, electronics goods, wood products and aluminium. Japan has been praised for proposing deeper liberalisation of its financial services sector, but is criticised for blocking elimination of tariffs on spirits and wood products. In an effort to act as peacemaker, Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister, called on negotiators to aim for 'a realistic agreement, rather than 100 per cent'. One participant added: 'There is a significant danger that the G7 countries will not have a concrete package either in services or in goods.' European Steelmakers hit out at 'Trade war' page 3</p>

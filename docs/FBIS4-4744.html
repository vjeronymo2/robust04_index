			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- A former aide to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had asked an investment consultant  who allegedly arranged Hosokawa's 1986 purchase of Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares not to identify  Hosokawa as a client in his firm's tax returns, the consultant  said Tuesday [5 April]. "When I received 10 million yen as a  consulting fee from the prime minister's former secretary  Masatoshi Miyama, he asked me to conceal the transaction," Shuzo  Fujiki, president of the Tokyo-based consulting firm Random  Walk, said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Fujiki, 60, said Miyama made the request after Hosokawa made  a profit of 50 million yen by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT  shares, for whose purchase Fujiki said he had helped Hosokawa  secure a loan. Fujiki complied with Miyama's request by  refraining from reporting to the tax authorities the consulting  fee as an income of his consulting firm, thereby avoiding the  identification of Hosokawa as the payer of the fee.    Hosokawa told reporters Tuesday morning he "does not know"  whether Miyama asked Fujiki to conceal the exact details of the  transaction. "I do not know it," the premier said. "I have to  ask (Miyama)."    At a news conference last Wednesday, Fujiki quoted Miyama as  asking him in 1986, "Mr. Miyama asked...`Because Hosokawa is the  incumbent Kumamoto governor, may he use the name of another  person for this transaction?'"    In the subsequent 1987 conversation with Miyama, Fujiki  said,  he took Miyama's remark as implying a request not to report to  tax authorities the name of Hosokawa as the payer of the  consulting fee, as publicity on such a deal might undercut  Hosokawa's reputation as governor.    According to Fujiki, Miyama had promised to pay 10 percent  of  net proceeds from any selloffs of the NTT shares as a "reward,"  while allowing Fujiki to dictate the timing of the selloffs.  However, Miyama reneged on the promise and sold off the 199  shares in February and March of 1987 without any consultations  with Fujiki, Fujiki said.    Later, Miyama asked for Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of  the reward to 10 million yen, he said, adding that he accepted  the request.    Out of the total, 7 million yen were handed over to Fujiki  from Miyama in a few installations, while the remaining 3  million yen was remitted to Fujiki's bank account, he said.    Fujiki said he is willing to testify on the NTT share  transaction at a Diet session if the governing coalition  complied with an opposition demand to summon him as a witness.  Diet business over the fiscal 1994 state budget has been  stalled over the witness demand.    Fujiki earlier told reporters that Hosokawa "lied" to the  Diet when Hosokawa said his father-in-law, but not himself,  asked Fujiki to act as an intermediary to facilitate the share  purchase.    Hosokawa denied the allegations on the Diet floor, saying  that Shohei Ueda, the father of his wife, Kayoko, asked for the  share purchase, asking Hosokawa for help in securing a loan to  finance the purchase. Hosokawa said he pledged his condominium  in Tokyo's Moto-Azabu as collateral to take out the 418 million  yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the  money to his father-in-law. Hosokawa's father-in-law died last  May.    In a related development, a well-placed government source  told reporters Fujiki "appears to have received the 10 million  yen" from Miyama.    However, the source denied the allegations that Miyama asked  Fujiki to conceal the details of the transaction.    Hosokawa earlier told the Diet he purchased the condominium  he offered as collateral with part of a 100 million yen loan he  borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group, a  company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal.    NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and  large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100  shares on October 4, 1986, before offering the shares for  smaller-lot public subscription.    Hosokawa succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares for which  he had submitted bids on advice from Fujiki, Fujiki said.    Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share  purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of about  50 million yen, he said.</p>

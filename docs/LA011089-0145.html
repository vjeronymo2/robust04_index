			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT PONDERS STEROID PENALTY  </P> <P> A bill that would impose a criminal penalty on anyone caught taking or  supplying anabolic steroids without a prescription was introduced today in  Britain's House of Commons.  </P> <P> The bill would add steroids to a list of controlled substances covered by the  1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, making them illegal for the first time in Britain.  Although they are not allowed by most sports organizations, steroids are legal  in Britain and most other countries.  </P> <P> "The events of last summer only serve to underline the necessity for government  action to tackle drug abuse in sport," said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal  Party's expert on sports and sponsor of the bill, referring to drug scandals at  the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> "I hope ministers understand that the physical health of athletes will be at  risk so long as anabolic steroids remain available," Campbell said.  </P></p>

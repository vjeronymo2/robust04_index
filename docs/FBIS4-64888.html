			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Herman Van Rompuy, Belgian deputy prime minister </F> and budget minister: "The Recovery Is Already Under Way"]    [Text] The Belgian economy has both its weak and its strong  points. Trotting them all out also means telling the whole  truth. Mostly, the value of a currency reflects the general  situation, certainly if, what is more, interest rates are low  internationally. Anyone who retains any doubts as to the  durability of the strength of the Belgian franc, however, cannot  deny the fact that our inflation is lower than that in Germany  and the Netherlands, that our current balance of payments has a  record surplus of 350 and 400 billion Belgian francs [BFr] in  1993 and 1994 respectively, that our level of unemployment, 10  percent, is lower than in the rest of Europe, and that the  budget deficit is not 3.5 GNP points higher than the European  average as calculated in 1988, but only 0.8 GNP points.    That is a different way of describing our situation than the  almost traditional "doomsday approach." Pessimism has been so  predominant that a few months ago, when I said the recession was  over, it seemed unbelievable. Over the last few weeks, however,  the economic analysts have been upwardly revising their growth  figures, so that even private forecasters are now talking about  growth of 1.3 percent in 1994, as predicted, incidentally, by  the European Commission.    So the question is not whether Belgium still needs a plan  for  recovery. A shift toward recovery is already under way.  Furthermore, in recent years, with the exception of 1993, the  national economy has performed better than in the rest of  Europe. It will yield an equivalent performance in 1994.  Incidentally, if one compares 1982-1987 with 1988-1994, then it  becomes evident that growth during the former period was slow,  whereas growth during the latter period was somewhat faster. A  more direct comparison with the Netherlands and Germany shows an  average increase in GNP of 1.4 percent, compared with 1.5  percent for our neighbours, and 2.2 and 2.5 percent respectively  during 1988-1994. If we only take data on the Flemish economy,  then the difference between Belgium and the two countries  already mentioned would be virtually indistinguishable.  <H5>  Edinburgh </H5>   Economic recovery in other European countries too may partly  be attributed to the European Union's recovery initiative that  was launched at the Edinburgh summit and definitively sealed in  Brussels in early December 1993. The Belgian presidency played  a particularly important role in this context.    Pointing out positive aspects does not mean to say that we  deny the structural failings of our economy, in particular our  not very labor-intensive economy and the high public debt. The  liberal opposition says absolutely nothing about the  labor-unfriendly character of our economy in its so-called  recovery plan. Employment is not merely the result of higher  economic growth or more investments. That is the reason the  Global Plan so strongly emphasized reducing the social burdens  for young people and for those with low qualifications.  Moreover, that is why the real increase in incomes has been  blocked for a three-year period.    Nothing could be simpler than organizing recovery by  increasing the deficit. That was the old Keynesian recipe, but  that is something to fall back on when excessive hopes are  placed on the so-called receipt effects of lowering taxes, even  benefiting investments. For many years now, I have been hearing  people clamor that certain tax breaks will generate more for the  treasury than they cost. Things have never turned out that way.  In order to avoid budgetary risks, in the Global Plan the  government fully compensated the reduction of the social  burdens.    Moreover, supposing that some fiscal incentives are  temporary, like the reduction in VAT [value-added tax] rates for  construction and investment allowances proposed by the Flemish  liberals, the only result will be to accelerate the speed with  which certain investments are made, rather than achieve durable  growth. For the construction sector, interest rates for  mortgages have always proven far more important than any drop in  VAT. Well, over the past few years it has been possible to  bring interest rates down. For investments, profitability is a  key determining factor, and it will increase as a result of wage  restraint, among other things. Naturally, additional measures  would be useful if the budgetary leeway permitted their  implementation, but even then the effects should not be  overestimated.  <H5>  Deduction at Source </H5>   The federal government has reduced the tax deducted at  source  on dividends from capital increases (including for small- and  medium-sized companies) from 25 to 13 percent. This is an  important step in removing discrimination against risk capital.  It binds the reduction to an economic activity and is therefore  socially more acceptable than a simple reduction in the rate of  tax deducted at source from 25 to 20 percent, which would mean  that those with capital were the only ones whose income was  improving while all other income groups were having to tighten  their belts.    The liberals claim that a reduction in company tax could be  compensated by abolishing subsidies to companies. But the  federal government no longer gives any allowances to private  companies.    This government is the first to privatize on a large scale.  And yet the yields of privatization form just a small part of  budgetary income. Of the BFr500 billion raised for 1994, only  11 percent is concerned. Like Germany, the Netherlands, and  France, and like Belgium in 1987, the money raised is being used  for the budget. In any case, the contribution of the private  sector is essential if the present public enterprises are to  withstand international pressures. In the case of a number of  them, the government's majority position was simply given up.    However, privatization here cannot be compared with what is  happening in Latin American countries, as the VLD [Flemish  Liberal Democrats] likes to do. Far less than 5 percent of the  business stock is in public hands here. Little was ever  nationalized and consequently we cannot privatize on a large  scale. In any case, where is the time when the PVV [Party For  Freedom and Progress] "nationalized" Cockerill-Sambre, not to  mention the massive cut in working time (1983), the tax increase  of BFr270 billion (in today's francs) due to the last three  index jumps (1984-1987). But that sounds too polemical. Yet it  is still correct.    Personally, I am not against the possibility of more  flexible  wage formation, with a certain link to company results. In  1987, there was a draft bill about profit-sharing remuneration,  but I do not expect any miracles from it. In addition, many  workers work in the nonprofitmaking sector or for self-employed  persons who know nothing of the concept of "company profits."    The task of the federal government is not over. Constant  vigilance is necessary over competitiveness, the budget, social  security, and employment. A rising economic cycle will not be  enough to gain fully satisfactory results. This task for the  federal government will remain difficult, in a period when the  general interest is not a self-evident idea.</p>

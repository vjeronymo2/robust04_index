			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and his delegation yesterday evening.  The delegation includes Dennis Ross, special Middle East peace  process coordinator; Christopher Ross, U.S. ambassador in  Damascus; and Martin Indyk, special assistant to the U.S.  president for Middle East affairs. The meeting was attended by  Faruq al-Shar', minister of foreign affairs; Muwaffaq al-'Allaf,  head of the Syrian delegation to the peace talks; and Walid  al-Mu'allim, Syria's ambassador in Washington.    Talks dealt with the peace process and all aspects of the  ideas presented during Saturday's meeting. The president  explained Syria's viewpoint, which stems from a real desire for  a just and comprehensive peace that guarantees the rights of all  parties. He stressed that addressing the basic peace issues is  what can guarantee the progress of this process.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his  delegation  left Damascus last night following a two-day visit to the Syrian  Arab Republic. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', senior Foreign  Ministry officials, the Syrian ambassador in Washington, and the  American ambassador in Damascus saw him off at Damascus  International airport.    Speaking to reporters prior to his departure, Mr.  Christopher  described his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad as extremely  serious and substantial. He said that, in his opinion, there is  much to do and substantive talks to be held. A great deal of  work and effort are awaiting us in the future, he said.    Mr. Christopher said he relayed some ideas to Damascus and  took others from it. He told reporters he was going to Israel  to meet with Yitzhaq Rabin and then on to Cairo. He said that  at present he has no plans to return to Damascus and added that  his country will play a more effective role to help the parties.  He said he discussed the subject of bilateral relations with  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and that he will resume talks  with him if Mr. al- Shar' visits Washington.    Replying to a reporter's question, Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' said Syria does not accept phased peace with Israel and  insists on complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories as a condition for the establishment of peace in the  region. He added that there has been no change whatsoever in  the Syrian position on the peace process. Al-Shar' said  President Hafiz al-Asad asked several substantive questions  which the Israeli side has to answer. Asked about the idea of  Majdal Shams first, the foreign minister said Syria's position  is that the Golan should be restored in full.</p>

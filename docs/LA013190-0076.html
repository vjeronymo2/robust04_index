			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> FRUSTRATING EPISODES OF 'AIDS QUARTERLY'  </P> <P> "Tales of Frustration" might be the umbrella title for two of the segments --  the third was unavailable for review -- of the latest "The AIDS Quarterly"  (tonight at 8, Channels 28, 50, 15 and 24).  </P> <P> A San Francisco immunologist, Alan Levin, with the encouragement of AIDS  activist Martin Delaney, made a leap into the ethical void last year when he  decided to test the powerful drug Compound-Q on volunteer patients with  advanced cases of AIDS. A big problem, besides the fact that the drug was still  being tested by the Food and Drug Administration and therefore not yet approved  for use, was not knowing when a dosage level became fatally toxic.  </P> <P> Two of the first three volunteers died within months of taking Compound-Q,  leaving Levin in an ethical gray area. The report pictures him in a dilemma: On  one side is Delaney, imploring him to continue testing what may eventually be  "the magic bullet" for the virus; on the other side is the FDA, ordering him to  stop the unauthorized testing. This is the other, continuing Drug War, putting  doctors in the trenches.  </P> <P> "Money and Morals," an unusually hard hitting segment for the generally soft  "AIDS Quarterly," shows how three states dole out AIDS education money,  distributed federally via the Centers for Disease Control. It indirectly raises  questions about how Christian some "Christians" are.  </P> <P> After the passage of Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-N.C.) bill preventing federal funds  from directly supporting gay activist organizations, the Centers for Disease  Control became a money conduit for the states, which then decide which  educational organizations are funded.  </P> <P> Well-funded efforts in Florida have a fraction of the effect of privately  funded, grass-roots projects. In Colorado, a hi-tech, Big Brother approach  tracks down AIDS carriers and partners with such intimidation that it may be  driving people with AIDS underground. North Carolina's Christian right stopped  all education funding to community-based groups in 1988 because of material  some ministers and politicians deemed as "obscene." North Carolina activist  David Jones laments on-camera: "We gave AIDS a headstart in this state."  Frustrating. ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

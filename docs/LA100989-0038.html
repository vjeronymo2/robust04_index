			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIJUANA SEWAGE: ACCORD CALLED A BREAKTHROUGH  </P> <P> A U.S.-Mexico environmental pact signed in Washington last week is a  breakthrough that could end the decades-long spillage of Tijuana sewage into  San Diego-area farms, wetlands and coast, according to U.S. experts and  lawmakers.  </P> <P> "This is a landmark agreement that will finally begin to resolve the problem,"  said Narendra N. Gunaji, U.S. commissioner for the International Boundary and  Water Commission, an El Paso-based panel that mediates border matters between  the United States and Mexico.  </P> <P> The accord also underlines the growing cooperation between U.S. and Mexican  authorities in combatting border environmental problems, from the befouling of  the Rio Grande to smelter emissions in the Arizona-Sonora region to the  border-wide dumping of toxic wastes. Border-area environmental hazards  increasingly have emerged as irritants in U.S.-Mexico relations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1993 Target Date  </P> <P> "The pollution is mutually detrimental to both nations, and therefore both  nations must work together," Gunaji said.  </P> <P> The agreement commits both governments to the construction of a San Diego-based  facility -- costing nearly $200 million -- that would treat wastes from Mexico.  Despite the agreement, the plant is still far from reality, with funding  questions still unresolved. The facility is not scheduled to be in operation  until at least 1993.  </P> <P> In signing the accord, experts said, the Mexican government in effect abandoned  plans to construct a treatment plant in fast-growing southeastern Tijuana, a  project that many on the U.S. side feared would exacerbate the problem by  depositing huge amounts of barely treated sewage into the already polluted  Tijuana River, which flows into San Diego. The proposed plant was to be built  on the Rio Alamar, a tributary of the Tijuana River.  </P> <P> U.S. authorities, on the other hand, agreed to allocate tax dollars exclusively  to treat foreign wastes. Gunaji noted that Washington, concerned about the  pollution of the Rio Grande, already is picking up half the tab of a  $44-million treatment plant planned for Nuevo Laredo, across the river from  Laredo, Tex. A jointly operated treatment plant has been in operation in  Nogales, Ariz., for more than 30 years, but that facility handles wastes from  both sides of the border.  </P> <P> In San Diego, lawmakers with little faith in Mexican sewage-treatment methods  had been lobbying for years for a U.S.-based plant to handle Mexican wastes.  But, until recently, the efforts had received sparse encouragement from their  Mexican counterparts. That changed considerably in the administration of  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office Dec. 1 and has emphasized  environmental concerns.  </P> <P> While the final details of the agreement still have to be worked out, there was  relief among officials that the Mexican government had finally acceded to the  concept of a binational facility.  </P> <P> Brian Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor who has been working on the issue  for more than a decade -- he once rode a bulldozer to dramatize his displeasure  with the northbound Tijuana sewage flows -- recalled that many doubted that  Mexico would ever consent to such a plan, or that U.S. officials would agree to  fund it.  </P> <P> "This was the impossible dream," he said. "We just kept the pressure up. Now we  know that we'll have our own technology."  </P> <P> For years, raw sewage from Tijuana has naturally flowed to the northern side of  the border via the Tijuana River and down numerous gullies and arroyos. Many  Tijuana residents remain without regular plumbing, allowing wastes to enter  rough channels that drain to the north. In addition, the city's sewage pipes  are subject to regular breakdown, augmenting the foul flow.  </P> <P> Consequently, much of the city's sewage -- 10 million gallons a day or more --  ends up in thefetid Tijuana River, which drains on the U.S. side. At the mouth  of the river on the U.S. side are a slough and a unique national estuarine  sanctuary, one of the few on the West Coast, that attract considerable  wildlife, including endangered species. Conservationists fear the impact on the  delicate ecosystem. Others worry about health hazards for humans: a 2 1/2-mile  swath of beach just north of the border has been quarantined for more than six  years because of the sewage.  </P> <P> With the agreement signed, the debate about the treatment project very likely  will shift to the fiscal arena. Both nations are being asked to contribute  substantial sums at a time when lawmakers in Mexico City and Washington are  tightening their fiscal belts. The exact amounts are still to be determined,  but early estimates put the price tag of the project at $192 million.  </P> <P> The U.S. government is expected to be asked to chip in about $100 million, of  which only $14 million has already been appropriated, officials said. Whether  lawmakers from non-border states will be eager to fund a project to treat  Mexican sewage remains to be seen.  </P> <P> California also has budgeted $14 million, and is expected to kick in another $1  million. The city of San Diego, has budgeted $12 million.  </P> <P> Mexico, according to preliminary estimates, will be required to contribute  about $41 million -- $21 million for pipeline construction in Tijuana and  another $20 million for the plant. The binational agreement, however, raises  the possibility that a loan program will be worked out allowing Mexico to pay  its share of the costs over a 10-year period.  </P> <P> Mexico has also reserved the right to reclaim the Tijuana waters treated at the  international plant -- an important point, given the water shortages that  always threaten the semidesert region.  </P> <P> The details are now to be worked out by the two nations' representatives on the  International Boundary and Water Commission. A definitive plan is expected  within 90 days, authorities said, and construction could begin next year.  </P></p>

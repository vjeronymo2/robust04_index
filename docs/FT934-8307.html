			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Former M&amp;A king opts to join Morgan Stanley MR JOSEPH Perella, one half of Wall Street's most successful mergers and acquisitions double act in the 1980s, moved back into the mainstream of investment banking yesterday. He announced he would join Morgan Stanley. Mr Perella resigned two months ago from Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A boutique he founded with long-term associate Bruce Wasserstein in 1988. He left behind his name and what he said was a 'significant' equity interest in the firm. Mr Perella, 52, will join Morgan Stanley's operating committee, but have no involvement in the management of its investment banking department. He said he had not discussed a management role with any of the banks he talked to. The move to Morgan follows intense competition from several Wall Street houses for his services, indicating the sharp increase in M&amp;A activity this year after a two-year lull. It also pointed to the ambition of a number of securities houses to expand their investment banking operations. Mr Perella eventually chose Morgan Stanley, an established house, over Merrill Lynch, which has sought to graft a stronger investment banking operation on to its substantial broking and trading activities. He will fill the gap left at Morgan Stanley by the departure this year of Mr Robert Greenhill, the bank's former president, who went to Smith Barney. But both Mr Perella and Morgan Stanley said the appointment would have been made even if Mr Greenhill had still been at the firm. Mr Greenhill has remained the leading adviser to Viacom in its bid to acquire Paramount, leaving Morgan Stanley with only a supporting role in the biggest contested takeover battle since the late 1980s - advising Nynex on its investment in Viascom. However, the bank's work for Merck in the acquisition of Medco Containment Services, and for AT&amp;T in its purchase of McCaw, will put Morgan back among the leaders in the M&amp;A business for this year. Mr Perella refuses to comment on why he parted company with Mr Wasserstein. 'I have an amicable relationship with Bruce. I just thought it was time to move on,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Minsk, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Belarusian Foreign  Minister Petr Kuzmich Kravchanka, said today that his country  hopes to open direct trade with China following the success of  diplomatic ties.    In an interview with XINHUA, Kravchanka said that it was  very  important for Belarus to further promote its relations with  China.    He said his government was grateful for China's support  particularly over its backing of the question of Minsk's joining  the UN Security Council.    "We hope our bilateral relations will always be filled with  constructiveness and the spirit of mutual understanding and  benefit," said the Belarusian foreign minister.    Speaking of Belarusian-Chinese economic and trade  cooperation, Kravchanka noted that Belarus' trucks and tractors  sold well on the Chinese market, and its military and space  technology are very advanced, on a par with the rest of the  world.    Meanwhile, Chinese garments and other commodities were  welcomed by Belarusian consumers and the minister said that the  two countries should raise their existing barter trade to the  level of trading by foreign currency.    On Belarus' relations with Russia and western countries,  Kravchanka said about 70 percent of Belarus' industrial products  are sold to Russia, while the latter provided Minsk with 96  percent of its energy.    It's necessary for Belarus to establish an economic alliance  with Russia, "and we are going to restore economic ties with the  east," said the minister.    "However, such links are built on the basis of market  relations, instead of on the old mandatory orders and state  planning model" he stressed.    He said conditions will become ripe for Belarus to develop  ties with Western countries as the market relations between  Belarus and Eastern states progress steadily and grow better.    The foreign minister added that Belarus pursues a neutral  position in international affairs and maintains itself as a  nuclear-free state.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth </F> Clarke before his visit to France by LE FIGARO correspondent  Jacques Duplouich in London on 7 February -- first paragraph is  LE FIGARO introduction]    [Excerpts] Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke today  arrives in Paris for a 48-hour visit. He will meet Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery,  Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, Raymond Barre, and Bank of  France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet [passage omitted]    [Duplouich] Everyone agrees that you are a convinced  pro-European who is intent on establishing Great Britain at the  heart of Europe, following in the footsteps of John Major.  Unlike your European partners, you continue to harbor just as  many reservations as ever when it comes to Economic and Monetary  Union [EMU], the single currency, the European central bank, etc.    [Clarke] John Major's government is a pro-European  government. And I intend to ensure that Great Britain  participates fully in the implementation of the second phase of  EMU. Naturally, we have our own views on how the Union should  organize itself. Consequently, I would like to see greater  emphasis placed on the economic convergence of our countries  than on the arbitrary establishment of a calendar proclaiming  European integration. We are continuing to argue in favor of a  free market, of a privatized economy, and of anything that might  help us to resolve the structural causes of unemployment,  especially the costs incurred by business and the burden of  bureaucratic regulations.    [Duplouich] However, sterling is not going to rejoin the  exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) so  soon.    [Clarke] I still believe in the virtues of a system of  stable  parities, and the pound's Black Wednesday [16 September 1992]  did not make me change my mind on this. However, I am not  certain that the best way of obtaining stable parities will  involve reestablishing links between our currencies within  narrow bands of fluctuation. We will have to talk about this in  due course, when we have made progress regarding the convergence  of our economies. In any case, the pound will not rejoin the  exchange rate mechanism during the current British legislative  term, which will theoretically end in 1997.    [Duplouich] In order to remain competitive globally,  especially among the industrialized nations, will the countries  of the European Union have to simultaneously review both their  social legislation and their laws governing work organization?    [Clarke] Yes. However, please note that this does not mean  that they will have to break with their social traditions. On  the other hand, what they will have to do is trim off any  excesses, especially where they constitute an obstacle to  employment. We must do away with any provisions which have a  negative impact on competitiveness. We must take care not to  increase the costs of our businesses to such an extent that  their only way out consists of axing more jobs than necessary.  This demand explains our intransigence vis-a-vis our  continental partners regarding the social chapter of the  Maastricht Treaty. Once again, it is not a case of abolishing  social protection for employees, but rather of easing the burden  on businesses so that they can face up to competition from the  United States and Japan, among others.    [Duplouich] Given the current economic situation, do you  believe that the implementation of a legal minimum wage is  unwise?    [Clarke] Yes. There can be no doubt that it would indicate  good intentions, but in reality for businesses it represents an  expense per employee which far exceeds that to which they can  reasonably agree. This, in turn, weighs heavily on employment.    [Duplouich] Could the shorter working week be an answer to  unemployment?    [Clarke] To my mind, the approach in Europe to the  unemployment problem is fundamentally flawed. In fact, people  believe that the level of employment is fixed and that jobs must  now be shared. According to this argument, if everyone works  less and goes into retirement earlier, there will be more jobs  on the market. What are the effects of this approach? A  decline in competitiveness and an increase in the rate of job  losses. The system does not work. The proof of this is that in  certain European countries, which have the shortest working week  and the longest paid holidays in the world, unemployment is not  coming down either. On the contrary.    [Duplouich] What is your view on France's policy of a  "strong  franc?"    [Clarke] I note that it constituted the pillar of the  economic program of the Left, and that it is still the pillar of  the economic program of the current government. Of course, a  policy of this kind imposes constraints when there are divergent  monetary conditions in Germany, the Netherlands, and France.  For our part, we defended sterling until Black Wednesday in  September 1992. We then had to go ahead with a devaluation and,  at the same time, adopt a policy of rigorous monetary  discipline. I have already said that, contrary to the opinion  held by our so-called Euroskeptics, unlinking sterling from the  system of fixed parities accelerated economic recovery. I have  been following the French experiment, which has after all proven  partially similar to our own. The effects are different, but the  government which is seeking to defend the "strong franc" has my  support.</p>

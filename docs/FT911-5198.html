			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Japan appreciates its art - Saleroom FOR generations Japanese prints were regarded as works of art in the west but as little more than scraps of paper in 20th-century Japan. That is now changing, so much so that Sotheby's decided to sell the fine collection of Dr Walter Amstutz, the Swiss mountaineer and publisher, in Tokyo yesterday. With Japan rocked by scandals over the false values given by companies to their art purchases, and the economy off the boil, the auction did not do as well as expected - but the total of Pounds 2.1m, with 24 per cent unsold, was reasonable. The top price was the Pounds 241,886 paid by a Japanese dealer for a portrait by Tosusai Sharaku of the actor Iwai Hanshiro IV in the role of a woman - the practice in late 18th-century Japan - which was above its high estimate. A very similar print by the same artist was within forecast at Pounds 206,051. The big names among landscape artists, notably Hokusai and Hiroshige, sold well, but the Japanese were not interested in well designed prints where the colours had faded. A record price of Pounds 64,951 was paid for a print of salt maidens at a beach by Harunobu and the Pounds 62,711 paid for a print of an actor by Shunko was a record for his work. In Geneva on Sunday, auction house Hapsburg sold the Art of Breguet, a comprehensive collection of 204 works by the famed Swiss clock and watchmaker, for Pounds 5.5m. The auction was 25 per cent unsold by value. A carriage clock, the first of its kind made by Breguet, which Napoleon bought for 1,500 francs in 1798, sold for Pounds 321,950, but the top price was Pounds 626,000 - the highest sum paid at auction for a wristwatch - which secured the Sympathetique, a timepiece which is more like an astronomical clock made in gold. At the Isle of Wight the transport collection of Norman Ball was sold by Sotheby's for Pounds 930,955, with only 13 per cent unsold, an achievement at a time when the market for classic cars is particularly weak. A 1925 Hispano-Suiza seven-seat tourer went for Pounds 110,000, below estimate, as did a pair of Fowler BBI ploughing engines, both 70 years old, which sold for Pounds 42,350. The horse-drawn caravan of 'Prince' Gypsy Lee, who read palms in London's Portobello Road market for many years, was sold to a New York telephone bidder for Pounds 5,060.</p>

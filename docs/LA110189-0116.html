			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> 7,110-ACRE HOUSING PROJECT ENDORSED  </P> <P> A plan to build homes on 7,110 acres east of Orange received the unanimous  endorsement of the city Planning Commission on Wednesday.  </P> <P> When the development is complete, it is expected to contain up to 12,350 homes,  businesses, schools and parks.  </P> <P> The commission, by a 4-0 vote, recommended that the City Council approve the  East Orange General Plan, a joint proposal of the Irvine Co., which owns the  property, and the city. Commissioner Randy Bosch abstained.  </P> <P> Before approving the plan, commissioners made several changes, including  increasing the minimum lot size to 6,000 square feet and the minimum driveway  length to 20 feet, city planner Jere Murphy said.  </P> <P> In addition, commissioners said that they want a four-lane street, Jamboree  Road, to run north from Santiago Canyon Road to the Riverside Freeway before  any occupancy occurs in the development.  </P> <P> The City Council is tentatively scheduled to consider the plan at its Nov. 21  meeting.  </P></p>

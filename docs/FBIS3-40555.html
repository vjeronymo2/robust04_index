S.; Nasirullah  Babar: `All Pakistanis Living Outside the Country Including  Altaf Hussain Can Return to their Country but They Will Have To  Testify in Court;' the Legalization of the Purchase and Sale of  All Foreign Goods After the Payment of Customs Duty Has Been  Proposed; MASHRIQ Panel Interview: Habibur Rahman, Mohammad  Irshad and Shaukat Ali Yousufzai."]    [Text] Islamabad (MASHRIQ Panel): Federal Minister of the  Interior Nasirullah Babar has announced that, after the court  proceedings relating to the [drug] dealers on the wanted list,  have been completed in Pakistan, these individuals would be  handed over to the U.S.. In an interview with the MASHRIQ panel  held in the interior minister's office in Islamabad, the  minister said that the government was determined to establish  the supremacy of the law at any cost. He said that the "big  fish" of the drug dealing business, who were facing legal  charges in the U. S. or other countries, would first have to  complete all legal procedures in Pakistani courts, and, if found  guilty as charged, these individuals would then be handed over  to face court trials in other countries. He said that Pakistan  had bilateral agreements with other countries under which  Pakistan would have to extradite to these countries individuals  who had committed crimes there. He said that the present  government had no intention of shirking its international  responsibilities. In answer to a question regarding Murtaza  Bhutto, the minister of the interior said that under the policy  of ensuring that the law was implemented, any individual charged  with a crime, whether the individual was Murtaza Bhutto or Altaf  Hussain, would receive the same treatment under the law. He said  that the sentences pronounced against Murtaza Bhutto by the  military courts in his absence became null and void under a  former, general amnesty declared by the People's Party. The  minister added that certain charges against Murtaza Bhjutto,  including the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] hijacking  and the Shah Bandar case, were still pending, and that Murtaza  Bhutto would be given every opportunity to clear himself in a  court of law. The minister said that all Pakistanis residing in  foreign countries, including MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader  Altaf Hussain, would be free to return to Pakistan, but those  who were facing criminal charges would not be able to escape  legal proceedings. In answer to a question regarding the  increased smuggling of foreign products into Pakistan, the  minister agreed that no Pakistani government so far had  succeeded in stopping this pernicious practice. He said that, in  view of the fact that markets in smuggled goods existed all over  the country and thousands of individuals depended on them for  their livlihood, it would not be practicable to shut down this  activity entirely. He said that he had proposed that, after the  payment of customs duties on foreign goods at the sale centers,  these goods should be allowed free passage. In this way the  checkpoints set up on the GT road, which subjected Pakistanis to  humiliating searches and resulted in illegal goods being left  behind [not clear; or allowed to go free?] could be abolished.  In answer to a question regarding the unrestricted entry of  foreigners into Pakistan and the presence of foreign spies  pretending to be sailors, Babar criticized the actions of past  governments, which he said had adopted a generous policy of  issuing visas for free travel between Pakistan and India and  which had ended the restriction on obtaining a confirmation from  the police before granting visas. The minister said that,  whereas in the past hardly eight or ten visas daily were granted  to individuals wishing to come to Pakistan from India, the [new]  policy had given rise to the undesirable practice of granting up  to 800 visas daily. The minister said that the present  government had reviewed the policy, and it was hoped that the  situation would gradually return to normal.</p>

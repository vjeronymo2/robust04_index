			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / US budget set to enter realm of realism: Vision of Change may have to THE Clinton administration must be delighted by the reaction of the US bond market to the economic package unveiled last week. The stunning decline in long yields - to well under 7 per cent - potentially provides a far more important boost to growth than Mr Clinton's so-called short-term economic stimulus. But the package is selling less well on Capitol Hill, where many conservative Democrats worry that the emphasis on tax increases and new spending programmes could prove a political liability. And, unlike the bond market, the Washington think-tank community is far from convinced that the budgetary austerity promised towards the end of Mr Clinton's term will prove sufficient to get the deficit under control. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, promised a package without the customary 'smoke and mirrors'. He only partially succeeded. One of the most misleading aspects of the plan is the claimed Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21.1bn) short-term stimulus. What the administration has really done is draw a circle around some of the measures and call that a stimulus; other measures that will reduce demand, such as the rise in personal tax rates backdated to January 1 this year, are excluded from these calculations. The final table on the last page of A Vision of Change for America gives the game away. This shows that policy changes will increase the structural budget deficit (the deficit adjusted for the business cycle) by a negligible Dollars 12.7bn in fiscal 1993 and reduce it by no less than Dollars 38.9bn in fiscal 1994. In other words, fiscal policy will be contractionary to the tune of Dollars 26.3bn over the next two years; the stimulus is thus almost entirely an illusion, which is one reason, of course, why bond prices are soaring. In Washington, however, the main focus is on longer-term measures. 'The plan does not solve the deficit problem once and for all. We will have to return to this,' says Mr Rudolph Penner, economics director at accountants KMPG Peat Marwick and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office. Mr Gene Steuerle, a former senior Treasury official now at the Urban Institute, agrees. He says it is useless to pretend that a great deal of deficit reduction can be achieved with a package that limits significant spending cuts to defence and significant tax increases to the affluent. 'A Dollars 150 energy tax is not a solution when you have a deficit per household of Dollars 3,000 a year.' The table showing changes in the structural budget deficit illustrates how limited the administration's goals really are. Whereas past deficit-cutting packages aimed to eliminate the structural deficit, the Clinton team is not even trying to get it below Dollars 200bn, or close to 3 per cent of GDP. After the election Mr Clinton said he would get the ratio of debt to GDP back on a declining trend. Mr Steuerle's calculations, however, show the debt/GDP ratio rising steadily - from 53.5 per cent this year to 56.6 per cent in 1998. The balance of the Clinton package is being attacked on several grounds. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies points out that the plan calls for Dollars 3-Dollars 4 of tax increases for every Dollars 1 of net spending cuts. That compares with a ratio of Dollars 2.75 in spending cuts for every Dollars 1 in tax increases advocated in a bipartisan budget-cutting plan published by the centre last year. But while sensitive to this argument, many Democrats also worry about the timing of tax and spending changes. Tax increases take effect this year and next, but significant spending reductions are delayed until after congressional elections at the end of 1994. Too often in the past spending cuts scheduled three or four years down the road have failed to materialise. The sheer momentum of spending programmes should not be under-estimated. The Bush administration wanted to control spending, but over its four years federal outlays actually rose 29 per cent in cash terms - in spite of a sharp fall in real spending on defence. The Clinton team is recommending Dollars 160bn of investment incentives and new programme spending in areas such as infrastructure, education and technology, yet projecting a total increase in federal outlays over four years of only about 15 per cent - half the increase under President Bush. Since spending on entitlement programmes is expected to rise by more than 20 per cent, the overall restraint is achieved only by projecting zero growth over four years in discretionary programmes. Even allowing for deep defence cuts, critics wonder if that is feasible. There are also doubts about the revenue projections: the increase of roughly one-third in marginal tax rates on wealthy individuals and on unincorporated small business may lead to increased use of tax shelters and lower than expected receipts. Even allowing for faster economic growth than factored for in budget projections, the view of many Washington experts is that Mr Clinton may have to scale back his planned spending increases and investment incentives to make his deficit-cutting package fully credible. In a reverse of historical precedent it could just be that new members of Congress - the Ross Perot class of 1992 - will force the president to be more realistic.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT                        (Fiscal years, Dollars bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Estimate                               1993   1994   1995   1996   1997   1998  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Baseline deficit             319.2  301.3  285.9  297.0  346.3  389.7 Cyclical component            68.8   51.6   36.3   24.0   16.8   16.1 Deposit insurance              6.9    7.9   -4.0  -12.5  -11.3   -7.3 Baseline structural deficit  245.5  241.8  263.6  285.5  340.8  380.9 Effect of policy proposals    12.7  -38.9  -54.2  -91.7 -139.8 -148.3 Proposed structural deficit  258.2  202.9  209.4  193.8  201.0  232.6 Debt/GDP (%)                  53.5   54.8   55.5   55.7   55.9   56.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Clinton plan and Urban Institute  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

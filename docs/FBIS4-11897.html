			<p>BFN     [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: The National Salvation  Revolution [NSR] believes in dialogue as a procedure and method  for finding solutions to numerous and thorny issues. That was  evident from the broad consultative conferences which were held  throughout the country, which produced truly Sudanese views on  solutions to numerous complicated internal issues. On this same  basis, the NSR is pursuing the same procedure and using the same  method for dialogue to remove misunderstandings which might  occur between Sudan and any other state. This is what Sudan has  always called and striven for, that is: To place relations  between ourselves and the United States in their correct  framework on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference in  the country's internal affairs. Colleague Najm al-Din Muhammad  Ahmad wrote the following commentary on the visit to this  country last Thursday [31 March] by Madeleine Albright, the U.S.  delegate to the United Nations, which he will now read:    [Najm al-Din] The two-hour visit to the country by  Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the U.S. delegate to the United  Nations, during which she met Lieutenant General 'Umar  al-Bashir, president of the Republic, was regarded in diplomatic  and official circles as a true beginning to serious dialogue  between our country and the United States. The United States  has displayed flagrant hostility towards Sudan since the  beginning of the National Salvation Revolution in 1989, without  Sudan committing a sin or without issuing anything which in the  least harmed these relations. For this reason, we know, just as  the whole world does, that the United States itself, and not  others, is the one and only country responsible for the state of  estrangement and indeed hostility that has been a characteristic  tarnishing relations between the two countries. Evidence, facts  and the practices of that great power have demonstrated this,  for that country is the one that started all this through an  economic boycott, beginning in 1989, within the framework of a  policy of pressure -- which it always pursues towards states and  peoples that strive to liberate their will and build themselves  through self-reliance.    The superpower was not content with that. It led a feverish  campaign in international forum when the weapon of economic  pressure did not succeed. America has been drawing on this  weapon against Sudan to make it bow or retreat, even an inch,  from all the programs and plans which have crystallized through  the numerous dialogue conferences in which the people of Sudan  joined forces. The result was a comprehensive national  strategic plan which laid down a cure for all the diseases and  maladies of the state. Sudan began to implement this plan with  every confidence and ability, in order to achieve the superstate  of Sudan, which it sought with the help of God.    We say: When the weapon of economic pressure did not  (?finish off) a free, noble people like the people of Sudan, the  United States resorted to campaigns in which it looked for  excuses to condemn Sudan and justify its direct interference in  Sudan's internal affairs, exploiting that so-called  international organization, the United Nations, in which it is  represented by the visitor who came to our country as a dear and  honored guest. She was granted the honor of meeting the  president of the Republic, who cleared up matters and removed  every obscurity or ambiguity in her mind about issues and  ambiguities. We hope she will be able to convey all the facts  she heard, the documents she acquainted herself with and the  information she was given on all her queries so as to thaw the  thick ice in relations between Sudan and her country -- or, that  at least, we can count on this as being the beginning of the  road leading to that. When the weapon of economic pressure  failed, the United States, which since the collapse of the  communist bloc has always brandished a stick at whoever disobeys  or tries to disobey it, led a campaign in which it desperately  attempted to distort Sudan's image in world opinion. This  endeavor reached its climax when the great power threw the name  of Sudan falsely onto the American list for terrorism, without  citing any convincing proof to justify the allegation, labeling  as terrorists people who profess a religion that discards  violence and calls on people to embrace it amicably.    The United States has always been accustomed to attaching  the label of terrorism to any honorable, proud, and free state,  forgeting or pretending to forget that it, that is to say, the  United States, in reality -- according to evidence -- sponsors  terrorism and protects those who practice terrorism. It also  assists those who terrify peaceful people and it spreads terror  and a lack of tranquility among peoples. No two people disagree  on U.S. support for organized international terrorism.  Moreover, its support for terrorism in Sudan is represented by  the direct moral support which it gives, just as it gave  generously to the rebel movement through the Washington  Symposium, and its sponsorship of the rebellion's assertion,  which favors the separation of southern Sudan from the rest of  the country.    U.S. support for terrorism in Sudan does not limit itself to  moral support --it exceeds it to give material support and  indirectly supply the rebel movement with the necessary  equipment through its allies and pawns. In all this hostility  and incitement, the United States proceeds from the bases of its  flagrant hostility to Islam. While it does so, it takes into  account the fact that Islam is the logical alternative to  remolding the world on the basis of justice and equality, and  absence of injustice after having suffered injustice and  oppression under U.S. attempts at hegemony and domination.    This is naturally not the conviction of the Sudanese people  alone but the conviction of all Muslim peoples in all parts of  the world. We say this, but, at the same time, we welcome the  dialogue between Sudan and the United States, which we regard as  having seriously begun with all openness and frankness.  However, we only hope that the United States will continue its  dialogue with us, while bearing in mind the principles of the  Sudanese people, which we cannot abandon or deviate from. These  principles are represented by Sudan's cultural orientations.  The United States ought to know that Sudan's cultural option  was not manufactured by the Sudanese Government, inasmuch as it  is the option of the widespread national will.    This matter is not confined to the Sudanese people but it  goes beyond them, becoming one of the concerns of the Islamic  nation as a whole. Consequently, the United States is faced  with an historic test and should show some readiness, however  limited, to respect other peoples' options. It is now entering  a dialogue with Sudan to rehabilitate its relations and  eliminate misunderstandings, caused by the United States in the  first instance -- that is, if it so wishes. God grant us  success.</p>

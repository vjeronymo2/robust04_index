On May 21, 1993, El Paso states that it filed modifications to the comparable discount provisions in compliance with the Commission's order dated May 6, 1993, which granted rehearing in part of the October 9, 1992 order. El Paso states that the Commission, in its March 1, 1994 order, found that it was a mistake to apply the comparable discount requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 to El Paso prior to restructuring and the spin-off of its merchant division. Accordingly, El Paso states, the Commission reversed its prior decision to require comparable discounts under the requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 before pre-restructuring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that it is filing in compliance with the March 1, 1994 order.

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Genscher quits after 18 years: Foreign minister's departure may create fresh strains in Kohl coalition MR HANS-DIETRICH Genscher, Germany's foreign minister for the past 18 years, yesterday stunned the political establishment in Bonn by announcing his decision to resign next month. His move marks the end of an era in German foreign policy, and is likely to cause new strains within the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The government is already struggling with severe budget constraints, facing the danger of a prolonged public service strike, and slipping in popularity in the polls. Mr Genscher's successor was named as Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, 50, formerly the state secretary for European affairs, and most recently construction minister. Her automatic appointment - she comes from the same minority Free Democratic Party (FDP) as Mr Genscher - was criticised by the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian-based sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). The chancellor was obviously anxious to avoid any major cabinet reshuffle at a sensitive time. He faced the simultaneous embarrassment of a second resignation, that of Mrs Gerda Hasselfeldt, the health minister. Her closest adviser is being investigated on suspicion of espionage. She was instantly replaced by a CSU colleague. Only four weeks ago the government was faced by the sudden resignation of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, and the most senior CDU Minister after Mr Kohl, in a row over arms deliveries to Turkey. In spite of the upheaval, the chancellor insisted yesterday that the resignations would not weaken his government. He paid warm tribute to the extraordinary service of Mr Genscher, saying his decision to go was entirely personal, and understandable in the light of his long service - 23 years in all as a cabinet minister. 'In these 23 years, German unity became possible, and also the breakthrough on the way to political union in Europe,' Mr Kohl said. 'In all of that, Hans-Dietrich Genscher played a decisive part. With his own inimitable personal handwriting, he has written a significant part in the history book of our country and our people.' European colleagues also paid tribute to Mr Genscher. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said he was saddened at his resignation, calling him an outstanding leader who helped unify Germany. A word with Mr Genscher by telephone or at international meetings 'has always been worth 100 official telegrams,' he said. European Commission president Jacques Delors said Mr Genscher would be sorely missed. In a television interview last night, Mr Genscher confirmed he was not a candidate to succeed Mr Richard Weizsacker as German president. He has also made clear that he is not interested in succeeding Mr Delors at the European Commission. In his letter of resignation - requesting to leave office on May 17, the 18th anniversary of his appointment as foreign minister - Mr Genscher gave no clear indication of the reasons for his departure. He said only that the step was 'right and necessary.' Aged 65, it is known that he has suffered from heart problems in recent years, including at least one serious heart attack, although his wife Barbara said health was not a factor in his decision to quit. Since unification, however, Mr Genscher has appeared to have less influence on German policy, with Chancellor Kohl taking the lead in relations with other EC member states and the US. Mr Genscher told colleagues in the FDP executive he wished to devote more time to the course of German unification. Coming from the east German town of Halle - he fled to the west in 1952 - he has always sought to promote the needs of the former East Germany in the West. Mrs Schwaetzer will face a huge challenge filling the international role of Mr Genscher, although she is a tough negotiator, and well experienced in EC affairs. According to members of the FDP, she agreed to withdraw her name from the contest for future leadership of the party - to succeed Mr Otto Lambsdorff - in return for her party nomination to succeed Mr Genscher. Mr Kohl made it clear yesterday that he regarded the Foreign Ministry as the preserve of the FDP for the life of the current government. But it seems less likely, after the resignation of Mr Genscher, that the minority party will be able to keep it in a future coalition.

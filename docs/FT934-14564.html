			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers fifth consecutive record high Bourses moved in different directions yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH refused to be diverted from its record setting ways and share prices registered a fifth consecutive closing high. The SMI index added 15.4 to 2,586.4, supported by the firm dollar, lower money market rates and technical trade connected with the expiry of options and futures today. Sandoz registered shares added SFr30 to SFr3,300 with its nine months figures proving in line with expectations. Ciba-Geigy registered shares shed SFr8 to SFr710 in continued response to Wednesday's warning that full year profits would be higher but the rise would be limited by economic conditions. Nestle was actively traded, rising SFr23 to SFr1,142 on futures related buying by foreign investors. Surveillance, the quality control group added SFr45 to SFr1,840 ahead of an extraordinary shareholders meeting today which will decide on a share capital cut. FRANKFURT fell for the second time this week below the 2,000 level in trading that was largely dominated by the expiration of futures and options today. The DAX index ended down 11.44 at 1,990.07 in turnover down to DM7.4bn from DM8.5bn. In a declining market Schering was one of the day's exceptions as investors continued to flock to the stock on news earlier this week that it intended to increase production of its drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The shares put on DM44 or 4 per cent to DM1,113. Allianz slipped DM27 or 1 per cent to DM2,680. Merrill Lynch has recommended a switch out of Allianz into Munich Re, down yesterday DM30 to DM3,420, on the basis that, by comparison, the latter is undervalued at present. Merrill commented that Munich Re, as the largest pure European insurer, should benefit the most from an improvement in prospects for the reinsurance industry. PARIS reflected disappointment that interest rates had been left unchanged, given expectation on Wednesday that a cut was imminent. The decision may also have prompted further speculation against the franc, while Mr George Soros, in an interview with a German magazine, argued that the French authorities should cut short term rates drastically to motivate the economy. The CAC-40 index closed down 13.40 at 2,113.88 in turnover of some FFr3bn. Kleinwort Benson in its latest monthly review of the market maintains an overweight position on the assumption that interest rate cuts will come in the near term. Lowering their target for short term rates to 6 per cent by the end of the year from 4 per cent previously, they comment that given that France has underperformed both Germany and Europe recently a correction seems overdue. BSN lost FFr16 to FFr854 in reaction to its announcement that it will launch a new promotional campaign tomorrow which is aimed at reducing its loss of market share. Some commentators noted that the cost of the campaign is likely to outweigh immediate benefits. MADRID put in a firm performance as the Bank of Spain took advantage of this week's good underlying inflation figures and the stability of the peseta to cut its key money rate to 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent. The general index rose 1.88 to 296.83 with some of the best performances seen in the recently underperforming utilities sector. BRUSSELS rose on expectations that interest rates might be cut as the local currency again came under pressure. The Bel-20 index added 14.26 to 1,362.71 in turnover of BFr2.2bn. Among the day's main leaders, Solvay rose 5.3 per cent to BFr13,400 but off the day's high of BFr13,700. AMSTERDAM continued to build on Unilever which has been gaining ground recently on news that branded goods groups are maintaining market share in the US. The shares closed up a further Fl 4.10 to Fl 207.90 as the CBS Tendency index put on 0.6 to 129.4. Philips added 60 cents to Fl 36.60 on news that it was to cut output of televisions. MILAN marked time as investors closed positions on the last day of the October trading account and prepared for the forthcoming flurry of rights issues beginning with Fiat's issue today. The Comit index rose 0.61 to 568.64. Fiat shed L87 to L5,623 while Italmobiliare, which is also seeking capital, shed L960 or 2.7 per cent to L34,560. A technical recovery was seen in the ordinary stocks of a number of privatisation candidates that have been marked down this week as investors switched into savings shares. Credito Italiano rose L27 to L2,233 while BCI finished L19 ahead at L4,369. Sip, the domestic telephone operator, edged up L32 to L3,445 the holding company, Stet put on L30 to L3,870.

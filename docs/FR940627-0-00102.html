			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Feral pigs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sus scrofa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) have been in the Waianae Mountains for about 150 years and are known to be one of the major current modifiers of forest habitats (Stone 1985). Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor and encourage the expansion of alien plants that are better able to exploit the newly tilled soils than are native taxa (Stone 1985). Pigs also disseminate alien plant taxa through their feces and on their bodies, accelerating the spread of alien plant taxa within the native forest. Present throughout the Waianae Mountains in low numbers, feral pigs pose a potential threat as some pig trails and rooting have been seen in the general areas of all three plant taxa included in this rule. The rooting was localized and no direct damage to any of the three plant taxa was noted. However, this situation could change very quickly (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2, 1992b3, 1992c5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Illegal collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes or excessive visits by individuals interested in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to all of the taxa included in this final rule, but especially to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea grimesiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is known from only a single population of five plants, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is known from only one population of two probable clones. Collection of whole plants or reproductive parts of these taxa could cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival of the taxa. Disturbance to the area by human trampling also could promote erosion and greater ingress by competing alien taxa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Introduced slugs have been observed to feed on ripe fruits and seeds of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea grimesiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This predation could seriously affect the reproduction of this taxon (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). In addition, rats ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rattus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) and feral goats ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capra hircus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), as well as feral pigs, are known from the area and damage to fruits, seeds, and plants from their foraging on other plant taxa has been observed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Of the three taxa in this final rule, two have populations located on private land, one on State land, and one on Federal land.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diellia unisora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is known only from Federal and private lands;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is known only from State land;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea grimesiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is known only from private lands. Federal listing automatically results in listing under Hawaii State law, which prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies. State regulations prohibit the removal, destruction, or damage of plants found on State lands. However, the regulations are difficult to enforce because of limited personnel. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or wild plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Listing of these three plant taxa, therefore, reinforces and supplements the protection available to the taxa under State law. The Federal Act also offers additional protection to these three taxa because it is a violation of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The small number of populations and individuals of all of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. All three taxa in this rule are known from three or fewer populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining to issue this final rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list these three plant taxa as endangered. These taxa are known from fewer than five populations. The three taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and competition from alien plants; habitat degradation and potential predation by feral animals, particularly pigs; and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws which are already in effect. Small population size and limited distribution make these taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because these three taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

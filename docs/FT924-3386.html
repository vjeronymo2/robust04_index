			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Apple plans dial-up services for PC users APPLE Computer plans to introduce dial-up information services for users of its personal computers and future personal communications products. The company has licensed the technology from America Online, the fourth-largest US provider of computer information services. Online information services give PC users access to a range of information, such as stock market reports, news and weather. They also provide electronic shopping and banking services and enable PC users to communicate via electronic mail systems. Use of such services is expected to grow rapidly with the proliferation of portable PCs and a new generation of 'personal communicators' that combine the functions of a PC, a cellular telephone and a facsimile machine. Apple said it would manage and market its own information services, based upon America Online technology. The two companies also plan to work together to develop enhancements to America Online services and to establish the technology as a standard. Apple will use the America Online technologies to create an improved version of its existing AppleLink global electronic communications system. AppleLink, which enables Apple employees and the company's suppliers to communicate electronically, is not available to the public. The system is used by about 50,000 people, Apple said. As part of the agreement between Apple and America Online, Apple received warrants to buy around 10 per cent of the online services company's stock for Dollars 1.3m over the next five years. Apple will also pay royalties for the use of America Online's technology. America Online currently has about 180,000 subscribers to its information services.</p>

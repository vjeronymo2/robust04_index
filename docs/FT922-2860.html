			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: GPA on the runway The latest airline price war in the US is unfortunately timed from GPA's point of view. It may be a short-term phenomenon, but it is a sober reminder that the fortunes of the world's biggest aircraft leasing group ultimately depend on the profitability of its customers. As BA's annual report pointed out last week, airlines' losses on international scheduled services totalled Dollars 4bn last year. Investors will be unwise therefore to subscribe for GPA's public offer if they are not confident that the air transport sector is set to resume its upward flight path in the mid and late 1990s. It is hard to fault GPA's recent record. The company has come through a turbulent period with minimal damage to earnings. It has an enviable, and possibly unparalleled, knowledge of the market, notably of the smaller carriers and the associated credit risks. It is financially innovative, as last week's successful Dollars 520m issue of securitised aircraft leases clearly demonstrated. This capacity to raise new capital, though, is crucial to GPA's long-term survival, as the prospectus frankly admits. There are commitments to buy almost Dollars 12bn of new aircraft by the end of the century, but only enough money in the kitty to take the group through to next June. So far GPA has avoided the worst effects of declining lease rates and lower residual values - but it cannot do so indefinitely without a market recovery. It has been hard for the advisers to price the risks - but a prospective 9-10 times multiple is probably fair at this uncertain stage in the cycle.</p>

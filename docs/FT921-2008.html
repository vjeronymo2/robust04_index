			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Barclays to implement 3% offer BARCLAYS BANK is to implement a pay deal for 70,000 employees averaging slightly more than 3 per cent - the lowest among the big four in recent years - in spite of union opposition. The implementation of the increase on Monday signals a tougher line by the banks on pay and conditions. The Barclays pay package will be implemented in spite of a ballot concluded yesterday by Bifu, the financial services union, which showed a majority of members in favour of industrial action. Members of the Barclays Group Staff Union (BGSU) have voted against the pay offer and are being consulted by their leaders on whether they want to vote on industrial action. In spite of the union votes, it is extremely unlikely that there will be industrial action at the bank. Bifu is investigating the possibility of joint action with BGSU. Although it has not given the results of its ballot, it admits that the majority in favour was narrow and that the turnout was low. Barclays' offer would raise salaries of its 70,000 non-managerial staff by between Pounds 230 and Pounds 535 a year, representing rises of between 4 per cent and 2.5 per cent. Salaries would vary between Pounds 5,958 and Pounds 18,674 after the implementation of the settlement, which is payable from the beginning of February, the settlement date.</p>

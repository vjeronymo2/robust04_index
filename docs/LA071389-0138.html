			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINAL REPORT ORDERED ON MALIBU GOLF PROJECT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission on Wednesday ordered  completion of a final environmental impact report on a controversial project to  transform a 340-acre Malibu canyon into a private 18-hole golf course and  country club.  </P> <P> The project was widely attacked at Wednesday's hearing by environmental  consultants and homeowners groups who want to preserve the wild area. Local  conservationists say the Malibu Country Club proposal would threaten sensitive  watersheds, destroy wildlife and vegetation, and worsen traffic congestion.  </P> <P> However, at least two planning commissioners, Paul Robinson and Lee Strong,  said they favor the project, especially if the final environmental study,  prepared by consultants to the developers, answers critical questions about  sewage disposal and parking. That report is expected to be presented to the  commission Aug. 17.  </P> <P> "I think some serious thought has gone into it, and I think it's a good project  for that area," Strong said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Grading  </P> <P> The $35-million project, if approved, would allow grading of more than 5  million cubic yards of earth and the construction of 60 homes, a  52,000-square-foot clubhouse, six tennis courts, two restaurants, a swimming  pool and underground parking. It would be located on land recently sold by  comedian Bob Hope to the Sun Pacific Co., a development group, which contends  that the exclusive golf complex would be a good use for the upscale Malibu  area.  </P> <P> Several environmental consultants hired by the Corral Canyon Homeowners Assn.  disagreed during the three-hour public hearing Wednesday. They said that the  development would irreparably harm several environmentally sensitive wildlife  habitats and that the proposed use of pesticides would threaten drinking water  supplies. And they said not enough study has been done at the site, which is in  a landslide area and is crossed by the Malibu Coast Fault.  </P> <P> "It is a fantasy to even think that you could restore the area to its natural  state," said Rudi Mattoni, a population biologist. The developers have said  they plan to restore natural vegetation and wildlife once the golf course is  built.  </P> <P> The site, between Corral Canyon and Puerco Canyon roads north of Pacific Coast  Highway, has been sought by the National Park Service for inclusion in the  Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. However, insufficient funds  and the developers' wish to pursue the golf course project have blocked  acquisition plans.  </P> <P> Sidney McClue Jr., executive vice president of Sun Pacific, told commissioners  that the project offers a chance to preserve up to 95% of the project as open  space.  </P> <P> "Golf course management is an extremely sophisticated science today," he said.  "We will avoid significant impacts to vegetation, water and wildlife."  </P> <P> McClue downplayed the impact of the vast amount of grading proposed at the  site, saying the commissioners should "look not at each individual part . . .  but at the sum of the parts."  </P> <P> However, Commissioner Betty Fisher said the panel needs to consider the large  scope of the project, its impact on traffic and sewage and whether it is  consistent with the lland use plan for Malibu.  </P> <P> "This is a huge project, and we might as well admit as much," she said. "We  just can't put that aside. And we'd better be very, very sure that if we  approve this project, all of these important questions are answered."  </P></p>

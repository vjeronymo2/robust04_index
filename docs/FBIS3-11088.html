			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Powdered Milk Import Permit Eliminated    The government has passed new control measures affecting a  number of agricultural products aimed at preventing imported  goods from hurting the market, and has deregulated foreign  purchases of powdered milk.    Yesterday the Higher Foreign Trade Council voted to increase  the duty on beans, set references prices for lentils, chickpeas,  broad beans, and kidney beans, and maintained the import permit  for cut-up chicken.    The duty on kidney beans rose from 15 to 20 percent. The  Ministry of Agriculture explained that the measure is an attempt  to promote crop diversification and substitution programs being  carried out in depressed areas.    In the case of cotton, it was decided to adopt permanently  the 10-percent duty that had been set on a provisional basis.    The reference prices set for four types of grain are an  attempt to establish a base value aimed at helping customs  authorities to identify cases of underbilling on imports.    Powdered milk imports were deregulated based on a possible  shortfall on the domestic market.    The decision to maintain the restriction on cut-up chicken  was made because it poses a continuing threat to national  producers.    On the recommendation of the National Narcotics Council, it  was also decided to include acetic anhydride and toluene on the  list of products requiring an import permit.    According to the Council, these products, which are used in  the paint industry, could be entering the country for the  purpose of producing illicit drugs.    Minister of Foreign Trade Juan Manuel Santos said that one  of  the most important measures was the adoption of the trade  protection system based on which the government will be able to  impose duties or quotas on imported products that seriously  affect local production.    "If the national and international situation indicates that  there may be a serious threat to national production, protection  of a given sector will be justified," Santos explained.    "This is a clause applied throughout the world and Colombia  had simply delayed passing it," he added.  <H5>  Tariff and Cars </H5>   The foreign trade oversight agency also ratified the  automotive agreement between Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.    According to Santos Calderon, an order will be issued next  week setting the import duty on vehicles at 35 percent.    The order helps luxury automobiles, the duty on which is now  40 percent. However, other types of vehicles will pay 35 percent.    For commercial vehicles such as vans (panel trucks) and  ambulances, the duty will drop from 20 to 15 percent.    In addition, and as this daily newspaper announced  yesterday,  a system of safeguards was defined. This is a mechanism making  it possible to establish temporary protection against an unusual  increase in imports of a product hurting national production.    For agriculture and fishing, the safeguard will consist of a  surtariff.    Manufactured products may also request a surtariff and, in  extreme cases, an import quota.    The issue of environmental requirements governing imported  gasoline will be taken up at the next Council meeting.  <H5>  [Box, p 12A] </H5> <H5>  Cattlemen Reject Imported Milk </H5>   The Antioquia Cattlemen's Federation (FADEGAN) and Milk  Cooperative (COLANTA) have emphatically rejected the  deregulation of powdered milk imports, which had been required  to have import permits since the middle of last year.    In a letter sent to Ministers Rudolf Hommes (Finance), Juan  Manuel Santos (Foreign Trade), and Jose Antonio Ocampo  (Agriculture), the Antioquia Cattlemen are asking that the  import permit be retained.    FADEGAN says its position "in no way means that we defend  excessive protectionism."    The cattlemen also insist that allowing powdered milk to  enter the country is a step backward, and warn of "the harmful  consequences which this measure will have for the rural  producer."    In 1993, the livestock sector and dairy industry both  experienced one of their worst crises ever. The difficult  situation forced pasturizers to lower the price of milk and the  government to institute the import permit in order to bolster  national milk production.    COLANTA, an association of 9,000 milk producers in  Antioquia,  Cordoba, and the coffee belt, argues that foreign milk is a  danger to Colombian industry, which has to compete with the high  subsidies granted by wealthy nations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States and North Korea held a  working-level contact in New York early this morning, Korean  time, and discussed additional inspections [chuga sachal],  including the inspection related to the replacement of fuel rods.    Gary Samore, chief of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Department  of the State Department, and Kenneth Quinones, the official in  charge of North Korean affairs, represented the U.S. side, and  Han Song-yol, counselor at the North Korean UN Mission, and  (Hyon Hak-pong), secretary at the mission, represented the North  Korean side at the contact.    Today's contact took place for the United States to deliver  its reply to the 5 May letter from Kang Sok-chu, first vice  foreign minister of North Korea. The United States reportedly  notified North Korea that no further dialogue would be possible  if an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team  were not allowed to carry out appropriate inspection activities  [chokchorhan sachal hwaltong]. However, the United States  reportedly asked North Korea to quickly reach an agreement with  the IAEA over technological problems concerning additional  inspections, hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, and  resolve the nuclear issue quickly without breaking the UN  Security Council's tentative deadline of mid-May, thus, strongly  hinting that it intends to resume working-level talks.</p>

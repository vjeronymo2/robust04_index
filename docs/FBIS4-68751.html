			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The New Parliament: In Anticipation </F> of Compromises? Some Thoughts After the Elections"]    [Text] The 1994 elections have provided a genuine criterion  of specifically what the concept "political party" means for the  population. It was revealed that--due to the throngs of  independent candidates--voters were inclined to prefer persons  who represent those political forces with whom they can identify  as to convictions and personal likes. Given the lack of  well-known names on the ballots of most Ukrainian election  districts, for many voters a candidate's political affiliation  became almost the only criterion of his convictions.  Moreover--as attested to by data from pre-election sociological  polls conducted by the "Democratic Initiative"  Center--candidates' party affiliation was a plus for 71 percent  of the voters. The information which motivated a voter  identified his convictions with certain stereotypes of public  opinion: the communists--with a revival of the super-state and a  "Brezhnev-type" economic stability, or with "Russification,"  repressions, and hunger; the nationalists--with strength and  order, or with hostility and rancor; the professionals and  centrists--with economic reforms, or with marking time. Also of  great importance for the course and end results of the elections  were regional specifics--the decline of prosperity in Ukraine's  traditionally industrial regions added to the votes cast for  members of the communist and socialist parties. The socialists  influenced voters by their special interests in solving the  problems of rural inhabitants and those of Western Ukraine--a  region which has traditionally favored right-wingers. Quite a  few voters in Galicia and in Central Ukraine gave preference to  those representatives of the national-democratic forces who  advocated a path of gradual political and economic reforms. As a  result, out of the 340 deputies to the new parliament, a  preponderant majority (242 deputies) represent political parties.    The practical activity of this past parliament indicates  that--one way or another--non-party deputies still gravitate  toward this or that political force. From this point of view it  seems feasible to present the non-party Ukrainian people's  deputies within the general context of political forces in our  country's newly elected highest legislative organ.  <H8>  Representatives of Right-Wing, Non-Democratic Forces </H8>   As expected, the right-wing political forces were unable to  achieve any great success in the elections. Despite all the  advertsing ballyhoo, none of the leaders or members of the  extreme right-wing Docial-National Party of Ukraine could "make  it" even to the second round. And of the persons supported by  the associations known as the "State Independence of Ukraine,"  only Anatoliy Makhlay "made it" to the second round in the  Vinnitsa region, but he lost therein. The Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party came though the elections with slightly better  results. The leader of this party--Stepan Khmara-was elected in  the very first round, and a member of this party--Roman  Kuper--prevailed in the second round. A certain degree of  success was also achieved by the UNA [Ukrainian National  Assembly]. The following three candidates of the UNA were  victorious in the election "lottery": Yuriy Tym, who "captured"  the votes of Chortkov's voters right in the first round, Oleh  Vitovych, who "got by" the chairman of the Lvov Oblast  Council--Mykola Horyn--and Yaroslav Illyasevych, who beat the  well-known economist--Zoryslav Romovskyy. The practical work of  the parliament will show whether Ukrainian politics will be  influenced by this 0.9 percent of the deputies' seats which have  swung to the right.  <H8>  National Democrats </H8>   The best results among the right-wing parties were achieved  by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]. Although the  leader of the KUN--Slava Stetsko--was unable (for reasons beyond  her control) to take part in the struggle for a deputy's seat,  three members of the KUN--Roman Krutsyk, Ivan Bilas, and  Mykhaylo Ratushnyy--were elected to the office of Ukrainian  people's deputy in the very first round, and in the second round  three more members of this party were victorious--Hryhoriy  Demyan, Taras Protseyat, and Lev Glukhivskyy. One deputy--Petro  Shvydkyy--will represent the political position of the  Nationwide Movement of Ukraine in the parliament; its  leader-Larysa Skoryk--was not elected to the parliament.    These elections turned out to be a stunning defeat for the  KNDS [Congress of National Democratic Forces]--a fact which many  analysts have connected with the erroneous tactic of the KNDS in  supporting structures which have lost the trust of Ukrainian  voters. Elections were lost by the leaders of the  association--Mykhaylo and Bohdan Horyn, Mikhaylo Batih, Roman  Ivanychuk, Pavlo Kyslyy, Dmytro Pavlychko, Oles Shevchenko, and  Oleksandr Hudym. It is already clear that this political force  has no future prospects, and even its members acting separately  will not be able to create a strong faction in the parliament.  Although two members of the Democratic Party--Volodymyr Mulyava  and Stepan Volkovetskyy--were able to become people's deputies  as a result of the very first round of elections, this party's  chairman--Volodymyr Yavorivskyy--was unable to win right away.  And, therefore, the parliamentary faction of the Democratic  Party, which consists of five members of parliament, will not be  able to play an independent role. The situation in the Ukrainian  Republican Party is similar. The absence of this party's leaders  in the parliament will certainly not be compensated for by its  deputation of nine members, among whom the best-known are Mykola  Horbal and Yevhen Pronyuk.    The success of the NRU [People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)]  in the first round of elections can be termed an event worthy of  amazement. The election during the first round of this party's  leader--Vyacheslav Chornovil--plus its leading activists--Serhiy  Holovatyy and Les Tanyuk--as well as Volodymyr Lanovoy, whom  Rukh supports, together with a continuation of the election  struggle by 43 NRU members and 45 independent candidates also  supported by Rukh, attests to the fact that the NRU faction in  parliament will become the nucleus of the national-democratic  opposition; the latter will be joined by the remaining deputies  with the same orientation. The elections have dispelled yet  another myth concerning the NRU--namely that this organization  is predominantly one of a Western Ukrainian nature. During the  second round Rukh representatives came to the fore in almost all  the election districts in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, as well as in  many districts of Vinnitsa, Dnepropetrovsk, Kirovograd, Sumy,  Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts. As a result of this second  round of the elections, the NRU faction--with 32 members of  parliament-has clearly emerged as the largest parliamentary  faction of national democrats.    Despite the defeat of its leader--Vitaliy Zhuravskiy--the  Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party still has two deputies'  seats and sent non-party candidates to fill another three  deputies' seats; they were supported by the "Ukraine" Democratic  Association, which is under the leadership of Levko Lukyanenko.  Six representatives were elected to parliament from the  non-party organization--the Union of Ukrainian Officers.  <H8>  Right-Wing Centrists </H8>   Even more modest were the results achieved by the  once-powerful Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine. One  of its ideologists--Ihor Koliushko--won the election marathon  right away thanks to support from the "New Wave," which is  influential in Galicia. And another two members of this  party--Taras Stetskiv, who also came from the "New Wave," and  Serhiy Sobolev--won a competitive struggle in a different  precinct. To be sure, Sobolev would probably have been assured  of support in any case not only from the PDVU [Party for the  Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], but also from the MBR  [Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms]; however, the leader of this  party--Volodymyr Filenko--was not helped to win by such "double  support," and he has dropped out of the parliamentary game. The  Social Democratic Party of Ukraine remains on the brink of  defeat, from which it will be difficult to escape.  <H8>  Independent Candidates </H8>   Among the 108 non-party candidates who were elected to  parliament, 17 have taken political stances somwehere between  the left-centrist parties and the centrist, pre-election blocs.  To be sure, it is quite difficult to find glaring contradictions  between the former vice-premier Lanovyy and the president of the  Ukrainian Financial Group, Babych. It may well be anticipated  that the people's deputies who belong to this group will--in the  various parliamentary discussions--be on the side of or in favor  of the Rukh-type national-democrats (Holovatyy, Pynzenyk).  Moreover, we cannot absolutely rule out the formation of a  separate parliamentary faction or a centrist-type Inter-Regional  Bloc for Reforms.  <H8>  Centrists </H8>   The 1994 elections were not good elections for centrist  political parties. The chances of the MBR to secure victory for  certain of its members obviously did not correspond to its  clamorous advertising activity. The leader of the MBR--Leonid  Kuchma--and his "comrade in the party"--Oleksiy Dmytrenko--won  during the first round; but during the second round the MBR  added only 10 deputies. Moreover, the Bloc's other  leader--Volodymyr Hrinev--was able to win only with great  difficulty. It is possible that the MBR, together with 2  deputies from the Civic Congress of Ukraine and another 1 from  the Liberal Party of Ukraine, 2 independent Crimean deputies,  and 25 businessmen, whose pre-election programs were not  essentially different from those proclaimed by the MBR, will be  able to form some kind of centrist nucleus within the parliament.  <H8>  Left-Wing Centrists </H8>   These political forces are characterized by a greater  orientation toward supporting the state sector of the economy  than is the case even with the MBR. This is true inasmuch as  there are a great many representatives of the power structures  among the members of the left-centrist parliamentary trend.  Among these 66 deputies (19.6 percent) one can single out  certain subgroups: 24 directors of large-scale industrial  enterprises, 9 representatives of local councils, 19  representatives of the government and state administrations at  various levels, 4 editors of newspapers, and 4 representatives  of law-enforcement organs. With regard to the remaining  representatives of this parliamentary group, we could relegate  another 26 (7.7 percent) members of parliament--members of the  Peasant Party of Ukraine who advocated the path of prudent,  sensible, evolutionary changes in the former composition of the  Supreme Council--to this parliamentary faction. Although many  representatives of the Peasant Party of Ukraine's power  structures (for the most part, chairmen of collective farms or  their deputies) were supported during the elections by the  Communist or Socialist parties, right now it is hard to say  whether this circumstance is still of decisive importance during  the parliamentary voting and whether it was useful for  stimulating the electorate.  <H8>  Left-Wingers </H8>   It would also seem obvious that it is hard to discern the  difference between the left-centrists and the left-wing  political forces. The grounds for such a differentiation may be  seen, however, in the fact that only one representative of the  Peasants' Party of Ukraine--Oleksandr Cherenkov--was entered on  the lists of deputies as a member of the CPU [Communist Party of  Ukraine]. On the other hand, it is difficult to see any  essential difference in the political orientations of the  official-left-centrists and the five representatives of the  Labor Party, among whom are also several members of the  Ukrainian government. Be that as it may, the left-wing forces  have acquired significant representation in the parliament. Such  a conclusion could have been drawn even after the first round of  the elections, in which victories were gained by one of the  leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine--Volodymyr  Marchenko--and the first secretary of the CPU Central  Committee--Petro Symonenko. On the whole, left-wing forces are  represented by 114 (33.8 percent) of the deputies' seats.    It is difficult to unequivocally assess the results of the  elections for the left-wingers. Of the 29 members of the  Socialist Party of Ukraine and those persons supported by that  party, only 17 managed to win deputies' seats. Of the 153  contenders for deputies' seats from the Communist Party who made  it to the second round, 85 were elected to the office of deputy,  while another 5 members of the Communist Party of Crimea also  won deputies' seats.    However, such a number of contenders from the left-wing  forces cannot be regarded as sufficient for a parliamentary  majority. Furthermore, the elections demonstrated that the  left-wing forces are quite heterogeneous. For example, the  political programs set forth by members of the Communist Party  of Crimea are characterized--more so than the others--by the  motif of "Slavic unity," whereas the predominant majority of the  Communist Party of Ukraine's deputies consists of  representatives from Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts, from the  Crimea, and--to a certain extent--from Zaporozhye Oblast. Such a  "regional" approach by the communists may be largely attributed  to a nostalgia among the voters in these regions for the times  when average wages there were 20-25 percent higher than for  Ukraine as a whole.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Although the newly elected parliament has not yet begun its  work, some preliminary forecasts regarding its activity can be  made already. The composition of this new parliament provides  scant grounds for anticipating its ability to work effectively.  Analysis of the election results from the 110 election districts  bordering on those where people's deputies were elected  indicates that the subsequent election of deputies will hardly  make any substantive changes in the composition of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council. There is no complete parliamentary majority,  and the parliament will inevitably split on most of the matters  to be brought up for a vote. The supporters of a certain  economic course will most assuredly have to be satisfied with  creating not exactly a faction, but rather certain tactical  blocs for the purpose of solving particular problems.    The election results attest to the fact that quite a large  group of Ukrainian political figures have henceforth lost a  parliamentary rostrum. Furthermore, the Supreme Council has  lost such political antagonist as Filenko Fokin, Skoryk,  Barabash, Altunyan and Meshcheryakov, the Horyn brothers and  Kotsyuba, Charodeyev and Shevchenko, Pravdenko and Matviyenko,  as well as many others. The extra-parliamentary factor of the  presure which will flow from these politicians in Ukraines's  public life will also have its own influence.  "Compiled" specially for NORODNA ARMIYA</p>

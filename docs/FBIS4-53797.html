It will mull joining hands with foreign companies to explore  Russia's vast resources while encouraging local firms to form  consortiums to take part in resource development. The  government will offer support by putting up funds.    Korea will seek Russia's cooperation on the resumption of  fishing in the Okhotsk sea with a catch quota of 300,000 tons of  pollack in the upcoming talks.

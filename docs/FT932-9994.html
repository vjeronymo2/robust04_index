			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Daiichi Housing rescue package nears completion NOMURA Securities, Japan's leading securities house, and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan are close to an agreement for a Y40bn (Dollars 360m) bail-out of Daiichi Housing Loan, their jointly-owned housing loan company which is burdened by mounting bad debts. The deal is the second financial reconstruction among Japan's eight housing loan companies. These have been hit by the downturn in the property market and land prices since the late 1980s. Earlier this year, a group of banks agreed to bail out Nippon Housing Loan. It is expected these two deals will lead to financial reconstruction plans for the other housing loan groups. Nomura and the Long Term Credit Bank have spent weeks hammering out the agreement, after Nomura refused to accept the terms proposed by the bank. The two companies both own 9 per cent of Daiichi Housing Loan, which was founded by the Long Term Credit Bank in 1975. Under the agreement, the Long Term Credit Bank will reduce to zero the interest on its outstanding loans to Daiichi Housing Loan, worth about Y210bn. The foregone interest income will cost the bank about Y5.4bn a year. Nomura, which has strong capital reserves, will pay Y20bn to buy collateral for housing loans which have since turned sour. Both shareholders will each pay Y10bn for a new issue of Daiichi Housing's shares. Nomura estimates that the Y30bn it will be contributing to the rescue will cost it about Y1.8bn a year. It is not clear whether other lenders to Daiichi Housing, such as the Norinchukin agricultural bank and Sumitomo Trust Bank, have been asked to reduce the interest on their loans.</p>

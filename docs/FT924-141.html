			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Malaya makes Pounds 1.4m acquisition Malaya Group, the retail motor operator, is paying Pounds 1.44m to purchase Western Motor Works (Chislehurst), a Vauxhall dealership. This is the first acquisition by Malaya since Mr Nick Lancaster and associates took a 54 per cent holding and management control last August. The vendor is Castle Bennett Holdings, which will receive Pounds 1.14m cash and 1.5m ordinary shares. Western sells more than 1,500 vehicles a year. Despite the difficult trading conditions over the past three years to December 31 1991 turnover eased just 8 per cent but pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 133,000 to Pounds 194,000.</p>

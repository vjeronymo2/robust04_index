			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / An island pulled up by a Bootstrap: Incentives which enriched Puerto Rico remain vital VISITORS recently to the offices of Fomento, Puerto Rico's economic development agency, were greeted by an exhibition of photographs depicting aspects of the island's economy. Some photos, which record scenes in factories and fields in the early 1940s, were mounted beside others showing more recent economic undertakings. Even the most cursory look at the exhibition forcefully made the point. Fifty years ago this year, Puerto Rico, impoverished and backward - the poorhouse of the Caribbean, says official literature - took a giant step forward. The result today is one of the more industrialised economies in the Americas. The spark was Operation Bootstrap, a web of incentives which have lured big companies to establish plants on the island. 'Puerto Rico today without Bootstrap would be terrible,' said Mr Alfredo Salazar, administrator of Fomento. 'We would still be struggling with agriculture alone, and would still be facing the hopelessness of the 1940s. This would have been an empty island as most of the population would have left.' The change has been, by any standard, dramatic and significant. Per capita income has risen from Dollars 120 in 1942 to Dollars 6,500, while GNP has grown from Dollars 287m to Dollars 17bn. Agriculture, which contributed 23 per cent of GDP in 1942, now accounts for 1 per cent and has been replaced as the backbone of the economy by manufacturing, with the number of industrial plants growing from about 50 in 1942 to 2,000 today, employing 155,000 Puerto Ricans, against 15,000 50 years ago. The volume of trade has grown from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 35bn. Puerto Ricans are now expected to live 74 years, 30 years longer than in the 1940s. Companies drawn to Puerto Rico gained not only from a tax holiday, but from the fact that the island, as a US possession, offered political stability, low wages and relative proximity to the mainland market. But Puerto Rico found itself losing business to competitors in south-east Asia and in the mid-1970s obtained further advantages under Section 936 of the US Revenue Code which encouraged mainland companies with subsidiaries on the island to deposit their profits in local banks. These deposits, of about Dollars 15bn, have become a pillar of the island's financial stability. Puerto Rico's Caribbean neighbours, overtaken by economic and social problems, sometimes look with more than passing envy at the results of Operation Bootstrap. It is clear, however, that the Puerto Rican experiment and its seeming success cannot be emulated. Puerto Ricans are US citizens but cannot vote for a president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. 'There are lessons in Puerto Rico for other Caribbean and developing countries, although there are few parallels,' concludes Mr Pat Thompson, executive director of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce, an umbrella for the region's private sector. Puerto Rico's position as a part of the US is similar to that of French overseas departments such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, and allows for assistance which others cannot get. 'The lessons for us from Puerto Rico are in the organisation and management of finance, and in negotiations with major companies and industrial sectors for joint venture industrial projects,' says Mr Thompson. It is clear, however, that what Puerto Rico is today is more than the work of Operation Bootstrap and the incentives contained in special arrangements such as Section 936. Despite its giant leap over the past 50 years, the island is still the least affluent part of the US. The average income of Puerto Ricans is a third of that of mainland residents. The economy is underpinned by federal transfers of about Dollars 4bn per year under programmes such as those for medical aid and food stamps. The island also receives hundreds of millions of dollars from rebates of federal excise taxes and duties collected on exports such as rum. Citizenship of the US has also facilitated easy migration to the mainland. Mr Salazar says that while 3.5m Puerto Ricans live on the island, another 2.5m are on the mainland. This is an obvious safety valve against social pressures, without which unemployment in Puerto Rico would be worse than the current 17 per cent. The fruits of Operation Bootstrap have helped Puerto Ricans answer some of the questions about their political future. They know what they do not want. Advocates of political independence have always been placed a distant third when votes are taken on political status. Economic and political problems in some neighbouring islands appear a powerful argument against casting adrift from the US. The argument is mainly between remaining the same or becoming a state of the union.</p>

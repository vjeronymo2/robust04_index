			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> NOTHING FROM NOTHING MAKES NOTHING;  </P> <P> LOW SELF-ESTEEM LEADS TO NO ESTEEM FOR OTHERS' LIVES; THIS IS WHERE  BLACK-ON-BLACK VIOLENCE MUST BE STOPPED.  </P> <P> My family and I went to Cook County Jail on Christmas morning, as we do every  year. We went to share the promise of the Messiah's birth. We departed with our  hearts heavy at the sight of hundreds of African-Americans sentenced to jail  for crimes committed mostly against other African-Americans. They missed the  hope of the new life. They're still locked out of the inn, condemned to the  stable, bearing the scars of occupation and rejection.  </P> <P> These men look physically strong, but they are emotionally wounded, casualties  of hard lives with limited options. Too many African-Americans grow up  sentenced to premature death. Young men in Bangladesh are more likely to reach  the age of 40 than black males in Harlem. Almost half of all African-American  babies are born into poverty, many scarred by low birth weight and inadequate  nutrition and medical care. If they survive, they enter a culture that  glorifies crime and violence. Homicide is the largest cause of death among  young African-American males.  </P> <P> There are more black men in prison than in college. For many, jail is a step up  in life. It offers heat, food, medical care, a roof over their heads. They live  with some discipline, without guns and with less chance of dying.  </P> <P> There is a terrible sense of permissiveness about black-on-black crime. Black  murder is becoming acceptable, unalarming, even among blacks. For example, when  30 unarmed Ku Klux Klansmen marched in Washington a few weeks ago, they  attracted 3,000 angry protesters, mostly black. It cost the police $900,000 to  guard the Klan's right to march. If one of those Klan members had killed a  black man in Washington, angry protests would have been ignited across the  country. It would have been a federal crime. Yet the jails are filled not with  Klansmen who kill blacks, but with blacks who kill blacks. These killings are  accepted as routine. There are no marches against them. They are not a federal  offense. They don't make the news.  </P> <P> We cannot allow killing to become routine. When a black is killed by a black  wearing a black jacket, it must be as offensive to the government and the  community as when a black is killed by a white man wearing a white sheet.  </P> <P> Who will stop the killing? In the end, only African-Americans can break this  cycle of violence. During slavery, the burden of emancipation fell upon the  enslaved. During colonialism, the colonized Ihad to fight for independence.  During segregation, the protest movement was forged by the victims. To stop the  killing and the drugs, the burden is on those who suffer the most.  </P> <P> Against the odds, African-Americans must make tough life choices with few  options. Many do without the acclaim that they deserve. For example,  African-Americans are a disproportionate number of those brave men and women  whose lives are on the line in the Saudi desert. The military option offers a  way out.  </P> <P> "You were born to lives with limited options," I told the Cook County inmates,  "but that is no excuse. In football, when a runner is surrounded three yards  short of a first down, his options are limited. It is unacceptable to run out  of bounds or to run backward or to fumble the ball. We expect him to put his  head down and drive, to make the hard choice. Killing each other is not the  tough choice; escaping on drugs is not the tough choice."  </P> <P> Too many of these strong young men have crushed egos, zero-based self-esteem.  If "I ain't worth nothin' then my death means nothin'." Zero from zero makes  zero. If "I ain't worth nothin', you ain't worth nothin' either," so shooting  you or making a baby with you and abandoning it means nothing. Nothing from  nothing makes nothing. Yet it is these men who are essential if the killing is  to end. "You are the veterans and the victims of this culture of guns and  drugs," I told them. "You are needed. The young headed this way need you to  warn them to change direction. Your babies need you. Your mothers terrified of  violence need you. I need you. If you were not drugged up or killing each  other, you would be fighting for your dignity. If you won't claim it, no one  will hand it to you."  </P> <P> As the new year dawns, things are getting worse for the young born to hard  lives. As a country we could offer help. We could stop the race-baiting that  preys on the misery. We could make certain that jail does not offer the best  housing, the only medical care or job training. In the end, however, no one  will act to end the plague of black-on-black violence unless African-Americans  resolve to end it. What better resolution for the new year?  </P></p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Gatt support on environmental links Broad support for wide-ranging talks on the links between trade and the environment was voiced yesterday by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, at their annual meeting in Geneva. Ministers are to meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round accords. They also are due to approve a Gatt work programme on trade and environment, the details of which will be thrashed out in negotiations among the world trade body's 115 members over the next two months. However, trade officials said yesterday that these negotiations had only just started in earnest and that many governments had yet to take a firm position on the issues to be covered. Gatt's working group on environmental measures and international trade, which reported to the annual meeting yesterday, has already paved the way for further work in three key areas: the trade provisions of international environmental agreements, transparency of national environment regulations, and the trade effects of packaging and labelling requirements aimed at protecting the environment. However, environmental groups are pressing for the work programme to include 'eco-dumping' - the competitive advantage alleged to be gained by countries with low environmental standards - and the ability of governments to restrict imports produced in environmentally unfriendly ways. The annual meeting earlier decided: To establish an independent disputes panel to examine claims by several tobacco-producing nations that new US rules on local content for cigarette manufacturers are illegal under Gatt; To set up a working party to negotiate Gatt entry terms for Jordan.</p>

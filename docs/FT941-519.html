			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / US confidence at post-recession high A sharp rise in consumer confidence this month to the highest level in nearly four years yesterday indicated that the US economy is again surging ahead after bad weather and other distortions temporarily slowed growth at the start of the year. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its consumer confidence index rose nearly 7 points to 86.7 in March, the highest reading since July 1990, at the peak of the previous business cycle. Separately, the Commerce Department reported early signs of a rebound in housing after disruptions caused by severe winter storms and the Californian earthquake. New homes sales rose 1.9 per cent last month and by 8 per cent in the year to February. This followed an erratic 22.5 per cent decline in January. The confidence figures are the first clear sign that the economy may be back on the steep upward growth trend established in the second half of last year when real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent. Analysts are now keenly awaiting payroll employment figures for March, due out this Friday, for confirmation of faster growth. The consensus view is that about 250,000 new jobs were created this month, well above the average for last year. But some analysts are looking for an increase of 300,000. If economic data for March do confirm rapid economic growth, the US Federal Reserve is likely to come under renewed pressure in financial markets to raise interest rates again. Last week the Fed signalled a second quarter-point increase in short-term rates to 3.5 per cent. The consumer confidence index has risen 26 points in the past five months and is now at a level which, over the years, has foreshadowed an increasingly strong economy, according to Mr Fabian Linden of the Conference Board. A sub-index measuring consumers' expectations of economic conditions over the next six months had risen particularly sharply - from 84.4 to 93.0. The survey also revealed that most US consumers expect interest rates to rise further: 70 per cent of respondents said rates would go up again against against less than half six months ago. The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households. The rise in new home sales last month mainly reflected a sharp rebound on the west coast following disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake in January. Sales in the west rose 28 per cent after a 22 per cent decline in January. Sales in the northeast, midwest and south fell again last month, but by less in most regions than in January. Most analysts expect a solid national increase in new home sales this month, reflecting more clement weather and mortgage rates that are still low by historical standards.</p>

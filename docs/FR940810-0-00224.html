			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Surfacing ACM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means surfacing material which contains more than 1% asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thermal system insulation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (TSI) means ACM applied to pipes, fittings, boilers, breeching, tanks, ducts or other structural components to prevent heat loss or gain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thermal system insulation ACM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is thermal system insulation which contains more than 1% asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Permissible exposure limits (PELS)_(1) Time-weighted average limit (TWA). The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight (8) hour time-weighted average (TWA), as determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A of this section, or by an equivalent method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Excursion limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 1.0 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of thirty (30) minutes, as determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A of this section, or by an equivalent method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Multi-employer worksites. (1) On multi-employer worksites, an employer performing work requiring the establishment of a regulated area shall inform other employers on the site of the nature of the employer's work with asbestos and/or PACM, of the existence of and requirements pertaining to regulated areas, and the measures taken to ensure that employees of such other employers are not exposed to asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Asbestos hazards at a multi-employer work site shall be abated by the contractor who created or controls the source of asbestos contamination. For example, if there is a significant breach of an enclosure containing Class I work, the employer responsible for erecting the enclosure shall repair the breach immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In addition, all employers of employees exposed to asbestos hazards shall comply with applicable protective provisions to protect their employees. For example, if employees working immediately adjacent to a Class I asbestos job are exposed to asbestos due to the inadequate containment of such job, their employer shall either remove the employees from the area until the enclosure breach is repaired; or perform an initial exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) All employers of employees working adjacent to regulated areas established by another employer on a multi-employer work- site, shall take steps on a daily basis to ascertain the integrity of the enclosure and/or the effectiveness of the control method relied on by the primary asbestos contractor to assure that asbestos fibers do not migrate to such adjacent areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) All general contractors on a shipyard project which includes work covered by this standard shall be deemed to exercise general supervisory authority over the work covered by this standard, even though the general contractor is not qualified to serve as the asbestos ``qualified person'' as defined by paragraph (b) of this section. As supervisor of the entire project, the general contractor shall ascertain whether the asbestos contractor is in compliance with this standard, and shall require such contractor to come into compliance with this standard when necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Regulated areas (1) All Class I, II and III asbestos work shall be conducted within regulated areas. All other operations covered by this standard shall be conducted within a regulated area where airborne concentrations of asbestos exceed, or there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed a PEL. Regulated areas shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e) (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Demarcation. The regulated area shall be demarcated in any manner that minimizes the number of persons within the area and protects persons outside the area from exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos. Where critical barriers or negative pressure enclosures are used, they may demarcate the regulated area. Signs shall be provided and displayed pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (k)(6) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized persons and to persons authorized by the Act or regulations issued pursuant thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Respirators. All persons entering a regulated area where employees are required pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section to wear respirators shall be supplied with a respirator selected in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in the regulated area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Qualified Persons. The employer shall ensure that all asbestos work performed within regulated areas is supervised by a qualified person, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The duties of the qualified person are set out in paragraph (o) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Exposure assessments and monitoring_(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General monitoring criteria.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Each employer who has a workplace of work operation where exposure monitoring is required under this section shall perform monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of asbestos to which employees may be exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposure shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift exposure for employees in each work area. Representative 30-minute short-term employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 30 minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for employees in each work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial Exposure Assessment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard shall ensure that a ``qualified person'' conducts an exposure assessment immediately before or at the initiation of the operation to ascertain expected exposures during that operation or workplace. The assessment must be completed in time to comply with requirements which are triggered by exposure data or the lack of a ``negative exposure assessment,'' and to provide information necessary to assure that all control systems planned are appropriate for that operation and will work properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Basis of Initial Exposure Assessment: The initial exposure assessment shall be based on data derived from the following sources:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If feasible, the employer shall monitor employees and base the exposure assessment on the results of exposure monitoring which is conducted pursuant to the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) In addition, the assessment shall include consideration of all observations, information or calculations which indicate employee exposure to asbestos, including any previous monitoring conducted in the workplace, or of the operations of the employer which indicate the levels of airborne asbestos likely to be encountered on the job. However, the assessment may conclude that exposures are likely to be consistently below the PELs only as a conclusion of a ``negative exposure assessment'' conducted pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) For Class I asbestos work, until the employer conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that job will not be exposed in excess of the PELs, or otherwise makes a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer shall presume that employees are exposed in excess of the TWA and excursion limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

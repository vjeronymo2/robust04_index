			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Countries in the  Asia-Pacific region must cooperate in the exchange of technology  if they are to raise their living standards, a meeting of  parliamentarians from countries in the region said Friday [17  June].    The 108 legislators from 35 countries at the Asia-Pacific  Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference on "science and  technology for regional sustainable development" made the call  in a document unanimously adopted at the end of their five-day  meeting in a Tokyo hotel.    The document, titled "Inventing the Future: Science and  Technology for Sustainable Development," said the  parliamentarians "viewed human capital as the most valuable  resource a country can possess for its advancement."    But the document said the Asia-Pacific region contains the  majority of the world's population below the poverty line and  this can only be altered if countries in the region cooperate in  the formation of scientific and technological partnerships aimed  at regional sustainable growth.    "It is clearly recognized that there are important linkages  between poverty, population growth and pressures on the  environment," the document said.    "Poverty is indeed one of the great sources of environmental  degradation.    "Any practical strategy for sustainable development demands  that basic needs of the population be met as a matter of the  highest priority."    The document said strategies to improve living standards  should include expanding connections among business, industry  and universities, and more emphasis on science and technology in  government decision-making, particularly in new technologies  like biotechnology, information sciences and bioenergy.    It also recommended greater involvement of women in  scientific and technological activity.    Outlining the contents of the document at a press conference  after the meeting, Goku Menon, head of the Indian delegation to  the conference, said it focused on the uses of science and  technology in meeting the basic needs of people in the region.    He said the conference was an example of the growth of  regional ties which will lead to greater scientific and  technological cooperation at the expense of "narrow nationalism"  in the region.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: PROOF THAT IMAGE IS FLEETING  </P> <P> For those of you who get severe stomach cramps when a shiny Jaguar, Porsche or  Mercedes-Benz pulls up next to your beat-up old Ford, don't fret. Many of those  drivers don't own those sexy and speedy cars; they just rent them for a day.  </P> <P> Ken Kerzner, president and chief of operations for Budget Rent-a-Car of Beverly  Hills, said thousands of people, including celebrities, Japanese businessmen,  tourists and those who choose to test-drive before they buy, rent the exotic  and luxurious cars. Budget also rents car phones and life's newest essential:  the car fax machine.  </P> <P> He said customers, age 25 and up, rent the cars for business and personal  reasons. Some simply do it for show.  </P> <P> Customers are "screaming" for the Mazda Miata and the new Toyota Lexus right  now, Kerzner said.  </P> <P> "People in Southern California have a love for automobiles. Without a car in  Southern California, you can't get around.  </P> <P> "Your car is your image."  </P> <P> Wannabes -- those who want to sit behind a Porsche and the like -- can expect  to pay $29.95 a day for the Mitsubishi Mirage and $1,000 a day for the Ferrari  Testarossa.  </P> <P> Not in Gear With Michael  </P> <P> Where do you go after you land Michael Jackson as a pitchman?  </P> <P> Well, for athletic shoe company L.A. Gear, it's gone a long way down the  celebrity ladder. Since Jackson signed on with L.A. Gear in the fall, the  Marina del Rey company has named a host of celebrity endorsers -- but none seem  to be in Jackson's league. Among the additional celebrity pitchmen are  basketball stars Akeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone and model Heather Locklear.  Last week, L.A. Gear also announced that it had signed actress Priscilla  Presley to target what it calls the "30-plus" woman.  </P> <P> For those awaiting the Jackson commercials, don't hold your breath. They are  not expected to air until next spring.  </P> <P> If You Really Loved Us . . .  </P> <P> If all else fails, ask your customers to help you sell your product. That's  what Investor's Daily, the Los Angeles-based publication that dubs itself  "America's Business Newspaper," is doing.  </P> <P> A computerized letter sent to subscribers from Investor's Daily founder and  Chairman William J. O'Neil begins with the plea: "You are very important to  Investor's Daily, and I'd like to ask you for a little help."  </P> <P> O'Neil asks the reader to submit the names, addresses and phone numbers of  "friends, relatives, investors or business associates" who might be worthy  candidates for Investor's Daily subscriptions.  </P> <P> But don't worry, Investor's Daily will do the rest, sending each nominee a free  two-week subscription with the compliments of the subscriber who submitted  their name.  </P> <P> Although Investor's Daily, with a circulation of 101,000, is "growing rapidly,"  the letter says, the help is needed so that the newspaper can double its  circulation and compete with the Wall Street Journal. Now what subscriber could  ignore such a heartfelt entreaty?  </P></p>

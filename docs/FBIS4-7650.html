Mr.  Musaraj said in his reply that the above claims are groundless.  The SP [Socialist Party] has not been denied the right of  collective organizing for any legitimate objective. He  explained that the Public Order Ministry has not banned  gatherings of the SP in the set places. On the contrary, it has  taken all measures for the security of these activities, with  the exception of the cases when they have been considered as  seriously dangerous for public order and security. After  mentioning some cases of law violations during manifestations,  the minister stressed that in the future the public order forces  will not allow such violations be repeated. None of the  citizens has been discriminated because of sex, race, language,  religion, economic and financial state or for any other personal  circumstances. Such violations have not been made and will not  be allowed for any deputy. On the contrary deputies have not  been prevented in accomplishing their task.    Mr. Musaraj invited the socialist deputies to help the  forces  of order to observe the rules of security according to the laws  in force.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: IHT and paperwork SOME WEEKS ago, you printed a letter from an elderly widow headlined 'What can I pass on?' in which she asked several questions about inheritance tax. Could you add a footnote to your answer giving details of the documentation needed when the annual exemptions for IHT are used? Is it in any way similar to the declarations made for CGT? You asked for the necessary documentation regarding annual gifts to utilise the annual exemptions. It is normally sufficient for you to make the gifts together with a covering letter. For example, if you propose to make the gift utilising the Pounds 3,000 annual exemption, you should merely keep a record of the gifts you make and the copy of the covering letter, together with the cheques. If you wish to make use of the gifts out of income, then it is important to show that the gift is of a regular nature and, therefore, any letter accompanying the gift should state the facts of the case. For example, if you are to pay an amount each year for the next four years under a deed of covenant, then the covenant form would be evidence of the regular nature of the payment. Alternatively, the letter should state the regular nature if this is what is proposed. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.  All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: German bid to outmanoeuvre tank sales ban GERMAN industry, barred from selling heavy weapons directly to Arab countries, is collaborating with France in an attempt to sell tanks to the United Arab Emirates. The deal for 390 tanks could be worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) including spares and support. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and UAE president, is believed to have provided funding to develop a special version of the French Leclerc tank equipped with a German engine similar to that used in the Krauss-Maffei Leopard 2. Vickers of the UK and General Dynamics of the US are also competing for the order, the biggest of any currently in prospect for western tank manufacturers. This week Kuwait chose General Dynamics' M1A2 Abrams for a 236-tank order in preference to Vickers' Challenger 2. Several Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia - which is also in the market for more than 200 tanks - have long coveted the German Leopard. But they have been prevented from buying it under Bonn's strict arms export rules which forbid sales that might increase regional tensions. The latest Franco-German project could prove embarrassing to Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister. His predecessor, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, resigned in March after it was disclosed that 15 Leopard tanks had been sent to Turkey in spite of an embargo ordered by the Bundestag because of Turkish actions against the Kurds. In the late 1980s Germany halted efforts to sell a collaborative UK-German tank - using a Leopard chassis - in the Middle East. Deutsche Aerospace yesterday confirmed that its subsidiary Motoren- und Turbinen-Union (MTU) was developing a version of the engine it makes for the Leopard in order to fit the new French Leclerc tank, and had started procedures in Bonn to seek an export licence. However, it said Leclerc prototypes already sent to Abu Dhabi were not equipped with MTU engines. Giat Industries, the state-controlled French company which produces the tank, earlier declined to comment on the engine plan but said: 'We are adapting to the needs of our clients.' US and French industry experts say Sheikh Zayed is believed to have provided Dollars 50m to cover the costs of integrating the German engine after the French diesel engine was judged unsatisfactory. Engines and transmissions would be expected to account for about 10 per cent of the total contract value. France has until now been the UAE's main supplier of arms including battle tanks and fighter aircraft. Experts are puzzled, however, by Sheikh Zayed's plan for a specially developed version of the Leclerc. Incorporating the MTU engine is expected to require an increase in the tank's overall length. Neither the Leclerc nor the British Challenger 2 has yet won an export contract.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANNING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD  </P> <P> Little Red Riding Hood has been banned in Culver City first-grade classrooms  because some parents claimed that Trina Schart Hyman's version of the Brothers  Grimm fairy tale promotes alcoholism among primary students (Metro, May 19).  </P> <P> In this version Little Red takes a loaf of fresh bread, some sweet butter, and  a bottle of wine to her grandmother's cottage in the deep woods. After being  eaten by the wolf, Granny and Red are rescued by a huntsman. They celebrate by  eating the fresh bread and sweet butter. "Grandmother drank some of the wine  and Red Riding Hood had a cup of blackberry tea. After a while, grandmother  felt quite strong and healthy." The illustration shows grandmother flushed and  cheerful with a glass of wine in her hand. This critics say sends a message to  first graders that drinking wine is an acceptable way to relieve stress and  feel better.  </P> <P> Nonsense. First graders know the best way to relieve stress is to throw  tantrums, hit younger siblings and break toys. They prefer French fries, soda  pop and sugared cereal to wine.  </P> <P> If parents want to complain, how about cruelty to animals? The huntsman cuts  open the wolf while the animal is snoozing in grandma's bed. Isn't that cause  for animal rights' activists to protest this story? The huntsman also skins the  wolf and takes the pelt. Where are the groups against fur coats?  </P> <P> This version of Little Red Riding Hood won national awards and is included on  the recommended reading list published by the California State Department of  Education. Yet some nit-pickers begrudge poor, old, ailing granny a glass of  wine.  </P> <P> Why do some adults read things into fairy tales? What child considers  Goldilocks and the Three Bears a personal rights case or the Little Red Hen a  worker's compensation case? "Oh, A Hunting We Will Go" use to be a children's  song. Now it seems to be a book banner's anthem.  </P> <P> MARJORIE MILLER  </P> <P> Hesperia  </P></p>

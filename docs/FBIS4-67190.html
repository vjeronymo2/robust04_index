			<p>BFN     [Text] A dozen pharmacists and distributors of  pharmaceutical products have been arrested for illegally selling  large quantities of a potent painkiller causing strong  hallucination to the public at huge profits.    The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office said yesterday that  two medical doctors were also indicted without formal arrest on  charges of violating the Pharmaceutical Law for helping  distributors take the products out of hospital inventory.    According to state prosecutors, the 12 arrested allegedly  engaged in the distribution of products containing nalbuphane  HC1, hallucinating its users, from April last year through last  month.    Initial investigations showed that the 12, mostly  pharmaceutical company employees, distributed 22,000 ampules  (one ampule contains 10 centiliters) of the injection drug which  have a market value of 60-100 million won (750,000-1.2 million  U.S. dollars).    The prosecutors said the drug, which is believed to bring  reactions as powerful as methamphetamine, sells for about  30,000-50,000 won per ampule, mostly to youths and drug addicts.    "The distributors worked clandestinely with doctors and  pharmacists to gain access to large quantities of nalbuphane and  sold them through organized networks run by hooligans," one  prosecutor explained.    In one instance, the prosecutors said, Yi Sok-chae, a  manager  of a pharmaceutical company, purchased 11,800 ampules at 400-500  won each and sold them to another distributor at 1,500-2,000 won.    "What is shocking about this case is that it involved  organized groups of people who are well aware of the dangerous  implications of administering the painkiller," one prosecutor  said.</p>

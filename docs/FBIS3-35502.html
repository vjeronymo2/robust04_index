			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Police Minister Moshe Shahal by </F> Itay Engel and Tamar Landau -- live]    [Text] [Engel] What do you know at this point about what  happened in Hebron?    [Shahal] I have been in constant contact with the police  commissioner since the moment the incident was first reported.  Together with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], we are  investigating and checking all the circumstances of the incident.    First of all, I would like to express my sorrow at the loss  of life and at this horrendous murder. I categorically denounce  the slaying of human beings, whatever their nationality may be.  The Israel Police and the security forces will make every  possible effort to bring the people responsible for this act to  trial. I call on all the sides to evince restraint and not to  succumb to provocations on either side.    [Landau] Sir, the details in our possession are quite  sketchy and we would like you to fill us in. When did the  incident start?    [Shahal] I received the first report before 0600 [0400 GMT]  this morning from the police commissioner, but I assume that the  incident began earlier. Other details are currently being  investigated. At this point, the picture is not yet entirely  clear. We know that there were quite a few fatalities, and the  toll reported to me was from six to eight dead. To repeat, I am  in constant contact with the police commissioner, and I believe  the picture will become clearer soon because an investigation is  currently under way.    [Landau] Do you know the identity of the Israeli from Qiryat  Arba' who opened fire at the Arabs?    [Shahal] We have the name of a Jew who was found there, who  is either wounded or dead. We do not yet know what his role was  in the incident, and we are currently collecting testimony from  eyewitnesses to ascertain what exactly happened.    [Engel] From the initial details in our possession, we  realize that the incident did not start this morning but last  night, when Jewish and Muslim worshipers converged at the Cave  of the Patriarchs, respectively for their Purim and Ramadan  prayers, and clashed with each other. Were the police ready for  such an eventuality? How many troops did you have on the spot?    [Shahal] You must understand that the Israel Police are not  responsible for order and security in the territories, and it is  only an auxiliary force helping bring lawbreakers to court.  Israel Police and Border Police troops are under IDF command  and are part of its deployment. They tried to calm down and  deal with the situation. As said, I do not think I can comment  about what happened this morning before I receive more accurate  information.    [Landau] As far as we know, the Arabs attacked by the  Israeli caught him, beat the hell out of him, and actually  killed him.    [Shahal] You know more than I do. We have not yet confirmed  those details. Therefore, it would be irresponsible on my part  to comment on something about which I have no accurate  information from an authoritative source.    [Engel] Could you tell us what is going on now in Hebron?  We understand that serious riots erupted there in the wake of  the incident.    [Shahal] There is a great deal of tension. Consequently, I  call on the entire Arab and Jewish population to evince  restraint and not to succumb to any provocations on either side.  We have experienced the murder of Jews at the hands of Arab  terrorists. Unfortunately, we are faced with an incident whose  specifics are not yet clear. A measure of restraint will serve  those who want to uphold the peace and save human lives. The  security forces, the IDF, the Border Police, and the Israel  Police are prepared to deal with the incident. To repeat, all  these bodies are in constant contact to prevent a deterioration  of the situation in the wake of this horrendous act.    [Engel] Has the prime minister been briefed on the details  of the incident?    [Shahal] Absolutely, he is being briefed all the time. All  the pertinent elements are being briefed almost in real time.    [Landau] Are you contemplating the possibility of declaring  the area a closed military zone?    [Shahal] I cannot answer this question, which is being dealt  with in ongoing consultations. We must first check the incident  to ascertain exactly what happened.    [Engel] Minister Shahal, thank you very much.</p>

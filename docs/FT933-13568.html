			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Italy, UN agree temporary truce: Row over peacekeeping in Somalia shifts to diplomacy THE row between Italy and the United Nations over the conduct of peacekeeping forces in Somalia shifted over the weekend from public posturing to quiet diplomacy. The differences are to be discussed at a meeting on July 27 between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr Bruno Bottai, director-general of the Italian Foreign Ministry. Until then all parties are expected to observe a cooling-off period. The decision to hold a top-level meeting with the UN secretary-general followed urgent talks on Friday in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, between Italian diplomats and Admiral Jonathon Howe, Mr Boutros Ghali's special envoy, General Cevik Bir, the Turkish commander of UN forces, and US diplomats. Neither side was willing to comment on the talks - in contrast to the mutual criticism traded earlier between the UN and the Italian government. The sole outcome was the formal announcement of the July 27 meeting. Mr Koffi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, had called for the removal of General Bruno Loi, commander of the 2,600-strong Italian contingent in Somalia, claiming he had defied UN orders. The Italians gave their backing to Gen Loi, refused to call him home and reiterated their criticism of the way UN operations in Somalia had shifted from a peacekeeping and humanitarian role to enforcement. They feared this risked turning the UN force toward an unwelcome occupational role, with its impartiality surrendered by the US-sponsored call to outlaw General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the principal Somali warlord. From Mogadishu, Reuter reports that Italian troops clashed yesterday with Somali gunmen at a checkpoint in the capital. Italian sources said gunmen who had hijacked a bus opened fire when the vehicle was stopped and the Italian troops shot back. A Somali man and a woman were wounded, apparently by fire from the gunmen, the sources said. Meanwhile, in Germany leading politicians within the ruling coalition began to question German involvement in Somalia just as 250 soldiers prepared to join peacekeepers there. Speaking in the Cologne-based Express newspaper, Mr Karl Lamers, spokesman for the foreign affairs committee of the Christian Democratic parliamentary group, said a clarification of the UN mandate in Somalia was urgently needed. Mr Lamers, who has been a strong advocate of German participation in UN missions outside Nato, said: 'If the UN mandate is not clarified shortly, a new situation would appear in which the withdrawal of German soldiers would become necessary.' In an interview in Die Welt published today, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign affairs minister and a member of the Free Democrats, the junior party in the coalition, added that the situation in Somalia should be continuously examined to see if the politically agreed conditions for German involvement had not changed. However, he added German soldiers should not withdraw 'when the first difficulties arise'. The federal constitutional court recently approved German participation in UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia after the government coalition said the soldiers would be kept out of particularly dangerous zones.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Tecs chief warns against shrinking skills base EMPLOYER-LED Training and Enterprise Councils yesterday warned the government that any weakening of work-based training would result in many young people entering dead-end, low-skilled jobs. Mr John Troth, chairman of the Tec chief executive network, expressed in a letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, 'the greatest possible concern' at reports in yesterday's FT that there could be cuts in funding for Youth Training. This programme, the centrepiece of work-based training for young people, at present offers a guaranteed place to any 16-to-19-year-old that wants one. It is understood that the Department for Education is about to present proposals to divert the majority of the Pounds 850m a year spent on YT by the Department of Employment into its own expansion of further education. Instead of funding going through Tecs to employers and providers of training, it would be be channelled to colleges through the new quango, the Further Education Funding Council. Colleges would arrange work experience where appropriate. Mr Troth, who pledged Tec support for Mr Hunt's efforts to defend YT, said the work-based route was an essential option for significant numbers of young people and it should be employer-led. He said it encouraged employer commitment to training which in turn led to a widening of employers' training. It also 'kick-started' the process of lifelong learning.</p>

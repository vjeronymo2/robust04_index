			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco, dies Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, died on Friday, 16 months after being diagnosed as suffering from a brain tumour. Mr Walsh, 51, was a highly-regarded manager who had won a reputation as one of the US's foremost turnround experts. He had been hired by Tenneco in 1991 to help revive the fortunes of the ailing company, whose activities extend from the Case farm machinery company to gas pipelines, shipbuilding and packaging. By slashing the company's dividend, selling assets and taking an axe to its costs, he returned Tenneco to profitability last year. Mr Walsh had spent the previous five years at Union Pacific Railroad, which he had taken through a similar restructuring. But his career in industry had begun only in 1980, when he joined Cummins Engine at the age of 38. Before that, he had worked in private practice as a lawyer and as district attorney in southern California. Mr Walsh had stepped down as chief executive of Tenneco in February, saying at the time that his medical treatment was impairing his ability to run the company. The chief executive's position was taken over by Mr Dana Mead, then president and chief operating officer, who had been brought in to Tenneco by Mr Walsh two years before. Mr Mead was among those who paid tribute to Mr Walsh's determination. 'Mike's legacy is our shared inspiration to fight on and never settle for second best,' he said.</p>

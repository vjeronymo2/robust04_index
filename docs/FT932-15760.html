			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Tories talk up recovery prospects THE ECONOMY is showing 'signs of improvement', Mr Tony Newton said yesterday, as senior Tories used the recess to talk up the prospects for recovery before parliament's return on Wednesday. On the first anniversary of the government's general election victory the leader of the Commons acknowledged it had been 'a very difficult year' but said the government was moving in the right direction. His remarks followed party chairman Sir Norman Fowler's use of a party political broadcast to deliver an equally upbeat message that there were now 'clear signs' of economic recovery. Both men also hit at recent criticism of the leadership qualities of Mr John Major, prime minister, who was expected to spend the weekend in his Huntingdon constituency. After a day debating the Criminal Justice Bill, aimed at tightening rules on insider dealing, MPs are due to turn yet again to the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty, which will have its 20th day in committee on Thursday. The main initial point of interest is likely to be whether Mr Michael Morris, who chairs the sessions when the bill is discussed in detail, has again changed his mind about allowing a vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment. Mr Morris announced last month that he had reversed his decision to allow a vote on the amendment which would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. A number of Tory Euro-sceptics have since asked him to reconsider. Although a new clause offering MPs a further opportunity to debate and vote on the chapter has presented a fresh obstacle to the bill's passage, ministers have been encouraged by the measure's comparatively rapid recent progress.</p>

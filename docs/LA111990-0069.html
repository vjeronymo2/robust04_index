			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST PREVIEW;  </P> <P> UNLV'S CHANCE AT BEING NO. 1 MAY LIE IN THE CONFERENCE  </P> <P> The Big West Conference has long been awash in the reflected glory -- and  shared tournament revenue -- of Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> So if you think UNLV is in limbo as it awaits the result of its appeal of the  NCAA ruling barring the Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title,  consider the rest of the conference.  </P> <P> Put it this way: If Duke is safe from another tournament final onslaught, who  pays?  </P> <P> Some Big West coaches think they know.  </P> <P> "If they can't play in the (NCAA) tournament, they'll be driven to prove  they're No. 1 anyway by winning all their games, and by winning them all by big  margins," said UC Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm, whose team holds the  distinction of being the last to defeat UNLV, 78-70, on Feb. 26. "Whether or  not they could do that would be their quest."  </P> <P> Say you're San Jose State, which lost to the Rebels by scores of 100-80 and  105-69 last season; or UC Irvine, which lost one game by 103-67? And now UNLV  is going to get mad?  </P> <P> Even New Mexico State, which beat UNLV early in the season and went 26-5, lost  to UNLV by 23 points in February.  </P> <P> "Before, they've always played knowing they would get in the tournament  anyway," Pimm said. "But every week, every game, would become very important.  They could take the challenge like that, to show they're the best team in the  country and say, 'OK, we can't play, but let's end up No. 1 in all the polls.'  "  </P> <P> As Cal State Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg sees it, every Big West team could  become party to UNLV's vendetta.  </P> <P> "If (UNLV is barred from the NCAA tournament), I think they'll use the regular  season as a postseason tournament so as to make a potential farce out of  whoever wins the (NCAA) tournament," Greenberg said.  </P> <P> So Big West coaches say they support UNLV's appeal. Is it fraternal good will  or just self-preservation?  </P> <P> UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said there would be neither a let-down nor vengeance  from his team if the NCAA ruling stands.  </P> <P> "Our guys are good guys. They play hard all the time," Tarkanian said. "They'll  compete.  </P> <P> "You would be shocked if you sat through a week of practice. The Rebels never  talk about any of that stuff. When we won the championship, we never talked  about vindictiveness."  </P> <P> If UNLV's appeal is denied, the Big West will have to decide whether to allow  the Rebels to play in the conference tournament.  </P> <P> To include UNLV could deny another team a chance to win the automatic NCAA bid  that goes with a conference championship.  </P> <P> But to exclude the Rebels would be a blow to image, TV ratings and gate  receipts.  </P> <P> "It would be a tough decision," said Jim Haney, conference commissioner.  </P> <P> And the Big West, like UNLV, would rather not face it unless absolutely  necessary.  </P> <P> A look at the conference:  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 13-16, 6-12  </P> <P> Conference finish: Seventh  </P> <P> A promising team went awry last season. The Titans won six games in December,  but played erratically after that and lost eight of their final nine.  </P> <P> The players responsible for most of the scoring, Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill,  are gone -- Ceballos to the Phoenix Suns. Junior point guard Wayne Williams is  the only returning starter.  </P> <P> But Coach John Sneed says this team's chemistry has improved, and, although  chosen to finish last in the Big West by conference coaches, he says the Titans  can be better than that.  </P> <P> Forward Agee Ward, a junior, is the most experienced returning player other  than Williams. The top newcomer appears to be guard Joe Small, who was the top  community-college scorer in the state last season, averaging 25.3 points at the  College of the Sequoias.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAL STATE LONG BEACH  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 23-9, 12-6  </P> <P> Conference finish: Fourth  </P> <P> One conference coach says Long Beach has more good players than any team in the  Big West -- including UNLV, which he concedes has the best starting five.  </P> <P> Coach Seth Greenberg has most of the players back from a team that was left out  of the NCAA tournament on a controversial decision by the selection committee.  </P> <P> The biggest loss was point guard Tyrone Mitchell. Bobby Sears, a junior,  probably will steer the 49er running game. Lucious Harris, a sophomore guard  who was conference freshman of the year and scored in double figures 26 times,  is on top of a pile of talent that runs very, very deep.  </P> <P> The schedule includes road games against Arizona and Syracuse, but Greenberg  says the biggest questions about his team concern its green neon "California  Gold" uniforms.  </P> <P> "They're so ugly they're nice. And if you think they're so ugly, wait until you  see our warm-ups."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FRESNO STATE  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 10-19, 4-14  </P> <P> Conference finish: Ninth  </P> <P> With the departure of Ron Adams, the last vestiges of the Boyd Grant era are  gone. Gary Colson, the former Pepperdine and New Mexico coach, will junk the  Bulldogs' trademark deliberate, defensive style in favor of an up-tempo game,  despite the personnel he has inherited.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for (the players), but I think I have to go with what I think  will work," Colson said. "Maybe we could win a few more games this year by  controlling the ball, and they have done a nice job with that before. But I  don't think that's the answer in the long run for us. We need to play up-tempo  so we can recruit to be competitive in the league."  </P> <P> The top three scorers, juniors Wilbert Hooker and Tod Bernard and senior Chris  Henderson, are back. Bernard, at 6-5, has moved inside, where he and Henderson,  6-6, will play on the league's smallest front line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEVADA LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 35-5, 16-2  </P> <P> Conference finish: First (tie)  </P> <P> Larry Johnson, a consensus first team All-American; Stacey Augmon, the MVP of  the NCAA West Regional; Anderson Hunt, the MVP of the Final Four; and Greg  Anthony are back from a team that won the NCAA championship game by the largest  margin in title game history.  </P> <P> The only starter who is not back, center David Butler, is replaced by George  Ackles, who started 27 games two years ago but redshirted last year after  breaking his wrist.  </P> <P> "The thing that concerns me, and I know it's something that concerns all  coaches, is that we can't afford any injuries to our key people," Tarkanian  said. "We have a tremendous drop-off any time we go from one of our starting  positions to the next person, but our starting five is very, very good."  </P> <P> Ask Duke, a 103-73 loser in the NCAA final.  </P> <P> The one freshman is an important addition: H Waldman gives Tarkanian a backup  for Anthony at point guard. And yes, his name is H with no period; his mother  disliked the family name Herb.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 26-5, 16-2  </P> <P> Conference finish: First (tie)  </P> <P> UNLV's guards had the Final Four as their showcase last season, but they were  beaten for first-team all-conference by the Aggies' Keith Hill and Randy Brown.  Only Brown is back to lead the next of a succession of stunningly athletic and  balanced teams Coach Neil McCarthy has constructed from community college  talent.  </P> <P> McCarthy says Brown can be the first player he has coached in his 16-year  career to play in the NBA. Forwards Reggie Jordan and Michael New are the other  starters back from the team that relegated UNLV to the second seed in the  conference tournament after sharing the title.  </P> <P> The Aggies faded at the end last season, losing to Long Beach in the Big West  tournament and to Loyola Marymount in the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PACIFIC  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 15-14, 7-11  </P> <P> Conference finish: Sixth  </P> <P> Three years after going 0-18 in the Big West, the Tigers are on the brink of  breaking into the conference's upper division. Coach Bob Thomason took over the  season after the Tigers reached their nadir, and in two years he has made them  a threat.  </P> <P> Pacific beat UC Santa Barbara in two of three games last season, including in  the Big West tournament.  </P> <P> The team's top scorers, junior guard Dell Demps and senior center Don Lyttle,  are back, and both have a touch from three-point range, a favorite tactic of  Thomason's.  </P> <P> Lyttle's consistency and rebounding will be critical for a team that had  particular trouble at defensive rebounding, Thomason says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAN JOSE STATE  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 8-20, 5-13 in the Big West  </P> <P> Conference finish: Eighth  </P> <P> A year after the walk-out against Bill Berry decimated the program, Stan  Morrison coaxed eight victories out of the Spartans, and a team that was a  consensus last-place pick finished eighth.  </P> <P> Troy Batiste, a scrappy guard whose 12-point average was second on the team,  and sophomore guard Charles Terrell, a walk-on last season, are co-captains and  the emotional core of the team.  </P> <P> Morrison said he may play 12 players, but adds a caveat: "That may mean we have  a lot of mediocre guys."  </P> <P> The talent pool should be deepened by new players such as freshman forward Mike  Brotherton and Michael St. Julien, a 6-4 forward who won the national  community-college high jump title with a leap of 7' 3 1/4."  </P> <P> </P> <P> UC IRVINE  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 5-23, 3-15 in the Big West  </P> <P> Conference finish: 10th  </P> <P> This Anteater team will be better.  </P> <P> "It's got to be better, after what we went through last year," said Coach Bill  Mulligan, whose team set a school record by losing 15 games in a row.  </P> <P> Ricky Butler, a 6-7 senior center who has weighed close to 300 pounds at times,  was driven by the misery of the season to slim down to 245 and should exceed  his team-leading averages of 14 points and seven rebounds a game. Forward Jeff  Herdman is the only other senior, and after losing his touch last season, will  try to regain the form that helped him briefly lead the nation in three-point  shooting percentage two seasons ago.  </P> <P> Guard Dylan Rigdon and forwards Jeff Von Lutzow and Craig Marshall will try to  fulfill the promise they showed as freshman. But the player who might be most  crucial is Gerald McDonald, a point guard out of Compton College who must steer  the all-out running game on which Mulligan has staked hopes of a comeback.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UC SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 21-9, 13-5 in the Big West  </P> <P> Conference finish: Third  </P> <P> The Gauchos were the winners of a strange either/or NCAA bid game between Santa  Barbara and Long Beach last season, and proved they belonged in the field by  beating Houston and advancing to the second round, where they lost to Michigan  State. But superb rebounder Eric McArthur and guard Carrick DeHart, who each  averaged 15 points, are gone from a team that was the only one to beat UNLV  after January.  </P> <P> The best returning players are senior forward Gary Gray, junior guard Paul  Johnson and junior forward Lucius Davis.  </P> <P> Six players will rotate in the guard positions, and Coach Jerry Pimm says the  Gauchos will turn to more of a running game by handing the ball to sophomore  point guard Ray Kelly, a strikingly quick transfer from Texas Christian.  </P> <P> The area of concern is inside, where Pimm hopes Gray will get help from another  transfer who could make a difference, Sam Robson, a 6-11 center from North  Carolina Charlotte.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UTAH STATE  </P> <P> 1989-90 Record: 14-16, 8-10 in the Big West  </P> <P> Conference finish: Fifth  </P> <P> Three seasons ago, Utah State won the Big West tournament, earning its first  automatic NCAA bid in Rod Tueller's last year as coach. In the two seasons  since, neither of the teams coached by Kohn Smith, Tueller's hand-picked  successor, has broken .500.  </P> <P> This could be the first.  </P> <P> His best player, Kendall Youngblood, was the conference freshman of the year  two seasons ago and has played everything from point guard to small forward.  </P> <P> Seven of the top eight scorers are back, including four starters. Rich Jardine,  a slender forward with a long-range shooting touch, and Randy Funk, his more  rugged counterpart, give the team experience inside.  </P></p>

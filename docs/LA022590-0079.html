			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL VIDEOS: ARMCHAIR VISITS TO THE FAR EAST AND HIMALAYAS  </P> <P> One nice thing about travel by video is that you can visit any place you want,  any time you want. You don't have to follow traditional routes. This month, our  connecting flights of fantasy take us from the Far East and the Himalayas to  Switzerland.  </P> <P> "Portraits of the Great Far East" (International Travel Films, 85 minutes,  1989). The quality of Doug Jones' travelogue is first-rate and, combined with  his excellent narration, provides the viewer not only with a scenic journey but  a better appreciation of the culture and history of some of the most popular  destinations in the Far East. It also can be of help to those in the early  stages of planning a trip.  </P> <P> The first stop is cosmopolitan Tokyo and includes visits to the Imperial  Palace, the Ginza area and Buddhist temples, and a short train ride to view the  Great Buddha and the religious center of Kamakura.  </P> <P> That is followed by a trip to the southern island of Kyushu and the town of  Kagoshima for colorful festival scenes and a look at the still-active volcano  of Sakurajima, a tea ceremony at Iso Gardens and a visit to watch porcelain  being made. A return to Tokyo provides a look at the night life on the Ginza,  from Kabuki to Broadway shows.  </P> <P> In Korea, viewers are shown the pastoral countryside of this "Land of the  Morning Calm," and the city of Kyongju with its many temples and fascinating  cultural center.  </P> <P> The video next moves to Singapore for street scenes that show the Raffles  Hotel, original home of the Singapore Sling drink, plus modern hotels, old  alleys, Chinatown and duty-free shops combined with beautiful parks, all of  which reflect the high standard of living enjoyed in this island city.  </P> <P> The next stop is Bangkok, Thailand, where temple spires pierce the skyline and  klongs (canals) are the major thoroughfares. Stops include the Rose Garden -- a  colorful, cultural and entertainment center -- and a visit to the Royal Palace.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong there are the obligatory scenes of the crowded harbor, where navy  ships, junks, cruise ships and ferries vie for space, and traditional herbal  and snake shops contrast with modern shopping districts.  </P> <P> There are side trips to Aberdeen, which is crowded with boat people and  fishermen, and Kowloon in the more rural New Territories, to visit the Sung  Dynasty Village, where viewers see examples of old-style Chinese culture and  traditions.  </P> <P> A return to Hong Kong gives viewers a look at the subway system and duty-free  shopping (including the renowned tailors), and a sample of the varied night  life along Nathan Road.  </P> <P> Kuala Lumpur is the major stop in Malaysia, where the crowded streets are lined  with Islamic mosques. Rubber and tin are the foundation of the economy, and  many kinds of pewter objects are displayed. Also visited are the Batu Caves  north of Kuala Lumpur, where Hindus practice their religion.  </P> <P> Sri Lanka gets brief coverage, and the narration points out its current  troubles while showing scenes of the capital city of Colombo and rural farms,  where methods have remained unchanged for centuries. There's also a visit to  Kandy to see the Temple of the Tooth, snake charmers and the famous Kandian  dancers.  </P> <P> India is the last stop. Scenes of Madras show a "land of poverty and want"  that, according to the narration, is still a "fascinating spot."  </P> <P> Sacred cows, temples, a belief in reincarnation and the use of camels provide  some of the colorful threads that make up the fabric of India. The final  contrasting scenes are of Agra and the spectacularly beautiful Taj Mahal.  </P> <P> Jones' films were made for showing in theaters and have not been edited for  video viewing. There are no hotel or restaurant recommendations.  </P> <P> Tapes, and a brochure of his other videos, are available from International  Travel Films, P.O. Box 39402, Los Angeles 90039, (213) 663-4334. Price: $29.95.  </P> <P> "Exploring the Himalayas -- Nepal and Kashmir" (Questar Video Inc., 1989). A  visit to the mystical Himalayas is an adventure, even by video. Drawn by the  lure of awesome Mt. Everest and by James Hilton's illusive Shangri-La, more and  more tourists are exploring this remote corner of the world. For armchair  travelers, this video is a worthy substitute.  </P> <P> Against a background of scenes of the majestic, snow-covered mountains and  their peoples, the narration provides information on such things as the  history, geology, climate and religions that play such important roles in the  culture and economy.  </P> <P> Buddhism and Hinduism are the predominant religions, and countless rituals and  festivals plus 40 languages and numerous dialects add color and intrigue.  </P> <P> Srinigar, the capital of India's northern state of Kashmir (a site of current  unrest), is where the video journey begins, showing the vibrant streets and  waterways and the lovely gardens around Dal Lake, where lake dwellers live in  houseboats and travel by native craft and water taxis.  </P> <P> From Srinigar, viewers share a ride on a rickety bus (along a treacherous dirt  road) on a two-day trip over mountain passes to the city of Leh, in Ladakh, on  the arid Indus River plain, a land dotted with early Tibetan-Buddhist  monasteries.  </P> <P> Also from Srinigar is a breathtaking nine-day trek, most of which is at more  than 12,000 feet, to the spectacular Zanskar Valley, recently opened to  tourists.  </P> <P> Viewers see the primitive farming methods, religious rituals and life styles of  the hardy villagers of this isolated valley. There also are scenes showing the  daily routine of the monastic monks and of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader  of Tibetan Buddhism.  </P> <P> The video next moves to Nepal, birthplace of Buddha, where eight of the world's  10 highest mountains are found. Street scenes in Katmandu show ancient temples,  and in adjacent Patan we see intricately carved pagodas, a legacy of early  Newar artisans.  </P> <P> In contrast, viewers are shown the encroaching Western influence of a cola  bottling plant and modern hotels. The "hidden lanes" of Katmandu, however,  retain the early trading-center atmosphere, as merchants crowd sidewalks to  sell everything from flowers and food to haircuts.  </P> <P> Religious sights include a huge Vishnu shrine, the major Hindu temple of  Pashupatinath and the Bodhnath and Swayambhunath stupas (Buddhist shrines) with  their characteristic eyes of Buddha painted on the exteriors.  </P> <P> Viewers also see the colorful festival of Indra Jatra and the Kumari, the girl  child who represents a Hindu goddess.  </P> <P> There are also visits to a pottery market in nearby Bhaktapur and a bronze shop  to watch artisans at work.  </P> <P> There are few highways in Nepal, so trekking is the best way to see the  country. A popular trek, which takes three weeks to a month, follows a group  via Annapurna Mountain to villages and the valley of the Kali River, where  there is a mystical shrine.  </P> <P> Other highlights include a visit to villages of the famed Ghurka soldiers, a  wild river-rafting trip and an elephant ride in the animal sanctuary of Chitwan  National Park.  </P> <P> The final scenes take in Mt. Everest and the engaging Sherpa guides. When they  are not guiding treks they are shown as farmers, shopkeepers, artisans and  participants at a Tibetan-Buddhist festival.  </P> <P> There are no travel or hotel recommendations.  </P> <P> Tapes are available from Questar Travel Network, P.O. Box 11345, Chicago, Ill.  60611, toll-free (800) 544-8422. Price: $29.95.  </P> <P> "Switzerland" (Video Visits, International Video Network, 1989, 58 minutes).  This is a video that will tempt the most root-bound armchair traveler to get up  and go. In addition to its fine natural beauty, Switzerland -- bordered by  France, Germany, Austria and Italy -- has absorbed some of the culture of its  neighbors, giving each of its areas an intriguingly different flavor.  </P> <P> Zurich is the first stop on this summer tour. Viewers visit its elegant  shopping district, craft shops, museums, opera house and St. Peter's Cathedral  with its huge clock face, then head for Schaffhausen and the spectacular Rhine  Falls close to the German border.  </P> <P> The German influence also is evident in Lucerne. Scenes include the Kapellbruke  (bridge), the grotto with the "Dying Lion" sculpture, a ferry ride on Lake  Lucerne and a visit to a wedding celebration.  </P> <P> At Interlaken and Grindelwald, viewers see mountain climbers and glaciers in  the Jungfrau region and listen to a yodeling contest against a backdrop of  beautiful Alpine scenery.  </P> <P> The arcaded streets of the capital city of Bern offer scenes of the colorful  vegetable and flower markets, clock tower and Parliament building. These are  followed by a visit to Morat fortress for a magnificent view of the  countryside.  </P> <P> It's the French influence that is seen and heard in the town of Neuchatel, a  clock-making and wine-making center. Farther south in the French border  country, viewers visit Lausanne and Geneva on Lake Geneva. At Lausanne, you see  scenes of the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the nearby Castle of Chillon,  featured in Lord Byron's poem.  </P> <P> In cosmopolitan Geneva, a center of international organizations, scenes include  elegant shops, the university, Geneva flower clock and the Cathedral of St.  Pierre, built in AD 400, under which archeologists are shown excavating still  older structures.  </P> <P> Viewers then visit the resort town of Zermatt for vistas of the spectacular  Matterhorn seen from the town and cable cars, followed by a look at some  apres-ski activities.  </P> <P> The video then visits the Swiss Riviera on Lake Lugano, including Locarno,  Bellinzona and Lugano, where the influence is heavily Italian. Scenes in Lugano  show the market and outdoor cafes, health resorts and a park with famous sights  of Switzerland built in miniature.  </P> <P> Next, there's a brief visit to Andermatt and its health spa, Bad Ragaz, before  reaching Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland, dating back to 3000 BC.  </P> <P> The video concludes with scenes of the ski resorts at Arosa, Davos and St.  Moritz, and a brief look at the elaborately decorated buildings of Appenzell.  </P> <P> The film quality is very good and the narration informative. There are no tips  or travel recommendations.  </P> <P> Tapes are available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino  Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just learned that late this afternoon Alija  Izetbegovic, the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,  received Charles Redman, U.S. President Clinton's special envoy.  They held talks for almost two hours. Nedzad Leko has a report.    [Leko] Following the talks with Charles Redman, President  Izetbegovic told journalists the following:    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, you waited for  a long time. We had rather long talks. This was one in a  series of talks on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on restoring  peace. This is a kind of search for solution to the problem in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Of course, we touched on the unavoidable question of  territories. We also mentioned the problem of Sarajevo and  Mostar. We agreed that, as far as Sarajevo and Mostar are  concerned, we will proceed with the planned solution, that is,  the administration of Sarajevo by the United Nations and of  Mostar by the European Community. I think that we will stick to  these solutions. (?Representatives of the EC) have already  visited Mostar and I believe that Mostar representatives will go  to Brussels as early as next week to resume talks.    We are, therefore, still searching for a peaceful solution  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and these talks are part of the efforts in  that direction. I believe that they were very constructive and  useful. [end recording]    [Leko] Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament  session tomorrow and the Assembly of Citizens of Serb  Nationality in Sarajevo today, Charles Redman said:    [Begin Redman recording, in English fading into  Serbo-Croatian translation] All of these meetings are very  important. They demonstrate that the political leadership in  Bosnia is actively involved in the search for a solution for the  future. As the president said, there are many issues on our  agenda. Many of those things refer to a short-term improvement  in living conditions, the improvement of the situation in  Sarajevo, Mostar, and other areas in Bosnia, but we all know  that we have (?an important task), which is to try to find a  comprehensive solution to this war through talks. That is a very  difficult issue. (?The president) has been dealing with it for  months. I know that the Bosnian Government is permanently  committed to this aim, and I believe that the Bosnian Croats are  also interested in that, as we can see from the agreement on the  federation which will be discussed tomorrow at the [Bosnian]  parliament session. I hope that there is the same type of  constructive standpoint among the Bosnian Serbs.    It is only through a joint action by all three sides that we  will reach an effective and acceptable solution. These meetings  are an important part of that process. I have heard a lot of  encouraging statements at today's meeting of Citizens of Serb  Nationality, and I hope that the session of the Bosnian  parliament tomorrow will be equally encouraging. [end recording]    [Leko] Asked about the decision of the self-proclaimed  parliament in Pale to refuse to join the Bosniak-Croat  Federation, and whether he considered that decision final,  Charles Redman said:    [Begin Redman recording] I do not know whether that is the  final decision. We have known since the meeting in Geneva last  August that the Bosnian Serbs wanted a high degree of autonomy.  That led to the idea of a constitutional union which will  preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, but which will give its constituent  parts a high degree of autonomy [words indistinct]. I have not  heard anything from any side here in Bosnia that indicates that  they want something else. So, while the Serbs perhaps do not  want to become member of the federation in the same way that the  Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Government organized themselves,  I heard nothing that indicates that they would not be interested  in the idea of a constitutional union which preserves Bosnia.

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Toray slides despite improved fibre sales TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday posted falls in consolidated earnings for the full year to March. It blamed sluggish demand for its synthetic fibres, and lower profits at its construction affiliate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Pre-tax profits fell 11.4 per cent to Y64bn (Dollars 481.20m) on a 6.5 per cent rise in total sales, to Y976.7bn. After-tax profits fell 26.2 per cent to Y27.7bn. The company's fibre sales grew 10.1 per cent to Y489.9bn. However, the company said demand for nylon used in tyre cords and fishing nets declined. Sales of chemicals and new businesses declined 0.5 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively. Nylon resin sales slowed because of sluggish demand from the automotive and electronic industries. Polyester film sales also decreased because of low demand and increasing price competition from film for magnetic tapes and industrial materials. Sales of the housing and engineering division rose 7.8 per cent to Y219bn, but operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Y7.6bn.</p>

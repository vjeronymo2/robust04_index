			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Marketing and Advertising: Jingles go only part of the way Advertising has lost its way and needs to be reborn as a system of product information for consumers. Bill Ziff, chairman of Ziff Communications Company which specialises in magazine publishing, believes that the current decline in advertising has not just been caused by the recession. 'What's occurring today is caused by one basic trend: a loss of confidence in advertising's power to persuade the consumer.' This, Ziff told the recent Periodical Publishers' Association conference in London, had affected all media. Consumers were increasingly turned off by 'the search for the perfect jingle, the slogan so devoid of content that it could be about anything, the model with the happiest smile, the celebrity with the highest approval rating, the universal image to manipulate the presupposed mass-mind.' The transition to the more substantial advertising required by factually-driven purchasing decisions was already under way, Ziff predicted. It would tend to favour print and magazines over the electronic media. The loss of confidence was caused by advertising's outmoded appeal to anachronistic notions of a mass market. This was in stark contrast to the reality of the marketplace - the increasing sophistication of contemporary consumers and the fragmentation of once monolithic brand names into a host of customised lines and styles. As ever greater variety pours out of the world's manufacturers, Ziff argued, 'the advertising we carry continues to cling to the magic talisman of brand names in the outmoded belief that image can still override specific features and real price and value in the minds of knowledgeable consumers'. Advertising had lost its power over the consumer because of its banality. The rebirth of advertising as an indispensable information system, Ziff added, would make product quality a viable investment strategy 'by guiding highly-targeted buyer groups to the specific products that had the right pricing and features for them'.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW THEY'RE DOING;  </P> <P> INJURY SLOWED GEORGESON, HE WASN'T STOPPED  </P> <P> Mark Georgeson shuffles across the Pepperdine University campus and tries to  remember what it was like to walk without stiffness in his hip. Loping along  without discomfort is a distant memory.  </P> <P> Georgeson spends seven days a week rehabilitating. He lifts weights, does  aerobics and treads water in a swimming pool. Still, he hobbles.  </P> <P> Basketball used to be Georgeson's game. He was highly recruited as a senior at  Marina High School in 1987 and has played with and against some of the best in  the country. Now, climbing stairs is a challenge.  </P> <P> If anyone has a right to be depressed, it's Georgeson. His life and basketball  career were smashed, destroyed and mangled last Valentine's Day, along with the  car he was driving.  </P> <P> But Georgeson will have none of that. Pity? Save it for someone who needs it.  Georgeson says he is the luckiest guy around.  </P> <P> Nearly 10 months after regaining consciousness in what was left of his Honda  Civic, Georgeson is happy, content and, he says, better off than before.  </P> <P> He has undergone four surgical procedures to repair damage from the accident.  But while his mobility is impaired, he's still moving forward.  </P> <P> "Things never really stopped for me, it was more of a pause," Georgeson said.  "When you have a dream, like basketball, and then have it taken away, you can  do one of two things. You can bitch and moan or you can try to put the pieces  back together."  </P> <P> The pieces are there. The puzzle has changed.  </P> <P> Georgeson, a 6-foot-10 center who would have had two years of eligibility left  -- he averaged 4.0 points in 20 games last season -- remains on scholarship. He  helps with the team's post players and goes to nearly every game, sitting on  the bench.  </P> <P> But he has refocused his life, and playing basketball is no longer at the  center of it. Talking, teaching and helping are his games.  </P> <P> For the past three months, Georgeson has been a volunteer at Camp David  Gonzalez, which is run by the Los Angeles County probation department. Director  Bob Stanley says the juveniles who have been sent there have committed  felonies.  </P> <P> "Mark has a good rapport with the kids here," Stanley said. "Part of that might  be because of his size. But it is also because of the problems Mark has been  through. They can relate."  </P> <P> Georgeson became involved with the camp through his fiancee, Stella Berkebile,  who teaches there. He spends two hours almost every evening working with the  kids, coaching basketball, teaching English and sometimes just talking.  </P> <P> At first, the going was tough, the kids wary. But gradually, Georgeson has  reached them by talking about his own experience.  </P> <P> "It's tough for someone to get up in front of a crowd and talk about success,"  Georgeson said. "Not everyone can understand that, because not everyone has  experienced success. But you get up there and talk about anxiety, about fear,  about losing things and about pain, and every person will listen. Everyone has  experienced pain, whether its physical or mental."  </P> <P> Georgeson has worked closely with several kids at the camp and even brought two  of them to a recent Pepperdine game. Georgeson has been so effective with the  kids that Stanley has offered him a job. But Georgeson turned it down because  he wants to finish his education.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to graduate next December and said he might accept the job  then.  </P> <P> "We've had former NFL players come here and other athletes come here to talk to  the kids, but none has been as effective as Mark," Stanley said. "I wish we  could get him here full time."  </P> <P> For now, Georgeson is happy to volunteer. His main goal is to organize a  basketball team -- Camp Gonzalez was recently admitted to the Southern Section.  </P> <P> He hopes to open the season Jan. 17.  </P> <P> "Really, I've gotten far more from the kids there then they have from me,"  Georgeson said. "I learned that you can always find someone who is worse off  than you are.  </P> <P> "I remember I showed them my scar one time, and this kid lifts up his shirt and  showed me three scars on his chest from bullet holes. I certainly have been  much more fortunate than they have."  </P> <P> To get to Camp David Gonzalez, Georgeson has to drive along one of the winding  canyon roads that lead out of Malibu. It's the same road he took Feb. 14.  </P> <P> Georgeson, who had transferred to Pepperdine from Arizona in 1988, was feeling  pretty good that night. Pepperdine had lost at Loyola Marymount that evening,  but he was confident the Waves would win a rematch three nights later.  </P> <P> He had rounded a curve when headlights flashed in front of him. It's the only  thing Georgeson remembers about the accident.  </P> <P> "I woke up with the steering wheel up in my face," Georgeson said. "I couldn't  feel my leg. There was a bone coming out of my knee, and I was bleeding from my  scalp."  </P> <P> David Campbell, a Pepperdine assistant, lived near Georgeson and was a few  minutes behind. When he came upon the scene, he stopped but didn't realize  Georgeson was one of the victims.  </P> <P> "It obviously had just happened, because the cars were still smoldering,"  Campbell said. "Someone else had stopped, and I told him that I would go for  help. Mark must have recognized my voice, because I heard him yell, 'Coach.' It  was then I recognized his car."  </P> <P> Two other drivers stopped and were sent for help. Campbell stayed and tried to  comfort Georgeson.  </P> <P> "Coach kept saying, 'You're going to be all right; you're going to be all  right,' " Georgeson said. "They way he said it made it sound like I wasn't all  right at the time."  </P> <P> He wasn't. Georgeson had a broken pelvis, a broken leg, three broken ribs and a  large gash on the top of his forehead.  </P> <P> The paramedics arrived 20 minutes later. They took the other driver away in a  helicopter. He later died of injuries sustained in the accident.  </P> <P> Georgeson was pinned in the car, so they had to free him with the "Jaws of  Life." It was a slow process because of the way he was situated. After nearly  an hour, they finally worked Georgeson free and took him to Westlake Hospital.  </P> <P> "Mark's mom called me about 1:30 a.m. and asked me to drive her to the  hospital," said Berkebile. "When we got there, they were just getting Mark's  clothes off. They didn't say that he would make it, and they didn't say he  wouldn't make it. After six hours of surgery, they finally told us he was going  to be all right."  </P> <P> For the next 40 days, Georgeson was in the hospital. He had two operations on  his hip, one on his face and one on his knee.  </P> <P> Berkebile, who attended Newport Christian High School in Newport Beach, refused  to leave the hospital except to get a change of clothes. She slept on a cot in  his room and showered in the nurses' locker room.  </P> <P> Three nights after the accident, Pepperdine beat Loyola Marymount, 131-123. The  Wave players wore blue ribbons on their uniforms to honor Georgeson.  </P> <P> "As soon as the game was over, I grabbed the game ball," Pepperdine Coach Tom  Ashbury said. "All the players signed it and I took it over to the hospital  that night. Mark was awake when I got there, but he was in a fog because of the  medication he was on. I left the ball on the bed."  </P> <P> The next morning, Georgeson woke up to find the ball and realized Pepperdine  had won.  </P> <P> "That was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had," he said. "It made me  feel like I had a lot of special friends."  </P> <P> During the next few weeks, cards, letters and gifts were delivered in bunches.  </P> <P> Georgeson was hampered by a foot injury as a freshman and played only six  minutes for Arizona before transferring midway through the 1988-89 season.  Still, he was remembered. There were more than 1,000 letters from people who  lived in Tucson.  </P> <P> "There was one letter I know I'll always remember," Georgeson said. "It was  from a girl who had gone with her family to Kansas City for the Final Four (in  1988). On the way home, they were hit by a drunk driver, and her father and  brothers were killed.  </P> <P> "The letter she sent me had happy faces on it, and she wrote that I shouldn't  get down. I broke down and cried. Here was someone who had been thrown  something a lot worse than me and she was encouraging me."  </P> <P> Georgeson will never play basketball competitively again. Doctors have told him  that he could possibly play in two or three years, but Georgeson said he won't  chance it.  </P> <P> "They said I could develop severe arthritis in my hip if I played," he said. "I  want to have a family and I want to play with my kids in the yard. I don't want  to be confined to a chair while they grow up.  </P> <P> "Besides, I've already gotten far more out of basketball than I put into it."  </P></p>

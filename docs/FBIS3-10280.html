			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] The Workers Property Area, known as APT, is  barely off the ground but is already making itself felt in the  economy because of the influence that it has in certain areas,  mainly agriculture and livestock.    Most of the enterprises that make up the APT today were sold  to the workers or leased to them with promises that they would  be sold. They were in deplorable financial condition, however,  and their equipment and facilities were clearly run down.    In many cases the workers have sought domestic and foreign  partners, while in others they are facing serious financial  difficulties since they cannot get loans because they do not yet  have documents legitimizing their ownership. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Organization and Management in the APT </H5>   Definition and nature of the APT: There is no totally  accepted, widely discussed definition of the APT yet. There are  only interpretations based on the economic and social "Consensus  Accords" that have emerged from the privatization of state-run  enterprises that has been going on since 1991 and on the  organizational process in which these enterprises now find  themselves.    The following definition has been drafted with the aim of  stimulating discussion that will lead to consensus on a clear,  precise meaning of the term.    APT is understood to mean "the group of enterprises in  which,  under their system of ownership, the workers participate as  shareholders (majority or minority), thus forming a new  grass-roots economic sector based on the struggles of the  working class and their trade-union grievances relating to the  social ownership of the state-run sector created by the  Sandinist People's Revolution."    The enterprises of the APT have been established as  corporations under the national legal system. Owing to their  origin, their goal is collective profits, which differentiates  them from traditional private enterprise.    The following are some of the differences and similarities  that have been identified:  <H5>  Traditional Private Enterprise </H5>    -  One or several partners--Goal: profits    -  Partners investing  capital    -  Heavily dependent on bank loans    -  Some degree of union  activity    -  Wage-earning employees    -  Considerable managerial  capability    -  Marketing experience    -  Individual  profits    -  Labor/management relations    -  Economic and financial  plans   <H5>    APT Enterprise </H5>    -  Many worker partners--Goal: profits    -  Partners investing  capital    -  Heavily dependent on bank loans    -  Union  self-management    -  Wage-earning employees and owners    -  Basic  managerial capability    -  Little marketing experience    -  Collective  profits    -  Partner/worker relations    -  Socioeconomic plans       What type of partners are there in the APT?    The law permits different categories of shares, establishing  differences between partners in accordance with what kind of  shares they hold.    Some Labor Corporations (14) have specified in their  constitutions and bylaws that all shares are registered. They  have, however, established another category that takes into  account the labor relationship between the enterprise and the  partner. There are thus two kinds of shares: "A" and "B."    --Type A shares are all those that are in the possession of  partners who are working in the enterprise. Type B shares are  those that are in the possession of partners who chose not to  continue working in their enterprise.    --The rights of partners vary according to the type of share  (A or B) they hold. Partners with type A shares will be entitled  to vote at meetings. Partners with type B shares have the right  to attend and speak at meetings but cannot vote, and other  restrictions on the exercise of the right arise from this.  Partners with type B shares may not hold any managerial post in  the enterprise.    --The two types of shares confer equal rights in the  distribution of profits.    In other enterprises in the APT there is no difference  between partners, regardless of whether they are working or not;  thus, they have equal rights at meetings (to speak up and vote),  the same right to seek administrative posts, and an equal share  in profits.    If a worker is an owner in an enterprise, can he be fired?  What happens then?    In the case of APT enterprises, shareholder rights do not  guarantee a permanent job, inasmuch as this depends on the  efficiency and responsibility of each worker. People must  realize that jobs cannot be guaranteed to the detriment of the  enterprise's finances.    Ultimately, a worker's job will depend on the enterprise's  economic potential and the effective use of manpower. An  owner/worker can be justifiably dismissed in order to safeguard  the profitability and production efficiency of the enterprise  and to protect collective assets.    Nevertheless, a worker who is fired or decides to leave the  enterprise retains all his rights as a shareholder.    Dismissal should be the last resort, inasmuch as an  enterprise has several ways of helping its worker/partners and a  wide range of options for their direct employment. The following  are some options that both agricultural and industrial  enterprises have tried:    --Rotation of work shifts    --Work on credit    --Lowering wages    The following can be regarded as options for indirect  employment in the event of payroll cuts in the agricultural,  industrial, or services sector:    --Work on family parcels    --Temporary harvest work    --Work as a distributor, commission agent, or salesperson  in one's hometown    --Others  <H5>  The Initial Capital of APT Enterprises </H5>   The agricultural and industrial APT enterprises were created  by Presidential Resolution No. 109-91 (see Cuaderno No. 10,  Annex 3 of Cipres [Center for Sociological Research]). The first  to win contracts with Cornap [National Corporation of the Public  Sector] were the agricultural enterprises, which negotiated  resources from the state-run corporations Agroexco, Hatonic,  Cafenic, Bananic [Nicaraguan Banana Enterprise], Nicarroz, and  Trabanic.    An initial group of industrial and services enterprises  concluded negotiations in early 1993 and acquired enterprises  from the COIP [People's Industrial Corporation], Conilac, Corcop  [People's Commercial Corporation], Cotur, and other agencies.    The initial capital of the APT enterprises is the capital  that the state-run enterprises had at the time of the  negotiations; it consists of land, plantations, machinery, and  other resources and was acquired under lease and purchase  contracts with the owner (the State).

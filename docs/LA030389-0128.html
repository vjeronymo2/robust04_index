			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Some years back Daniel Douke switched from painting trompe l'oeil cardboard  cartons to non-figurative canvases. These have the same alchemical yearning to  turn one thing into another. In this show, Douke transforms acrylic, plastic  and bondo into chameleon textures resembling everything from troweled on,  whip-cream-thick finger paint, to lacquered, technicolor metal.  </P> <P> His earlier penchant for making paint look like actual objects may have  reflected a frustrated sculptural bent. He gives this impulse full rein in  works like "Incident" with its three uppermost horizontal bands of raw, frothy  color and "aged metal" stakes protruding out a foot or more from a densely  layered square field.  </P> <P> Abstract compositions caged behind faux-metal grates are so convincing they  invite a touch test. Douke has so thoroughly mastered the nuts and bolts of  painting that he can keep thrashing around at its frontiers. However, the works  that stay with us keep the three-dimensional pyrotechnics in check, opting for  pure, clear abstract emblems close in feel to Jasper Johns. In spite of  considerable technical facility, too many works leave us wondering what the  point is. (Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa Monica Blvd., to March 11.) MARLENA  DONOHUE  </P></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Interest costs keep Birse in the red Birse Group, the building and civil engineering company, yesterday announced a return to operating profit for the six months to October 1993, after two years of losses. The recovery was led by increased activity from the company's construction division, but interest payments of Pounds 1.98m resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a Pounds 2.71m loss a year earlier. Operating profit amounted to Pounds 580,000 (Pounds 429,000 loss). Birse announced a Pounds 24m placement in December, to counter the impact of write-downs on its property portfolio and the effects of collapsing profit margins on its construction business. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said: 'We've bottomed out, I think, but how quickly the recovery will happen is still in doubt.' Turnover increased by 20.5 per cent to Pounds 197.3m. The rise was wholly accounted for by Birse Construction, which reported a Pounds 774,000 profit, against a loss of Pounds 615,000 a year earlier. Mr Birse said the company had started to push into more stable sectors of the construction industry, primarily public sector contracts such as schools, hospitals and refurbishment of council estates. With its strengthened balance sheet, Birse has been able to compete more strongly for new contracts, and this should result in a stronger order book over the next three months. The company's plant hire business remained profitable at the interim stage, and Birse's housebuilding business recorded its first operating profit. Birse has decided to wind down its commercial property development and investment business over the next two years. The portfolio is valued at Pounds 30m, and reflects present market values, so this would enable the group to reduce net debt from its current level of Pounds 17.3m. Losses per share amounted to 2.1p (3.6p).</p>

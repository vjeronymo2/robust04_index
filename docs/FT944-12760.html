			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fyffes buys IPounds 5m stake in Jamaican venture Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetables distributor, is to pay IPounds 5m (Pounds 4.94m) for 40 per cent of a new Jamaican banana company. Jamaica Banana Holdings has been formed along with the Jamaican Government and Jamaica Producers Group, a Jamaican quoted producer, to acquire two large estates which together cultivate 3,000 acres of bananas. The deal is part of the continuing privatisation of the Jamaican banana industry. The government is understood to have just 5 per cent of the new group. Fyffes, which markets about a third of Jamaican banana production, said the existing arrangements would continue unchanged. Earlier this week Fyffes made its sixth move in continental Europe in the last 18 months. It bought 50 per cent of Tropic International, a French fresh produce group which is expected to have sales of IPounds 30m this year. The consideration is understood to be about IPounds 1.5m. The acquisition lifts Fyffes' total annualised turnover in France to IPounds 100m. Fyffes is now jostling with Geest and Dole for second place behind Chiquita in the European fruit distribution market. In addition to France it operates in Spain, Denmark, Holland and Germany.</p>

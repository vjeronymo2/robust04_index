			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Writing on the wall for art thieves A centralised database of works of art has been set up by a Palm Beach County businessman to help prevent the trade in purloined paintings. Roger J Mealey believes the database will enable insurance companies and museums to ascertain whether a work is genuine or stolen. On registration by the owner, an image of the picture is digitised and colour scanned. Subscribers to the service then get access to the Sarte Collection records using a computer and modem.

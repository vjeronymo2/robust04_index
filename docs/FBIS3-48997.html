			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Government of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia profoundly regrets the resolution on the situation in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was recently adopted by the  UN General Assembly. This was stated in a letter sent to UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali by Dragomir Djokic, head of the  Yugoslav mission in the United Nations, on behalf of the  Yugoslav Government.    The assertion by the authors of the resolution that  Bosnia-Herzegovina is the victim of Serbian aggression has been  refuted in practice with fierce fighting between the Bosnian  Croats and Muslims. The authors of the resolution, the letter  states, ignore the fact that it is the Bosnian Muslims who have  been persistently obstructing the peace process in the past few  months and refusing to accept and implement the agreements that  the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia  consider realistic and just.    The Yugoslav Government rejects the accusations about  concentration camps throughout the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and stresses that such camps are run by the Bosnian  Muslims and the Bosnian Croats.    The resolution also mentions the violation of human rights  of  ethnic Albanians, Bosnians, Hungarians, Croats, and others in  Kosmet [Kosovo-Metohija] and Vojvodina, which is not only  something that the resolution should not be dealing with but  also represents an unprecedented fabrication and distortion of  the truth, the letter states.    Particularly unacceptable is the fact that Security Council  Resolution 820, which was imposed on the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia because the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen  plan, is still in force, even though cochairmen David Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg have abandoned the plan themselves. This  was pointed out by Ambassador Djokic in the letter to  Butrus-Ghali.</p>

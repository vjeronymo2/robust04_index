			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LOAD OF PLATE GLASS FALLS ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY  </P> <P> Ten tons of plate glass fell off a truck and shattered early this morning on  the Golden State Freeway near Saugus, causing a three-car collision, at least  15 flat tires and the closure of the southbound lanes of the freeway for more  than an hour, authorities said.  </P> <P> The glass fell from a truck carrying 21 tons of plate glass from Fresno to Los  Angeles, said Officer Ralph Elvira of the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Elvira said the truck, driven by Raul Hinojosa, 55, of Parlier, was traveling  south on the freeway near Hasley Canyon Road at 4:15 a.m. when it "swerved  abruptly," causing the glass to slide onto the roadway and shatter.  </P> <P> Three cars collided as they tried to avoid the glass, Elvira said. No one was  injured in the collisions.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Jodi Ransone said that when she arrived at the scene, 15 vehicles  with flat tires lined the right shoulder and center divider of the freeway near  the spilled glass. Elvira said several other motorists called this morning to  complain about flat tires.  </P> <P> The CHP closed the southbound lanes of the freeway while Department of  Transportation crews cleaned up the glass. Two lanes were reopened after 5:30  a.m., Elvira said. The freeway was reopened completely at 8:30 a.m., he said.  </P></p>

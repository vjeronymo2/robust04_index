			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Battered by storms but heading for port: The chief executive of Royal Insurance NOBODY thought we'd have the guts to do it,' said Mr Richard Gamble, the chief executive of Royal Insurance, whose decision last week to omit the company's final dividend surprised the City and precipitated something of a run on the company's already battered shares. Mr Gamble - who took over the hot seat late last year  - believed he had no option and said the decision enjoyed the unanimous support of Royal's board. Royal's pre-tax losses of Pounds 373m were substantially worse than many analysts had expected and very nearly double the Pounds 187m loss reported in 1990. That result was the first time the company had ever been in the red in its 147-year history. In the last two years the company's balance sheet has been wrecked by a succession of catastrophic losses. It paid out Pounds 100m to meet the cost of storm losses in January 1990, and a further Pounds 126m to meet claims from subsidence damage to houses. Last year it was hit even harder by insurance claims from building societies and banks who have lost millions of pounds on sales of properties repossessed after their owners had defaulted on mortgages. Royal is a market leader in this class of insurance - known as domestic mortgage indemnity - and underwrites one in every five contracts. It has paid out Pounds 66m in claims and made provisions of more than Pounds 200m for future claims which it expects to emerge after properties repossessed but not yet sold are disposed of. The group's solvency margin - the gauge used by insurers which compares net assets as a percentage of annual premium income - fell to 29 per cent at the year end, a level nearly twice as high as the legal minimum but much too low for comfort. Subsequently the sale last month of Royal's Dutch subsidiary to a newly formed European joint venture - which Royal jointly owns along with Germany's AMB and Italy's Fondiaria - has pushed up the margin to 34 per cent. Even so a dividend payout - even maintained at last year's level  - would have cost more than Pounds 90m, including the cost of advanced corporation tax. After Royal reported disastrous half-year results last August, many analysts had been expecting a cut but few had advised their clients that the dividend might be passed altogether. The result was a rush of selling on Thursday, led by the managers of income funds. This wiped nearly 20 per cent off the company's market value. At the end of the week Royal's share price stood at 183p, compared with a 1991 high of more than 400p and a high in 1990 of nearly 600p. Capitalisation has sunk to less than Pounds 900m and the Royal could drop out of the FT-SE 100, a huge blow to morale for a company which for much of this century has regarded itself as the most eminent UK insurer. Mr Gamble and his senior colleagues were shaken by the fall and are bitterly critical of what they allege to be shortsightedness by the market. 'What shocked me was the freefall,' said Mr Gamble, who believes that the market has not fully appreciated the extent of change introduced to the Royal since he assumed effective control early last year. A former deputy finance director of British Airways, he has waged war on the lax underwriting and financial controls that he believes to be at the root of the company's present demise. A succession of senior managers have been replaced, frequently by executives from outside the insurance industry. Costs have been cut - last year 1,500 people left Royal's worldwide operations, nearly one third of them in the UK. Under Mr Gamble's direction, Royal is less concerned about its share of the market than it was in the early 1980s, when the company grew rapidly in the UK and North America. 'I was horrified when I came into this business and found it so driven by market share,' he says. Strategic thinking at the Royal, like the insurance industry in general, is too dominated by industry concepts like expense ratios (which measure expenses as a percentage of premiums) which give little guide to the underlying profitability of business being written, adds Mr Gamble. Companies can reduce their expenses ratio simply by underwriting large quantities of business which may ultimately generate losses. 'We've got to look at real money', he says. The new profit-centred approach draws a great deal from the experience of Royal's Canadian operation, led in the 1980s by Mr Roy Elms. He transformed a loss-making business by insisting that his underwriters become more selective about risks and backed away from potential problem areas. Royal no longer boasts that it is Canada's biggest insurance company but last year the company increased its profits. Mr Gamble regards Royal Canada as a 'template' for the global operation and has appointed Mr Elms to a new position of group underwriting director. Royal claims some progress has been made already. Last year it reduced the number of policies it writes by around 10 per cent. In some loss-making areas like motor business the reduction was even sharper. Royal reduced the number of motor fleet insurance policies it sold by 30 per cent, and insures 17 per cent fewer private motorists than it did 13 months ago. The problem, though, is that any improvements have been masked by the company's mortgage indemnity results. Mr Gamble accuses the market of 'myopia', but analysts are still worried. The market is concerned by the scale and uncertainty of the mortgage indemnity claims. Royal latest estimate is that total losses on mortgage indemnity for last year, 1992 and 1993 could amount to Pounds 450m. This compares with an estimate of Pounds 400m just three months ago. 'It just seems to get worse,' said one analyst, pointing out that Royal reacted to the problem later than some of its competitors. 'Under the circumstances Mr Gamble is a doing a pretty good job. But he is in the sort of circumstances that you wouldn't want to be in in the first place.'</p>

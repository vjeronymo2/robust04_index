			<p>BFN     [Text] The president-elect of Malawi, Mr. Bakili Muluzi,  has pledged an open government and a close working relationship  with opposition parties. Addressing a media conference in  Blantyre, he said he held no grudge against the previous  government of Dr. Kamuzu Banda, and that he did not believe in  starting a witch-hunt against its members.    Mr. Muluzi said he would have no problem in seeking an  alliance with Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy in  the event of his party not gaining an outright majority. The  final results of the elections are expected later today.    On relations with South Africa, Mr. Muluzi said he would  seek  close cooperation and pointed out that a formal trade agreement  existed between the two countries. He said the alleviation of  poverty in Malawi and environmental affairs would receive  priority. His inauguration as president will take place in  Blantyre on Saturday.</p>

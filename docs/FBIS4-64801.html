			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Increasingly More Want To Go Along </F> With the EU"]    [Text] Almost half, specifically 47 percent, of Finns are  in favor of joining the EU (European Union). The Finnish  Broadcasting Company's Finnish-language television news program  on Friday [22 April] announced results of the most recent  opinion poll on the issue. Of those queried, 31 percent oppose  joining and 21 percent have not yet made up their minds. The  margin of error in the poll is approximately 3 percent.    The differences are not great, compared with the  corresponding poll taken a month ago. The EU supporters have now  increased by 2 percentage points, and opponents by four points.    The group of those unsure whether they are for or against  has  clearly gotten smaller. This is above all interpreted as  resulting from the way the poll was conducted. Questions in the  second poll were asked through personal interviews, and not by  telephone [as was the earlier one].    The poll was conducted by Taloustutkimus. A total of 921  Finnish voters were interviewed in their homes in early April.  Among other questions presented them was: "Should Finland join  the EU in accordance with the results achieved in the accession  talks?" In addition, the interview subject was invited to  explain his stand. Most replied that Finland cannot afford to  stay outside, that the country would otherwise simply not be  able to manage.    It is also assumed that EU membership will improve exports  and reduce prices.    Opponents to the EU based their arguments on the belief that  Finland would lose its independence and its right to decide its  own interests if the country joined the EU. In addition, many  are afraid Finland will be forced to pay large sums. General  uncertainty was also mentioned as a reason.</p>

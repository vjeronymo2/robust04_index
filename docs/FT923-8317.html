			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tribunal backs Maori claim on fisheries THE WAITANGI Tribunal, the powerful advisory body on Maori affairs, has recommended that most of the fisheries of New Zealand's South Island be handed over to the Ngai Tahu - one of the country's smallest tribes. The tribunal in its findings said that the government had failed in a number of ways to honour its obligations to the South Island-based tribe from the signing of the treaty between the British and Maori people in 1840. These included purchasing 34.5m acres from the tribe which left them landless and with no economic base on which to fish, failure to protect and conserve the sea fisheries and an assumption that non-Maoris had equal rights with Maoris over their fishery. The tribunal said that the Ngai Tahu had an exclusive right to fish virtually all the South Island coastline as well as a reasonable share of the 200-mile deep water fishery. In the past similar findings have led to substantial cash settlements with the Maori tribes concerned, and observers say one in this case could be worth between NZDollars 500m and NZDollars 800m. However, a settlement much smaller than this is likely with the tribe gaining a direct share of the resource. Tribunal members rejected the tribe's claim for all sea fisheries off its boundaries, equivalent to 70 per cent of New Zealand's total commercial fisheries. Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said the recommendation would not be accepted in full, especially as it would favour just one small group of Maori. Maori representatives have emphasised that they do not plan any compulsory acquisition of South Island fishing held now by non-Maoris. In its finding the tribunal said allowances should be made for the serious depletion of the inshore fisheries, caused by non-Maori fishing, when working out a reasonable share of the deep water fisheries. Ngai Tahu's 28.000 members are already set to become the main beneficiaries of a Dollars 120 million 10 per cent commercial fishing quota that had previously been agreed they would receive under the Maori Fisheries Act. If the tribunal's recommendation was granted, the Ngai Tahu tribe would receive about 85 per cent of the total fishery for hoki, the major export fish.</p>

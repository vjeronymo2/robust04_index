			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Derya Sazak: "The United States Creates </F> Difficult Situation"]    [Text] It is common knowledge that the United States does  not maintain a favorable approach to Turkey's initiative to  reach an agreement with Iraq to reoperate the Karkuk-Yumurtalik  oil pipeline, which has been abandoned to corrode. A visit to  the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday further  clarified the U.S. stance on the matter. Ambassador Richard  Barkley held talks with Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and made  various proposals, which are regarded as a "formula."    Ambassador Barkley's written proposals indicate that the  U.S.  Administration, let alone trying to facilitate the "operation to  save the pipeline," wishes to further complicate the matter by  transferring it to the UN Security Council.    The contacts Ambassador Barkley made shed light on the U.S.  stance on the matter some time ago. While the U.S. officials  explained the anxiety in Washington caused by the initiatives  that may result in the violation of the embargo against Iraq,  the White House approach was outlined as follows: "Former  President Bush won the war. President Clinton does not wish to  lose what has been achieved."    That viewpoint was an indication that the assessments that  led to the Gulf War have not changed and that the embargo will  remain in effect as long as Saddam Husayn leads Iraq. It is a  fact that the recent UN Security Council resolutions contained  moderate provisions in favor of Iraq. However, they lacked any  tendency that may have led to a change in the present situation.  Consequently, the messages from the U.S. State Department are  aimed at forcing Turkey to move within the framework of that  approach.    Turkey wishes to operate the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline to  withdraw the oil in it. Furthermore, it is inclined to agree to  resume the pumping operations after it withdraws the oil in the  pipeline. However, the United States has drawn Turkey's  attention to the UN resolutions. More importantly, it has asked  Turkey to hold talks with Britain, France, and Russia and  "persuade" them to agree to the resumption of the flow of oil in  that pipeline. Apparently, the United States has defended the  view that Turkey has to seek the consent of the countries that  have established a coalition against Iraq.    In addition to limiting Turkey's "maneuvering" capability in  its effort to have the embargo against Iraq relaxed, various  aspects of Ambassador Barkley's letter to Ozdem Sanberk can be  described as rather harsh. For example, a reference was made to  Article 50 of the UN Charter on the existing economic problems  in Turkey, which also justified the effort made to help Turkey  redeem the loss it has incurred from the embargo on Iraq.  Regarding the concept of "support," Article 50 says in part:  "If any country, regardless of whether it is a UN member, is  confronted with special economic problems as a result of the  implementation of the preventive or compelling measures the UN  Security Council may take against any country, then that country  has the right to appeal to the UN Security Council for the  solution of its problems."    Yes, that is the recommendation that has been made to Turkey  by a friendly country, the United States! The message that has  been conveyed to Turkey is quite clear: "We understand you.  You have incurred an economic loss as a result of the Gulf War.  You are in financial difficulty at the present time. If you  expect any help, then you better appeal to the United Nations."    Is that not disrespectful? It is as if Turkey is regarded as  a country like Somalia. As far as aid is concerned, the United  States is forcing the Ciller administration in Ankara to beg  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's organization, in addition to the IMF and  the World Bank. That is shameful.    The United States reached an agreement with President  Mubarak  and quickly erased Egypt's debts to unite the Arab world against  Saddam Husayn when the Gulf War broke out. However, that  country has advised Turkey to appeal to the UN Security Council  only three years after that state of affairs.    The quota of $1.6 billion is the only key to the resumption  of pumping operations in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The UN  condition is that 30 percent of that amount be transferred to  the reparations fund. However, Iraq has regarded that condition  as a violation of its sovereignty. Consequently, it has endured  the embargo. Therefore, it is impossible for Turkey to persuade  Iraq to agree to sell its oil and channel the profit it makes to  the UN reparations fund. Actually, Turkey is not concerned with  the sale of oil at this stage. It is only trying to save the  oil pipeline. However, it seems that its initiatives have been  judged to be too much.    The views Ambassador Barkley conveyed to Ozdem Sanberk  yesterday indicated that Turkey "has missed the train" on the  question of having pumping operations in the oil pipeline  resumed. The valves could have been turned on immediately after  Sanberk returned from Baghdad to Ankara some time ago. However,  the question of the needs of Turkey, which has expected a  formula from the United States, have been transferred to the  commission [not further specified] once again. The U.S.  officials have invited the Foreign Ministry officials to hold  talks in Washington at the end of May. Meanwhile, they want  Turkey to reach an agreement with Britain, France, and Russia.    The question as to how Ankara will manage to persuade  Moscow,  London, and Paris to agree is unknown. Also unknown is how long  southeastern Turkey, whose economy is on the verge of collapse,  can continue to endure the embargo. It is a pity for the people  of this country. It is as if the embargo has been imposed on  Turkey and not on Iraq. Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin's visit to the Habur border gate was the only "timid"  step that has been taken to revive the border trade between  Turkey and Iraq thus far.    If Barkley's letter will not be enough to force the Turkish  Grand National Assembly members to remember our national  interests and Turkey's sovereign rights, then what are the  "warnings" they need that they may do so?    Meanwhile, why is the parliament undecided on rejecting the  extension of the Hammer Force's mandate? Is it because the  parliamentarians believe that the United States may act with a  sense of fairness and provide the aid Turkey needs? We believe  that this is something that will not happen.</p>

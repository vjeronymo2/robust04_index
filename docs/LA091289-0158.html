The team has lost 12 of 14 extra-inning games this season.  </P> <P> The weekend losses dropped the Indians to 14 1/2 games out of first place in  the American League East division and 13 games under .500. Both marks were the  worst of the season for Cleveland, which had Monday off.  </P> <P> The Indians went into Tuesday night's start of a home series against Detroit  with a 65-78 record, in sixth place in the division.  </P> <P> Through Sunday's loss, the Indians had lost eight of their last 10 games.  </P> <P> Edwards, 52, was named Cleveland's 33rd manager July 16, 1987, replacing Pat  Corrales. Last year, his first full season with the Indians, the team went  78-84, a 17-win improvement over the 1987 season.  </P></p>

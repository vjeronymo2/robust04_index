			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: POP STARS**** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE*** GOOD VIBRATIONS** MAYBE BABY*  RUNNING ON EMPTY  </P> <P> RICK ASTLEY  </P> <P> "Hold Me In Your Arms." RCA.**  </P> <P> The second album by the British pop star features more of the pleasant but  disposable dance/pop that marked his platinum debut last year. Astley, a Grammy  nominee for best new artist, has a manly voice and a shy, courtly manner that  make him seem like a clean-cut version of the randier George Michael.  </P> <P> The 22-year-old is a capable vocalist, as he proves on an earnest, soulful  version of the Temptations' classic, "Ain't Too Proud to Beg." But too much of  the album is filled with featherweight fodder that makes Europop confections by  ABBA and the Pet Shop Boys seem heavy by comparison.  </P> <P> The encouraging sign is that Astley had more creative input on this album than  he did on his debut. He wrote and co-produced half of the songs, including the  warm, melodic title track and the sassy first single, "She Wants to Dance With  Me." And Astley's songs are more distinctive and interesting than the  homogenized, assembly-line fluff by the British writing/production combine  Stock-Aitken-Waterman, which crafted back-to-back No. 1 hits for the singer  last year. If this teen heart-throb is to achieve any credibility as an adult  pop star, he should break from his pop-minded mentors and work with producers  who will encourage him to be more soulful and mature.

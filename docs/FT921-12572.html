			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Edberg sees off young pretenders - Tennis THIS afternoon Monica Seles, the queen of women's tennis, will face the 20-year-old American, Mary Joe Fernandez, in an attempt to grunt her way to a second Australian Open crown to retain tenure of three of the four grand slam championships. Of the major titles, Wimbledon alone lies in other hands, and this year the 19-year-old Yugoslav double-hander, whose mysterious last-minute withdrawal from Wimbledon last year caused a row, says she intends to make a strong challenge at the world's oldest championship. Only then will we know where among great champions we should rank this remarkable player. In turn, tomorrow sees an intriguing clash between the two men ranked 1 and 2 in the world - Stefan Edberg of Sweden and Jim Courier of the US. This is a repeat of last year's US Open final, when the 26-year-old Swede lifted his game to undreamt-of heights in 6-2 6-4 6-0 victory that he described as his best-ever tennis. In spite of a nine-week lay-off, Edberg is almost back to that form under the guidance of coach Tony Pickard, the British Davis Cup captain. In many ways this has been an historic Australian Open. As if to underline the rapid rise of so many talented youngsters, for the first time we had two unseeded men's singles semi-finalists: Wayne Ferreira of South Africa and Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands. These two 20-year-olds came to the fore at these championships last year by reaching the last 16 unseeded at their first attempt. This time they confirmed their promise. Ferreira had three good wins. First he beat Karel Novacek (seeded 8) in four sets, then the Wimbledon semi-finalist David Wheaton (15), also in four, and finally the rejuvenated John McEnroe in an absorbing match. Before that McEnroe, unseeded and unfancied, had played vintage '83 tennis to remind us of his immense talent. First he thrashed defending champion Boris Becker, who seemed determined to prove that he is now a baseliner (how arrogant can you get?); then he thwarted Emilio Sanchez in the match of the championships so far. After winning the first two sets and being caught at two sets all by the speedy Spaniard, the 32-year-old US left-hander had looked on the point of collapse on a sweltering afternoon. When McEnroe saved three match points in the final set and came through to win it 8-6 after four hours 32 minutes of sweat and toil, he received an ovation that even in his heyday he rarely experienced. This was a new McEnroe. He competed hard but with complete fairness. He refused to question a single call, and how they loved him. But the effort had taken its toll. In spite of intravenous re-hydration he had nothing left to give. Ferreira was put in his place by Edberg. But the favourite had to save two set points in the first set before cruising into his fourth Australian final with a 7-6 6-1 6-2 victory, and he was impressed. 'Wayne showed that he can really play good tennis; he started fast and didn't seem to be nervous,' said Edberg. Krajicek's victories over former French Open champion Michael Chang (14) and the current Wimbledon champion Michael Stich (4), both in five sets, were immensely impressive. In the past this 6 ft 3 ins Dutchman has failed in long matches, most notably against Ivan Lendl at last year's US Open when he held match point in the fourth set - only to lose it and the next six games as well. In both his tests here he was magnificently purposeful. Against Chang he threw the fourth set to conserve energy and won the decider 6-3, ending with three aces. Against Stich he could afford no such luxury: he was two sets to one behind. The way he held his serve, and his nerve, proved the value of his training under the guidance of Amsterdam-based coach Rohan Goetzke. This has included haptotherapy, a means of inducing mental relaxation through touch. The treatment has certainly transformed a man who, in his junior days, was notorious for his instability. Krajicek's decision to default to the No 2 seed Courier was sad but inevitable after he had retired during his doubles semi-finals with Jan Siemerink against the Australians Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde on Thursday. His serving arm was simply worn out. 'Before this I had never passed the second round of doubles in a grand slam,' he said. 'Suddenly I'm playing every day. I have only just stopped growing. I haven't got my strength yet, so it's pretty dangerous to play too much tennis.' But even after the tournament doctor had warned him of the dangers, he did not find it easy to accept that he should not continue. 'It was one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make. It was the chance of a lifetime to play a semi-final of a grand slam. I don't know if it will ever happen again.' Seles had been a trifle lucky to win here for the first time last year. In a tense semi-final against Fernandez she had faced a match point against the tenacious baseliner. The 20-year-old American will relish the opportunity to challenge her again today after an impressive semi-final win against the No 2 seed, Gabriela Sabatini, that revealed a new, aggressive quality in her play. Although Sabatini had won nine of their 14 previous meetings, including the last six, the Argentinian had always lost to Fernandez won five of their first meeting as seniors, the last occasion occurring at the 1989 French Open. Since then, Sabatini has recovered her poise against Fernandez, but on Thursday she could not cope. 'I was surprised how well she played,' she admitted. I doubt if Seles will be taken by surprise today. The champion has looked better than ever, thumping and grunting her way through relentlessly. Even the bright new German star, 17-year-old Anke Huber, who had put out last year's finalist, Jana Novotna, could not detain her long. Nor could the effervescent Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in the semi-finals. Sanchez-Vicario was blown away 6-2 6-2. I suspect that the same fate will befall Fernandez.</p>

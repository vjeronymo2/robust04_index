			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART'S DIXON RULED INELIGIBLE  </P> <P> Billy Dixon, the top returnee from Hart High's Southern Section 3-A Division  cross-country champion team, has been declared academically ineligible for the  first month of the season. He could become eligible next month if he maintains  a 2.0 grade-point average.  </P> <P> "He realizes his mistakes and is trying his best to make up for them," Hart  Coach Gene Blankenship said. I have no doubt he will be back and running in  five weeks."  </P> <P> Dixon, a senior who recorded marks of 4 minutes 23.4 seconds and 9:24.32 for  1,600 and 3,200 meters in track last season, was Hart's second man on a team  that advanced to the state Division I championships.  </P> <P> Hart is ranked second in the preseason Southern Section Division II poll.  </P></p>

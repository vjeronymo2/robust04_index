			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Laying proper foundations A wave of property companies have joined the stock market in recent months. But in the wake of the worst post-war property recession, few have been able to claim a particularly distinguished record. However, Argent has few qualms in claiming such a background. 'The Argent team has anticipated changes in the property market correctly and acted decisively,' the prospectus says. Argent bases its claim on three shrewd decisions taken over the past five years. It reduced its development exposure when the market peaked in 1989. It bought investment properties at the bottom of the market between 1991 and 1993 and it bought the Brindleyplace development site in Birmingham in the summer of 1993, shortly before a marked recovery in prime development land values. The other factor that distinguishes Argent, in the eyes of some analysts, is the quality of its management. 'There are only two management teams (of the property companies joining the market) worth backing, and this is one of them,' says Mr Alec Pelmore of Kleinwort Benson. Argent was founded in 1981 by Mr Michael Freeman, aged 42, and Mr Peter Freeman, 38, sons of Mr David Freeman of DG Freeman, the City law firm, and joint chief executives. They began by assembling sites, winning planning permission and selling the package on to an institution or property company. Sometimes they would carry out developments themselves or with a joint venture partner. By 1989, Argent was involved in 20 developments. But the property market was becoming overheated and in April 1989, Argent took the decision to get out. As a result, it now proudly states, it lost a mere Pounds 1m on its development programme and never missed an interest payment. Two years later, it believed that property values had fallen so low that the time was right to re-enter the market. In July 1991, it established a joint venture with Warburg Pincus, a US venture capital company. Over the next two years, it bought 16 investment properties at a total cost of Pounds 136m. In June 1993, it turned its attention to development land and bought Brindleyplace. The company puts a heavy emphasis on having sufficient income from investments to cover interest payments and administration costs. Its income stream is already secure. About 85 per cent of its income will, barring defaults, be secure for more than 20 years. Although the investment portfolio can be expected to benefit from a resumption in rental growth, Argent is unlikely to be generous in its payment of dividends. Some analysts also believe that short term growth prospects could be cramped by the full valuations that have been placed on its properties, particularly at Brindleyplace. Nonetheless, the company is likely to get an enthusiastic reaction from the City when it joins the stock market. 'It is the most entrepreneurial of the newcomers,' says Mr Chris Turner of BZW, the brokers. 'It is an issue which, even in today's market, will go well.'</p>

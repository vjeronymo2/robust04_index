			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: No special pay deal for top civil servants Sir, Your piece on top civil service pay seems to have left some with the idea that the senior civil service is being treated differently from other public sector workers ('Performance pay deal could give top civil servants 3.5 per cent', August 10). The fact is that the government pay policy has been applied rigorously to all civil servants, irrespective of grade. As far as the senior civil service is concerned, an addition of 1.25 per cent has been added to the pay bill as a result of this year's negotiations. Unlike their colleagues elsewhere in the civil services, senior civil servants no longer have automatic increments, and thus, in order for the pay bill to stay cost neutral in any one year, 2 per cent is available for performance-related pay. These arrangements have been strongly resisted in many parts of the public sector, but of course as a result of their use some civil servants will be paid no increase this year; all will be paid increases commensurate with what their managers judge to be their contribution to the performance of their department or agency. The implication that somehow the senior civil service has got off lightly is both misleading and unfair. There will be no automatic increase this year for any civil servant covered by the recently negotiated package. Elizabeth Symons, general secretary, Association of First Division Civil Servants, 2 Caxton Street, London SW1H 0QH</p>

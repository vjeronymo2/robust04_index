			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Brussels plan to cut EU airport service costs The European Commission is drawing up plans to open the market for ground handling services at European airports, a move that could sharply reduce airlines' costs. Action to force competition in airport services will tackle the last significant element of air transport not in theory opened up to competition when the single European market came into force two years ago. The commission aims to present draft legislation to EU transport ministers at a meeting next month. Airlines argue that at many European airports, ground handling services are controlled by monopoly suppliers. Air France, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, SAS and Spanair, which have joined forces to support opening the market, say the monopolies typically charge 30-50 per cent more than suppliers who face competition at other airports. The services in question cover passenger and baggage check-in, loading and unloading of baggage, mail and cargo handling, aircraft cleaning, towing, refuelling and aircraft maintenance.</p>

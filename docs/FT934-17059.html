			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Life charges: just what do you pay?  -Investors have faced daunting barriers to discovering the truth, says Eric Short. But relief is at hand THE charging structure of life companies, which has been notoriously opaque, will soon become much clearer. At present, the charges can be understood only with the help of an actuary. But investors would like to know the answers to two questions: which are the high and low charging life companies, and how much of an investment in a life or pensions contract from any life company is taken out in fees? Obviously, a life company must impose charges to meet the costs of issuing and of servicing a contract. But are those charges reasonable? The fee structure on a unit-linked life contract is extremely complex, with five or six types of charge being the norm. The bid/offer spread, annual management charge, capital/accumulation units and policy fee are the main ones. Faced with such a complex array of fees, most investors will have great difficulty in discovering how much of their investment is eaten up by charges. The problem is even more complex for with-profit contracts. The only way in which the effect of charges can be shown to laymen in a way they will understand is to show what the benefits would have been had no charges been imposed for a given investment, followed by what the benefits would be after deducting the company's charges. But Sib and Lautro, the regulatory bodies, have always insisted that illustrations showing the benefits of a policy on different assumptions of growth rates should also assume a standard charge that applies to all policies and not just the one. They claim that the standard basis illustrations will not be misused by intermediaries selling contracts to clients. The Office of Fair Trading, however, has always insisted that using standard charges is anti-competitive in that it denies investors the information they need to answer the two basic questions posed above. Now, chancellor Kenneth Clarke has accepted the OFT's argument and, next year, illustrations will be based on the charges actually levied on each policy. Nevertheless, information on illustrations based on actual charges has been available to investors if they had known where to look for it. Money Management, an FT monthly publication, has been allowed by Lautro to seek such illustrations from life companies and to publish the results in its periodic surveys of personal pensions. The latest survey, published in the October issue*, includes a comparative table of benefits assuming actual charges, no charges and the standard charge. It provides enough information for investors to answer the two basic questions above. Since the aim was to identify the high and low charge life companies, and to discover what those charges cost the investor, the table excludes specialist companies which take business only from fee-based intermediaries. These companies have the lowest charges and, thus, the highest illustrations. But, to make a complete comparison, the investor needs to allow for impact of the fees paid to his adviser in determining the overall effect on his investment. The table can guide the investor in his selection of a life company. The wide range in the value of benefits between the lowest and the highest charging companies shows the importance of making the right choice of life company. Investors need to look at a company's charging record, as well as that of its investments. The charging structure used by a company has different effects for different terms. The table shows that four of the five lowest charging companies over 10 years are not in the top five for 25 years, although an examination of the complete table in Money Management shows they are still very competitive. So, the choice of life company on the lowest charge basis depends on the term of the contract. An investor already holding a personal pension contract, and who intends to take out another contract, needs to check if that life company is still competitive on its charges for the new (lower) term. The highest charging life companies tend to market through their own sales force or through tied agents. As such, the salesmen are under no obligation to reveal this fact to clients. Investors have to check this themselves. Independent financial advisers should be taking charges into consideration when recommending a life company, but investors should check that this is indeed the case. At 10 years, charges can reduce the benefits by between 9 per cent (the lowest charge) and 23.4 per cent (the highest charge), with an average reduction of 14.5 per cent. At 25 years, the range is between 8 per cent and 32.7 per cent, with an average of 22.1 per cent. Once this information is available widely, life companies are likely to come under pressure to reduce their charges. The present Lautro illustrations produce figures that exceed the vast majority, if not all, of the own-charge illustrations, showing that the standard charges used are far too low compared with present charging levels. Under the present Sib/Lautro rules, a life company is not allowed to reproduce the tables in Money Management in any of its literature or promotional material. It can merely point out that the survey has been published. Since newspapers can reproduce the table, the ruling seems irrational. But since it exists, it is up to investors to see for themselves. *Money Management, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND, Pounds 3.95.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL PENSION ILLUSTRATIONS - UNIT-LINKED PLANS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Best Projections (lowest charges)                          10 years                              25 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey Life                 36,700   Equitable Life              208,020 Equitable Life             36,649   Cornhill Assurance          206,241 Rothschild Asset Mgmt      36,306   Albany Life                 205,937 Scottish Mutual            36,113   Prosperity Life*            205,286 Family Assurance           35,878   Wesleyan &amp; General          204,937  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lowest Projections (highest charges)                          10 years                              25 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Combined Insurance         32,463   Royal London                175,718 Providence Capitol         32,277   Combined Insurance          175,387 Royal London               31,294   Gartmore                    175,072 Refuge Assurance*          31,222   Acuma Life                  174,365 Eurolife*                  30,848   Eurolife*                   167,309 No charges                 40,292   No charges                  248,632 Average fund               34,461   Average Fund                193,583 Lautro basis               36,486   Lautro basis                213,205  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows projected open market option funds for a contract taken out on July 1, 1993, with a monthly premium of Pounds 200.

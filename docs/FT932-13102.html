			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A meaty encounter - Bookshelf WHY NOT eat meat? None of the stuff has passed my lips for years, yet the aroma of roast beef still charms, as does the memory of bacon crisped on a primus stove. But three different vegetarian arguments persuade me, each convincing enough on its own but together overwhelming: arguments which respectively conclude that meat eating is cruel, unhealthy, and uneconomic. It is uneconomic because ten acres of land can feed 24 people if planted with wheat, but only two people if applied to cattle grazing. And rainforests are being cleared at a frightening rate to make room for beef cattle to supply hamburger chains. It is unhealthy because meat is full of saturated fat. Meat is decaying animal matter. It is cruel not merely because farming techniques and slaughterhouses make it so, but because killing a sentient creature as a matter not of need but of taste is morally repugnant. (How many of us could slit a cow's throat ourselves?). A newspaper report tells of a common practice among British farmers. A type of lowland sheep has been selectively bred for two characteristics: smallness, so that it eats less; and a genetic inclination to have twins or triplets. But when a ewe has a single lamb, the lamb is too big to be born. So its front limbs are amputated in the womb to protect the ewe. Before this year's lambing season is over 50,000 lambs will have died this way. Colin Spencer's handsomely comprehensive history of vegetarianism (The Heretic's Feast Fourth Estate, Pounds 20, 402 pages) shows that from the earliest times one or other of these reasons has persuaded many to forgo meat. But other reasons have prevailed too, chiefly religious ones. In a continuing tradition from antiquity to the present there have been significant minorities of people who shared similar views. Ovid was disgusted by animal slaughter; Plutarch was a vegetarian, as was Leonardo da Vinci. England's most carnivorous hour was reached in the 18th century, and descriptions of the way animals were then treated reads like a horror story. Pigs, calves and poultry were whipped to death to tenderise the flesh. Geese were nailed to the floor to fatten. Sheep were killed by slow bleeding to improve the eating quality of their meat. 'I know nothing more shocking or horrid,' wrote Alexander Pope, 'than the prospect of kitchens covered with blood and filled with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures.' Wartime rationing in the 1940s improved the nation's health because of a shift of emphasis from meat to vegetables and grains. It is an oddity that so few set this fact against the reeking floor of the slaughterhouse, and draw the obvious conclusion. Looking at history from a seat at its dinner table is fascinating; one sees aspects of it quite absent from the sober-sided chronicles of kings and battles which usually march us through the ages. Spencer's book tells a fascinating story, and tells it well. It will move honest readers to ponder carefully what lies on the next dinner plate they encounter.</p>

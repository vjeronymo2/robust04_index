Today's figures suggest that consumer activity is mounting, said Dr Brian Bailey, Infolink chairman, although it would be necessary to wait for information on the volume of new credit over the coming months to determine the real strength of recovery. Loans sought for the purchase of new cars showed a year-on-year increase of 9.2 per cent in April, according to the survey. This is an improvement on March although the April result was only half the February yearly increase. The home-loans sector, representing specialist lenders, showed a year-on-year increase of 1.2 per cent in April - the first rise in demand seen by Infolink since 1991. Demand for credit with finance houses increased 4.9 per cent in the year to April, while credit applications to retailers rose 3.1 per cent. These are the highest rates of annual increase this year. Infolink predicts further increases in these sectors if greater activity in the housing market is maintained. Dr Bailey said: 'With increasing numbers of consumers enjoying greater employment and financial stability, April has seen a continued improvement when compared to the depressing levels witnessed in 1992.'</p>

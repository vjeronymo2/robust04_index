			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Going for quality at farm machinery show-case - Organisers of London's Smithfield Show are seeking visitors with spending-power The Royal Smithfield Show, which opens its four-day run at Earl's Court exhibition hall in London next Sunday, is rooted in the traditions of the meat trade. But for many years the viability of the event has relied heavily on the farm machinery industry, which uses it as a winter showcase for equipment which it hopes to sell to dealers and their farmer customers for use on the land in the coming year. A few years ago, the show appeared to be on its last legs. Attendance was falling a little further each year; machinery manufacturers were pulling out, leaving unoccupied floor space for probably the first time in the show's long history; farming and its ancilliary trades faced declining margins resulting from a combination of shrinking European Union support and a run of unfavourable weather. Almost the entire industry was in the doldrums. But the buoyancy is back and the organisers have every expectation of a lively and successful show. They base their optimism on a variety of factors. First, the marketing of the event has been revamped to concentrate on the 'quality' of those attending rather than mere numbers. A survey taken at last year's event, for instance, indicated that although attendance was less than 44,000 it was made up almost entirely of decision-makers in farming and the machinery trade. Moreover, 67 per cent said they were likely to place an order for some kind of equipment as a result of their visit to Earl's Court. Exhibitors have accepted the logic of this approach and many prestigious companies have returned, especially after the show's organisers introduced low-cost modular stands to replace the flashy creations of the past. The confidence and the cash behind those changes, however, came about as a result of EU area payments in compensation to farmers for setting land aside, which were higher than anticipated. The devaluation of sterling in the autumn of 1992 and the fact that such payments are calculated in Ecus saw to that and gave UK farmers an advantage over most of their European neighbours. Further, market prices for many farm-produced commodities have been higher than expected and well above apparent support levels because of shortfalls in supplies. This situation has continued through 1994 and tractor sales, which are always a good barometer of farmers' confidence, were running marginally ahead of 1993 at the end of October. Total UK registrations were 16,044 compared with 15,433 in the corresponding period of 1993. This small advance, the Agricultural Engineers Association believes, is likely to be eroded by the end of December to give a whole-year figure of about the same as last year's 17,899 units. That would still compare very favourably, however, with the low reached in 1992 when only 13,454 tractors were sold to UK farmers. How long this relatively lively trade will continue is, however, the subject of much speculation. Some industry pundits believe it will prove only a brief interruption to the downward trend that appeared to be established before the sterling devaluation. Certainly, the machinery trade seems to regard the current situation as a temporary window of opportunity which it can exploit. Many farmers see it in a similar light and have grabbed the chance to replace old and unreliable machines so as to be able to batten down the hatches when funds become tighter. For there is widespread concern that the good times cannot last. Thinking farmers and machinery manufacturers look at the budget-busting payments to an industry that is supposed to be getting used to world prices and the free trade of the Gatt accord and wonder how they can be maintained. Then there is Franz Fischler, the EU's new agricultural commissioner, who takes over the portfolio on January 1. This Austrian clearly remains an unknown quantity. But his background among small mountain farms and ultra-green policies may not make him sympathetic to the relatively larger and mainly intensively managed farms of the UK. Paradoxically, the UK's agricultural industry is already responding to anticipated pressures by increasing the size of farms so as to benefit from the economies of scale. One commentator has estimated that up to 1m acres (400,000 hectares) of Britain are now contract-farmed. This almost certainly means that the owners are earning significantly more from this land than they could have done under their own management. Machinery manufacturers have been doing similar things for years. Takeover, mergers and joint ventures are increasingly characterising what is now a thoroughly international business. And when the multinational companies that serve farmers find it necessary to rationalise it is pretty clear that their clients, whose businesses are tiny in comparison, should do likewise. Indeed, the way the Smithfield Show is now organised reflects this cut in the number of decision-makers at all levels, the need to rationalise and economise and the increasing internationalism of the trade. This will be the last full-scale annual Smithfield Show. In future, it will be held every second year, alternating with the Agritechnica Show in Germany. Pleasingly, an annual lifestock and meat show will continue to be held in London just before Christmas.</p>

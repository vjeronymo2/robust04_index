			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (PL) -- Russia and Cuba today signed  the bylaws of the international association Ros-Cuba, an  institution created to foster cooperation in the fields of  production, finance, and scientific-technical investigation.    Lev Nogilevskiy and Pablo Martin, president and vice  presidents of Ros-Cuba respectfully, signed the document, which  establishes the legal bases for the operation and registration  of the institution for Russian authorities. The main  headquarters of Ros-Cuba will be installed in Russia.    The ceremony was held at the Caribbean island's diplomatic  mission in this capital. Lionel Soto, Council of Ministers vice  president who is on a working tour through the former Soviet  nations, was present.    The agreement to organize Ros-Cuba was signed in October by  Soto and Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council of  Ministers, after several rounds of negotiations seeking new  bases for bilateral cooperation.    At the close of the ceremony, Nogilevskiy termed as  important  the signing of the association bylaws, which seek to initiate a  new stage in economic-trade ties between the two nations.    The president of Ros-Cuba thanked the Cuban Government and  Cuban authorities who are in Russia for the facilities that were  used while preparing the documents that were needed to start the  international organization.    Ros-Cuba will be formed by businesses, state institutions,  and businessmen from the two nations. Promoting services to  third nations will also be one of its duties.</p>

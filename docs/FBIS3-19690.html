			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bavaria -- Grand Coalition the Only </F> Solution?"]    [Text] For decades, the Christian Social Union [CSU] has  governed Bavaria with big absolute majorities. After the next  land parliament election, it might have to clear some of the  ministers' seats for the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD]. According to a poll conducted for BILD AM SONNTAG by the  Forsa Institute, the CSU will lose so many votes that the only  possibility for Bavaria might be a grand coalition. While the  CSU is still slightly ahead of the SPD on the land level, it  would only come second in Bavaria in Bundestag elections.    Last Thursday [17 March] and Friday, Forsa asked 609  Bavarian  voters: For which party would you vote if land parliament or  Bundestag elections were held on Sunday? In both cases, the CSU  achieved less than 40 percent. The Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] might not get back into the land parliament in  Bavaria either. But even if the Liberals manage to get over the  5-percent hurdle -- a coalition with the CSU would not get a  majority. The Greens/Alliance 90 and the Republikaner are too  strong -- and the CSU would certainly not form a coalition with  them. This only leaves the SPD as partner.    The main reason why the CSU is experiencing such a decline  with the voters is obvious: It is the affairs surrounding its  top politicians Streibl, Gauweiler, and Tandler. Asked to name  the biggest problems in Bavaria, 53 percent mentioned  unemployment, and as many as 38 percent said "scandals and  politicians." Other issues, such as the housing shortage or  crime, play only a minor role.    Are the CSU's chances of being elected getting any worse on  account of the Amigo affair? There is a clear answer to this as  well: Of those asked, 73 percent said yes, only 19 percent do  not thinks so, and 8 percent do not have any opinion on the  matter.    Is Minister-President Edmund Stoiber in a position to start  afresh in Bavarian politics, without scandals? Of those asked,  58 percent think he cannot do it. Only 27 percent think Stoiber  is capable of making a scandal-free new start.    A total of 39 percent of the voters prefer Stoiber to his  SPD  competitor Renate Schmidt, who would get 35 percent of the  votes. Among CSU supporters, the minister-president is clearly  ahead with an 80-percent approval rating, with only 68 percent  of SPD voters approving of Ms. Schmidt.    With regard to Bavaria, the CSU still has a "land bonus" due  to its experience in government. This is why things look  brighter here than at the Bundestag elections, where SPD  Chairman Scharping can hope to win 45 percent of the Bavarian  votes, while CSU Chairman Waigel could offer his chancellor only  a small dowry of 37 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 14 Apr (AFP-NA) -- It was officially  reported today that the Chilean Finance Ministry has extended  the enforcement of the 18 percent surcharge on Chinese textile  products.    The measure aimed at protecting the local textile industry,  which is facing a crisis of low prices because of an abundant  and inexpensive supply of foreign textile products, affects 18  fiber, wool and cotton manufactured products.    The Chilean Government has stated that the surcharge on  Chinese textile products may be increased once a study  establishes the extent of direct and indirect subsidies received  by the Chinese textile and clothing industry.    Chilean Textile Union Leader Manuel Bustos, who is currently  president of the United Labor Confederation, has said that some  Chinese companies have a zero-cost hand labor because people  serving judicial sentences are used as forced labor.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Afghan rebels encircle Kabul: Overthrow of Najibullah jeopardises UN-sponsored peace plan AFGHAN guerrillas were poised early this morning to launch an assault on Kabul to try to force a military solution to the country's 13-year civil war, as intensive efforts were made to arrange a political settlement. The mounting crisis comes after President Najibullah's removal threw United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations into doubt. The government in the capital, in the hands of Najibullah's generals and ministers, appeared increasingly fragile as rival guerrilla groups encircled the city. The guerrillas, who have been fighting to unseat Najibullah's Soviet-installed regime, have intense rivalries among themselves and have been unable to agree on their participation in a peace accord. There were reports of their troops opposing each other close to Kabul. The UN Security Council, as well as the US, Pakistan and other governments, issued urgent calls for restraint on all sides and for a political solution amid fears that Afghanistan could descend further into anarchy. Mr Benon Sevan, the special representative of the UN secretary-general, was holding urgent talks in Kabul to salvage his peace plan, under which Najibullah was to have handed over power to a 15-man neutral council. This would have led to an interim government and eventually to elections. On Thursday, Najibullah was stripped of power by his ruling party and attempted to leave the country, but was turned back at Kabul airport. He is now in hiding in the city, probably in a UN office. The chief of the security police committed suicide. The 44-year-old president, who had been security chief to President Babrak Karmal, installed by the Soviets on their invasion in 1979, held office for six years. Other leading members of the ruling Watan (homeland) party pledged their commitment to the UN plan. But there were fears that the peace plan could be rendered irrelevant if mujahideen guerrilla groups fought with each other to assert control. Mr Abdul Wakil, Afghan foreign minister, left Kabul for a meeting in Charikar, 40 miles north of the capital, with Ahmad Shah Masood, leader of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla faction which controls much of the north of the country. He later returned but it was unclear whether the two men had met. Mr Farid Ahmad Mazdak, a leader of the Watan party, said the government could work with Masood and several other prominent guerrilla field commanders. 'With the departure of Najibullah, there is now no obstacle in the way of peace,' he said. 'It is important for us to achieve understanding with our mujahideen brothers without delay.'

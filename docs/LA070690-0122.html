			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: LEG SHAVING, COW STOMACHS, CHARITIES AND FEMINISM  </P> <P> Dear Ms. Klein:  </P> <P> Freaks? Weirdos? Really, Ms. Klein, cyclists are humans, too. By the way, tell  your husband that I highly recommend the 'Lady Remington.' It provides a close  shave without any unnecessary bloodshed.  </P> <P> Michael Benner,  </P> <P> UC Irvine Cycling Team  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Benner:  </P> <P>  How long have you been in Orange County, Mike? Here, no one bats an eye at  freaks and weirdos passing themselves off as humans. The human angle, in fact,  seems to play big with the voters.  </P> <P>  Perhaps you think I was a bit hasty in describing my husband and his fellow  bicycling enthusiasts in the same vein. I can understand that. It would bother  me, too. Still, my husband seems to delight in being different. How else to  describe this shaved-legs ritual?  </P> <P>  But, heck, Mike, to give you an idea of how open-minded I am about alternative  lifestyles, I want you to know I passed on your Lady Remington suggestion to my  husband. He even bought one. Right about now, Mike, I'm thinking unnecessary  bloodshed might not be such a bad idea.  </P> <P>  Dear Mrs. Klein:  </P> <P> I have been enjoying your comments very much. Yesterday, you got over into my  territory. You realize that each of those cows you wrote about has four  stomachs? Never in my 92 years have I found a magnet in any of them. Nails,  yes. Barbed wire and magnets, no. Autopsies on bovines expiring from hardware  disease have revealed nails, baling wire and other miscellany, but no magnets.  The foreign objects always punctured the stomach well before making it through  the maze of stomachs into the intestine.  </P> <P> Why is barbed wire like a bikini? It protects the property without obstructing  the view.  </P> <P> Sincerely,  </P> <P> Paul K. Justus  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Justus:  </P> <P>  Lord knows I wouldn't presume to argue with your 92 years or the cows in your  territory. (I, for example, have never been present at a bovine autopsy,  although it's been on my 'Things to Do' list for years.)  </P> <P>  However, with all due respect, let me point out that if you had found a magnet  in your cows' stomachs, you might have found any 'nails, baling wire and other  miscellany' all in one place. You see, farmers these days actually encourage  their cows to swallow magnets and even go as far as to purchase magnets for  their cows' enjoyment. The metal particles cling to the magnets, thereby  greatly reducing the heartbreak of hardware disease.  </P> <P>  I suppose one regrettable side effect of this technology would be a reduction  in the number of bovine autopsies that one gets to attend. But as I'm sure you  are aware, life is full of such trade-offs.  </P> <P>  Did you know, for example, that barbed wire may soon be replaced by invisible  electronic fences that encourage animals not to wander by giving them a mild  jolt? Just think what that could do to your bikini line.  </P> <P>  Dearest Dianne:  </P> <P> Once again, I am caught reading an article of yours that is as poor as your  knowledge of the subject/subjects.  </P> <P> Your June 20 article makes reference to the totally unfounded and ludicrous  suggestion that charities in Orange County are hard-pressed due to the 'never  too loose with our change' mentality. You better get your facts in line to  support that allegation. . . .  </P> <P> Well, Dianne, we can't give to everything. It's that simple. I ask you -- have  you honestly given to each and every charity that has ever approached you on  the street, at your door, in your place of employment, etc., etc., etc.? If  not, than you have absolutely no right to print such a ridiculous suggestion.  Why should YOU bite the hand that feeds so many needy organizations around this  county? . . .  </P> <P> Sincerely,  </P> <P> Mary Ellen Adams,  </P> <P> Orange County resident, volunteer and charity contributor  </P> <P> Balboa Island  </P> <P> Dearest Mary Ellen,  </P> <P> So nice to hear from you again. But you have me a little concerned. It's not  like you to admit to being 'caught reading an article' of mine. Since you have  been that honest with me, however, I'll repay your kindness. Here are some  statistics that you may find enlightening.  </P> <P>  Orange County has one of the lowest rates of charitable-giving per capita,  about 40% less than the rest of the nation. This is according to George  Phillips, the United Way's vice president of community issues. According to  other studies -- including the 1989 Orange County Annual Survey -- only about  30% of county residents make any charitable contributions, while the rate  nationwide is over 50%.  </P> <P>  And, Mary Ellen, you are right. We can't give to everything. I can't. But  maybe you're different. You certainly do seem to have a lot to share. With me,  at least.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dear Dianne:  </P> <P> I can't express completely the gratitude I felt when you called yourself a  feminist in your May 16 column. It's time that women who espouse feminist  values begin to come out of the closet and use the 'F' word when describing  themselves. I believe the same mind set which made "liberal" a dirty word is  also at work with the word 'feminism.'  </P> <P> Go down the line with all the issues which have come to light because of  hard-working feminists: from obtaining female suffrage to working for equal pay  and access to higher education and better jobs. Only the most confirmed  patriarchs will deny these changes have worked for the good of all. . . .  </P> <P> I wish I didn't have to say I'm 'grateful' for your admission. Perhaps if more  women and men would stand up and be counted, feminism would cease to be a  stigma and instead become a badge of honor.  </P> <P> Sincerely,  </P> <P> Valerie Dufresne  </P> <P> Corona  </P> <P> Dear Valerie,  </P> <P>  Thanks for your letter. This ought to make you feel even better. I AM A  FEMINIST! Not that anyone who reads this column regularly ever had any doubts.  I'm not much for hiding in closets.  </P> <P>  Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Readers may reach  Klein by writing to her at The Times Orange County Edition, 1375 Sunflower  Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626, or calling (714) 966-7406.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: US economy US housing starts fell in March. Does that mean things are getting worse, or better? At first sight, the figures look terrible: a month-on-month fall of nearly 10 per cent. Bond futures rose on this slumpish news. Then the weather men got to work: January was very cold, February was very warm and in March it was too wet in California to dig a trench. In the end, the market turned to the weatherproof numbers for building permits, which show just a hint of recovery. Futures fell again. Meanwhile, industrial production was down a little less than expected. Good news? No, the weather again. Heating demand fell in February, then recovered. One cannot do seasonal adjustment when the seasons themselves are maladjusted.</p>

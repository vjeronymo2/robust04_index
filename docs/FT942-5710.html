			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Lib Dems accuse BBC of imbalance: European Elections The Liberal Democrats yesterday accused the BBC of abandoning its legal obligation to give balanced coverage to political parties during the European election campaign. Mr Matthew Taylor, the party's campaign chairman, said in a letter to Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, that the corporation was 'slavishly following' an agenda set by Labour. Mr Taylor said 52 per cent of BBC television political coverage had been devoted to Labour since the party manifestos were launched on May 23, compared with 34 per cent for the Tories and 14 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. He also accused Mr Birt of failing to respond to a Liberal Democrat call for equal treatment which was made two days after the campaign started. Liberal Democrat strategists believe there are two main reasons for the imbalance: Coverage of the Labour leadership election has not been kept separate from coverage of the campaign. Much of the coverage of the Conservative campaign, especially in the early stages, included speculation about the impact on Mr John Major's hold on Downing Street. The Liberal Democrats say that the main television news broadcasts have also given an unfair advantage to Labour on policy issues. In particular, a long report on Labour's Social Justice Commission is said to have mentioned the Labour party several times without the usual balancing responses from other parties. Liberal Democrat officials acknowledge that the party frequently complains about television coverage during elections. However, they say the distortion is worse than in any previous campaign. They are also incensed by the BBC's failure to respond to the party's initial complaint, adding that a similar complaint to Independent Television News was followed quickly by 'satisfactory' talks. Broadcasting organisations are required by law to ensure 'balanced' coverage during election campaigns. The BBC said that Mr Birt had been unable to respond to the Liberal Democrats' first letter because he was away from the office when it arrived. The corporation said the director-general had seen both letters and would respond in due course.</p>

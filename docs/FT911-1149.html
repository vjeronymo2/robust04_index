			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: SBC takes 10% Cragnotti stake SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC) has given its seal of approval to the new merchant bank being set up by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, former managing director of Italy's Enimont chemicals joint venture, by taking a 10 per cent stake, worth around L45bn (Dollars 34.5m). The new bank, called Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, intends to specialise in taking stakes in companies and cross-border deals. In March, it made its debut with the CDollars 77m purchase of a controlling share in Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group. That deal, and the arrival of SBC, will go a some way to improve the credibility of Mr Cragnotti's new venture, which is expected to have its head office in London with a branch in Milan, and possibly other European cities. Some have dismissed the company as little more than an appendage for Italy's Ferruzzi group, for which Mr Cragnotti worked prior to taking the post at Enimont. Milanese bankers suggested the new venture was little more than a consolation prize from Ferruzzi to Mr Cragnotti for his efforts in having run Enimont, the chemicals group formerly joint-owned by Montedison, the chemicals concern which was controlled by Ferruzzi until last November. However, reports that Mr Cragnotti had already gone some way to assemble around L200m in capital - a figure confirmed by yesterday's announcement - and evidence that Ferruzzi and its allies not means his only shareholders, have helped scotch such talk.</p>

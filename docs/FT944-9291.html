			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BOC The slow, steady progress of industrial gas companies tends to look less than exciting during a cyclical upturn. During the fourth quarter, operating profits at BOC's core gases operations rose an underlying 13 per cent, a modest increase compared with the rest of the chemicals sector. That helps to explain the company's 15 per cent underperformance against the sector over the past two years. But the qualities of gas companies start to shine near the peak as cyclical companies' earnings growth decelerates. BOC's steady progress should be sustained long after that despite continuing price pressures. BOC has been aggressively cutting costs and busy improving its product mix. But most of the earnings growth will be driven by strong volumes. The industrial gas market expands almost twice as fast as GDP and BOC is heavily exposed to the fast-expanding Asian economies. The stock is at a price earnings premium to the market for 1995 of about 20 per cent. In the near-term BOC has little chance of outperforming. But its resilience will look increasingly attractive by 1996 when the market's earnings growth is expected to slow to about 5 per cent. BOC's biggest headache remains its pharmaceuticals business which is small, risky and provides no compelling synergy with the rest of the group. There is no urgency to dispose of the operation because its new anaesthetic drug should compensate for the decline in its old product. The long-term danger is that like Boots and Fisons it will find little significant in the research and development pipeline. If the right price is offered, BOC would do well to exit.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Oscar Rene Vargas] </F> <H5>  [22 Apr p 11] </H5>   [Text] Four years into the Chamorro government, the  characteristics of Sandinism's internal political process can be  summarized as follows:    1. The results of the February 1990 elections showed that  the  social and grass-roots movement had entered a phase marked by  the retreat of the mass movement. They also showed that the  traditionally impoverished sectors and the middle class that had  grown poor during the last half of the 1980's voted for change.    Four years after the elections, however, poverty has  worsened  and the retreat of the social movement has intensified. One of  the major accomplishments of the Chamorro government is that  despite the worsening of almost all social indicators, a new  period marked by the rise of the grass-roots movement has not  begun. The political and economic initiative remains in the  hands of those who are pushing the counterreform.  <H5>  Leadership and Strategy </H5>   2. Since the day after its defeat the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front] has been immersed in a necessary  internal debate on the tactics and strategy to be followed  during the current stage of stagnation and retreat for the  grass-roots movement. All factions are worried about the future  of the FSLN: how to regain the political ground that it has lost  and how to develop the best tactics to regain power in the 1996  elections. The crux of the disagreement is how to reassemble the  political forces that became scattered after the 1990 electoral  defeat into a government alternative in 1996.    3. The social and grass-roots resistance to the policies of  the "neoliberal" government has been spontaneous, isolated,  circumstantial, without long-term political organization and  guidance.    The FSLN's political leadership has been unable to begin an  internal debate that would help formulate a strategy that can  coordinate and combine the various pockets of social resistance  and, at the same time, place them properly in the current  correlation of political forces.    A tactic must be urgently implemented to preserve the  political, social, and economic clout of the progressive forces  so that they can retake the political and social initiative and  overcome current limitations. This means changing styles of  leadership, which can be achieved only by making substantial  changes in the current political leadership.  <H5>  Impoverishment and the FSLN </H5>   4. The lack of a clear FSLN strategy and the frustration of  most people over the Chamorro government's failure to keep any  of its campaign promises have been and may remain the breeding  ground for the risky, spontaneous actions of the masses. They  could also turn major segments of the population into the social  base of the far right, which speaks the language of populism. We  must remember the example of the PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal  Party] in the Atlantic Coast elections in February 1994 and the  Italian elections in March 1994.    Moreover, the increased poverty among the population does  not  necessarily benefit the FSLN; rather, it could lead to  "political apathy among major segments of the people" or become  a "spearhead" for Nicaragua's far right. In order to prevent the  right from capitalizing on the population's current discontent,  there must be a shakeup in the FSLN leadership.    The victory of the left-wing forces favoring "democratic  socialism" in Poland in the October 1993 elections was based on  cutting ties to the past, maintaining discipline in the party,  backing reforms to establish a flourishing economy, and  reassuring voters that the party is a stable and revamped  political force.    5. The strategic defeat of "real socialism," which was  heavily influenced by the Stalinist political model, has ceased  to be the political reference point for many FSLN activists;  this has made possible the natural emergence of various factions  within it.  <H5>  [23 Apr p 7] </H5>   [Text] 6. We find three schools of thought in the FSLN,  although they are embodied in just two organized factions:    a) Those who think that all is lost and who are feverishly  seeking any way to join with the people who won the 1990  elections. They have forsaken the struggle for "democratic  socialism" and, influenced by the retreat of the grassroots  movement, feel that the FSLN will not regain power through  elections. Owing to these factors and to opportunism, they have  decided that now is the time to switch sides so that they can  enjoy cushy jobs under the current government or a future one.    b) Those who think that in spite of the defeat of "real  socialism" nothing has changed. They adhere to "orthodox" and  "rigid" positions regarding their methods of struggle and feel  that the status quo in the FSLN political leadership must be  maintained at all costs. The leaders of this faction confuse  short-run successes with strategic victories and replace an  analysis of the real world with political rhetoric from the era  of the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship or with the  language that was used during the revolution, which a majority  of the population rejected in the 1990 elections.    c) Those of us who acknowledge defeat are engaged in  intensive self-criticism and are working to develop specific  tactics that will enable us to set immediate new political goals  that must be redefined in a wide-ranging, open discussion inside  the FSLN. This does not mean abandoning the struggle for a more  just society or setting aside the grievances about which broad  segments of the population feel most strongly. We simply feel  that the FSLN must tailor its tactics to the political  circumstances in which we find ourselves, and this means a  shakeup if we want to return to power in 1996.    7. Because of the lack of an incisive, serious discussion  and  owing to the preservation of the status quo in the FSLN  leadership at the 1991 Congress, we have lost the political  initiative and failed to delve more deeply into the meaning of  the strategic defeat in 1990. It is precisely because no  political changes have been made in the FSLN leadership that an  in-depth analysis of the current situation and of the role that  the FSLN ought to be playing is not being conducted.    8. Some mid- and upper-level leaders have not openly  accepted  the failure of the Sandinist agenda in its version for the  1990's. They want to preserve anachronistic language and  leaders; they refuse to accept that they do not represent the  best chance for the FSLN to recapture the vote of the people.  <H5>  Criteria for Renewal </H5>   9. There are two major requirements that the FSLN must  fulfill in order to present a new face to the majority of the  people, and both can be met at the next Special Congress:    a) Most of the members of the FSLN's next political  leadership must come from the rank and file. In other words,  only half of the political leadership ought to be members of the  current National Directorate and National Assembly. We cannot  talk about a political renewal if we merely propose a rotation  of the personnel who were responsible directly or indirectly for  the defeat in 1990. We are not in favor of a purge either. Some  degree of historic continuity must be preserved in the FSLN,  combining experience with input from new leaders who can spur  new solutions and alternatives.    b) The Special Congress has a responsibility to elect not  just a new and different political leadership but also a  leadership that is not linked to the "pinata." We cannot promote  a political renewal unless it is accompanied by an ethical and  moral renewal. In other words, the new leadership cadres of the  FSLN must emerge from the rank and file and not be linked to the  "pinata." Unless these two minimum conditions are met, we will  be jeopardizing any possibility of winning the 1996 election.    10. We must keep a cool head and not meddle in problems or  involve ourselves in unnecessary political commotion. What we  are proposing is a rejection of economic, political, and social  improvisation. We must become standard-bearers of the policy  that the privatizations must be transparent and we must call for  the monitoring of CORNAP [National Corporation of the Public  Sector] sales. We must aspire to once again become the moral  conscience of the people.    11. Sandinism needs to rejuvenate itself, to become viable  and credible. The poor need a new hope free from the stumbling  blocks of the past and with a new, consistent, rectifying  leadership that does not renounce its principles but is instead  able to harness the mistakes of the right wing and the  government in order to build a new social consensus with the  people.</p>

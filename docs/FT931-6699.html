			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Squeeze yourself a taste of Sicily - Cookery I SHOULD be in Sicily this week attending a cookery course, sampling local wines, exploring the markets and rejoicing in a scented snowdrift of almond blossom. Alas, it was not to be, so I am comforting myself instead with the sunny richness of Sicilian oranges now flooding into British shops. There is no shortage of them and prices are reasonable. Most pleasing of all, with their sticky, sweet, shockingly blood-stained juices, are the moros and taroccos. I squeeze half a dozen or so for our breakfast each day, a vibrant swig to zip us into action on grey English mornings, and I like to serve these glorious fruits at the end of rich meals for dessert. For the quickest and most dramatic effect, simply cut each orange, peel and all, from top to bottom into eight wedges, remove the pips with the point of a knife and pile the crescent-moon slices on to a plate. Allow two oranges for every three people. You might remember, as I do, oranges being served like this at half-time in inter-school games. In those days, we used to save the pieces of orange peel after we had sucked the juicy flesh from them. If you then carved the peel with a penknife and wore it like a boxer's gumshield, you revealed a gratifying flash of orange false teeth when you smiled. I am not suggesting you indulge in such childish pranks at the dinner table. But the simple refreshment can be given a sassy finishing touch by serving the wedges on a plate lined with fresh bay leaves, and sprinkling them with a smattering of lightly-crushed fennel seeds. The combination of fennel and orange is lovely, and fennel is well known for its digestive properties. Another aromatic alternative is to intersperse the wedges with sprigs of rosemary. The blue flowers and silvery green foliage make a splendid foil for the orange skin and ruby flesh of the fruit and, if the herb is bruised lightly, it will impart some of its fragrance to the citrus. This simplest of all orange salads can be served on its own, or with little biscuits or sponge fingers also flavoured with fennel or rosemary. The fruit also can be used as an edible garnish for scoops of blood orange sorbet. Sweet oranges are suited equally for savoury roles. The Sicilians are fond of combining them with fish, and I rate them highly with small birds such as quail. POT ROAST QUAIL WITH CARAMELISED ORANGES (serves 4) Pot-roasting quail in the juice of blood oranges keeps the little birds beautifully succulent. Extra fruit, grilled until slightly toffeed, provides an irresistible garnish. Ingredients: 8 plump oven-ready quail; 5 thin-skinned blood oranges; juniper berries and bay leaves; 1 oz unsalted or clarified butter; a little olive oil. Method: Marinate the quail for a few hours in the juice and zest of 3 oranges with 8 bruised juniper berries. Turn the birds occasionally. Dry the quail, reserving the marinade which will have stained them a pale shade of beetroot. Skewer each one with a cocktail stick to tuck the legs neatly against the body - this is less fiddly than trussing. Choose a flame-proof casserole just large enough to take the little birds in a single layer. Heat the butter in it and colour the quail lightly all over. Then, lay them breast down and pour on the marinade. Without waiting for the liquid to become hot, cover the casserole and pot-roast at 375-400F / 190-200C (gas mark 5-6) for 35 minutes. Turn the birds breast up and cook for 10-15 minutes more. Then, serve straight away or turn the oven temperature right down: pot-roast quail can be 'held' for up to half an hour without spoiling. Dish up the little birds in a nest of rice or other grain, or sit them on rounds of grilled or fried polenta. Offer their gravy (lightly seasoned and strained of spices and zest) in a sauce-boat, and serve with caramelised oranges on the side. To make these last, cut the remaining 2 oranges, peel and all, into 8 wedges each. Thread on to damp wooden skewers, spacing the wedges well apart and interleaving them with bay. Brush with olive oil and grill for about 10 minutes until the fruit is hot, the peel is slightly toffeed and the bay leaves smell incense-sweet.</p>

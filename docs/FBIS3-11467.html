[Castriota de Azambuja] Argentina and Brazil have permanent  cultural and geographical links. There are many difficulties.  The more we trade and develop our relations the greater the  possibility of problems. It is very difficult to have  diplomatic problems with Nepal or other nations with which we  have little contact.    Bilateral relations do not require a lot of imagination. It  is determined by geography. There have not been any conflicts  between our nations for over a century now. South America is  almost the only region in the world where a 100-year-old map is  still good because borders have not changed.    We were adversaries in colonial times and rivals throughout  the 19th century. We tried cooperation in the 20th century and  we are now partners. The objective when we were rivals was to  put hurdles in the other nation's path. We would make access,  paths, and communications difficult. Now we are partners.  There is a spirit of partnership [preceding words in Latin].  The purpose now is to see that the other party is doing well.    It is also true that we began a difficult year and that our  problems are real. Argentina can talk with the United States  about joining NAFTA but cannot negotiate its entry by itself as  long as it is a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South].  The fact that Argentina is enjoying the prestige of being  invited to join NAFTA does not hurt us. For the time being  Brazil is not interested in NAFTA. We think that we must follow  the path opened by President George Bush through the Rose Garden  Agreement. This agreement is also known under the formula 4+1  and was conceived within the framework of the Americas  Initiative.    [Etchebarne] Would Brazil's proposal to create a free trade  zone in South America also hurt Mercosur?    [Castriota de Azambuja] The train of integration goes  through  Mercosur. Brazil's absolute priority is Mercosur's customs  unification. Negotiations with other South American countries  refers to a free trade zone, and Argentina has being invited to  join Brazil in the negotiations.    [Etchebarne] Will there be agreement on external duty  levels?    [Castriota de Azambuja] Of course. In June we will agree on  an external duty level. The humility earned through defeats  caused by the failure of policies implemented through the 1980's  makes agreement between the two countries easier. Brazil  thought it could be self-sufficient. That was the dream, the  national objective. To import was almost tantamount to treason.  We contracted several bad bets during the 1980's which  destroyed the Brazilian dream. It was thought oil prices would  increase. For strategic reasons we purchased oil from Iraq  instead of from our neighbors. We bet heavily on African trade  but the matter did not work out. Then we bet heavily on  protectionism.    [Etchebarne] What about relations with the United States?    [Castriota de Azambuja] The United States has its own master  plan [preceding two words in English] based on NAFTA, but Brazil  cannot accept negative preferences. Mexico's digestion will not  be easy. The country has serious problems, as the kidnapping of  the Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] president shows. It seems  Chile will be the next country to join NAFTA because it is the  only country that has done everything it had to.    The Americas summit in December will be important for  defining our relations with the United States.</p>

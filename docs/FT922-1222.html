			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Deadlock in Efta talks with Poland and Hungary TRADE liberalisation talks between Hungary and Poland and the European Free Trade Area are deadlocked, the Hungarian government said yesterday. The two former communist states are refusing to accept Efta's offer on import tariff reductions, regarding them as much less generous than the European Community association agreements. The Hungarian government said sympathy for eastern Europe and the political will to overcome protectionist lobbies were fading. This could be seen in the lack of progress both with Efta and with EC parliaments' ratification of the association agreements. One stumbling block in Hungary's Efta talks is the resistance of Austrian farmers to increased food imports from Hungary. A good agreement with Austria, a neighbour and the second most important trading partner, is particularly important to Hungary. Czechoslovakia's agreement with Efta, which was concluded in April, has come under attack for setting precedents for eastern European weakness in the face of west European negotiating strength. Discussions between Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary on regional free trade to parallel that with western Europe also suffered a blow with the move to break up the Czechoslovak federation. The uncertainty will delay talks and an independent Slovakia would resist dramatic moves to open up markets, Hungarian officials say. Hungary is set to back down on discriminatory vehicle import tariffs in favour of Ford of the US after heavy pressure from European carmakers. The government promised yesterday to reverse a decision to impose 18 per cent duties on van imports by all companies except for Ford, which is one of the largest investors in Hungary. Duties on European-made vans will now be brought down to match the free entry granted to Ford's Transit model. The decision is a humiliating defeat for Hungary at the hands of powerful vehicle manufacturers such as Fiat and Renault which prodded the European Community to investigate discrimination embodied in the two-tier tariff. Hungary gave in after European carmakers made veiled threats to hinder ratification of its association agreement with the EC. But the Hungarian government remained defiant even after its climbdown, saying that it had introduced the tariff with 'noble motives' of promoting foreign investment in Hungary.</p>

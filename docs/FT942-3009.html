			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sket sold The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday completed the sale of Sket, one of eastern Germany's largest machine-tool enterprises, to a west German group of investors led by Salzgitter Maschinenbau, writes Judy Dempsey. Salzgitter Maschinenbau agreed to buy a 51 per cent stake in Sket and its two subsidiaries, and will invest DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) until the end of 1996. It will guarantee 2,000 jobs, but this figure will be eventually be reduced to 1,725 by 1999. The remaining stakes will be divided between the Treuhand and the management of Sket, with the agency retaining a 25.1 per cent share. Sket, based in Magdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt, had a turnover of DM100m last year. Prior to German reunification, its exports were targeted at the markets of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. These markets collapsed following German monetary union. The sale, which ends of three years of uncertainty about the ability to find a buyer for Sket, was yesterday welcomed by Mr Christoph Bergner, prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / (CORRECTED) MEPs look for younger voters: Coming up on MTV, a hot new quartet of European politicians Correction (published 23rd June 1994) appended to this article. The contest for younger Dutch voters in the European elections will take a new twist this weekend. On Sunday, Mr Gijs de Vries, one of the country's most prominent members of the European parliament, is scheduled to take part in a programme broadcast by MTV, the US-based pop music and video-clip channel, to a potential audience of some 25m European households. His appearance, along with that of three other aspiring MEPs from other states of the European Union, is calculated to put Mr de Vries in touch with the Netherlands', and Europe's, youth. 'Young people have a real hunger for information about Europe,' he says. 'One of the most frequent questions I get is how can I get a job in Europe, or how can I do a student internship with a foreign company elsewhere in Europe.' Though he is only 38, Mr de Vries is a veteran Dutch MEP, having served the right-wing Liberals in Europe since the age of 28, when he was barely older than most members of today's 'MTV generation'. Dutch young people may be interested in pursuing pan-European careers, but most voters in the Netherlands, traditionally a stronghold of pro-European feeling, are displaying a distinct lack of interest in the European Parliament campaign. Mr Jan Marinus Wiersma, an MEP candidate for the Labour party, says, 'There is some voter fatigue out there because this is the third election they've had since March.' Besides the municipal polls in March, the Dutch also held a general election in early May. Mr Wiersma disagrees with the view that there are no fundamental differences between the parties. 'There is a fight going on about the future of the 'Rhineland' model of combining an active government stance with freedom for market forces.' The left wants to create jobs while the right wants to lower wages, he says. Mr de Vries of the Liberals also highlights differences. 'In social policy, the question is whether we want a 35-hour week, which the Socialists favour, or rather greater flexibility in labour laws, as we want.' All parties are broadly in favour of the European Union, and there is no hint of anti-Maastricht fervour. Mr Sam Rozemund, an analyst at the Clingendael institute for international relations in The Hague, says that domestic rather European politics are dominating the latest campaign. 'But that's little different from European elections in other years,' he notes. What is different, however, is that Dutch politicians are still trying to put together a government coalition, meaning the June 9 poll is being seen as a referendum on the result of the May 3 general election. The ruling Christian Democrats and Labour both fared badly in the national elections, losing support to the Liberals and D66, a left-of-centre party. Much will depend on the level of voter turnout. 'Christian Democratic voters tend to turn out for the European election, so that could favour them,' Mr Rozemund argues. CORRECTION In the Financial Times of June 3, it was reported that MTV Europe has an audience of 25m households. MTV estimates that its audience is over 60m households.</p>

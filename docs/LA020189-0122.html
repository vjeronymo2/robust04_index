			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NORTH JUDGE WEIGHS ACTION AGAINST ABC;  </P> <P> ASSAILS AIRING OF TESTIMONY, HINT ON ELUDING JURY DUTY  </P> <P> The federal judge overseeing the Iran-Contra case said today he is considering  a contempt action against ABC News for a report about the start of Oliver L.  North's trial that used his immunized testimony.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell noted the network's Tuesday evening news  broadcast carried a portion of North's 1987 testimony to Congress about the  foreign policy affair. ABC reporter Tim O'Brien said in his report that anyone  seeing that testimony would be excused as a juror.  </P> <P> Gesell said O'Brien "took pains to advise the public that if they looked at  (his report with North's testimony), they'd be excused from jury service."  </P> <P> "I have not decided whether or not this is the appropriate basis for a contempt  action," the judge said sternly, and he told prosecution and defense lawyers to  question potential jurors intensely about their recall of North's appearance  before Congress.  </P> <P> Gesell is dismissing as a juror anyone who acknowledges reading about, watching  or listening to North's testimony to Congress about the 1985-86 U.S. arms sales  to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defends Broadcast  </P> <P> George Watson, ABC's Washington bureau chief, defended the broadcast, saying,  "I don't see how we can report on issues before the court without going back to  the public record of what Colonel North has said on the subject himself."  </P> <P> "If that causes a problem for jurors, that must be addressed by Judge Gesell  himself," Watson said. "We are very mindful of the rights of Colonel North or  any defendant to a fair trial, but we have a responsibility . . . to report  what's happening."  </P> <P> North, 45, faces 12 felony charges, including lying to Congress, destroying  documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. If convicted on all charges, the  former White House aide and retired Marine lieutenant colonel faces 60 years in  prison and $3 million in fines.  </P> <P> Jury selection resumed today with another 52 potential panelists asked to  complete a questionnaire about their knowledge of North's case.  </P> <P> Eleven people have been selected so far for the final jury pool, a group of  about 50 people from which the ultimate panel of 12 jurors and six alternates  will be selected.  </P></p>

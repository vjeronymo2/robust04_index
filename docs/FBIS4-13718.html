			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "GATT's Patent Proposals May Spell Doom For </F> Third World Farmers"]    [Text] Although, in principle, we have always come out on  the side of copyright and patent holders, the new GATT patent  proposals may mean that farmers will not be allowed to plant  seed unless they paid royalties to one of the patent holding  companies. By extending patenting laws to the Third World it  means that companies can control and market crop varieties in  countries which may have donated the genetic material used to  breed those varieties. Most of the raw materials for the  high-yielding seed that is developed in the laboratories of  Western companies comes from Third World fields but the irony of  it all is that farmers who have received no reward for parting  with the raw material that makes manipulation of genes possible,  may be asked to pay royalties for their use. The UN  International Trade Commission has estimated that U.S.  companies, in all sectors, stand to gain USD 61 billion a year  from developing countries in royalty payments -- if GATT's  proposed patents regime is approved.    At present, Indian law, for example, does not allow  agricultural and medicinal products to be patented, but all this  may soon have to change, if the GATT draft is approved by the  Indian government. But, as multinational seed companies see  farmer's rights to their own seeds as an obstacle to company  marketing expansion, they fully expect that, under the GATT  regulations, India will be forced to introduce such patents, or  face retaliatory trade measures.    But Indian farmers are seen to be fighting back, for they  have been staging a number of dramatic protests against GATT's  proposed patenting measures. In August, 1993, for example,  40,000 farmers carrying neem branches as the symbol of their  collective indigenous knowledge, demonstrated in the Southern  Indian state of Karnataka and, in October of the same year, they  launched the Third World Farmers' Movement Against Transnational  Corporations at a rally attended by over a million farmers.  Northern environmentalists are giving all-out support to their  struggle.    W.R. Grace and Co., one of the largest U.S. chemical  companies, and Cargill, which controls 60 percent of the world  trade in cereals, are under attack by Indian farmers for the  threat they represent to their livelihoods. Grace is accused of  infringing the intellectual property rights of millions of  Indian peasants by taking out U.S. patents on pesticide products  derived from the neem tree which has been used in India for  centuries for a range of medicinal and agricultural purposes.  Cargill is setting up a hybrid seed-processing complex in  Karnataka, and has been singled out as one company which would  flood the Indian market.    Third World farmers' groups argue that such a monopoly  system  of patents, combined with open access to markets, would only be  of benefit to large corporate concerns and, in return, the Third  World will get nothing for the knowledge which led to the  development of patented products. Indian farmers are,  therefore, protesting this and are proposing, instead,  collective patents as an alternative form of intellectual  property rights which would reward communities for their  traditional knowledge of the uses of plants and animals.    With the recent instruction to grow neem trees in  Bangladesh,  a tree which has always been native to this part of the world,  it would be more than a pity should people find that, after  planting the trees, they discover their produce has already been  patented by multi-national companies based in foreign countries  and, as their intellectual property, we shall also have to pay  royalties for their use.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / HK airport signing is short of a real deal: UK-China tensions still bedevil agreement on funding the project Officials from Britain and China meet today to sign an agreement on the funding of Hong Kong's HKDollars 158bn (Pounds 12.6bn) airport project. While it is an important symbolic occasion demonstrating that the two sides are committed to resolving their differences on the matter, a vital element will be missing. Without so-called 'financial support agreements' necessary for borrowing, today's agreement amounts to little more than a refinement of the 'memorandum of understanding' that Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, flew to Beijing to sign in September 1991. And that committed the Chinese government to taking just one month to approve the financial details of the airport project. The six-point agreement to be signed today will cap permissible public debt at HKDollars 23bn and provide for a HKDollars 60bn equity injection into the two public corporations responsible for the airport and its connecting railway. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) will receive an equity injection of HKDollars 23.7bn and be allowed to borrow up to HKDollars 11.4bn, while the Airport Authority (AA) will receive an equity infusion of HKDollars 36.6bn and be allowed to borrow HKDollars 11.6bn. To satisfy China's aversion to debt finance, the Hong Kong government has committed itself to paying in more equity rather than increasing borrowings in the event of cost overruns. The 'financial support agreements' missing from today's signing are the documents the MTRC and the AA need before they can approach financial markets for borrowings. Chinese officials have told their UK counterparts that they will deal expeditiously with these agreements. They have indicated that the MTRC's support agreement can be dealt with first while the AA's will have to await its formal incorporation after legislation has been passed later this year. Since March 1992, when the Hong Kong government put forward its first financial plan, it has often been hard to believe that the central point at issue was the funding of an airport and its railway. The ensuing talks became entangled in the long-running Anglo-Chinese dispute about democracy, overlaid by concerns that the airport was a British ploy to strip Hong Kong of its riches, and was possibly not even necessary. Only after the political dispute was played to a stalemate in June this year did the issue of airport finance become resolvable. The airport talks have, therefore, been a metaphor for Anglo-Chinese relations. In the end, as always, China's will has prevailed. It never liked the idea of funding the project with debt, in spite of the fact that 1992 and 1993 were the two best years in a generation in which to borrow long term. So the proposed HKDollars 73bn of debt was reduced to HKDollars 23bn. It always sought, and won, the advantage in negotiation. When, during the summer, the UK sought to get agreement for both the minute and the support agreements China balked. It wanted the minute first, then talks about the support agreements; that is what it got. When Governor Chris Patten ill-advisedly said in London last week that an airport agreement was only 'days' away, Beijing made sure that he was made to wait more than a week. To add insult to injury, in Beijing on Wednesday night Mr Lu Ping, China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, sought to play down the significance of the airport deal for China's broader relationship with Britain over Hong Kong. 'It does not solve everything,' he said. 'It does not mean that everything about the transition of Hong Kong is smooth sailing.' Indeed not. At the same time as officials were inching their way toward the deal to be signed today there were signs of other rows on the horizon. The Hong Kong government's award to Gammon, a Jardine group company, of a HKDollars 790m contract to build a naval base for the Chinese navy has been loudly condemned by Beijing. Gammon submitted the lowest tender of the seven companies that competed for the contract, but Beijing has been angered by Jardine's delisting from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has been seen as a vote of no confidence in China's future administration of the territory. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday that Beijing expected to be consulted and informed of the outcome of tenders. There are modestly encouraging signs that a way ahead is emerging. Last week a senior official from Hong Kong's Monetary Authority attended a 'seminar' in the colony organised by Beijing's 1997 advisers. He gave the government's view on why Hong Kong's exchange rate peg to the dollar should be preserved  -a view that was quickly agreed to by Beijing. Such artificial occasions may not be an ideal way for Hong Kong to discuss issues of importance with its future landlord, but in the absence of a breakthrough in Sino-British ties, which no one expects, they are about the best Hong Kong can muster these days.</p>

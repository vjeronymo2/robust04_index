			<p>BFN     [Text] East London May 2 SAPA -- Ballot papers had been  stacked by hand in some ballot boxes in the Ciskei, a National  Party [NP] spokesman said on Monday [2 May].    Regional candidate Mr Billy Nel said in a statement that the  seals of the boxes could not have been there at the time of  voting, or else were removed afterwards for this to be done.  "This practice was found to be done at ballot boxes at counting  stations at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital and Manpower Centre."    He said the sealing of boxes was "totally unacceptable".  Mdantsane counting stations were a total fiasco. Plastic cable  ties were used, or plastic tape, instead of the official seals  from the presiding officer and the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission].    The counting procedures were rushed and the result had been  seen as more important that the system or security. There was  no security at the counting stations and people could come and  go at leisure.    United Nations observers had been absent from the majority  of  polling stations in the Transkei. "The NP is extremely unhappy  with the execution of voting procedures from the Transkei and  Ciskei and also the intimidation that took place during the  election. The result produced in these areas were anticipated  by the National Party. But the margin of error is totally  unacceptable to us."    The NP hoped it would not be forced to accept all the  results  without a proper investigation, or a heavy-handed attitude  towards these problems from the ANC.</p>

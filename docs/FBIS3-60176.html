According to a CANA report, Police in Britain say that they  seized 2.7 tonnes of cannabis worth 6.5 million pounds sterling  that were reportedly traced to the Vincentian registered ship.    On Saturday 14th last, Customs officers assisted by the Navy  arrested seven people including a woman on board the mothership  Poseidon, a one-thousand tonne vessel registered in St Vincent,  about 100 miles off the West Coast of Ireland.    A Customs spokesman said then that a further 3 tonnes of  cannabis is thought to be concealed aboard the Poseidon.    Reports also say that some 18 people have been arrested in  connection with this latest haul.    Checks with the local Registrar of Shipping have not  revealed  that the ship is registered here. But in view of what Labour  Party Leader Stalky John said recently in another case is the  practice for frequent name changes to be made, this is not  surprising.    Further, the details of changes made at the office in Monaco  are not sent on quickly to St Vincent for the local records to  be updated.    About a week ago a locally owned and registered ship was  caught with cocaine in Grenada's waters.    In August another Vincentian registered ship, the Alexandra  was arrested in Canada with 30 tonnes of hashish.</p>

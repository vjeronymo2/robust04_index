			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO BALLET MAKES A STRONG FINISH IN COSTA MESA  </P> <P> San Francisco Ballet closed its run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center  in Costa Mesa over the weekend with a program that made a surprising point. The  further away it got from classical vocabulary, the better it looked.  </P> <P> In ascending order of impact, the company offered artistic director Helgi  Tomasson's new "Handel -- A Celebration"; the athletic follies and competitions  of Jerome Robbins' "Interplay" (1945), and the hyperkinetic Expressionism of  Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land" (1981).  </P> <P> The ghost of Balanchine hovered over Tomasson's 10-part, neoclassical homage to  Handel (to a compiled score) but the results, though never in bad taste, proved  uninspired and unmusical.  </P> <P> Tomasson tended to rely upon rote symmetrical groupings, occasionally skewering  formal patterns and classical vocabulary, though often apparently, arbitrarily  </P> <P> so. Two pas de deux dropped the neoclassic look altogether and boldly ventured  into romantic idioms.  </P> <P> He also occasionally dug from the cliche pile -- such as juxtaposing a lyric  and a hectic pas de deux to the same music. But the primary problem was the  threadbare, poverty of movement. You waited for the choreography to fill out  the music, but it never happened.  </P> <P> Some choices were unfortunate. He cast the superb, Kirov-trained Ludmila  Lopukhova against type, requiring her to execute speedy, slinky-distorted moves  a la Balanchine. Though fully capably of fast dancing, Lopukhova, on Friday and  at the Saturday matinee, only looked badly utilized and was further subjected  to the indignity of being turned head over feet in the air by the corps of  eight men.  </P> <P> Making a cautious first appearance with the company at the Saturday matinee was  Yuri Zhukov, the Kirov corps member who joined the San Franciscans for a  nine-month guest stint right after the Leningrad-based company danced in Orange  County in August.  </P> <P> Zhukov seemed distant, uninvolved. He had a bad landing in his otherwise secure  variation and partnered a vivid, sweet Sabina Allemann with patrician  restraint. But at least he didn't smugly court the audience as did his Friday  counterpart, Anthony Randazzo.  </P> <P> The company looked better in Robbins' high-spirited "Interplay" (set to Morton  Gould's "American Concertette"). Christopher Stowell excelled with airy  lightness -- holding shapes in the air, bounding from textbook correct position  and tossing off the step-over, hopping turns with virtuosic security.  </P> <P> In contrast, a good-natured David Justin at the matinee seemed underpowered and  overly careful in his preparations. But he also made some fine airy corkscrew  turns and clean landings.  </P> <P> A coolish Elizabeth Loscavio and a supportive Alexi Zubiria danced the pas de  deux on Friday; a secure Grace Maduell and an overtaxed Barton Parker II on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Both casts in "Forgotten Land" (to Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem) brought  riveting commitment and energy to Kylian's abstract, whirlwind depiction of  communal calamity, grief and transcendence.  </P> <P> Evelyn Cisneros showed slashing power and nonstop dramatic momentum Friday in  the first pas de deux; Jamie Zimmerman, with her limpid port de bras, evoked  more poignancy Saturday. Each was partnered by the noble, technically strong  Lawrence Pech.  </P> <P> Jo Ellen Arntz and Andre Reyes were the shot-from-guns duo in the demonic  Scherzo on Friday; Joanna Berman and Stowell took over the roles with equal  power on Saturday.  </P> <P> A radiant Alaina Albertson was partnered by Randazzo (Friday) and Edward  Ellison (Saturday). Both men proved strong.  </P> <P> Denis de Coteau conducted a sometimes ragged Pacific Symphony with deep  sympathy for Britten's score and few insights into Handel's music. Roy Bogas  was the expert piano soloist in Gould's "American Concertette."  </P></p>

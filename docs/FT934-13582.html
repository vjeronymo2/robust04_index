			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Building societies end run of net outflows: Mortgages lead lending growth A MODEST net inflow of retail funds to building societies in September has ended the run of net outflows suffered by them in the three previous months, when savers withdrew money to spend on holidays, L-registration cars and BT3  -the final sale of shares in British Telecom. But the figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association also underlined the severity of the competition facing the societies for savings and for mortgage lending. New commitments from borrowers taking out mortgage loans with societies rose slightly to Pounds 2.6bn in September from Pounds 2.4bn in August, but the BSA said that societies were still losing market share to the banks, largely because of the banks' fixed-rate mortgages. This picture was confirmed by the statistics from the British Bankers' Association, which showed banks' mortgage lending rising by Pounds 951m in September, after an increase of Pounds 800m in August. The net receipts to building societies of Pounds 124m in September compare with net outflows from society savings accounts in August of Pounds 132m. In the third quarter as a whole, there has been a net outflow of Pounds 69m. The BSA said there was still very tough competition for savings, and highlighted unit trusts in particular. Mr Bob Pannell, an economist at the BSA, said that because there was not a great demand for mortgages at present, building societies' main concern was to maintain the existing pool of savings. Though the figure for net new commitments was notably higher than the Pounds 1.8bn in September last year, the figures for 1992 were distorted by the ending of the stamp duty holiday, which brought house purchases forward to the summer.</p>

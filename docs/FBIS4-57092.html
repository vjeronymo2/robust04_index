			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- Today, the Health Ministry  announced it will adopt a plan to control and sell medicine to  ensure that medicine is acquired by people who really need it  and to overcome availability problems. The official GRANMA  daily reports that this plan is part of an integral strategy to  increase national production of pharmaceutical items. The  strategy includes the implementation of a control system, strict  prescriptions, and specific uses for medicine. There also will  be more support for herbal medicine.    Health Minister Julio Teja reported that foreign exchange  has  been earmarked to support a more independent and efficient  import strategy. My ministry is making great efforts to ensure  the supply of 352 medicines considered to be essential for the  people's health, Minister Teja said. This includes 73 that are  already guaranteed by means of a control card and that benefit 2  million people.    The health minister said the production of Priority 2  medicines included in the pharmaceutical inventory will grow  until it reaches levels similar to those of 1992.    The medical-pharmaceutical industry has outlined a plan to  secure materials, and much of the raw materials necessary are  already in the country, GRANMA reports.    The minister noted that this industry's production, which in  1993 generated 59.7 million pesos (the same amount in dollars,  at the official exchange rate), will climb to approximately 84  million in 1994, a figure similar to that of 1992.    One initial measure designed to control medicinal supplies  and avert black market profiteering will be to make drugstores  more accessible to the population. This group includes medicine  freely sold whenever available. It includes aspirin,  antiseptics, digestion medicine, analgesic balms, and dry  lotions. The plan also calls for linking medical centers with  nearby pharmacies where patients can acquire prescribed medicine.    At the same time, a significant number of pediatric,  gynecological, clinical, and surgical products will be included  in intrahospital pharmacies where medicine prescribed at the  institutions can be acquired.    These control measures are designed to permit outpatients  and  hospital-released patients to buy the medicine prescribed by  their doctors.    Deadlines also will be set for purchasing antibiotics and  chemotherapy medicine in light of the fact that the  nonacquisition of these products within an established timeframe  makes their use unnecessary because a medical reevaluation of  the patient becomes necessary. The plan foresees the creation of  a corps of inspectors that will function at all levels to  oversee the process and guarantee its efficiency.</p>

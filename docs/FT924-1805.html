			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer repeats losses of Pounds 3.4m REORGANISATION and restructuring measures at Enterprise Computer Holdings, a supplier of second user IBM computers, failed to stem losses in the six months to September 30. Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, said the company had captured its share of the available business in a market that was showing continuing deterioration and that an improvement in economic conditions would be necessary before the company would prosper. Turnover of Pounds 35.5m was 38 per cent down compared with the same period last year reflecting in part the disposal of non-core businesses. The loss before tax was Pounds 3.39m compared with Pounds 3.4m in 1991. Losses per share were 4.3p (4.6p) and the interim dividend is passed. New management under Mr Dowling took over on June 1. The business has been slimmed down from 13 sites to three key operations in the UK, Germany and US. Overheads have been cut by Pounds 4m a year but shareholders; funds are now down to Pounds 4.4m. Mr Dowling said he believed the losses and drain on cash were now behind the company: 'The second half has started rather more optimistically' he said, and I hope to report a general improvement at the year end.'</p>

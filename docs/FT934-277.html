			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Court takes firm line on extorted pay-offs A Japanese court has signalled its disapproval of deals by companies to pay off racketeers and other extortionists who threaten to disrupt annual shareholders' meetings. The Tokyo District Court on Monday meted out suspended sentences of between five and six months variously to four former officials of Kirin Brewery who were found to have given Y46m (Dollars 415,000) to sokaiya (extortionists) this year. The company denied any links with the pay-offs, but the chairman and two other senior officials stepped down in July to take responsibility for the scandal. They have remained with the company as advisers, however. Many such extortionists claim gang links and commonly take a small stake in leading companies. They then threaten to ask embarrassing questions at the annual meeting, unless the company pays them to stay away. In the past, company executives have lost face at the meetings when dissatisfied exortionists have asked probing questions, including points about scandalous information concerning them or about the conduct of the company. Some meetings have been stretched to as long as 13 hours as executives faced query after query. To limit the impact of the sokaiya, most Japanese companies hold their shareholders' meeting on the same day but some companies are still targeted and Kirin seems to have been a victim this year. Last year, Mr Masatoshi Ito, president of Ito-Yokado, the retail group, resigned after the arrest of executives from his company who were alleged to have paid Y27m to gangsters in violation of the Comm-ercial Code, which was toughened in 1982 to prohibit pay-offs. Companies have also been known to hire racketeers to monopolise the floor at shareholders' meetings, so as to prevent investors asking legitimate questions.</p>

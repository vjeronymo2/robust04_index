			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Beige Book eases fears on economy RECENT reports may have led to unnecessary anxiety about economic prospects, the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book survey of regional economic conditions implied yesterday. The generally upbeat report cites a 'modest improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation' last month, following a dip in activity in March caused mainly by severe winter weather. Manufacturing output, retail sales and home sales were all said to be improving. The survey was conducted in the weeks up to April 23. Manufacturers in most districts reported increases in sales and orders, with near-capacity production at some car and steel plants. Strong demand for car parts and electronic equipment was reported in Boston and Chicago. The outlook for jobs was mixed, with hiring in most regions expected to be restricted; higher output mainly reflected productivity gains and increased overtime. The Fed survey was also upbeat about consumer spending, reporting a modest rebound in retail sales in most areas after widespread declines in March. The revival was led by durable items such as furniture and home appliances. Retailers in San Francisco, however, blamed concern about job security for lower than expected sales. Most districts reported 'strong or improving' residential housing markets, although commercial real estate remained in the doldrums. Where bank lending increased it was mainly for consumer loans or mortgage refinancing. A few districts, including Atlanta, Kansas City and St Louis, reported a pick up in commercial loans, especially to small businesses. The Fed survey is regarded as a reliable guide to regional trends. Its relative optimism contrasts with a series of gloomy national statistics, including sharply reduced growth in the first quarter and recent steep falls in the purchasing managers' index and leading economic indicators. Employment figures for April, due out tomorrow, will be scrutinised for evidence of a pick up in activity after the subdued first quarter.</p>

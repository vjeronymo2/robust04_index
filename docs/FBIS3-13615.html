			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F> 'Arafat by Hamidah Na'na' in Tunis, published in cooperation  with Paris-based AL-FAJR; date not given]    [Text] [Na'na'] When you agreed to the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement, most observers viewed your stand as a historical  gamble. This was confirmed in time with the Hebron massacre,  which revealed that the issue of settlements, which under the  Oslo agreement had been postponed, should have been listed as a  priority issue on the agenda. The issue of Jerusalem also  emerges as a real obstacle in the UN deliberations. How do you  assess the status of the Palestinian cause after what happened?    ['Arafat] The Hebron massacre has confirmed that they do not  want to implement what they agreed to in Oslo. This was clear  when Rabin said that there are no sacrosanct deadlines. This is  in addition to the influence the Israeli Army has on the  political leadership. The military does not want to implement  the Oslo agreement or the Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you  call it. The Gaza-Jericho First agreement is part of the  agreement and the agreement is an integrated one comprising a  preliminary stage to be followed by a final one, and it was  agreed to call it the Gaza-Jericho agreement because the  Israelis are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho first.  The Oslo agreement covers all the Palestinian territories that  were occupied in 1967.    Here, I would like to clearly point out that the Hebron  massacre was not a massacre against a group of Palestinians that  was committed by a Zionist settler. The Hebron massacre is a  scheme in which Israeli Army units participated. This clearly  resembles what our brother Algerians faced from the French  Secret Army Organization [OAS] which sought to obstruct the  French-Algerian agreements. As Palestinians, we now face the  same situation in the occupied territories. This only shows  that the extremist Zionist mentality views the Palestinian Arab  presence in the occupied territories as a very serious issue.  From this premise, the withdrawal of the settlers from Hebron  is essential. We have reached the conclusion that Israel does  not want to implement the Oslo agreement. It is not the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you call it because the  Gaza-Jericho agreement is part of a more comprehensive agreement  made up of two stages; a preliminary one to be followed by a  final one. First, they are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and  Jericho and then from all of the occupied Palestinian  territories that were occupied in 1967.    [Na'na'] You referred in previous statements to the  involvement of Israeli military units in the Hebron massacre.  Do you mean that there are forces within the Israeli Army that  do not agree with the behavior of the political leadership and  that they seek to undermine this leadership's Oslo commitments?    ['Arafat] Yes, the Hebron massacre is not an individual  action, nor an action carried out by a psychopath, as the  Israelis like to say. The Hebron massacre is part of an ongoing  scheme in which Israeli Army units participate. This situation  is exactly like the one our Algerian brothers had faced at the  hands of the OAS prior to Algeria's independence. They sought  to obstruct the French-Algerian agreements, the Evian talks, and  General de Gaulle's commitments. The Palestinian people in the  occupied territories are now experiencing the same situation.  These forces have no interest in the establishment of peace,  what interests them is to continue establishing greater Israel  on Palestinian land and the land of other Arab countries.  That's why we should be very alert about the developments.    [Na'na'] Was the issue of settlements and the threat they  pose to the peace process discussed in Oslo? Don't you think  that this issue should have been a priority, the objective of  which is to separate the settlers and the Palestinians in order  to prevent any friction that would place mines in the road of  the peace process?    ['Arafat] The issue of settlements was discussed in Oslo and  an agreement was reached on several points in this regard. The  most important points are:    First, the building of new settlements is totally  prohibited.    Second, the expansion of current settlements is totally  prohibited.    Third, the confiscation of new territories is totally  prohibited.    The final decision on the fate of the settlements was  mentioned in the Oslo agreement. The issue of settlements will  be discussed as soon as possible within a period of no more than  two years. The formed committees are supposed to start work  after an agreement is reached on the final stage. We formed a  committee to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, a committee to  discuss the issue of refugees, a committee to discuss the issue  of evacuees, a committee to discuss the issue of settlements and  settlers, and a committee to discuss the issue of borders.    [Na'na'] If the issues contained in the Oslo agreement are  so clear, then how do you explain the U.S. stand at the UN  Security Council, which now rejects discussing the Jerusalem  issue or referring to it as part of the occupied territories,  which has led to postponing the vote on the agreement many times?    ['Arafat] The Security Council is currently discussing a  resolution that condemns the Hebron massacre and calls on Israel  to take measures, including the confiscation of settlers'  weapons to prevent them from carrying out illegitimate acts.  The text of the resolution will demand measures to protect  Palestinians through an international presence in the occupied  territories. Herein lies the differences between the United  States and us. While the United States talks about the presence  of international observers in the Palestinian territories, we  say that the agreement stipulates an international presence in  Palestinian territories. We demand an immediate international  presence in the Palestinian territories to protect our people  and holy places at this difficult time.    (The telephone rang and the speaker on the other end was  Dennis Ross. From the course of the conversation, it seemed  that there was a new negotiable offer. I heard Mr. Yasir  'Arafat say to Ross: Wait for a couple of hours and I will come  after I meet with my comrades in the Executive Committee.)    [Na'na'] It has been said that there is a new offer by the  United States that seeks to expedite the process of withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho and expand the Jericho area in return for  not discussing the issue of Jerusalem in the Security Council  resolution, accepting civil observers instead of international  emergency forces, and dismantling a number of settlements and  evacuating about 500 settlers from Hebron. How true is this?    ['Arafat] No. This was not what I just discussed with  Dennis Ross. It is not currently an issue of Jericho's area, of  expediting the withdrawal process, or dismantling the  settlements. It is more serious than that. It is an issue of  international protection for our people to make them feel safe  and secure in light of this multilateral conspiracy, involving  the settlers, members of the Israeli Army, and gangs which call  themselves organizations such as "Kakh," "Kahane Hay," and other  such racist organizations. These organizations are proven to be  financed from New York, specifically Brooklyn, and are being fed  with weapons, men, and money.    The Israeli settlers are carrying out joint patrols with the  Israeli Army. This a violation of the Oslo agreement. The  Israeli Government should bridle the settlers because the  continuation of the current situation will destroy the peace  process at its roots.    [Na'na'] Is it possible to conclude from what you are saying  that you will not return to the negotiations unless effective  international presence; that is, military protection, is  provided for the civilians?    ['Arafat] The most important thing to us now is to provide  an international presence. This should take place through a  resolution on which the Security Council votes so that it will  be obligatory to its members and all parties concerned with the  peace process. Russia and the United State -- the cosponsors of  the [Madrid] conference -- are supposed to take measures to  adopt a similar resolution.    [Na'na'] What form of international protection do you  envisage?    ['Arafat] A military one, of course. Otherwise, who will  protect Palestinian civilians from the armed settlers? There  are international forces in southern Lebanon, on the Golan, and  in Sinai. Why is it so strange to have international forces in  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? It is true that I am not  asking for guns and tanks. But I am asking for international  forces that are capable of protecting the civilian inhabitants  from attacks by the settlers and others.    [Na'na'] The Russians have returned in force to the  international arena after the Hebron massacre and made several  proposals, such as the need to convene a new international  conference similar to the Madrid conference on the Middle East  crisis. Do you believe the Russian proposals could be  implemented?    ['Arafat] We fully welcomed the Russian initiative. We have  been in constant contact with Russia. I received many envoys  and finally Foreign Minister Kozyrev.    [Na'na'] What about Arab coordination. Do you expect an Arab  summit in reply to what has taken place?    ['Arafat] I wish an Arab summit would convene. However, this  requires intensive efforts. The Arab state of affairs is  difficult and complicated. I hope that as Arab leaders we can  overcome the Gulf crisis so that the new world order will not be  established at our expense and that of our children.    [Na'na'] Within the framework of Arab coordination, have you  and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan reached an advanced stage of  political and economic coordination?    ['Arafat] Yes, we have made large strides in the field of  coordination with the Jordanian brothers. We signed an economic  agreement. We held meetings of the security committee and the  refugees committee, and meetings of other committees on other  levels. All this took place in implementation of what we and  his Majesty King Husayn had agreed during my last visit to  Jordan after signing the Cairo agreement when I handed King  Husayn a copy of that agreement.    [Na'na'] After the massacre, French Defense Minister  Francois  Leotard visited Israel. Does this visit signal a change in the  French stand? Do you not believe it would have been more  appropriate for a defense minister of a country that is a friend  of the Palestinians to have postponed his visit in the wake of  the Hebron tragedy?    ['Arafat] The French stand has not changed. In the United  Nations, this becomes apparent through the president of the UN  Security Council, the French representative. The French stand  is good, solid, sympathetic, and forceful. We had hopes that  such a visit would not take place at that time so that it might  not be interpreted as France approving of the massacre and  supporting the Israeli stand.    [Na'na'] President 'Arafat has been a hero in the eyes of  his  people. He has been a symbol, and a struggler. However,  support for you in the occupied territories has been dwindling  for some time. Of course, you notice from the pictures  transmitted on television and the information you receive that  following the Hebron massacre, the people now oppose the Oslo  agreement and the peace process, and that their support for you  has greatly diminished.    ['Arafat] I have said this more than once. Patience has its  limits. Everyone, both far and near, should realize this. Our  people welcomed the peace agreement. But, the Israeli maneuvers  and Rabin's obstruction of the implementation of the agreement  have made the peace process lose its credibility in the eyes of  our people. I do understand the Palestinian people. The world  at large should also excuse them if they lose their faith in  peace. Our people suffered two massacres in 15 days. The first  took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque by armed settlers in collusion  with the Israeli Army. The second massacre was the one  committed against our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  where dozens of martyrs fell, many were wounded, and more than  1,000 were arrested. It is true that they released 1,500  detainees of those whose prison terms had nearly ended, but they  arrested 2,000 others.    This state of affairs that our Palestinian people has been  experienced has led, among other things, to their dwindling  support for the peace process.</p>

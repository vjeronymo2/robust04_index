			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> NEW FIRM HIRES LAID-OFF CITY STAFF, RESUMES TAPINGS  </P> <P> Compton residents can continue viewing weekly City Council meetings on cable  television now that the council has voted to contract with its former video  production employees.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, in the face of continuing budget problems, the council  eliminated the Community Communications Network and Public Affairs Department,  adding at least six more city employees to the approximately 85 laid off last  summer.  </P> <P> However, Charles Thrower, who directed the city-owned network, formed a private  production company that he calls Thrower Video Enterprises and proposed that  the city hire his firm to videotape the council meetings, which are broadcast  on Channel 36 on Mondays and Wednesdays.  </P> <P> Thrower has hired three laid-off network employees, and will use city equipment  for the tapings. The cost to the city is $45,500 for the rest of the fiscal  year ending June 30.  </P></p>

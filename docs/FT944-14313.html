			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (10): 'We are on the right track' / Interview with President Frederick Chiluba Question: Structural adjustment is proving a painful process for Zambia: is the medicine too strong for the patient? Answer: I agree it is a very painful process, and people complain quite a lot. But they also understand that we have to lay new foundations for an economy that had been devastated. When we took office, inflation was running at 400 per cent. Today inflation is down to 30-35 per cent; there is fiscal discipline. New roads are being build, old roads being repaired. There are drugs in hospitals and desks in the schools. We are on the right track. Yet infant mortality has risen, life expectancy is falling. . . Those are symptoms of the system we inherited. The structural adjustment programme is not the cause of Zambia's problems. It is diagnosis, and it requires bitter medicine. Zambia's external debt per capita is one of the highest in the world: is this compatible with economic recovery? It is a big problem. I regard it as a form of punishment, and lack of confidence on the part of the international community. Having got rid of an autocratic government and introduced democracy, we are burdened by debts incurred by the previous regime. What is your response to the manufacturers' complaint that Zambia's industrial base is being undermined by high taxes on raw materials? I think these fears will subside. Protective tariff barriers are not the answer. The answer is a level playing field. We support regional co-operation and we have insisted on the removal of tariffs. Some countries have more to do, but we would rather urge them to remove those tariffs which are making competition unfair than start a trade war. Is it not time to abolish the 23 per cent duty on imported raw materials? We are considering this. Revenue collected is small. At the same time, industry has for too long been protected, and manufacturers have to become more competitive. Agriculture is also in severe difficulties, with perhaps one third of commercial farmers bankrupt. Shouldn't the adjustment programme take more account of the strain Zambia is under? I understand the IMF and the World Bank, and how they work. They want their money back even if it doesn't come back quickly, because there are other countries in need. One thing I have learned from IMF and the Bank is to move away from consumption to production, to move from waiting to doing something on my own. That spirit I embrace. No one will come and rebuild our shattered country. We must do that with our own sweat and blood. We must learn to take the initiative. At the same time, the IMF and the Bank must understand there are a lot of conditions that may be appropriate in Latin America, but not Africa. They must able to adapt and understand local conditions. That is a matter we have to negotiate with them - they cannot say 'Take it or leave it.' Are you satisfied with the pace of privatisation? About 13 companies have been privatised including Zambia Brewery and Chilanga Cement, but it's a long, slow process - not because of bureaucratic inertia. You cannot force people into buying what they are not interested in. Meanwhile we have launched the Lusaka stock exchange, which helps the process. We want to ensure transparency, encourage management-worker buy-outs, for example, and show that the benefits of privatisation are not confined to the wealthy. Has the government decided on a timetable for the privatisation of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, and whether it will be unbundled? ZCCM for us is the centre of economic activity. Although we have the Kienbaum report, there may be other reports. We do not want to depend on just one group of experts, and we do not believe that the break-up of ZCCM is necessarily the best option. And the timetable? It all depends on how we work things. There are new sources of copper, like Konkola. We want to attract private investment in this one particular area. It is much richer than anything elsewhere. So what are your plans for Konkola? To hive it off as a separate company? We want to make it as a kind of subsidiary to ZCCM, and that will mean that private investment will go in without tying it into the existing arrangement. It's an option. . . Might the timetable extend beyond the next election? Certainly. But in the meantime, once ZCCM has been properly capitalised, there will be more production, and job creation will grow. . . But you won't get this without foreign capital and privatisation. Surely. . . And have you not reached the stage where ZCCM can hardly manage to meet its operational costs? There have been improvements. We have reduced unit production costs from 82 US cents a pound to 74 cents. Unfortunately, the price of copper fell which upset forecasts, but slowly the situation is shaping up for the better. We can only hope prices don't fall again. Meanwhile production has fallen. The accumulated costs and problems to be tackled meant that we could not have managed a quicker pick-up. Allegations of corruption and claims that minister have been involved in drug running have undermined the reputation of your government. What are you doing about it? There have been wild allegations, and when these were linked to some ministers they offered to resign. But we haven't had the slightest confirmation of their having been involved. Nevertheless, we have introduced a bill outlining a code of ethics. Yet senior members of the donor group continue to express concern. Can there be smoke without fire? Under the code, ministers are required to declare everything they have and how they got it, and when. If the donors or anyone else provide evidence of corruption or influence peddling, I will investigate. After three years in office have you become authoritarian? And it is disconcerting to see your official portrait in public institutions - it's redolent of the Kaunda era. I could order them to be removed] I think it is a tradition, rather than a show of being anything. Frankly speaking, many people have said I am rather weak. I have not forced one single issue either in party in government. No, I am not authoritarian, I am too liberal to be that. I suffered long enough under an authoritarian regime. Perhaps if you were tougher, your party would be in better shape - instead it seems to be disintegrating. No. People ought to understand that we are coming from an era where everybody was oppressed. When freedom comes - freedom of expression, conscience, association - it is disruptive. But there is no better way to develop. Never again will one political colossus stride the country and get rid of the rights of the people.</p>

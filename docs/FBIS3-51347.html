			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Jan (DPA) -- Pumping  operations for crude oil through two of the most important  Colombian oil pipelines are completely paralyzed, Ecopetrol  [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] spokesmen have reported.    One of the oil pipelines, which goes from the oil wells in  Cano Limon in the eastern part of the country to the Caribbean  port of Covenas, was dynamited by the pro-Cuban National  Liberation Army (ELN) in the northern Department of Cesar. The  pipeline, which is 780 km long and has the capacity to pump up  to 250,000 barrels of crude oil, suffered a breakdown, which  caused 5,000 barrels to be spilled and a subsequent fire.    In addition, there is serious ecological destruction that is  being controlled by Ecopetrol emergency technicians and workers.  So far this year it is the fourth attack on the Cano  Limon-Covenas Pipeline, which has been the target of attacks by  the ELN. Last year the ELN blew it up 39 times.    Meanwhile, the Colombia Oil Pipeline, which pumps crude from  the northwestern Department of Antioquia to the port of Covenas,  was damaged by an explosive device in Remedios Municipality,  Antioquia Department. The oil pipeline, the second most  important one in the country, has been blown up three times this  year. Last year it was attacked 10 times by the ELN.    The aforementioned guerrilla group's attacks on the oil  pipelines are part of its "war" on President Cesar Gaviria's oil  policy, which the rebel group believes is hurting Colombian  interests.</p>

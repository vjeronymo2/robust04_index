			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / House price index unchanged House prices were unchanged in October, the Halifax Building Society price index shows. After a rise of just 0.1 per cent in September, the figures confirm that the underlying trend in prices remains broadly flat. Halifax said that it expected this trend to continue until consumer confidence improved. It added that the price of new houses rose by 1.2 per cent last month after a fall of 4.6 per cent in September.</p>

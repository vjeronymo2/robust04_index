			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Lazard offer goes flat - At a Glance Lazard Investors this week abandoned its planned launch of an investment trust specialising in regional brewers. The offer for Lazard Brewers Investment Trust failed to attract the minimum Pounds 50m the fund managers had hoped for. The collapse was blamed on poor market conditions, rather than the concept behind the fund. The trust had agreed to buy a Pounds 27m portfolio of shares in regional brewers from brewing giant Whitbread, but this deal has been cancelled.</p>

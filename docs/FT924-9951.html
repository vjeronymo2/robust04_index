			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Port of Liverpool jobs level 'steady' THE NUMBER of jobs generated by the Port of Liverpool has remained steady over the past 16 years even though the number of dockers has fallen from 7,000 to about 600, according to an independent study. In 1976 the port generated between 52,000 and 107,000 local jobs and 129,000 to 304,000 in the UK as a whole. Using the same criteria, the 1992 figures give ranges of 49,000 to 105,000 locally and 125,000 to 311,000 nationally. The study was carried out for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company by Mr Peter Stoney of Liverpool University's macroeconomic research unit, who also carried out the 1976 work. The wide range of job numbers is because those among shippers cannot be entirely attributed to Liverpool's existence. 'We cannot say they would all go if Liverpool ceased operating,' Mr Stoney said. 'Many might transfer elsewhere.' Mr Stoney says the loss of dockers' jobs has been made good by growth among tenant companies in the Mersey docklands. Moreover, Liverpool's trade and profitability trends are now positive, while they were negative in 1976. Cargo is twice the 1980 level, industrial relations are good, Liverpool has developed as a national hub for west coast traffic, and its freeport has been successful and is being extended. Mr Stoney predicts that during 1992-98, new facilities and port-based trading estates will generate Pounds 230m extra income and 4,500 local jobs during construction work. They will bring in Pounds 83m of operating income to the port, plus 3,000 permanent jobs, when complete. He says the figures are pessimistic. 'The estimated impact on jobs of capital spending takes no account of any resulting increases in trade passing through the port.'</p>

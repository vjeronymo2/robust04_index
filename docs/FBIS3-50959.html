			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV-13 Sunday" newscast] </F>   [Text] The daily EXCELSIOR published today a report on the  alleged leaders of the armed groups in Chiapas. The report  contains a list attributed to the Attorney General's Office  [PGR] that includes priests, legislators, teachers, and PRD  [Party of the Democratic Revolution] figures are among the rebel  leaders.    Attorney General Jorge Carpizo today sent a letter to  EXCELSIOR editor Regino Diaz Redondo stating that the PGR has  not provided that information. It is obvious, Carpizo indicated  in his letter, that the document does exist, but it has not come  from the PGR. The official added that as far as he an the PGR  are concerned, having a series of rumors and false statements  attributed to them constitutes the most serious blow that could  be dealt. Carpizo said the rumors are intended to destroy what  has been built through much toil and that they harm the  foundation for dispensing justice.</p>

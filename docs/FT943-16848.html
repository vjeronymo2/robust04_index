			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Dollar ends turbulent week on firmer note The dollar staggered yesterday to the end of a week in which it fell to a post-war low against the Japanese yen but avoided a headlong decline. Attention is now focused on the rash of policy meetings next week which should reveal whether the G3 countries - US, Germany and Japan - are willing to take concerted action to support the dollar. The central bank meetings are followed by the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Naples, which starts on Friday. The weakness of the dollar and its impact on financial markets is likely to be of key concern at the summit. The US currency stood at Y98.65 in late trading in New York after closing in London at Y98.705, more than a yen firmer than its low of Y97.68 reached in Tokyo trading. Against the D-Mark it was DM1.59655 in New York after finishing at DM1.5946 in London. Earlier the dollar had gained support from rumours, later denied, that the Bank of Japan might cut its official discount rate. Speculation had been fuelled by comments made by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that lower Japanese and German interest rates would help the dollar and world economic growth. The rally petered out during late European trading amid disappointment that central banks had not intervened, as they did last Friday. The banks, however, chose to stay out of the market following the failure of their earlier efforts which saw the dollar fall below intervention levels. Traders are hoping for concerted action next week, possibly in the form of co-ordinated interest rate moves from the US, Germany and Japan. Analysts warn, however, that all three countries have good reasons not to want to make policy changes yet. If the market's expectations are disappointed, this may well leave the dollar vulnerable. Analysts are divided as to whether the dollar will take to the sidelines until after the G7 summit or endure a volatile week. Equity markets had a better week, after suffering heavily when the dollar first slipped below Y100 on June 21. The FT-SE 100 index finished at 2,936.4, a 2.1 per cent rise on the week, and in Frankfurt the Dax climbed 1.6 per cent higher over the same period. However, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo and the CAC 40 in Paris each fell by more than 1 per cent during the week. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 21.69 points up at 3,646.65.

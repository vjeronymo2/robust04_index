			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Mswati III at the opening of the Sixth </F> Parliament in Lobamba on 18 February--live]    [Text] Your majesty the Ndlovukazi, your royal highnesses,  right honorable prime minister, chiefs, excellencies, members of  the diplomatic corps, honorable ministers, Mr. President and  honorable members of the House of Senate, Mr. Speaker, and  honorable members of the House of Assembly. Distinguished  guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by welcoming you all  to the state opening of the first session of the Sixth  Parliament of the Kingdom of Swaziland.    My first duty today, on behalf of the whole Swazi nation, is  to commend the work of the previous government. In often  difficult circumstances, and over a period of great change in  the Kingdom, the prime minister and his cabinet team, along with  the members of both houses of Parliament, worked hard for the  development of the Kingdom. The nation owes a vote of  appreciation to all who served us over this period.    Two years ago, the nation was in the process of deciding the  direction to be taken -- of political reform. I made it clear  then, in this chamber, that the future of Swaziland depended on  the full, active, and peaceful participation of all Swazis in  that process to achieve a result which would truly reflect the  wishes of the majority of the country. The elections were  clearly a success. They were accepted as freely and fairly  conducted by the international community, and more importantly  they were what we, the Swazi people, wanted.    Beyond the fact of a new electoral system, the reforms have  been important to Swaziland as a means by which the whole Swazi  family has been involved in a debate of national interest and  significance. I should like to take this opportunity to  congratulate the nation for its wholehearted participation and  support of the process, and for the peaceful manner in which the  exercise was conducted. Of course, the very nature of reform  implies an ongoing process, and the recommendations given by the  nation include many issues which still require attention. This  we will address in the same manner -- carefully and peacefully  and with the full knowledge and approval of the Kingdom.    I should also like to highlight the achievement of those of  you sitting here who are very much the end result of the first  reform initiative. You members of the House of Assembly, who  have been chosen by your fellow Swazis to be their  representatives in the country's most important legislative  chamber, you take your seats here at a vital time in the  Kingdom's history, and you and all members of both houses hold  in your hands the hopes of those you represent, to ensure that  the direction of our development aim is correct, and that the  effects of development strategies implemented by government  reach those who most need them, for the time has now come for  the nation to direct its attention to the issue of greatest  importance for our future stability and prosperity -- how best  to tackle the economic problems facing the country today, and  what steps we must take to sustain the progress toward achieving  our national development objectives.    Before considering this economic challenge at a national  level, we should understand the importance to Swaziland's  development of events occurring around the world. These days of  increasing economic inter-dependence between nations, the  effects of situations in one part of the world, or the decisions  of other countries and organizations, can have implications for  the rest of us. One example of this, and one that perhaps has  the greatest significance for the world's economic future, is  the signing last December of the General Agreement of Tariffs  and Trade. This was the result of many years of negotiations  between all the major trading blocks aimed at breaking down  trade barriers between countries, and it is an important step  towards creating a world of free trade.    While Swaziland, along with other developing countries, can  welcome the outcome of the agreement in terms of expanding  markets for our exports, there are several short term  disadvantages and implications for our economies to be taken  into account. Two examples of these are, first, the issue of  our unique access to various markets for our sugar, beef, and  other products. Under the terms of GATT, this trading advantage  will certainly fall away in time, reducing the revenue from  those export markets. And second, linked to the first, is the  fact that the agreement will mean all our exports will  potentially be in direct competition with every other country.  Thus, the GATT signing represents both an advantage and a  challenge to the Kingdom. The advantage is the opening up of  whole new markets for our exports, and the challenge to Swazi  industry of producing exports which stand up to competition from  the rest of the world. These are areas for national discussion  as we determine ways to lift our levels of quality and  efficiency in production.    At government level, we have already begun to lobby the  First  World to consider the penalties to developing countries of the  agreement. The price to them of our support for the signing is  their understanding of the potential harm it will do to our  economies. In the short term, we are looking for a continuation  to our preferential access to markets, at least until we are in  a position to compete with the developed world in the export  market place. This will be a challenge for government and an  issue for which we will be looking to our friends in the  international community for help and advice.    Conflict situations around the world too have an impact on  us, not simply for the adverse effect they have on the world  economy, but also because they tend to divert attention away  from the development needs of emerging countries like Swaziland.  The situation in Bosnia, for example, while providing an  illustration of the dangers of division within a country,  continues to draw resources and concern away from the developing  world in a justifiable effort to resolve the crisis there.    Swaziland continues to support the process of negotiation  between the three rival factions, and we pray that the use of  force is avoided. We encourage the moves by the United Nations  and the European Union to assist in finding a settlement to the  dispute, and an end to the suffering of so many.    Another focus for world attention outside Africa has been  the developments toward a lasting settlement in the Middle East.  The danger of that troubled area developing once more into a  global situation with huge economic and social (?cause) can  never be overlooked. And so we welcome any moves which reduce  tension and bring the separate nations closer together.    Swaziland with its long association with the state of Israel  gives particular credit to the decision by the Israeli people  and government to take the road of negotiation and  reconciliation. It is one that we have supported constantly for  many years. Despite the delays and setbacks, we are encouraged  by the efforts of both sides -- Palestinians and Israel -- to  push forward with the agreement signed last September. Let us  hope that this first step in the process to real peace in the  region can continue, and we trust that other steps to include  all the people of the Middle East will soon create an atmosphere  in which countries there can develop peacefully without the  constant threat of violence and disaster.    And here in Africa the tragedy of civil war and internal  strife in so many countries continues to affect the economic  development of the continent as a whole and serves as a lesson  to us all on the importance of maintaining unity within nations.  The UN operation in Somalia has been the most expensive in the  organization's history. With the withdrawal of most of the UN  force in two months' time, let us pray that the lives,  resources, and effort which have been expanded over the past  year will not be wasted by a return to the bloodshed of recent  history.    In Sudan, the ongoing conflict between different ethnic  groups has resulted not only in death and destruction, but has  caused the enforced movement of many thousands of refugees who  now tax the resources of countries which are obliged to act as  their temporary hosts. The economic effect of refugees on a  country is one that we here can well understand and sympathize  with.    And perhaps most tragic of all is the continuation of the  daily shedding of blood in Angola, a country whose people have  known no peace for over 20 years and who are paying the  appalling price of the use of force to resolve their  differences. As fellow member of two organizations of economic  cooperation, the resolution of the conflict in Angola has  particular importance for us. We hope that the negotiations  underway in Lusaka signal the start of lasting peace to that  unfortunate country so that her huge natural and human resources  can contribute effectively to the economic future of our  subregion.    Clearly though the economic implications to Swaziland of the  situations in our two neighbors, Mozambique and South Africa,  deserve our closest attention. The process of peace in  Mozambique appears to be on course, and we congratulate all who  have contributed toward its success so far. The effect on our  economy of a stable and prosperous Mozambique cannot be  overemphasized, and we must be doing all we can now not just to  support the process, but to understand how best we can prepare  ourselves to take the fullest advantage of a return to peace in  our neighbor. It is imperative that we keep the channels of  communication at all levels between governments, NGO's  [nongovernmental organizations], and the private sector as open  and as active as possible. Our shared border holds many  possibilities for mutual economic improvement including  increased trade, joint tourism projects, and the greater use by  us of Mozambique's access to the sea. The success of the  refugee repatriation program is the first indication of the  importance we must attach to increasing cooperation with  Mozambique and government must accept this as a major priority.    The same is true of our other neighbor, South Africa. The  change in policy and direction of a new nonracial government in  South Africa is undoubtedly the single most important factor for  Swaziland's economic future. We would do well to fully  understand the implications to us of change in a neighbor on  whom we rely so heavily. The initiative lies with us to open  the lines of communication with those with whom we will be  dealing in future. With new figures in power in South Africa, it  will be up to us to inform and educate about the needs of the  Kingdom and to discuss with them the possibilities for increased  economic cooperation. Of particular relevance are our shared  natural resources, our various financial links and our numerous  trade agreements. We must not ignore the significance to  Swaziland of change in South Africa, and government must take  the lead in establishing links as early as possible.    It follows that it is in Swaziland's best interest for South  Africa to enjoy as peaceful a transition as possible to a stable  and prosperous future. We, therefore, look with concern at the  potential for disruption to the process toward elections in  April of the non-involvement of large sections of South African  society. We have constantly urged all parties in South Africa  to grasp this opportunity to be a part of their country's  future, and we continue to do so. Instability across our border  has the gravest implications for us and we must do all we can to  encourage a smooth transition.    One important aspect of a new South Africa, and one that has  been in focus recently, is the future of those Swazis who  through the unjust laws of Swazi territory over the years find  themselves unwillingly members of a country which is not their  own. The world should be left in no doubt that we are doing all  in our power through peaceful negotiation to restore to the  Kingdom the land and the people we have lost through a process  of historical injustice. The recent establishment of a border  adjustment committee signals our intention to proceed with this  issue at the highest levels. The nation will also be aware that  I raised the subject on a number of occasions last year,  including at the United Nations. In the event that we do not  achieve our aims before a change in government in South Africa,  we are of course prepared to talk to those who will have been  given the mandate to act as a result of the elections in April.  History and the facts are on our side, and I'm confident that  justice will be done.    And so we come to the issue of the Kingdom's economy at  national level. Clearly the world recession, recent drought,  and the number of international factors have combined to ensure  very difficult economic times ahead for Swaziland. Our  challenge as a nation is to identify the areas of problem, and  then to formulate strategies which will ensure the economic  stability and prosperity of the Swazi people for many  generations to come.    I mentioned last year that following on from the successes  of  the consultation of the nation on our political future, the same  process would be used to decide the Kingdom's economic choices.  I intend summoning the nation in the very near future to  propose a four-stage process aimed first at educating us all to  the economic realities of the Kingdom. Then gathering opinion  on our national development priorities, seeking views on how  best to frame our strategy, and finally deciding on how we  implement them. The first two steps require the active  involvement of all Swazis.    The first stage, one of education, is vitally important as  it  is central to the process that we will all understand the  limitations and realities of composing a national development  plan within an underdeveloped country such as ours. We must  acknowledge that there are no easy overnight solutions to our  economic difficulties, and that the most important ingredients  for future success will be hard work, sacrifice, and dedication.    The second stage will also involve the support of all  Swazis,  young and old. This is when we will confirm the nation's  priority objectives, the direction to be given to government for  the Kingdom's development. Key objectives from the past which  still hold good today include economic growth, sustainable  development, self-reliance, equity and participation, and social  justice and stability. We will need to confirm these, and if  necessary, amend or add to them. I should like to highlight  some of the more important aspects of each objective to give  focus for discussion.    The key to our future is clearly to achieve growth in our  economy. The creation of jobs and the increase in gross  domestic product must be central to any development strategy.  How to achieve this will be a major point for debate in the  process of national consultation ahead. One aspect for  discussion with regard to job creation is the problem of how to  create the right environment for investment both by Swazis and  by international investors.    For Swazis the provision of capital and knowledge, with  which  to start up businesses, is perhaps the most vital. For foreign  investment the provision of a business environment which is  attractive in terms of incentives, infrastructure, skilled work  force, and good industrial relations is crucial to success.  These issues are being addressed within government, but the  nation will want to contribute to the debate with ideas and not  by action on how to improve this vital area.    Hand in hand with economic growth is the need to ensure that  our development is sustainable, that we can manage to control  and improve our economy to ensure constant progress over the  years ahead to get us through times of global recession.    While acknowledging the importance of close economic  cooperation with other countries in the region, it is  nonetheless that we do everything possible to stand on our own  in terms of producing the basic everyday requirements such as  foodstuffs and essential manufactured goods. We must grasp the  message that to rely on imports is to be at the mercy of changes  in the world crisis and to miss out on business opportunities.  Emphasis must surely be placed on self-reliance.    Since the days when we first considered ourselves to be a  distinct separate nation, a fundamental theme in protecting the  unity and independence of the Swazi people has been the quality  of all members of the Swazi family and the active participation  of all in the decisions affecting the Kingdom. This principle  was central to the process of political reform over the last two  years and guides us in the economic debate ahead.    And finally, an element of our national objectives which has  drawn the nation together and one that has ensured our  independence, is the principle of social justice resulting in  peace and stability for the Kingdom for so many generations.  When we survey the state of perhaps the majority of countries  on our continent, we would do well to reflect on the importance  of these final two principles, and to realize how sensible we  have been in the past to insist on the maintenance of peace and  stability through a policy of social justice at all costs.    Of course the stability of our country depends on many  factors. One is the physical security of the Kingdom and the  efficiency of those entrusted with maintaining our system of  justice. In these days of increasing crime, there has been a  marked decrease in confidence in our ability as a nation to  enforce the law. The police and the courts in particular are  finding their resources and capabilities stretched to the limit  and new answers to this crisis need to be found.    One encouraging move is the recent undertaking by the police  force to establish close working groups with the civilian  community, and this is clearly an initiative which deserves all  our support. Crime prevention is the social responsibility of us  all, and not an issue to be shrugged off as a problem for the  police alone. And for the courts, plans are already in hand to  expand existing facilities and courts so that the backlog in  cases can be based [as heard] and the administration of justice  to be made more efficient.    Equally important though is the relationship between the  police and the courts. There must be a mutual understanding and  sympathy between these two critical elements of our justice  system. The two must work in harmony and with closer  cooperation toward achieving an overall raising of confidence in  the processes of the law. We will be calling for views on how  to improve in this vital area in the months ahead.    These then are some of the more important aspects of our  national objectives, which the nation will be asked to consider  during the process of consultation, and I would appeal to all in  the Kingdom to give serious thought to the various questions  raised.    Closely linked to our national development objectives is the  confirmation of government priorities on spending. This is an  issue that will occupy members of both houses following  presentation of the budget by the minister for finance. Since  independence, our three highest priorities for government  spending have been health, education, and agriculture. These  are recognized as being fundamental to the objectives of any  developing country. But the nation will be asked to confirm  whether in each case the specific targets for spending in each  area is correct, and indeed whether other areas deserve more  attention.    The provision of adequate health care to all members of the  Swazi nation continues to demand our concern. New challenges in  this field confront as we strive to increase health facilities.  To make existing ones more efficient [word indistinct] of most  agents to educate our people about the importance of health care  and the prevention of diseases.    We have all been shocked to learn of the extent of the  spread  in the Kingdom of the killer disease, AIDS. Swaziland, along  with many other countries, stands to lose whole generations to  this menace. Unless we act with haste to contain the danger, the  real enemy to finding a solution to this potential devastating  problem, ignorance -- ignorance of what this disease is,  ignorance of what we can do to prevent it, and ignorance of the  effect on our future if we fail to contain it.    This is a challenge for us all to confront. We all have a  role to play in educating others to the dangers. There must be  a wholesale change in attitude to our social behavior. The only  alternative is to witness a tragedy occur which will undermine  all our development efforts and result in a future of misery for  our children. We require a national policy on this issue, and  we look to you seated here to give the nation its direction.    A central principle since independence has been our belief  that a nation's future is dependent on the products of its  schools. Access to education is right for all Swazis, and this  remains a guiding objective for government today. There has  been a long debate on the issue of what some call free  education. This is an issue the nation shall be addressing in  our forthcoming debate on the national strategies. It must be  acknowledged though before discussion begins that there is no  such thing as free education. In the end the nation will pay,  whether perhaps through higher taxes or a change in government  spending. There is clearly no magic source of funds to pay for  free education. Swaziland must pay for Swazis to be educated.  Nor is this something that can be changed in the short term.  Whatever the outcome of national debate on this issue, there  will be no overnight miracle to cancel the bill to Swazis for  our education.    Perhaps of more immediate concern and an issue that can be  addressed in the short term is that of the direction of our  education. The question is: Are we preparing Swazis with the  right training, knowledge, and skills to enter the market place  as workers? This is something for the nation to consider in the  months ahead and for government now to reflect on.    The third pillar of our current priorities is the  development  of our agricultural policies and the support given by government  to our farmers. Agriculture remains the stable employment for  the majority of Swazis and the foundation of our economy. It  deserves its place at the top of the nation's priorities.  However, the development and direction of our agricultural  policies and the degree and extent on government support to our  farmers is another subject for debate. We look for the  individual input of ideas from the farming community toward the  development of a national agricultural strategy. Our economic  future depends to a large degree on the performance of the  agricultural sector, and this will be central to our national  development plan.    An aspect of agriculture which has been ignored too much and  which requires the urgent attention of the members of both  houses here is the continuing decline in the state of our  environment and the abuse of our natural resources. It is a  poor worker who does not look after the tools of his trade. For  a country whose main employment is centered on the fruits of the  soil, we must recognize that our most important asset is the  land we have inherited from our forefathers. We must do all we  can to protect our natural resources for without them we are  nothing.    To protect does not mean to avoid using. Indeed in some  respects we under use our natural resources. Certainly as an  example, recent experience has taught us that we cannot expect  by right to receive sufficient rainfall every year to sustain  us, and that we must prepare ourselves in future to make more  use of the precious water resources in the Kingdom. This  includes more emphasis on the construction of dams and the  identifying of other sources of water for our irrigation needs.  But equally we ignore at pour peril the dangers of overuse of  other natural resources. We must conserve our priceless assets  so that they will provide for future generations as they have  for the past. Our soil, our trees, our rivers, our livestock,  and our wildlife. These are part of the rich fabric of  Swaziland and must be preserved at all cost. They are the tools  of our most important trade. We must look after them.    Earlier when discussing the impact on our economy of global  free trade, I referred to the requirement for us to become more  competitive as producers and suggested that efficiency was the  key. This requirement for efficiency extends beyond the private  sector and could perhaps become the watchword for all national  business. Leading the way in this regard should be government  and those organizations supported by government, the parastatals.    With a new start for government, this is the ideal time to  introduce the notion of efficient practice in all public sector  dealings. Improved efficiency equals increased productivity  and, in the case of parastatals, this is something the nation  expects to see. Too much of government's precious resources are  spent on supporting the inefficiency of companies who should be  self-sufficient and independent of public subventions.    Let us see the introduction of controlled measures on the  performance of government and the parastatals and let improved  efficiency in the public sector be an example to private  business.    Before I include, I should like to address a few remarks to  our friend in the international community. First, allow me on  behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the government, and the  whole Swazi nation to express my deep gratitude to you all for  your continuing support and share the experience toward the  development of the nation. That support has been generous and  well directed in the past, and it is my hope that you will be  able to continue to assist us as we decide on the way ahead. My  theme today has been to focus the attention of the members of  both houses of the nation's parliament and of the Kingdom's as a  whole on to the economic challenge for Swaziland in the years to  come.    During the process of consultation with all Swazis which  will  begin very shortly, we will be approaching the international  community for advice based on experience gained in your own  countries and elsewhere. This is an opportunity for your  countries to be part of this important stage in our development  and we will result in a detailed analysis of the targets for  future development assistance. We urge to help us find the  right way forward. [preceding two sentences as heard]    I have spoken at length about the challenge facing the  nation  in the years ahead. These are exciting times and you members of  Parliament, Assembly and Senate are at the very center of the  decision-making process. We ask for God's guidance in your  deliberations in these chambers, and we urge you to reflect on  the huge responsibility you share for the future of our Kingdom.  You have our confidence and trust. We ask that you perform  your duties to the nation with honor, loyalty, and dignity.    Thank you. God bless these proceedings.</p>

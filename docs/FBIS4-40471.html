			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma's Security Committee has unanimously  described the Russian president's edict on urgent measures to  protect the population from gangsterism and other manifestations  of organized crime as contradicting the Constitution and  existing legislation. This was stated on Thursday in an  interview to Interfax by Viktor Ilyukhin. He noted that this  fact was reflected in the State Duma's decision, which had been  prepared on this matter.    The lower chamber plans to discuss the president's edict at  a  plenary meeting on Friday 17 June. Ilyukhin stressed that in  conditions when the Constitutional Court is temporarily not  operating, only the president can halt the operation of the  edict. A recommendation to Boris Yeltsin to do this is also set  out in the draft State Duma decision.</p>

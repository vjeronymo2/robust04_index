			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: TV operations boost CBS CBS, the US broadcast television group, yesterday announced second-quarter profits of Dollars 109.3m, up slightly from Dollars 107.4m a year ago. The results translate into earnings of Dollars 6.84 a share, a record for CBS. Last year, the company reported earnings of Dollars 6.73 a share, but that figure was boosted by two extraordinary items. Without those items, earnings in this year's second quarter were up 19 per cent from a comparable Dollars 5.77 a share in 1993. Operating income was also higher in the quarter, up 14 per cent to Dollars 174.3m, while consolidated net sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 882.6m. The CBS television network unit made the biggest contribution to group earnings, reporting substantially higher income than a year ago. It attributed this to a strong performance from its prime-time, daytime, late-night and news programming. Although it has the weakest sports programming of the three main networks, CBS said its college basketball broadcasts in the quarter - which included the highly-popular Final Four championship tournament - posted an especially big sales increase, as did late-night programming, led by the top-rated Late Night with David Letterman show. Higher earnings were also reported by the group's affiliate stations and radio divisions. The results had little impact on CBS shares yesterday. However, they fell sharply in early trading on the news that the company was abandoning its planned merger with the QVC television shopping network, after telecommunications group Comcast launched a rival bid for QVC. The shares recovered later, after CBS said it would buy back 3.5m shares and split its stock five-for-one. In late trading, they were Dollars 308, up Dollars 8 on the day. See Lex</p>

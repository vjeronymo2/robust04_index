			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Ohana and Dutilleux - Wigmore Hall recitals Paul Roberts's latest London piano recital, at the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday, was given in memory of the composer Maurice Ohana, who died last year at the age of 78. The tribute was richly deserved. Born in Casablanca of Andalucian ancestry, a British passport-holder (his father had once been resident in Gibraltar) who spent his adult life in France, Ohana produced a mature compositional voice which, while not disguising the marks of his exotic upbringing nor denying the potent influences of Debussy and Falla, remained singularly and fascinatingly his own. The New Grove calls him a 'fiercely independent figure' - rightly so, since he steered rigorously clear of the cliques and fashions that dominated French music in the postwar period and yet managed never to fall prey to backwater obsessiveness, smallness of vision, or eccentricity. Roberts, a noted Debussyan who became Ohana's favoured pianist in the last decade of his life, played here six of the Etudes d'interpretation that Ohana wrote for him. Each of these is brilliantly written to exploit - as are Debussy's late Etudes, the obvious starting-point - a particular facet of pianistic technique; each transports the listener into a world of Mediterranean air, light and artistic perception, clean, sensually unabashed, on occasion bracingly harsh. Melodic lines emerge sharply profiled, often curlicued with the ornate tracery of North African cantillation or Andalucian folk song. (In the most striking Study of Roberts's selection, 'Main gauche seul', a sinuously weaving line for the left hand preserves its independence through all manner of decorative impositions.) There is a constant sense of Ohana's hard-edged, non-European, sometimes jazzy vitality extending and developing the Debussy pianistic canvas. Roberts, a superbly under-the skin interpreter of these pieces, also played selections of Debussy, including glittering yet firmly ordered performances of three Studies, and a bold one of Falla's magnificent Fantasia baetica. The programme was satisfying both in parts and as a whole, above all because of the intelligence and precise sense of style with which it was delivered. Another distinctive senior figure of French music, Henri Dutilleux (b. 1916), figured in the recital of the Ysaye Quartet at the Wigmore the following evening. His 1977 string quartet - subtitled 'Ainsi la nuit', a short (17 minutes), tightly packed piece - speaks the languages of Bartok and Webern yet with a highly 'personal' mode of utterance. Minute cells, flourishes pile up; the virtuosity of the string writing is remarkable both for its firmness of purpose and for its lack of ostentation. The young French quartet, who since their victory in the 1988 Evian competition have picked up an international career and a Decca recording contract, played 'Ainsi la nuit' with a devotion sadly missing in their brusque, jerky accounts of Haydn (Op. 74 no. 1) and Beethoven (the F minor, Op. 95) earlier in the concert. Even their Mendelssohn A minor, more suavely disciplined, seemed oddly airless and unloving. The Ysaye Quartet concert was sponsored by Banque Paribas</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Lottery licence to run for only 7 years THE NATIONAL Lottery licence is to run for less than seven years, Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, said yesterday. The main licence for the lottery, designed to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for charity, the arts, sport, heritage and celebrating the millennium, will expire on March 31 2001. The successful applicant will not be chosen until March or April next year and would be unlikely to be up and running before the late autumn, so the operation will run for no more than 6 1/2 years. Mr Tim Holly, chief executive of Camelot, one of the declared bidders for the licence, said yesterday: 'I am marginally disappointed. I would have preferred it a bit longer. I thought we would get between seven and 10 years.' Mr Davis made it clear yesterday that there would be a 'very strong presumption' that there would be another competitive tender when the first licence ran out. Lottery operators will have to recoup the cost of an investment likely to exceed Pounds 200m to set up the national system. The Great British Lottery Company, a consortium that includes Granada, said yesterday it accepted the length of the licence. Mr Davis is insisting that the lottery must be 'tasteful' and avoid games and advertising likely to lead to addiction. 'What we want is an absolutely clean, respectable, stable image,' he said. Mr Davis said his office would investigate the background of all those applying to run the lottery and would call on information from a wide range of government departments. 'I will have access to a very wide range of information, but I am not going to be specific because one could get into sensitive areas,' said Mr Davis. 'We must not have the wrong people running this lottery.' Mr Davis is insisting that the contents of all bids remain confidential. The draft invitation to apply and draft licence make it clear that applicants will have to provide plans for national coverage and a launch date. The lottery will have to be available in every local authority area six months after the national launch. Applicants will be expected to show a decreasing percentage of turnover spent on administration as turnover increases and return a proportion of proceeds from television rights and other merchandising to good causes. Mr Davis also made clear that there would be reserve standards - a maximum percentage the licensee may retain and a minimum percentage to be paid to the government for the good causes. Applicants will have to specify fixed minimum payments to be paid to the government in each year of the licence and provide a percentage for 'the target prize total' for the winners. Apart from Camelot - which includes Cadbury Schweppes and Racal Electronics  -the Great British Lottery Company, and a consortium of N M Rothschilds and Tattersalls of Australia, the contenders are likely to include Ladbrokes, the Rank Organisation, the Tote with partners, and possibly Mr Richard Branson offering a non-profitmaking option.</p>

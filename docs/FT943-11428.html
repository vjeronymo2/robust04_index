			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Speculation on Archer post Speculation mounted among Conservatives yesterday that Lord Archer, the party's former deputy chairman, would be offered a government post. This follows the Department of Trade and Industry announcement that it would not take any action over insider dealing allegations. However friends of Lord Archer said Mr John Major, the prime minister, had not yet made any formal approach to the peer, who is one of the party's leading activists and fundraisers. Lord Archer refused to make any comment on the handling by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, of the insider dealing allegations, which related to a bid by MAI, the entertainment and financial group, for Anglia TV.</p>

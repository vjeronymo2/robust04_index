			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Audit burden more likely to increase Sir, I write to draw your attention to a political con-trick which is being pulled on small businesses. The government announced with great gusto a lifting of the audit burden from small companies. As a chartered accountant with many small company clients, I have studied the draft legislation and would like to warn the public that they will not see any significant cut in costs if the legislation goes through as it stands. For companies falling in the turnover range of Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 350,000 per annum, the proposed legislation requires the accountant to sign a new report, replacing the audit report. However, the work required to enable the accountant to sign the new report will be almost as much as is currently carried out for an audit of this size of company. As the wording of the new report introduces new risks for the accountant which have yet to be tested in the courts, many accountants may feel it necessary to carry out more work than before. The Department of Trade and Industry is dealing almost exclusively with the Auditing Practices Board on this matter. The Auditing Practices Board is responsible for standards and guidance within the profession on auditing matters. As such, it is mainly concerned with larger companies and, from what it has written and said, appears to have little grasp of the practical implications of the proposed legislation and its effect on small companies. In its rush to score political points out of this matter, the government has not allowed sufficient time to ensure that the proposals are workable. The draft legislation was issued towards the end of May and responses on the matter were required by June 10. With the Auditing Practices Board behind the proposals, it seems extremely unlikely that it is going to be altered before becoming law. Of course it makes sense to maintain a requirement for small businesses to involve a chartered accountant in their accounting affairs and it makes sense to remove unnecessary elements of the accountant's work. However, to tell small businesses that their burden is being lifted when, in the fullness of time, they will realise that it is not, is nothing more than a cheap and nasty political trick.

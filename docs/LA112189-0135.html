			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> TITANS SEE RECORDS FALL ON WAY TO RECORDING BEST SEASON SINCE '84  </P> <P> On the quiet Monday after the end of the season, Gene Murphy sat in his office,  the names of this year's seniors already erased from the depth chart on the  wall as preparations for next year begin.  </P> <P> "This was a good football team," Murphy said.  </P> <P> With a one-back offense and one spectacular back, Cal State Fullerton pulled  out a 6-4-1 record, nailing down their best season since 1984 with a  well-played victory over San Jose State Saturday.  </P> <P> Behind the running of Mike Pringle and the accuracy of quarterback Dan Speltz,  Fullerton set 41 offensive school records this season.  </P> <P> But as the season wound down, it was an improved defense that helped the Titans  to their best record since Fullerton went 11-1 in 1984, holding the last three  opponents to 10, 13 and 14 points.  </P> <P> "I think the last four games we played as well as a team as we have in a long  time," Murphy said.  </P> <P> But the offense was the story of the season.  </P> <P> Fullerton switched to a one-back set this season under first-year coordinator  Bill Wentworth and finished the season with an average gain per play of 6.3  yards, a school record.  </P> <P> "The (offensive system) is the best we've had since I've been here, with the  balance between the run and the pass," Murphy said. "And (we) didn't  necessarily have the best personnel we've had."  </P> <P> Pringle, Speltz and receiver Rocky Palamara are leaving Fullerton, but they  leave their names behind in the record books.  </P> <P> Among the more memorable:  </P> <P> Mike Pringle  </P> <P>  -- 357 yards rushing against New Mexico State, which tied the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. record for a week before Indiana's Anthony Thompson  broke it.  </P> <P>  -- 626 yards rushing in two consecutive games, an NCAA record.  </P> <P>  -- 2,690 all-purpose yards, second best total in NCAA history to Barry  Sanders' 3,250.  </P> <P>  -- 11.52 yards a carry against New Mexico State, a school record.  </P> <P>  -- 116 points in a season, breaking kicker Greg Steinke's record of 85.  </P> <P> Dan Speltz  </P> <P>  -- 4,595 passing yards in two seasons, a school career record.  </P> <P>  -- 156.2 passing efficiency rating, a school season record.  </P> <P>  -- .693 completion percentage, a school season record.  </P> <P>  -- 33 touchdown passes in two seasons, a school career record.  </P> <P>  -- 481 yards passing against Utah State, a school record.  </P> <P> Rocky Palamara  </P> <P>  -- 13 receptions against Utah State, a school record.  </P> <P>  -- 69 receptions and 1,024 yards, both season records.  </P> <P>  -- 122 receptions for 1,899 yards in two seasons, both school career records.  </P> <P>  -- 18 receiving touchdowns in two seasons, a school career record.  </P> <P> Those records often overshadowed performances by other players, among them nose  guard John Bavaro, who blocked four kicks; linebacker Russ Oleyer, whose 129  tackles were a school record, and cornerback Terry Tramble, who had six  interceptions.  </P> <P> Pringle ran behind an offensive line anchored by Reggie Redding that began the  season short on experience and finished it short on players who weren't  injured, but did its job all the same.  </P> <P> And freshman kicker Phil Nevin put on a show of accuracy, hitting 33 of 33  extra-point attempts and making 15 of 21 field goals. His misses were all  beyond 48 yards, except for a blocked 36-yarder.  </P> <P> Still, it was the winning record the Titans said they wanted.  </P> <P> Their 5-2 Big West record has assured them a tie for second place. The 6-4-1  record assures them they won't have to hear again and again how long it has  been since they had a winning record.  </P> <P> This season, a break in what has been a difficult nonconference schedule  helped.  </P> <P> "We should have had a winning record," Murphy said. "We should have had more  wins. We should have beat Utah State and we should have beat San Diego State."  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Fullerton will open the 1990 football season with a home game against Sonoma  State, a Division II school. . . . The basketball season opens at home Friday,  with the women playing Weber State at 5 p.m. and the men playing Lamar at 7:30.  . . . Volleyball player Stephanie Scofield is a nominee for the regional GTE  Academic All-America team.  </P></p>

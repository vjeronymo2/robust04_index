			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLAIRE MARINE SCORES WIRE-TO-WIRE WIN AT ARLINGTON  </P> <P> Claire Marine, the Irish-bred filly who might have been a factor had she been  entered in today's Arlington Million, settled for a wire-to-wire victory in the  $500,000 Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington International Saturday.  </P> <P> Allowed to establish a slow early pace on a grass course listed as yielding,  Claire Marine shrugged off a few challengers through the stretch to earn  $300,000 for her owners, Chicagoan Sidney Port and Charlie Whittingham, who  also trains the 4-year-old filly.  </P> <P> Claire Marine, timed in 2:01 4/5 for the 1 3/16 miles, paid $4, $2.80 and $2.60  as the favorite under Chris McCarron.  </P> <P> Capades, 1 3/4 lengths back, paid $4.40 and $3.40 and Gaily Gaily returned  $3.60. Next was Ravinella, followed by Key Flyer, Nastique, Here's Your Silver  and Baba Cool.  </P> <P> Claire Marine's win was her sixth in nine American starts, the other victories  coming at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar.  </P> <P> On Saturday, she carried 123 pounds, the same as all the other starters except  Capades and Key Flyer, who carried 117 apiece.  </P> <P> Whittingham considered starting Claire Marine in the Million, but already had  Nasr el Arab and Frankly Perfect entered to run today.  </P> <P> Port owns 75% of Claire Marine, who had one victory and four seconds from six  starts in France before the Americans bought her a year ago.  </P> <P> "I had mixed emotions about which race she would run in," said McCarron, winner  of the 1984 Million with John Henry but without a mount in the race today. "In  this race, I knew she had these mares over a barrel, but she would have been  very tough Sunday, too."  </P> <P> No matter what happens in the Million, Whittingham will return to California  happy. Oczy Czarnie, the 3-year-old French filly who won Friday's Pucker Up  Stakes, has been turned over to the trainer, and he also will take over River  Warden after the 3-year-old French colt runs in the Million.  </P></p>

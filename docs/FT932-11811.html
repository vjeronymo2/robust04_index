			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (7): Birthplace of captive insurance movement - Bermuda IN SPITE of its geographical location and rising competition from centres nearer to home, Bermuda continues to attract its fair proportion of offshore business from Europe. European investors are prominent in the British colony's growing investment fund and trust management industries, but the island's offshore insurance industry has attracted most interest from Europeans. The birthplace of the captive insurance movement in the 1960s, Bermuda is by far the biggest of the world's offshore insurance centres and is home to some 1,324 captive insurance companies - insurance subsidiaries which insure the risks of their industrial or commercial parents. Last year 36 of the 59 new captives companies formed were from the United States, but surprisingly, in view of the rising competition from centres such as the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Luxembourg and Dublin, 16 of the new captives were from Europe, six of them from the UK. Mr Malcolm Butterfield, the registrar of companies in Bermuda, estimates that between 15 and 20 per cent of the total number of captives on the island are European and says he is 'cautiously optimistic' about the island's prospects as a centre for European companies. Many of the island's biggest European captives are British: companies such as Grand Metropolitan, Hanson Group, and British Airways have a long-established presence. Captive managers suggest that Bermuda is finding it more difficult to compete with Luxembourg and Dublin, for the business of companies which have operations in more than one European country. However, Bermuda more frequently wins out when a company forming a captive is seeking to insure risks on an international basis, especially when it has a US subsidiary. Mr Brian Hall, president of Johnson and Higgins, the US broker, which manages several hundred Bermuda-based captives, says the island is benefiting from the tendency for larger international companies to set up a network of captive companies. US companies such as Wang and Digital have captive insurers in Vermont, a growing US captive domicile, as well as a reinsurance captive in Bermuda, for example. Mr Hall predicts other international companies could follow suit, possibly by setting up a European captive in Dublin or Luxembourg, a US captive in Vermont, and a reinsurance captive in Bermuda. More importantly, European investors have a large stake in the new independent insurers and reinsurers which have grown rapidly in recent years. Zurich, Europe's second biggest insurer, has a majority stake in the Bermuda-based Centre Re, the world's fastest growing reinsurer. Centre Re underwrote more than Dollars 1bn of premium income in 1992, its fourth full year of existence and now counts with assets in excess of Dollars 4bn. Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss group which is the world's leading engineering company, is the ultimate holding company of Scan Re, another fast growing Bermudan reinsurer, which set up in 1988. Both companies specialise in 'finite risk' reinsurance, often offering buyers multiyear contracts to cover their biggest risks. The deals, which also include provision for the reimbursement of premiums if losses do not occur or are lower than expected, are designed to bring greater stability to the reinsurance marketplace. According to Mr Jens Juul, the president of Scan Re, Bermuda's regulations and tax rules, as well as the extensive network of legal and accounting services, provide an ideal framework for the development of this business. 'There is no question that worldwide knowledge in these type of products is concentrated in Bermuda.' ABB underlined their confidence in Scan Re by investing a further Dollars 50m in the company, bringing its total capitalisation to Dollars 100m. Revenues in 1992 amounted to between Dollars 140m and Dollars 150m. Indeed over the past six months there have been indications that Bermudan-based finite risk reinsurers could play an important part in bolstering the beleaguered Lloyd's of London insurance market. Towards the end of last year the UK's Commercial Union joined with a number of US investors to back a Dollars 365m-strong reinsurance company, Mid Ocean, formed partially to reinsure business originally underwritten in London. The group expects premium income to amount to more than Dollars 200m in its first year of operation, says Mr Henry Keeling, Mid Ocean's underwriter, who was formerly deputy underwriter at syndicate 51 in Lloyd's. More recently Merrett Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, has sponsored the formation of a Dollars 70m Bermudan-based reinsurer, to exclusively reinsurer business originally underwritten by Merrett's nine syndicates at Lloyd's. In between these developments Centre Re agreed an ambitious programme to provide reinsurance to Lloyd's Names, in a deal negotiated by the insurance brokers, Steel Burrill Jones. Outside the reinsurance arena Bermuda is attracting increasing European interest in its mutual fund industry. European demand is responsible for a third of the sales by the 235 mutual fund companies based in Bermuda. Europeans are also interested in taking advantage of Bermuda's new trust law, which allows a limited number of overseas companies to manage Bermudan-based trust companies. Coutts, the private banking arm of the UK's National Westminster Bank, is one of three new trust companies to have been set up in the last six months. Schroders, the UK merchant bank, and Lombard Odier are the other two.</p>

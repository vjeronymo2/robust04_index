			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa has undertaken to conduct its arms  sales as a responsible member of the world community and not to  supply weapons to regimes which use them for oppression.  Speaking at the South African Embassy in Washington Deputy  President Thabo Mbeki said President Nelson Mandela would soon  sign an agreement covering international regulation of missile  delivery systems. Mr. Mbeki was reacting to questions about  news reports in the United States that South Africa planned a  sharp increase in its arms exports following the end of the arms  embargo. He said South Africa had a strict policy not to send  weapons to conflict areas in Africa. He said it was possible  that South Africa could provide aid to Rwanda in the form of a  military field hospital.</p>

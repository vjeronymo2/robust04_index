			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Daiei bids for 42% of Chujitsuya DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain, yesterday launched a friendly, partial takeover bid for Chujitsuya, a Japanese retailer active in the Tokyo area. If it goes through the deal will leave Daiei in control of nearly 20 per cent of Japan's supermarket trade. The offer, which is for up to 42 per cent of Chujitsuya's shares, at Y2,700 a share, could signal the end of a complex series of financial and share deals that will help Daiei pursue its goal of ex-panding operations in Tokyo. The bid was signalled in early December, when Shuwa, the property and retailing company, defaulted on loans to Daiei worth Y110bn (Dollars 750m). Daiei had been holding a 33.9 per cent stake in Chujitsuya as collateral for the loans. At that time, Chujitsuya said it had given up efforts to stay independent and would co-operate in a takeover by Daiei. A formal offer for the shares, however, is required under stock exchange rules. Under the terms of the offer, Daiei must receive acceptances for at least 35 per cent of the Chujitsuya's shares, worth Y85bn, or the offer will lapse. It said it would purchase up to 38m shares, or just over 42 per cent of the company. Chujitsuya's shares were suspended yesterday, but finished with an asking price of Y2,530 on Thursday. Daiei is making 53.21 per cent of the offer itself, while the balance of the offer is being placed through Maruetsu, a Daiei-controlled retailer in Tokyo. Daiei said that Chujitsuya would continue to operate as an independent company and retain its separate stock market listing. However, a range of measures would be taken to integrate the management and operations of the two groups. Daiei established itself as a leading retailer in western Japan, but was hindered in its expansion into Tokyo because of high land prices. But the steep fall in property prices, pushed the heavily indebted Shuwa to the edge, creating an opportunity for Daiei.</p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Egypt offered aid pledges Egypt has won aid pledges of between Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn a year to help bolster its economic reforms, Mr Youssef Boutros-Ghali, minister of state for international co-operation, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Boutros-Ghali, in Paris for a meeting with aid donors, said he had informal contacts with the Paris Club of creditor nations and said a debt relief programme was proceeding normally. Egypt is due to get a final 20 per cent of debt forgiveness in July following a 1991 deal in which the Paris Club agreed to halve Egypt's official debt in return for its role in the Gulf War, on condition that it pursue economic reforms. Of this amount, almost Dollars 1bn is likely to come from the US, western officials said. Washington also gives Cairo military and other aid.</p>

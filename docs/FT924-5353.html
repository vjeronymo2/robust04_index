			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Aids, 'killer of the fittest', debilitates developing world / Review of a survey of the disease's economic impact JUST OVER a decade after the world learned of an epidemic that echoes the Black Death of the Middle Ages, reliable statistics remain hard to obtain and evidence is sometimes anecdotal, but the consequences are becoming starker. Aids (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the fatal condition that results from long-term infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), currently kills 100,000 people a year worldwide. But worst-hit are vulnerable economies of developing countries in general, and Africa in particular. In Uganda, the condition is inflicting a terrible toll on the country's railway corporation. Ten per cent of its employees may have died of Aids; labour turnover is 15 per cent a year. In Zambia, the country's copper mines, responsible for 75 per cent of the country's export earnings, are vulnerable: 'The danger is that skilled workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be trained,' warns one expert. 'The result will not be a sudden collapse in mine output. Rather, there will be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents and delays, and output will suffer.' From South Africa comes other ominous news. Life insurance companies paid Pounds 855,000 in Aids-related claims between 1985 and 1988. In 1989 alone, payments were Pounds 700,000. In Zimbabwe, claims in group life schemes of one insurance company doubled between 1986 and 1990, and the amount paid out multiplied 25-fold. And in Malawi a leading insurance company pulled out of the market when the government banned Aids test on applicants seeking cover. These examples come from an extensive survey of the possible impact of the disease on development by the Panos Institute, the independent London-based research body*. Although the study takes a global view, some of the most frightening statistics come from Africa. The World Health Organisation, drawing on a World Bank model, says that life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa could fall to 47 years by the end of the century, compared to 62 without the HIV/Aids factor. Unicef predicts that the under-five mortality rate in central and east Africa is likely to rise to between 159 and 189 per 1,000 live births, instead of dropping to 132. But Africa bears a double affliction - it has nearly half the world's HIV/Aids victims but the continent's economic crisis has left it almost bereft of the resources required to meet the challenge. In 1990, says the Panos report, the global cost of Aids treatment was estimated at between Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and Dollars 3.5bn - no more than 2 per cent of which was spent in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that up to 12m adults are infected with HIV - one in 250 of the world's adult population. Over 80 per cent of cases in the developing world, and most of those infected, are between 14 and 44. By the end of the century the death toll is expected to be at least 400,000 a year. And by then at least 40m people, perhaps 100m, are expected to have been infected by HIV. The world faces other killers, some of which are readily preventable or curable. Malaria claims 1m lives a year; tuberculosis 3m, diarrhoeal disease 4m. But most of these deaths are among the vulnerable - the very young or the aged: the former are unproductive, and the latter have ceased production. Aids, however, threatens the development prospects of whole nations, the report points out, by primarily attacking men and women aged between 20 and 45, 'the backbone of the labour force'. Because HIV hits active young adults hardest, it could be described as 'the killer of the fittest'. As the epidemic advances, warns the report, to be published on Monday, the eve of World Aids Day, existing skills shortages will be exacerbated and new ones will be created. Productivity will be threatened: 'As the young sexually active members of the labour force (20-40) become infected, fewer will survive to form the older segment (40-60) which has accumulated skills.' The higher the income, the greater the opportunity for sexual activity. Thus a 1988 study in Zaire found that HIV infection rates in better educated and higher paid male workers was 5 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in the lower-graded categories. Further evidence comes from Zambia, where one sample revealed 8 per cent infection among urban adults with fewer than five years of schooling, rising to 33 per cent of those with 14 years or more. The picture is incomplete, the report acknowledges. Chapters on the implications for labour rely heavily on information from central and east Africa. Nevertheless, the impact of Aids may be as severe in other developing regions. 'Cash crop production may decline . . . labour costs rise as shortages develop, and employers may face spiralling medical costs,' warns Mr Jon Tinker, president of the institute, in his foreword to the 170-page study. No cure or vaccine is in sight, most experts agree. Part of the anti-Aids strategy, says Panos, should involve more money for prevention. It cites one calculation that suggests that Dollars 100m spent in anti-HIV/Aids activities in Thailand in 1991-92 could stop 3.5m people being infected and save Dollars 5.1bn in potential losses: 'Spending Dollars 1 now to save Dollars 51 later does sound like quite a good investment,' says Mr Tinker. But even if infection were to cease overnight, the challenges posed are enormous, warns Panos. The lengthy incubation period means that . . . the number of Aids cases would continue to grow over the next decade at an average of 10 per cent a year, a total of 40m by end of century - almost 90 per cent of them in the developing world. This means that planners must prepare to adapt, says Panos. In the agricultural sector it may mean less labour-intensive crops. The schooling systems must accommodate the special needs of a forecast 10m orphans; economic policies must take into account the changing age profile of the labour force. *The Hidden Cost of AIDS: the challenge of HIV to development, The Panos Institute, 9 White Lion Street, London N1 9PD Tel: (71) 278 1111, Pounds 9.95</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (19): Challenge for company culture - Business re-engineering: the need for 'totally new thinking' OVER a decade ago, in 'Information Technology Year,' Kenneth Baker toured the UK exhorting businesses to automate and change the entire way they operated to increase productivity and gain new market opportunities. The story goes that after one such speech in 1982 he was approached by a small businessman who said: 'I'm so fired up by what you said that I'm going straight out to buy an electric typewriter]' Eleven years later this story is all too familiar to proponents of business process re-engineering or any of the 20 other names for this idea which were discovered in a recent survey. 'Companies are spending millions of pounds on applying information technology to business processes which are donkey's years old and are irrelevant to today's needs,' says Mr John Bennett, an executive director at computing company ICL. 'Advances in technology mean that companies are enjoying huge improvements in cost-performance of computers. Businesses have extensive telecom networks and easily accessible databases. Yet despite the advances and the massive investment in technology, office productivity has barely increased in the last dozen years and in many cases has actually decreased,' he says. Mr Bennett believes no more than five per cent of ICL customers are seriously working on business re-engineering. Mr David Harvey, a director of research firm Business Intelligence, which recently published a 300-page report on business re-engineering*, says information technology itself is part of the problem. MOST businesses claim they are 'geared to constant change,' he says. 'But too often the change is the wrong kind: the kind that props up a creaking management process or functional structure and keeps it going for a few more years, rather than replacing it with a system which works and is suited to current needs. The result is management systems of growing complexity and overhead.' Information technology has been part of the problem, he says - 'as administrative systems have grown in complexity, IT has been used to help manage that complexity.' Today's quest for more competitive companies with fewer layers of management and administration has made business re-engineering a hot topic in the 1990s. An annual survey of senior executives in Europe by the consultancy CSC Index found that this issue entered 'the top 20' at 17 in 1989 and jumped to number one in 1990, staying in the top three since then. Business re-engineering, according to the Business Intelligence report, is the transformation of a company from one based on functions, such as accounting, marketing and manufacturing, to one based on processes, such as order processing and fulfilling customer expectations. The study highlights the restrictions of traditional structures. Each department focuses on what it contributes, not on what is needed as a whole. There is competition between functions, for example for budgets and staff. Staff identify with their function, rather than with the company as a whole. There are barriers to co-operation between functions, and sometimes even conflict. And a structure based on functions generates its own bureaucracy, which is needed to co-ordinate work and the flow of documents between the functions. 'Re-engineering challenges the underlying values and culture of a company,' the report says. 'All the components of a company could be affected, because re-engineering takes a holistic approach. Everything that affects outcomes - organisation, processes, people, technologies - must be considered for change.' Mr Christopher Bell, a business re-engineering specialist at Andersen Consulting, goes further: 'Question everything: there are no sacred cows,' he says. 'Set dramatic targets and think of dramatic ways of reaching them.' All this is a considerable challenge and there can be no textbook approach. Christopher Bell underlines the need for totally new thinking when looking at re-engineering. 'Go wild with ideas,' he says. 'Look at brain-storming meetings, suggestion boxes, workshops, industry 'best practice,' confession meetings, consultants, focus groups: any technique to generate new ideas to do things differently.' Even so, it is worth identifying specific areas which are ripe for re-engineering - and the resultant re-engineering need not be too earth-shattering. Rank Xerox, for example, cut the time to bill special contracts from more than three months to just one day, largely by simplifying the flow of documents around the company. This was part of a wider corporate re-engineering in the UK. Christopher Bell at Andersen Consulting and David Harvey at Business Intelligence emphasise activities which focus on customers and the quality of products and services delivered to them. Mr Harvey points to the typical arrangement where a customer enquiry at a branch generates a request for information to a particular department, which sends back the reply, which generates a further enquiry based on the information, so that enquiry goes to another department and so on. A variation on this theme is when too many staff in different departments deal with the same customer or supplier. THE Business Intelligence research highlights IT as key to business re-engineering. Others agree. At the simplest level, IT enables departments to share information through an on-line database, breaking down barriers and jealously guarded departmental ownership of data. Electronic data interchange, the exchange of orders, invoices and sales forecasts between computers, is transforming relationships between trading partners and eliminating paper-handling. And often such systems will just be the starting point for business re-engineering. 'The IT function must no longer be seen as the unit which mulls over whether the company should go for the Unix operating system,' says John Bennett at ICL. 'The emphasis now must be on how the function can play its part in the future of the enterprise.' David Harvey at Business Intelligence agrees: 'The relationship between IT and the rest of the company must be completely different from that of the past. In the past it has been a stand-alone department, often detached from business thinking. It must now be part of the team which helps shape the business re-engineering programme.' He adds: 'The IT director should be more pro-active. Senior executives are unable to think of their business and processes in terms of anything more than today's - and probably yesterday's - technologies, because they are not told how new technologies can make possible what has previously been impossible. 'Whose fault is this? If the buck does not stop with the IT director, it is hard to think where it should stop.' Business Re-engineering. Pounds 395.

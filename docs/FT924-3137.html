			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Rivals join forces to take over Spanish property company A BIDDING war for El Encinar de los Reyes, a medium-sized Spanish property group, ended yesterday when two rival bidders, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the large commercial bank, and the Olazabal family which controls El Encinar, agreed to join forces to take over the company. The groups said they planned to make a bid, worth Pta170bn (Dollars 1.5bn), offering Pta2,900 a share, for the whole of El Encinar. Mr Jaime Olazabal would become president and Mr Santiago Bergareche, president of Metrovacesa, BBV's property arm, would become deputy president. The fight for control of El Encinar, which owns a former US Air Force housing base outside Madrid, had split Madrid's investment community since October, when the Olazabals, who control 35 per cent of the target company, launched a formal takeover offer, at Pta2,500 a share, for a further 14 per cent. That would have given them control as El Encinar owns 3 per cent of its own equity as treasury stock. The BBV, which had built up a stake of 24.9 per cent of El Encinar earlier this year, countered with an unusual promise that it would improve on the Olazabal offer - if shareholders ignored it - after it had expired. It did not say how much it would pay, nor how much it would offer. The Olazabals increased their offer to Pta2,750 and complained to the courts that the BBV was flouting takeover rules by not bidding directly against it. Challenged to pronounce on the affair, the stock market commission said the BBV had acted correctly. That ruling has probably established a precedent for other takeover battles in Spain, but the affair has made the authorities uncomfortable and the commission will have been relieved at yesterday's decision to make a joint bid. El Encinar reported profits last year of Pta198m on assets worth Pta13.3bn. The buyers want to refurbish the former US base housing near Madrid, which has been paying low, controlled rents since the American forces first arrived in Spain in the late 1950s.</p>

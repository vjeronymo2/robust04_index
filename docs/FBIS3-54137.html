The continuing arms build-up among Arab countries, the spread  of Islamic fundamentalism, and an anticipated increase in  terrorist activity require Israel to maintain its strength and  alertness, says Shahaq.    The deputy chief of staff was speaking at a meeting this  morning with military reporters, where he reviewed the IDF's  plans for 1994. With more, reporter Alan Ben-'Ami:    Taking an overall look at Israel's strategic situation, the  IDF sees three positive trends in three major areas for concern.  On the plus side, the peace process continues, Israel's  international standing and relations with other countries are  getting better all the time, and the country's economic  situation is steadily improving. Against this, a wary eye needs  to be kept on the continuing arms build-up of Iran and Arab  countries, especially with regard to nonconventional weapons.  The spread of Islamic fundamentalism and the likelihood of  increased terrorist activity are dangers to be addressed.    For the time being, then, the IDF will keep both eyes open  and its powder dry. No significant changes will be made in its  order of battle this year, and all branches of the armed forces  will acquire sophisticated new weaponry and equipment. This  will include planes and helicopters for the Air Force,  antimissile systems for the Air Force and the Navy, the first of  the Saar 5 type missile boats which are now under construction,  and improved tanks, armored personnel carriers, and advanced  artillery guns and rocket launchers for the Army. The emphasis  will be to widen even further the all-weather and  around-the-clock fighting capabilities of all three branches.    In addition to the training programs and exercises for the  IDF's standing forces, training of reserve forces -- which has  been erratic in recent years due to budgetary restraints and  operational duties in the territories -- this would be stepped  up and put on a more even keel. At the same time, reservists  are likely to find themselves being called up for duty much  less, although those in combat units will continue to bear the  brunt of reserve service.    Antiterrorist activity and maintaining the security along  Israel's border with Lebanon will continue to play a major role  in the Army's day-to-day operations. Guerrilla and terrorist  operations by Palestinian and Lebanese groups doubled in  southern Lebanon last year, compared with 1992. There were 330  hostile acts of one sort or another, compared with 170 the  previous year, with Hizballah well ahead of other groups in  attacks of one sort or another against the IDF and the South  Lebanon Army. The forecast is for increased terrorist activity  in the year ahead, both from Lebanon and also in the territories.</p>

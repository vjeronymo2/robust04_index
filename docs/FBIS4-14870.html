			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from ITAR-TASS/EFIR-DAYDZHEST column under general </F> heading "In Brief"]    [Text] 2 Apr -- The DPRK has to all intents and purposes  made a negative assessment of Russia's proposal to apply a  multilateral approach in discussing the North Korean nuclear  problem. A representative of the Republic's Foreign Ministry,  answering questions today from a correspondent of KCNA, the  official North Korean news agency, pointed out that "we make a  positive assessment of the fact that Russia opposes sanctions  and pressure and intends to find a solution to the problem  around the political consultation table. But we are concerned  that Russia's proposal for multilateral negotiations may  complicate the problem."</p>

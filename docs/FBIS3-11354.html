			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Congress Permanent Commission summoned  today an extraordinary session period to begin on 22 March. The  commission plenum approved the motion with 26 votes in favor of  and two against. The sessions will be held to discuss electoral  reforms to the constitutional and penal codes.    The Popular Socialist Party [PPS] and the Cardenist Front  for  National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN] voted against the move.  PPS Deputy Cuauhtemoc Amezcua criticized the fact only specific  government officials and the Institutional Revolutionary Party  [PRI], National Action Party [PAN], and the Party of the  Democratic Revolution [PRD] participated in the negotiations  regarding the extraordinary debates. PFCRN Deputy Alberto  Carrillo said the people's participation in the Federal  Electoral Institute will only create a council of notables; it  will not guarantee or solve the electoral problems.    The summons states the special debates will begin on 22  March  but does not set an ending date. The document also establishes  only two issues will be discussed and approved: 1) reforms to  Article 41 of the Constitution, to allow greater citizen  participation in the electoral organizations; and 2) reforms to  the Penal Code to review the description of electoral crimes and  to increase punishment.    The proposal to reform the penal code, both for general  rights within the Federal District and federal rights for the  rest of the country, suggests adding 17 acts to the current list  of electoral crimes. This seeks to clearly and definitively  protect the right to vote freely and privately, the right to  participate in the political process, the authenticity of  electoral documents, and to prevent the illegal use of public  resources in favor of a specific political party or candidate.    Some of the more noteworthy acts to be listed as electoral  crimes are:    1. Requesting votes in exchange for payment, gratification,  or a promise of payment or gratification.    2. Those ministers of religious organizations who, during  acts of their ministry, influence their followers to vote for or  against a specific candidate or political party or to abstain  altogether, will be sentenced to 500 days in jail or an  equivalent fine.    3. Altering election results and removing or destroying  ballots or electoral documents.    4. Disseminating false information regarding the election  process or its results.    5. Forcing subordinate government employees to vote in  favor of a specific political party or candidate;    6. Conditioning the rendering of public services or the  completion of plans or projects in order to force voters to vote  for a specific political party or candidate.    7. For public officials to use government funds, assets,  or services assigned to them due to the nature of their position  to support a political party or candidate or to do so using  subordinate personnel during working hours, notwithstanding any  other penalties that could derive from charges of embezzlement;  those assets may include vehicles, buildings, and equipment, and  there will be no bail for those detained on such charges.    8. Altering voter registration lists and tally sheets or  issuing illegal voting credentials; such crimes shall be  punished with three to seven years in prison.    Legislators from all parties expressed their opinion during  the Permanent Congressional Commission's debate.</p>

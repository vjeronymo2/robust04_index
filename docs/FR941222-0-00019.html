			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> D.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know how the temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in the roof, side wall, and floor areas are incorporated into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily temperature measurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the first HSM to be emplaced, the user is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure the air inlet and air outlet temperature difference of the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at equilibrium. This measurement is to ensure that the heat capacity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system will not be exceeded and that the concrete temperature criteria will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be exceeded. For the Standardized NUHOMS, this maximum heat capacity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24 kW. The 24 kW heat load is the design maximum and is the basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal hydraulic calculations for the cask. The temperature distribution for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various parts of the HSM have been calculated (i.e., the roof, walls, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor) by the cask vendor. Temperature differences causing thermal stresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the concrete were evaluated and are duly reported in both the SAR and SER.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These calculations were reviewed by NRC as a part of the overall process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this design approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that daily temperature measurements are not necessary to ensure convective air flow, given the requirement to verify that the inlets and outlets are not obstructed. Site-specific NUHOMS require temperature measurements when the DSC is placed into the HSM, 24 hours later, and again at 1 week after loading to ensure adequate thermal performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC disagrees with this comment. The HSM and DSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are considered components important to safety in the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daily temperature measurements of the thermal performance by the licensee are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to provide additional assurance that thermal limits are not exceeded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the general license. This requirement was imposed on the first cask of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this type approved by the NRC and listed in 10 CFR 72.214 for use by a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee, the VSC&hyph;24 cask (58 FR 17967; April 7, 1994) and is now applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. A number of commenters expressed concern about emergency planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and response contingencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern that in the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of problems and the need to off-load fuel (as in the recent situation at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Palisades), a transfer cask may not be available in a timely manner because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclement weather or because the transfer cask itself has experienced problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or is being used elsewhere. One commenter expressed concern at having to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a transfer cask on site within 40 hours of vent blockage to prevent concrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage. If the transfer cask is leased from VECTRA and is not at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee's site, who is liable if something happens that would require the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a transfer cask?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC has analyzed all design basis accidents from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operation of an ISFSI and concluded that there will be no release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactive material to the environment. The 40-hour limit on vent blockage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is intended to prevent concrete degradation that might occur over a long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of storage. A vent blockage accident would not result in the release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of radioactive material because the DSC would not be breached. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC believes that the potential risk to the public health and safety is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely small during the time needed to obtain the use of a transfer cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, there is no requirement that a transfer cask be at an ISFSI site all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tornado winds and missiles during movement of the fuel in a transfer cask or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a storage cask on a transporter were not analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Both the vendor's SAR and NRC staff's SER address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of tornado winds and missiles during movement of the transfer cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a loaded canister. These analyses show that, for tornado winds, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a safety factor of 1.5 against overturning when subjected to Design Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tornado winds (a safety factor greater than 1 will generally be adequate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public protection). The transfer cask stability, tornado missile penetration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance, and shell and end plate stresses were calculated and shown to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the allowable stresses for ASME BPVC Service Level D (accident)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stresses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter described an October 1972 storm that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooded the entire Davis-Besse plant site, including the (pre-operational)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor building. There has been subsequent flooding of the site,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly during spring thaws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

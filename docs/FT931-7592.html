			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Spanish money market rates rise: Devaluation fears as pressure continues on the peseta in ERM SPANISH money market rates rose sharply yesterday amid continuing pressures on the peseta within the European exchange rate mechanism. The cost of borrowing Spanish pesetas for one month rose to around 20 per cent yesterday, amid fears on financial markets that the currency may be forced to devalue within the ERM. The Bank of Spain yesterday left its official money market intervention rate unchanged at 13 per cent, despite the rise in money market rates in the morning. Later in the day the bank was forced to provide daily funds to the market at an average rate of 15.32 per cent, compared with 14.61 per cent on Monday. Throughout yesterday the Bank of Spain defended the beleaguered peseta with aggressive purchases of the currency. The developments appeared to have gained a certain breathing space for the peseta which steadied yesterday at Pta72.50 to the D-Mark against a Monday close of Pta72.95. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, also came to the peseta's aid with a statement that pledged a 'rigorous observance' of the convergence criteria leading to economic and monetary union and discounted any temptation to abandon the European exchange rate mechanism. '(The peseta's) permanence in the European monetary system is beyond all doubt and so also is its discipline within the exchange rate and monetary policies,' Mr Gonzalez said. In what amounted to a fine balancing act, the bank was able to keep its benchmark money rate unchanged at yesterday's routine auction of certificates of deposit because the shortage of liquidity in the domestic system ensured punitive lending rates on the inter-bank market. One-day rates rose as high as 22 per cent and those for three-month Euro-pesetas were above 16 per cent. Some currency dealers had forecast the bank would raise its intervention rate back up to 13.25 per cent, where it stood earlier this month before the Bundesbank eased its interest rates, or even higher. Although the peseta, which has a 6 per cent fluctuation band within the ERM, remains well off its Pta77.28 to the D-Mark floor in the mechanism, the Bank of Spain appears determined to prevent any downward slide much beyond its Pta72.70 parity. Mr Gonzalez' stout defence of the ERM is in line with orthodox economic thinking in Spain that seeks to use the mechanism's constraints to wring as much inflation as possible out of the domestic economy. 'Exit from the ERM means stop and go, boom and bust,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de Negocios. Currency speculators, however, seem to be betting on the government's inability to resist mounting pressure to refire the economy following a recent string of depressing statistics that included an unemployment total of just over 3m, or 20 per cent of the labour force. The Madrid stock market index was down by more than 4 points yesterday to close at 227.92, a drop of nearly 2 per cent and one of its heaviest falls this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Gnam: "Benefiting From the EU Security </F> System as a Neutral State"]    [Text] Vienna -- In an interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG  yesterday Chancellor Vranitzky said that one cannot speak at all  of Austria's moving away from neutrality. Rather, it is  important that action be taken within the framework of a common  European Union [EU] security system against those who disrupt  peace, and it is there that a neutral state can join.    According to Vranitzky, there are many people, for whom  "little Austria had always been shaky" in the confusion reigning  during the period from World War I to the occupation.  Neutrality then gave the people "for the first time the chance  to breathe freely and say: We are free." According to  Vranitzky, this attitude is a "healthy, positive feeling toward  this state."    Regarding Austria's negotiations with the EU, "this  neutrality has not been called into question" in Brussels. Thus  it has been made clear that Austria, as a neutral state in the  EU, can participate in the establishment of a collective  security system in Europe. This security system, for its part,  envisages measures against those who disrupt peace, and neutral  state can be a part of that.    According to Vranitzky, a second referendum on neutrality as  mentioned by Foreign Minister Mock, who was a guest at the EU  party congress of the Greens, is not necessary. "Austrian Army  abolisher" Pilz, on the other hand, is hinting at a "plan to  abolish neutrality": Partial amputation now, final disposal of  the rest two years later.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney falls The gloom surrounding Euro Disney increased sharply as the theme park owner company warned that the third quarter would result in losses of about FFr500m and its fourth quarter would also be in loss. The warnings confirmed leisure analysts' worst fears, which had been sustained since the park's opening by a stream of negative official and independent figures. The shares retreated 108 to 675p. British Aerospace added 3 at 402p after announcing a Pounds 1.4bn five-year revolving credit facility to refinance its existing bank lines and to extend its debt maturity profile. One analyst said: 'This should facilitate the group's restructuring and put it in a stronger position.' A squeeze in Smiths Industries saw the shares gain 6 at 371p. Reports that engineering group Vickers was about to announce a 25 per cent increase in production of Rolls-Royce cars helped the shares rise 5 to 150p. VSEL jumped 36 to 866p after a single buyer bought around 150,000 shares at 860p. That done, the shares surrendered some of the earlier gains, finishing 29 up at 859p. Guinness reacted favourably to news from the G7 summit on lower whisky tariffs. Analysts said it could add Pounds 10m to the drinks group's operating profits. The shares moved up 4 to 470p. Food retailers continued under a cloud, with talk of more downgrades. Asda eased a halfpenny to 61 3/4 p and J. Sainsbury declined 9 to 447p. There was further good two-way business in Forte, the shares fading 4 at the close to 222p in turnover of 8.8m. A bear squeeze and switching from Dixons lifted Kingfisher 14 to 609p. Volume in British Gas jumped to 10m and the shares closed 3 1/2 cheaper at 291 1/2 p after the company said it had postponed plans to increase charges to Gas suppliers who use existing pipelines. The weakness in crude oil prices as dealers waited for the outcome of talks between the United Nations and Iraq unsettled several stocks in the sector. Enterprise Oil shed 6 to 457p and Shell Transport slipped 2 to 613p. Reuters suffered from pre-results nerves and receded 20 to 1388p ahead of its interims due on July 27. Investors warmed to the results from Peel Holdings, which also announced the conclusion of successful talks with its bankers. The shares moved ahead 23 to 233p. MEPC also stood out in a reasonably confident property sector, showing an increase of 15 to 426p on the back of its rights issue success. Sentiment switched from the recently favoured television stocks. NatWest's caution moved the price of Central Television down 28 to 2030p, and did the same for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, which tumbled 8 to 205p. Anglia TV declined 7 to 338p and Scottish TV lost 6 to 542p. A round of revived bid rumours resurfaced to focus attention on Pilkington and the glass group saw its share price add 3 1/2 at 130p in a turnover of 3.9m. But some analysts poured scorn on the credence of the rumours - which pop up at regular intervals in the market - and instead pointed a finger at interest from the US. American buyers are believed to be increasingly friendly towards the stock. Further optimism about the banking sector ahead of the interim reporting season inspired continued buying of bank shares. Lloyds, which reports at the end of this month, climbed 8 to 570p and Barclays edged 3 ahead to 491p, while National Westminster gained 5 1/2 at 493p. It was an optimistic view on talks between Hong Kong and China which brought renewed interest in HSBC and Standard Chartered. The former strengthened 10 1/2 to 665 1/2 p, while the latter advanced 11 to 789p. International mining group RTZ followed the market lower, closing a penny off at 681p, having been 7 ahead at the day's peak after a Smith New Court recommendation. International conglomerate Hanson remained in demand following its announcement at the end of last month that it is to acquire Quantum Chemical, of the US. The shares ended 3 higher at 230 3/4 p in sizeable volume of 19m. The stock was also busy in the traded options, where the equivalent of just over 4m shares were also dealt. Support was strong for wool group Sirdar, which appreciated 6 to 101p. Two way business in Rolls-Royce brought volume of 2m as the shares closed unchanged at 138p. Just before the market close, Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, said it had lowered the rating on the senior debt of Rolls-Royce Plc to A3 from A2 to reflect the weakness of the commercial and military jet engines market. A buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing boosted electrical engineering group GEC, the shares closing 3 firmer at 318p. The securities house said: 'The share price may have doubled over the last 18 months, but the shares are still attractive by reference to cash generation and the strong order book.'</p>

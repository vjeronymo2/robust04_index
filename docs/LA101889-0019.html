			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-CHOICE IS WINNING POLITICAL WAR;  </P> <P> ABORTION: VICTORIES IN CONGRESS, FLORIDA AND PUBLIC OPINION ADD TO THE TALLY.  AND CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS ARE LISTENING.  </P> <P> How quickly the abortion winds have shifted. Last July, the U.S. Supreme Court  approved state restrictions on abortion in a decision that left the landmark  Roe vs. Wade decision in tatters. Three months later, the pro-choice movement  achieved its most sweeping political victories in decades by defeating abortion  restrictions in Florida and reversing longstanding, rigid congressional limits  on publicly funded abortions.  </P> <P> Even though the White House has said that President Bush will veto the bill to  relax restrictions on funding abortions for poor women, its proponents were  heartened by the fact that that they had 50 more votes than last year.  </P> <P> In California, the same powerful forces are at work. When the Legislature  reconvenes in January, pro-choice legislators will likely defeat every bill to  restrict abortions.  </P> <P> Evidence of a massive political shift favoring abortion rights in California is  overwhelming. In a September special Assembly election, voters in conservative  San Diego and Riverside counties replaced the deceased author of California's  parental consent abortion law with a pro-choice Republican. At the same time,  Orange County's conservative Sen. John Seymour, who is seeking the Republican  nomination for lieutenant governor, switched his position on abortion to  pro-choice. So did Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia).  </P> <P> With these new votes, pro-choice is the majority view in both the Assembly and  state Senate. This means that next year, for the first time, our Legislature  will probably vote to fully fund abortions for poor women. Already this year,  the Assembly approved Medi-Cal funded abortions by a 39-32 vote; though the  Senate voted 21 to 19 against funding, the result will be reversed next year  when Seymour and Davis cast their ballots.  </P> <P> This dramatic political change is due in part to the awakening of the  pro-choice movement, which in the past took for granted the right to abortion  established in Roe vs. Wade. More significant, though, is that Americans do not  like government telling them what to do with their private lives.  </P> <P> Most people recognize that the decision whether to have a child is personal. It  ought to be a family decision; it is often a medical decision, and for most it  is a religious or moral decision -- but it is not a government decision. By  successfully and properly framing the debate as a question of a woman's choice,  abortion rights advocates have found a way to appeal to moderates and  conservatives who are uncomfortable with pro-abortion rhetoric. One need not be  pro-abortion to be pro-choice.  </P> <P> Despite this, California legislators opposed to abortion are certain to test  the post-Webster waters by introducing a variety of bills aimed at establishing  a waiting period before an abortion can be performed; requiring fetal viability  tests and imposing rigid standards on abortion clinics. If abortion opponents  do pursue such a strategy, however, they risk the same devastating defeat  suffered last week by their allies in Florida, where Gov. Bob Martinez, who  proposed similar abortion restrictions, has been so weakened that he could be  voted out of office next year.  </P> <P> The votes in Congress and the Florida Legislature mostly reflect the careful  reading by elected representatives of this shifting popular opinion. To some,  it might seem like opportunism. In reality, it is democracy in action. Of  course, many California legislators will cast their abortion votes, pro or con,  for moral reasons, regardless of their constituents' views. But a decisive  number will vote purely as representatives of the people who elected them.  </P> <P> One other factor favors the pro-choice position. In the past, some legislators  voted against state-funded abortions for the poor in the belief that the courts  would strike down such restrictions. They calculated that they could please the  anti-abortionists without having to live with the prospect of back-alley  illegal abortions for the poor. They can no longer absolutely count on the  courts to bail them out, though it is still unlikely that the California  Supreme Court will reverse its decisions establishing a right to abortion here.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court decision against womens' right to choose abortion may  end up strengthening abortion rights. Undoubtedly in many states the Webster  decision will have its intended effect. But in California, as last week in  Florida and in Congress, pro-choice advocates have never been stronger.  </P></p>

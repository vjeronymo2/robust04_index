			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / German 'personality' contest: Judy Dempsey reports on Sunday's two state elections in the east The outcome of Sunday's elections in the east German states of Brandenburg and Saxony will depend largely on the personalities of their prime ministers. Both Mr Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic prime minister of Brandenburg, the only SPD-led government in eastern Germany, and Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat prime minister of Saxony, the only eastern state with a CDU absolute majority, have tried to use the 'cult of personality' and local patriotism to secure re-election. But they have gone about it in different ways. Mr Stolpe, a 59-year-old Ossi, or easterner, was a senior member of the Evangelical Church during the former east German communist regime. Since unification he has been repeatedly accused of collaborating with the former Stasi, or secret police. The more the authorities and the west German media tried to prove the allegations, the more the Brandenburgers rallied around Mr Stolpe. 'Stolpe is one of us (easterners). We won't let the Wessis (westerners) destroy him,' say his supporters. However, after the election the SPD might be forced to choose between a coalition with the CDU, or the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the former east German communist party, because the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition partner, might not jump the 5 per cent hurdle required to enter parliament. Mr Stolpe could have played the 'communist threat' card to galvanise his support. But since he is an Ossi, he knows how Brandenburgers share a common past. 'He is afraid of sowing divisions because he knows how old unsettled scores could be revived,' said an aide. Mr Biedenkopf has chosen the opposite course. A prominent politician in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, the 64-year-old former law professor fell out with Mr Kohl and sought refuge in Saxony. But Konig (King) Kurt, as he is known, has used the CDU's absolute majority in Saxony's state parliament to introduce a government based on law and order and to polarise society. The police have powers to detain individuals for up to 14 days for suspicious behaviour, and bug private homes, while anyone with the slightest previous connection with the Stasi or the former Communist party has been sacked or banned from holding jobs in the public administration. More than 1,000 people have appealed - and won - costing the state DM30m (Pounds 12.3m) in legal expenses. But Mr Biedenkopf wants another absolute majority. By accusing the SPD and PDS of flirting, he has weakened the political middle ground. 'Saxony is now politically polarised between the CDU and the far-left,' said Mr Fritz Hahle, the CDU's leader. 'That's good for us. Indeed, this polarisation might be enough to get us back with the absolute majority.' But the PDS could, at the expense of the SDP, get about 15 per cent of the vote in Brandenburg and more than 20 per cent in Saxony. Such a result would enhance the party's status as 'king-maker' in the formation of the new governments. But it would also provide a litmus test for the federal elections which take place on October 16 and in which the PDS is expecting to enter the Bundestag.</p>

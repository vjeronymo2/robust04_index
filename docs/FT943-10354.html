			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Tick, tick, tick, tick them off: Should the world worry about the spread of nuclear weapons, ask Jimmy Burns and Bronwen Maddox Combating the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the most pressing tasks facing the world's diplomats. Talks due to resume in Geneva today are aimed at reducing one area of increasing tension - the nuclear capability and intentions of North Korea's reclusive communist regime. US officials will again try to persuade their North Korean counterparts to permit nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog. The episode raises a worrying question: how many other countries could be close to developing nuclear weapons? Concern about North Korea's intentions followed the agency's discovery after the 1990 Gulf war that Iraq had an extensive programme to develop nuclear weapons. Last month, German police uncovered a cache of weapons-grade plutonium in a garage, raising fears that nuclear material from the former Soviet Union was finding its way on to the black market. The extent to which various countries are capable of developing nuclear weapons will become more urgent next year when the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims to curb the spread of such weapons, is due to be reviewed. To date, 164 countries have signed the treaty, drawn up under the auspices of the UN after the second world war. It distinguishes between five countries that it permits to have nuclear weapons programmes - the US, China, the UK, France and Russia (formerly the Soviet Union) - and other signatories that have agreed not to develop such weapons. But can the treaty constrain the military ambitions of the non-nuclear signatories under its inspections regime? Western governments and the agency agree on which countries are closest to nuclear weapons capability. Heading the list of worries, along with North Korea, are India, Pakistan and Israel. The latter three, which have refused to sign the treaty, have long been suspected of possessing facilities to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and been regarded as de facto weapons states. According to estimates by Mr Harold Feiveson, a specialist in energy and proliferation issues at Princeton University in the US, Israel and India may have acquired 0.3 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium by the end of 1990, enough for 100 bombs each, and Pakistan 0.2 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium, enough for 10-15 bombs. It may be beyond the scope of next year's review to bring the trio into the treaty since India and Pakistan appear to regard its discrimination between nuclear and non-nuclear states as unacceptable. The review may, by contrast, have a better chance of addressing a second, longer-term concern: the technologically sophisticated Asian countries. This group, which includes Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, is developing large civil nuclear programmes, giving governments access to large quantities of nuclear material which could potentially be used for weapons. Japan's civil nuclear programme is extensive, with 46 nuclear power plants and seven more on the way. According to Professor Richard Wilson, a physicist at Harvard University: 'Japan can make a bomb at any time. The only disagreement is whether it could take two weeks or two years.' Japan is also likely to accumulate tonnes of surplus plutonium over the next decade, by reprocessing used fuel rods from the core of civil nuclear reactors. The government had intended to use the stocks as fuel for its new generation 'fast-breeder' reactors, which use plutonium rather than the traditional uranium, but has put development of the reactors on hold. Despite protests from the Japanese government that it has no intention of using plutonium for military purposes, other countries, particularly the US, have been concerned that the potential weapons capability represented by these stockpiles will lead to a dominant Japanese diplomatic influence in the region. Addressing Asia's military ambitions will be one of the toughest tasks facing next year's review. That task could be complicated by the outcome of the North Korea-US talks beginning today. If North Korea wins economic concessions from the US in return for accepting nuclear inspections, other countries may seek to use the same brinkmanship in the hope of gaining similar rewards. While concern about Asia appears to be growing as the region becomes more prosperous, there are nevertheless some grounds for optimism in other parts of the world: Under a deal in January negotiated by the US, the former Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have agreed to transfer the 3,100 warheads on their territory to Russia. This will help diminish the likelihood of trade in weapons-grade nuclear material, of the kind uncovered in Germany last month (see accompanying article). Moreover, the three republics have indicated that they will sign the treaty and not develop weapons. One note of caution needs to be sounded: Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's president, has given only a lukewarm acknowledgement of his predecessor's promise to sign the treaty, saying that he will 'study' the question. However, if the transfer of the weapons is completed, the chance of the republics being technologically capable of re-arming is slim. Mr Feiveson comments that the republics 'do not currently possess the means to produce weapons-usable material', as the Soviet facilities to manufacture nuclear weapons were based entirely in Russia. Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, which had developed or begun to develop nuclear weapons, have renounced the capability on economic and political grounds. In the Middle East, there is little sign that countries are pursuing nuclear programmes with any vigour. Mr David Kyd, spokesman at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Vienna headquarters, says: 'Surprisingly, perhaps, most Middle Eastern countries do not have a great deal of money to devote to (nuclear research).' The agency describes Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia, all signatories to the treaty, as having small research programmes that are essentially at the laboratory stage, many years and hundreds of millions of dollars away from weapons capability. Western intelligence experts are scrutinising Iran's procurement of foreign technology for signs of a weapons programme. But their suspicions that Iran has embarked on early stages of projects to enrich uranium with Pakistani and Chinese help have not been confirmed. Libya, also a signatory to the treaty, did start nuclear research in the mid-1980s, but its interest has waned, partly through lack of money. Many of the Russian scientists advising the country have gone home and the project lacks spare parts, according to agency inspectors. Algeria, alone in the Middle East, is pursuing nuclear research with determination. It has two civil reactors, one in the University of Algiers, and a second, larger, Chinese-built reactor near the Atlas mountains in the north. The agency monitors these facilities under a special arrangement, although Algeria has not signed the treaty. This picture is far from complete: North Korea and Iraq provide warnings that secretive regimes can keep nuclear programmes covert despite the best efforts of western intelligence agencies. However, it is possible to draw some conclusions. First, development of usable nuclear weapons has been limited to a tiny handful of countries beyond the five nuclear states of the non-proliferation treaty. Second, the technologically easiest and cheapest route to developing nuclear weapons is that employed by North Korea - using nuclear material from civil reactors - rather than that employed by Iraq - constructing elaborate, separate facilities. Given that this is the case, Asian enthusiasm for civil nuclear power may pose as much of a difficulty to curbing proliferation as the endeavours of countries such as North Korea and Iraq. The challenge for next year's treaty review is to devise a further inspection regime acceptable to nuclear and non-nuclear countries alike. This must reflect the changes in nuclear capability since the original treaty was drawn up, and reflect the aspirations of emerging nuclear states. North Korea's negotiations with the US made clear that dissatisfaction with the treaty's bargain between nuclear and non-nuclear countries is high. Finding a new pact which will curb the spread of such weapons remains a formidable challenge.  --------------------------------------------------------------- Military inventories  --------------------------------------------------------------- By the end of 1993              Weapon-grade uranium   Weapon-grade plutonium                   (tonnes)               (tonnes)  --------------------------------------------------------------- US                  550                    110 Russia        800-1,000                    130 France            10-20                      6 UK                   10                      3 China             12-21                1.8-4.8 Israel                -                    0.3 India                 -                    0.3 Pakistan            0.2                      - N Korea               -                   0.01?

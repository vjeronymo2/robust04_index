			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (4): Facilities cater to every type of traveller - London London's five international airports represent the entire spectrum of the genre, from the overcrowded to the virtually deserted, serving everyone from the besuited businesses traveller to the sombrero toting package holidaymaker. The number one, Heathrow, remains easily the busiest international airport in the world. A million passengers a week pass through its four terminals. It operator BAA admits that it is close to reaching a level that is uncomfortable for its users. The solution - a fifth terminal - will not be opened until 2002, and that is assuming permission is granted for a go ahead next year. But airlines continue to flock to Heathrow, with the likes of American Airlines and Cathay Pacific deserting other London airports in recent months in search of the lucrative business traveller. Inside the airport, facilities for business travellers continue to improve. The latest addition is a flight connections centre. London's second airport, Gatwick, still labours under an image of being a charter flight base, even though it is often much quicker to reach than Heathrow for central London-based travellers. It has just opened a business pavilion for first and business class travellers, and a transit lounge that claims to allow the quickest connections in Europe of about 30 minutes. BAA marketed London's third airport, Stansted, as a business airport from the start. But with just 3m passengers a year and a capacity of 15m, it has a long way to go before it reaches the critical mass which is needed to attract the frequency of flights to capital cities that business travellers demand. Number four, London City Airport, is this year finally able to say that it is a success story. Passenger levels are 75 per cent above their levels last year and it now served 10 destinations with its small aircraft operated by six airlines including Air France, Virgin and Dutch carrier VLM. Finally there is Luton Airport, which admits it will remain a holiday airport for many years to come. It is trying to boost its business traffic and to that end is concentrating on establishing a direct rail link to the City of London, the Thameslink, which also connects to Gatwick.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (8): Expansionist plans reassure the workers - Privatisation in action: Farhan Bokhari takes a look at National Fibres of Karachi A WIDE variety of industries and services are being offered for sale under the government's privatisation programme. Among the smallest and least profitable disposals are plants that make roti, a thin round traditional flour bread, and which had to be closed after making enormous losses. Larger candidates for disposal include plants whose products include cement, ghee (traditional edible oil extract used for cooking), motor vehicles and tractors. The common motive for selling them is to improve output in the public sector where the average industrial profitability has been only 1.5 to 2 per cent per annum. As the programme only began last year, it is too soon to compare the performance of these privatised companies with their previous record. Small units such as roti plants are to be broken up and sold only for their real estate value. But some larger factories have been bought by investors who are now preparing to expand them. One example of a profit-making company with prospects of growth is the Karachi-based National Fibres Ltd (NFL), 51 per cent of whose shares were sold in February. It makes polyester fibre and polyester filament yarn used for manufacturing cloth by local textile manufacturers. Last year, NFL declared pre-tax profit of Rs177m (Pounds 3.9m) , on total sales worth Rs888m. The pre-tax profit this year has not been announced but sales have touched Rs900m, says Mr Mohammad Jawaid Anwar, NFL's general manager. The company was sold to the new Schon group for Rs760m (Pounds 16m) after bids were received in an open competition. Schon group's other investments include an oil refinery, an air charter company, yarn spinning and stock trading. Under the terms of the sale, Schon paid 40 per cent of the dues up front, and the remaining 60 per cent are due to be paid over three years. More expansion is planned to meet demand. Over the next two years, the company plans almost to triple its capacity of polyester fibre from 12,000 tonnes a year to about 34,500 tonnes and filament yarn from 3,000 tonnes a year to 5,000 tonnes in the same time frame. A striking feature of the whole privatisation programme has been the unexpected lack of resistance from labour unions. NFL employs 900 workers and officers, in keeping with the government's condition that there should be no lay-offs in the first 12 months after purchase. A labour package agreed last year allowed for *something in here (HP) * compensation if personnel were asked to go within that period. The government also agreed to pay allowances to unemployed workers for up two years after their dismissal. As a result of NFL's expansion plans, however, the company would need to raise its workforce to 1,050 within the next two years, leaving little room for lay offs. Mr Anwar says: 'We will be able to absorb our workers in the expansion. We have not laid off anyone so far.' A new labour contract was signed in May, backdated to the beginning of the year. Under it, the company agreed to a 20 per cent average wage increase. However, Mr Anwar expects the expansion to push sales to between Rs2.5bn and Rs3bn after the company's expanded production capacity. That would not only raise profitability but finance a rise in wages.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese to control Italian fashion house ITOCHU and Coronet, two Japanese trading houses, are to take full control of Mila Schon, the Italian fashion house, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In 1988, Itochu and Coronet purchased 40 per cent of Mila Schon. The Italian company has asked the Japanese groups to buy more shares due to financial problems at Mila Schon, a spokesman said. The trading houses have set up a 50-50 joint investment company, MS Investment SRL, in Milan to purchase most of the outstanding shares in Mila Schon.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> YOUTH AID PROGRAMS FACE MONEY CUTOFF  </P> <P> In the first round of repercussions from the recently enacted 1990-91 state  budget, county supervisors today are expected to put five programs that serve  troubled children on notice that their contracts may soon be terminated.  </P> <P> "These community-based organizations may really take a hit," said Rod Speer,  information services representative for the county Probation Department.  </P> <P> "This is devastating."  </P> <P> The state budget, which was signed last week after a long battle in Sacramento,  cuts funding for the county Justice System Subvention Program by 49%, a  reduction of $2.5 million, county officials said. That has forced the Probation  Department to quickly identify areas that can be trimmed while still providing  state-mandated services such as providing lawyers for accused juvenile  offenders.  </P> <P> As a result, programs that shelter runaways, provide job counseling and  emergency services to former inmates and give advice to other struggling young  people could become the first victims of the budget ax this year.  </P> <P> "All the departments that are facing cuts are identifying the programs  affected," said Ronald Rubino, the county's administrative officer for  management and budget. "The process has already begun in a number of areas."  </P> <P> If private funding can be arranged or if any of the state funding is later  restored, a prospect that county officials consider unlikely, then some of the  programs could be reinstated. If not, their money will dry up in 30 days. JIM  NEWTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- Moscow is concerned about the  latest outbreak of military actions in the zone adjacent to the  Lebanese-Israeli frontier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said  here today.    He said that as a result of an Israeli aviation attack on a  Hizballah base, there were many Lebanese casualties, and the  territorial sovereignty of Lebanon had been violated. In turn,  areas in northern Israel were subjected to dangerous fire.    "These alarming events cast a shadow over the continuation  of  Arab-Israeli dialogue and reconfirm the need for stepping up the  comprehensive search for political solutions," the statement by  the repesentative of the Russian diplomatic department said.  "Only at the negotiating table can and should agreements be  reached guaranteeing both the restoration of the territorial  integrity of Lebanon and the mutual security of this state and  Israel, and guaranteeing that there is no dangerous escalation  of violence."    As co-sponsor of the Near East peace process, Russia calls  upon all sides "to display maximum restraint and common sense  and to be guided in their actions by the long-term interests of  establishing a stable and just peace in the region."</p>

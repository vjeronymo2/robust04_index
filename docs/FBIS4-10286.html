			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 Apr (DPA) -- A leader of the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) was killed yesterday by a  rancher in Altamirano municipality, Chiapas State, the EZLN  Clandestine Revolutionary Committee reported today.    In a statement published by the EXCELSIOR News Agency,  guerrilla spokesman Subcommander Marcos said this action  contradicts the alleged climate of peace to which Manuel Camacho  Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, has  referred. Nevertheless, the cease-fire will be maintained.    According to the statement, the EZLN leader went with a  companion to see a parcel of land to farm. When they arrived at  the site, they were met with shots fired by the ranch owner's  son. The leader's companion was wounded.</p>

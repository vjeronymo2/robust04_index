			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of narrowing output gap Sir, Samuel Brittan ('The enigma of the UK output gap', February 14) writes that 'whatever the output gap, it is narrowing smartly . . .we know this from the combination of the unexpectedly sharp fall in unemployment and other labour market indicators, and from business survey evidence'. But the fall in unemployment has occurred because of a large increase in the number of part-time jobs (up 190,000), and in the self-employed (up 79,000, and some of these may be part-timers). The number of full-time employees has continued to shrink (down 95,000). So the total number of hours of labour services being used by the economy certainly hasn't risen much during the recovery, and may well have continued to fall. (All data refer to the period from March 1993, roughly when unemployment started to fall, up to September, the latest available). This is not evidence of a narrowing output gap. Instead, it is evidence that the market is re-distributing a roughly unchanged amount of work around a larger number of people. Labour market reforms over the past few years have probably helped achieve this. Examples include the cut in the starting rates of National Insurance contributions, and (during 1993) the abolition of the minimum wage imposed by residual wages councils. On this interpretation, the unemployment figures over-stated slack in the labour market a year ago, because there was an inappropriate mix of full- and part-time jobs. It is not the amount of slack that has fallen over the past year, but the the degree of overstatement. There is a clear message here for the government: beware of saving cash by extending means-testing of medical and social security benefits. Means tests act like very high marginal tax rates on low-income earners, and the more they are imposed, the more damage is done to the reforms of the past decade which are finally showing their worth in today's decline in unemployment.

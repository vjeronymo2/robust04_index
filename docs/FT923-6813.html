			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup scores sharp recovery DAWSONGROUP, the Milton Keynes-based commercial vehicle hire and distribution concern, reported a sharp turnround into profits at the interim stage.

Mr Peter Dawson, chairman, said truck sales and contract hire remained depressed but demand for short-term rentals was reasonably strong. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 22m (Pounds 21.5m). After tax estimated at 15 per cent, earnings per share emerged at 4.5p (losses of 0.5p). An interim dividend of 0.75p (nil) is declared.</p>

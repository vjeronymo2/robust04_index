			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 11 Jan -- The first of two trains with  reinforcements for the personnel and combat hardware of the  Russian "blue berets" battalion deployed in Serbian Krajina  arrived today at the railway station of the town of Subotica.  After the unloading of the hardware the detachment of Russian  paratroops will go to the site of their deployment -- the  "Klisa" airfield near Osijek.    In the next few days the 900 soldiers and officers of the  "Rusbat," which is guarding a 100-km stretch of the line  separating the Serbs and Croats, will be reinforced by more than  300 extra Russian "blue berets." In addition to this  reinforcement of personnel the battalion will have at its  disposal several new armored carriers, anti-tank weapons and  grenade launchers. The command calculates that this  reinforcement will make it possible to lower the excessive load  on the personnel who are manning 32 check- points around the  clock. Meanwhile, the additional combat hardware will help to  enhance the security of the Russian paratroops and forestall  possible provocations and attacks. Incidentally, the Belgian  battalion deployed in the same sector has already been equipped  with the same types of weapons, while some national contingents  of the UN forces even have tanks.    The situation in the zone for which the Russian battalion is  responsible has become substantially more stable in recent  months. This is explained not only by a certain easing of  Serb-Croat relations but also by the skillful execution of their  duties by the Russian soldiers and officers, constant contacts  with the opposing sides, and efforts to prevent incidents.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Venezuela tries to save Banco Latino Venezuelan president, Mr Ramon Velasquez, was meeting yesterday with the country's monetary authorities in an effort to save Banco Latino, the country's second largest commercial bank, which closed its doors after suffering serious financial problems. National Guardsmen were posted outside Banco Latino's headquarters in Caracas yesterday and the bank, with branches nationwide, was closed. There was no indication when it might re-open. The government is viewed by financial experts as trying to avoid direct intervention, which could prove expensive, and has urged other banks to provide assistance to Banco Latino. Its board said it had suffered 'a criminal rumour campaign' over the past three months that caused the loss of over Dollars 500m in deposits. The Venezuelan banking system was calm yesterday but prices of Venezuelan government bonds in the international markets fell as much as 4 per cent before recovering slightly. The Minister of Finance, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, said that the authorities had to determine whether Banco Latino's problem was 'illiquidity or insolvency'. Banco Latino, which over the past year offered among the country's highest interest rates on deposits, began suffering from a severe liquidity crunch last month, and received large sums in rediscounts and advances from the Central Bank. Despite this, on Thursday, the bank could not meet its obligations in the national cheque clearing system.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- [passage ommited]    The German minister [German Economy Minister Gunter  Rexrodt],  who has been on an official visit here since last Thursday,  asserted that placing limits on exports will only lead to  bilateralism, which runs against multinational agreements. He  explained that such a decision "would violate GATT and would  conflict with the interests of the world's large exporting  nations."    Rexrodt said his country's investments in Mexico will  increase if Mexico signs an agreement for reciprocal promotion  and protection of investments. In 1993, 31 percent of Mexico's  exports to Europe went to Germany and, in turn, Germany became  Mexico's foremost commercial partner in the region.    After meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello  Macias, Rexrodt explained that Germany has given Mexico priority  status in its relations with Latin America. An example of this,  he said, is the "Technogerma Mexico 1994" industrial fair, which  was inaugurated by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  on Monday.</p>

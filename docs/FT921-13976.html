			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: New funding regime hits disadvantaged Sir, We are deeply disturbed at the expected collapse of Apex Trust ('Apex to apply for an administrator', January 17) and the previous fall of Fullemploy. These are charities doing very important work with disadvantaged groups who will suffer from their demise. The collapse highlights the continuing funding pressures on charities and voluntary organisations providing support and training. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has warned the government consistently over the past 18 months that training for special needs is being undermined with the new funding regime used by Training and Enterprise Councils. The two examples are not by any means unique. Indeed, the majority of organisations for people with special needs are under similar pressures. A recent report by NCVO - Making training accessible: meeting special training needs - highlighted the need for greater financial incentives by the government. To date insufficient action has been taken. NCVO has called on the government to protect funds for training people with special needs. This is the only feasible way to secure provision for the most disadvantaged groups of the unemployed. We will also be seeking an urgent meeting with the Home Office to discuss its role in securing the stability in core funding. Judy Weleminsky, director, NCVO, 26 Bedford Square, London WC1B 3HU</p>

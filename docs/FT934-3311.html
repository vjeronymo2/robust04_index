			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Barbarians waiting at the gate: The importance of the Paramount case The Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications could be decided in a hearing which opens today in the Delaware Supreme Court. Just as important is the precedent the ruling will set for other US bids. The case is the most significant since the landmark Time-Warner judgment four years ago. At its heart is a controversial issue: what are a board's obligations to shareholders during a takeover battle? In particular, what right does it have to ignore or obstruct a hostile offer in favour of a lower priced friendly takeover, which directors maintain is better for the company long-term? US boards have been allowed by law to build up a panoply of defensive mechanisms to frustrate bids. This is in contrast with the UK, where takeovers are fought on an essentially level playing field with shareholders holding the whip hand. The Delaware Supreme Court will consider Paramount's appeal against a recent judgment by the state's chancery court. Judge Jack Jacobs blocked the proposed Dollars 9.5bn friendly takeover of Paramount by Viacom - the cable television company - on the grounds that Paramount's board had not adequately considered a higher hostile offer from QVC Network, a television home shopping group. He also threw out a special 'lock-up' agreement under which Paramount gave Viacom the right to buy its shares at Dollars 69.14 each - the price of the original takeover agreement - if the company were sold to a higher bidder. He said the lock-ups, worth some Dollars 400m, were unprecedented and would discourage other bidders. If the Supreme Court upholds the chancery court's judgment, victory in the Paramount battle will go to the highest bidder. If it accepts Paramount's appeal, QVC will probably be forced to bow out, leaving Viacom the victor. Whatever the ruling, it will affect US takeover conduct which is largely determined by legal precedents set in the courts of Delaware. The tiny state has set itself up as a congenial home for business and many leading companies are incorporated there. A legal touchstone for a board's duties in a takeover battle is the Delaware Supreme Court's 1985 judgment in the contest for cosmetics group Revlon. The court said that when it became clear to Revlon's board that the company was going to be sold, 'the directors' role changed from defenders of the corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for stockholders'. In 1989, however, the court upheld the right of the board of Time Inc, the publishing group, to reject a hostile offer from Paramount in favour of a lower priced friendly one from Warner Brothers. The reasoning was that it was the 'business judgment' of Time's directors that a merger with Warner would be in the company's long-term strategic interests. 'Directors are not obliged to abandon a deliberately conceived corporate plan for short-term shareholder profits unless there is clearly no basis to sustain the corporate strategy,' the court said. That ruling, which surprised much of the legal profession, gave corporate boards a powerful weapon against hostile bids, and it contributed to the demise of the takeover wave of the 1980s. The Paramount case, the first big US takeover battle for several years, provides Delaware with the opportunity to cast a fresh eye over its Time-Warner ruling. If Judge Jacobs' decision is upheld, it will limit the scope of the 1989 verdict and put a degree of power in shareholders' hands. He ruled that Paramount's deal with Viacom triggered 'Revlon duties' to put the company up for auction. By failing to give proper consideration to QVC's offer, the Paramount board had breached its obligations to investors. Why is Paramount's position different from Time's? According to Judge Jacobs, because the takeover involves not a merger but the sale of Paramount. Control of the group will pass to Mr Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, who owns 85 per cent of his company's voting stock. The deal therefore represents the last chance for shareholders to obtain a premium for control. Paramount will argue that if the judgment stands, a company with a controlling stockholder like Mr Redstone can never enter a strategic merger with a publicly controlled company - except through an auction based on short-term stock market valuations. The new ruling, it argues, also 'eviscerates the business judgment of directors' and discourages boards from developing strategic plans. Critics of Delaware's Time-Warner judgment argue that the takeover rules should always allow investors to sell their shares to the highest bidder. The more cynical maintain that part of the motivation was Delaware's desire to keep the chairmen of American companies sweet. The court faces a delicate balancing act in the Paramount case. On the one hand, it will not want to antagonise boards and undermine its credibility by stepping back from the Time-Warner ruling. On the other, it will be aware that corporate power is shifting from boards to aggressive institutional investors, who abominate anti-takeover devices and are still smarting from the Time-Warner case.</p>

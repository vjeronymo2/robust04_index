			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kola nickel clean-up plans revived A Dollars 640M project to renovate one of the world's biggest polluters, the Pechenga nickel smelter on the Kola peninsula, which was aborted in March because of Russia's financial problems, has been resurrected. Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group that is acting as technical manager of the proposed project, has reinstated its tender - Dollars 600m for smelter renovation and Dollars 40m for infrastructure work - and set a new end-October deadline for acceptance. Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some of it falls on the nearby town of Nickel, near the Finnish border, but the prevailing winds take two- thirds of it across Finland and Norway where the acid rain caused has done severe damage to forests. If the project goes ahead, it would cut sulphur dioxide emissions to only 15,800 tonnes and enable Russia to meet the undertaking (first given by the government of the Soviet Union) to cut emissions from in the Finnish border area by half. Equally important, from Russia's point of view, the project would provide the Norilsk nickel group, one of the country's most reliable and successful exporters, with a new smelter. Western observers suggest that the present Pechenga smelter, originally established in the 1930s and renovated in the 1940s, has only a few years of life left in it. Pechenga produces about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an intermediate material), which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining. At first the pollution abatement scheme was to have cost more than Dollars 1bn and included Montshegorsk but this proved to be economically impossible because of transport problems. The Finnish and Norwegian governments have promised environmental grants of up to Dollars 100m towards the project and they, together with Sweden, have said they would provide loans for the rest of the required investment. If Russia remains short of foreign currency, Outokumpu would be willing to take up to Dollars 100m of metal a year and would help repay the banks. The Norilsk group, which owns the Pechenga smelter and is the world's biggest nickel producer, is still hoping to win exemption from the Russian government from the requirement for most of its foreign earnings to be handed over and converted into roubles. Outokumpu let its tender lapse in March but has now reinstated it following a recent decree by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, which also set an October target for agreement on the Pechenga project. The Russian government has set up a special finance group to meet Nordic government representatives to thrash out financial details. The Nordic working group includes representatives from the export guarantee institutions of Finland, Norway and Sweden and the Nordic Investment Bank. Export credit would be tied to deliveries from each country. If the project goes ahead, Finland will provide about half the equipment including about 20 per cent from Outokumpu alone (a flash smelter based on Outokumpu technology and a sulphuric acid plant); 25 per cent from Norway (Elkem is responsible for the slag cleaning plant); and 10 per cent from Sweden. Outokumpu says that, if its tender is accepted by October, final agreement should be reached in mid-1993. There is a very tight three-year construction schedule. When the scheme was first mooted the new smelter was to have started up in 1995. Outokumpu has spent between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m so far on the project but if negotiations finally collapse the Finnish government will repay half the cost.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD POSTPONES DECISION ON SPRING  SPORTS  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified school board members have postponed a decision  on whether to cancel competitive spring sports at the district's three high  schools.  </P> <P> Board members, searching for ways to shore up a shrinking budget reserve, told  the district's staff this week to meet with boosters to see if they could raise  $23,000 to help defray the costs of the sports.  </P> <P> But, the board said, even if the money is raised it still may cancel the sports  if the district experiences any major revenue declines in coming weeks. The  board is scheduled to vote on the matter in early December.  </P> <P> The possibility that spring sports could be cut arose after board members  requested further cuts in the district's $33-million budget to boost a  projected 1.6% reserve, which board members consider insufficient. Cutting  sports would save an estimated $85,000, enough to increase the reserve to 2%.  </P></p>

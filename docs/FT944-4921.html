			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Pakhoed buys 66% of Lambert Riviere Pakhoed, the Dutch oil and chemical storage group, is to buy 66 per cent of Lambert Riviere, a French chemicals distributor. It plans to launch a public offer for the remaining shares in early 1995. The Dutch company said the Halliez family of France had agreed to sell its 66 per cent stake in the company at FFr470 per share. Pakhoed's public offer in France, scheduled to take place after the family sale is completed in January, will be made at the same price per share. If all the shares are tendered, the acquisition will cost Pakhoed about FFr408m (Dollars 75m). Lambert Riviere, with annual turnover of more than FFr1.6bn, is active in chemicals distribution in Italy, Spain and Portugal as well as in France. The agreement marks Pakhoed's second attempt to acquire the company. Earlier this year, it tried to take over Lambert Riviere through a joint venture with Univar Corp of the US. After the attempt failed, Pakhoed sold its 49 per cent stake in the joint venture, Univar Europe, back to Univar. However, Pakhoed retains a 28 per cent stake in Univar itself.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better value for money for water company customers Sir, The suggestion by Joe Rogaly ('Hosing us for all we've got', July 12) that most of the money from water price increases since privatisation has been distributed in dividends is ludicrous. Just as ludicrous is the National Consumer Council's claim in its recent report on water prices that water companies have increased dividends to shareholders by an average 63 per cent a year. The dividends of the ten major water and sewerage companies increased from Pounds 338m (equivalent) in 1989-90 to Pounds 478m in 1992-93. So the average increase was about 12 per cent a year, or 7 per cent after allowing for inflation. Water prices in the UK have risen in recent years for two reasons and two reasons only. First, because of the demands on the water companies to invest in quality and environmental standards set mainly by European Union directives. Second, because of decades of under-investment when water was in the public sector. Neither Joe Rogaly nor the NCC mentions that to meet these standards the water industry is investing twice as much each year as it makes in profits. Or that two-thirds of these profits are consistently used to fund part of this capital investment programme. If this were not so, water prices would be going down in real terms, like those for other utility services. Ten years ago the average household bill for water and sewerage was about Pounds 77. Today it is Pounds 199, an increase of about 160 per cent. Ten years ago Pounds 737m was invested in water and sewerage. Last year it was around Pounds 3bn, an increase of about 310 per cent. Is this or is this not better value for money for water customers? Janet Langdon, director, Water Services Association of England and Wales, 1 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9BT</p>

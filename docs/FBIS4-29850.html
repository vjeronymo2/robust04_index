			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Kwak No-pil] </F>   [Text] Business circles have begun a review of the  long-term prospect for "the situation after the summit talks,"  while expressing their welcome to the possibility that the idea  of imposing economic sanctions against the North has gone far  away because of the movements to push for the South-North summit  talks.    This notwithstanding, while viewing that it is difficult to  find a breakthrough in South-North economic cooperation for the  time being, the business circles seem to take a wait-and-see  attitude for the present as before. This is because of the  prevailing view that a hasty reaction is a taboo under the  circumstances in which a change might occur in the South-North  Korean relations at any time as have been thus far.    But, on the basis of their judgment that nothing will go  amiss in conducting the trade based on the  processing-on-commission or an indirect trade through third  countries with North Korea, which have been planned to be  realized this year, the business circles have decided to study  again their plan to conduct trade with North Korea, which they  have decided to put into action for the time being. In  particular, Lucky Goldstar, Samsung, and Daewoo Groups, which  have been more active than any other enterprise in the  South-North economic cooperation, have already begun studying  the possibility of investing in North Korea after the summit  talks are realized, while viewing that there is a higher  possibility than ever before that the South-North summit talks  will be realized.    Lucky Goldstar Group, which has engaged in more trade with  North Korea than any other business group in the country, has  decided to resume its trade based on the  processing-on-commission with North Korea at an early date,  which it has so far held back. The group will push for trade  based on the processing on commission worth $3.5 million, as it  already planned at the beginning of the year. It will ship raw  and subsidiary materials worth $200,000, for whose permission it  applied to the government on 11 June.    Chang Kyong-hwan, manager of the North Korea Team of Lucky  Goldstar Corporation stated: "While its wage level is very low,  North Korea's level of sewing and simple assembling technique is  considerably high. The trade based on the  processing-on-commission is very profitable from the viewpoint  of an enterprise."    Samsung Group has taken a big interest in investing in North  Korea's social overhead capital-related facilities, such as  repairing and expanding of the facilities at Chongjin Port. The  group is going to indirectly help North Korea solve the shortage  of consumer goods by building electronics appliances, sweaters,  and food stuff factories if circumstances permit, while actively  utilizing this as an opportunity to advance into the North.    Daewoo Group has a mind to push afresh for the construction  of the Nampo Estate--whose idea was discussed when its chairman  Kim U-chung visited North Korea--thereby reaching an  advantageous ground in an advance into the North ahead of any  other business group.    The group is going to push for the development of a zinc  mine-- which occupies the largest portion in the items imported  by the businesses from North Korea--and a joint fishery project  at the same time.    A project to develop Mt. Kumgang, on which an agreement was  reached when Chong Chu-yong, honorary chairman of Hyundai Group,  visited North Korea in 1989, has remained in the doldrums as a  result that the South-North relations have become tense. But,  on the basis of its judgment that in case the South-North summit  talks come true, there is the high possibility that such a  project will be discussed in earnest, the group has begun  reexamining the idea of pushing for the project. Hyundai has  been reported to prepare a foothold for its transactions with  North Korea through small-scale investments, including the  building of a cotton textile plant.    Other business groups have also begun reexamining their  investment plans which they have delayed putting into force.  Sunkyung Group has been interested in establishing sewing and  fishery product processing plants; Ssangyong Group in  establishing joint-venture footwear, and fishery product  processing plants; Kolon Group in a dye processing works; and  Kumho Group in building a tire plant.    One official concerned of the Federation of Korean  Industries  said: "Because the South-North economic cooperation issue has so  far been too politically subjected to political issues, it has  been difficult to push ahead with such projects on a consistent  basis. The almost prevailing view of the working-level employees  of the business groups is that it is necessary to push for  economic cooperation--aside from political questions--so that we  may not be outmaneuvered by Japan in terms of an advance into  the North."</p>

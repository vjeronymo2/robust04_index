			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Lloyd's reporting seeks computer age rationale IN MEDIAEVAL times, a merchant's ship might not return to its home port after a long voyage for three years. That, it is said, explains the unusual practice at Lloyd's of London today of using three-year accounts. Some critics suggest it is about time the procedure was changed to reflect standard twentieth-century corporate reporting. While the great majority of British companies - and their counterparts overseas - have to produce accounts every year, Lloyd's publishes its results after a time lag of three years. In June, for example, Lloyd's will present the results of the 400 or so insurance syndicates which were trading on the market in 1989. 'It's quite an unusual way of accounting,' concedes Mr Mervyn Ellis, a partner with Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, who specialises in work with Lloyd's. 'There is nothing magical about three years. But it's a typical British compromise.' Three-year accounting creates a number of difficulties for Lloyd's, especially when - as at present - it is reporting losses. Last year the market reported a deficit of Pounds 510m for its 1988 year but the market's leaders were not aware of the scale of the problems until early in 1991 and Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting syndicates - were ill-prepared for the shock when Lloyd's reported the loss last summer. At a meeting of Names in June, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle and a Name since 1980, said that the failure to anticipate the size of its losses early enough would have been a 'recipe for disaster for an industrial company'. To outsiders, the episode illustrates the quirkiness of Lloyd's and reinforces the case for reform. Certainly opinion among the insurance market's business leaders appears to be tilting decisively in favour of change. The Lloyd's task force, a group of 14 underwriters, brokers and academics, advised by McKinsey, the management consultants, conducted an examination of the market's business structure last year on behalf of the Lloyd's Council. It found widespread support for a move to a one-year system. About 69 per cent of the businesses consulted by the task force favoured a move to one-year accounting. Nevertheless, in its 240-page report Lloyd's: a route forward, published last month, the task force report recommended retention of the existing system. The conclusion was particularly surprising in view of the task force's rejection of an argument frequently put forward by advocates of three-year accounting at Lloyd's: that it is difficult to account for some classes of liability insurances, including potential legal actions and awards on a one-year basis. The task force argued that these accounts - representing so-called 'long-tail' business in which claims often emerge many years after the inception of the policy - develop over such a long period that only a substantial extension of the accounting period beyond the existing three years would greatly improve matters. Mr David Rowland, the chairman of brokers Sedgwick, who also chaired the task force, says: 'We started off with an extremely open mind. But we found the simplistic statement that insurance companies use one-year accounting and Lloyd's does not is untrue. When we looked at insurance companies, we found that many of the specialist accounts have three-year reporting.' Mr Michael Wade, from Holman Wade, another broker who served on the task force, says the group was surprised to find how many insurance companies also account for their results on periods longer than one year. One-, two- and three-year accounting are all accepted under a statement of practice issued by the Association of British Insurers. Although companies specialising in common or garden insurance such as motor and householders account for their results annually, companies on the London insurance market do operate on a two- or three-year basis. That includes nine out of ten companies specialising in marine, aviation and transport insurance, and all companies specialising in reinsurance. It might be argued that the difficulties on long-tail business should extend the accounting period in the other direction, towards perhaps five- or ten-year periods. Mr Matthew Patient, an accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte who served on the task force, concedes that there is still potential uncertainty. He stresses: 'It must come to a point where you are unreasonably holding back from Names information that you can establish.' The task force report cites other reasons for retaining the existing system, which reflect Lloyd's unusual business structure. Syndicates - which actually conduct underwriting - are a form of annual joint-venture between Names. They are formally wound up at the end of the accounting period, closing their accounts and paying a reinsurance premium into a successive year of account to cover any outstanding liabilities. When underwriters set the size of this premium for the so-called reinsurance-to-close, they need to ensure that Names on successive years of account are fairly treated. This calculation means that Lloyd's underwriters require more accurate details of how their insurance results are reported than their counterparts working for insurance companies. 'The unique thing about Lloyd's is that there is a full payout after the accounting period,' says Mr Patient. 'If you get it wrong, you get it totally wrong.' In comparison, he says, there is an equalisation of any such longer term changes to the accounts in a conventional insurance company, which can spread any losses more evenly among its shareholders, most of whom remain relatively unchanged year by year. The task force also says that a three-year accounting system will tend to encourage Names to take a long-term view about their investments in Lloyd's, which will improve the long-term stability of the market's capital base. On the other hand, it recognises that given the time lag inherent in three-year reporting, it needs to improve the quality of its forecasting and provisional results. As a result, it does call for two changes to current accounting practice. Syndicates should publish their solvency position and an indicative profit forecast after 24 months; and the corporation should publish a global profit forecast for the market as a whole after 24 months. Both proposals may need the scrutiny of auditors. A recent row between Lloyd's and Chatset, the independent company which monitors the performance of Lloyd's syndicates, has underlined the deficiencies of existing reporting practices only too well. Although Lloyd's accepts that its losses in 1989 will be more than Pounds 1bn and the worst in its 300-year history, there is considerable uncertainty still about the outcome for 1990 and 1991. Chatset, which made its forecasts on the basis of quarterly claims settlement figures, reckons that Lloyd's will make heavy losses in both years, but its figures have been widely condemned on the market and labelled 'alarmist' by the Lloyd's chairman Mr David Coleridge. If the recommendations are implemented, the official information provided may at least offer a rationale for three-year accounting more in line with the age of computers than the age of sail.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / LIG to raise Pounds 115m with rescue issue London International Group yesterday revealed the terms of a Pounds 115.2m rescue rights issue intended to restore the group's balance sheet and enable it to concentrate on its core condom and surgical gloves activities. LIG also reported a net loss of Pounds 173.7m for the year to March 31, including a Pounds 91.4m loss on the sale of LIG's ColourCare International photo-processing division to management for a nominal sum. Mr Nick Hodges, chief executive, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that if we had not disposed of this business it would have disposed of LIG.' The rights, a one-for-one issue, was needed to reduce debt of Pounds 168.3m at the year end, and to plug the Pounds 10.7m net asset deficit caused by the loss. The shares fell 8 1/2 p to 90 1/2 p on the news, which compares with the issue price of 70p. Mr Hodges said the group's aim was to rebuild shareholder value and 'show that the company is different'. There was a new management team in place; factory closures had been implemented, more were planned and production would shift to lower-cost, more highly automated plants in the Far East; and new marketing ideas were being pursued such as the use of the Durex brand throughout the world. Mr James Tyrrell, finance director, said the group aimed to increase operating margins on its remaining health and personal products activities to 15 per cent, although this might take until 1997 to achieve. Other targets included gearing falling to 50-70 per cent and dividend cover of 2-2 1/2 times, although LIG is currently precluded from paying dividends. It is due to go to the High Court this month for approval of a reorganisation of its reserves so that it can pay dividends again, although Mr Hodges could not say when they might resume. Mr Tyrrell said gearing would still be high, at an indicated 78.6 per cent, after the rights issue. Last month the group announced the sale of its UK cough mixture brands for Pounds 11m and its plans further disposals of non-core health and beauty brands. As well as the rights, the group has arranged a new Pounds 114.5m loan facility with five banks, conditional on the rights issue and the sale of ColourCare. Other lenders would be repaid from the rights proceeds, Mr Tyrrell said. The issue was underwritten by SG Warburg, and some shareholders have already promised to take up 19.46 per cent of the rights.

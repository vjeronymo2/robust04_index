			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Record HK property deal WORLD GROUP, the Hong Kong corporate empire of the late Sir Yue-kong Pao, yesterday paid a record HKDollars 3.53bn (USDollars 458m) for a large property development site on the Kowloon Peninsula in an auction held by the Hong Kong government. World won the bid for the 1.7m sq ft site in Diamond Hill in the face of competition from all of the colony's leading property developers, including Cheung Kong, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai Properties. The deal is to be shared evenly between three of World's listed companies  - World International, Wharf Holdings, and Hong Kong Realty and Trust. Mr John Hung, director of Wharf, said the group would 'create the only mega purpose-built retail centre under one roof in that region'. It plans to build retail and residential property on the site.</p>

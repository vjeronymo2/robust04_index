			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Major moves to rescue Gatt MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday put forward proposals to break the logjam of the stalled round of trade liberalisation talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. During a day of intensive discussions on the future of the Uruguay Round at the economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Major made what British officials described as a forceful intervention in the opening session. His officials refused to give further details but Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, later disclosed that the UK prime minister had brought forward proposals which he expected to be discussed later in the summit. The proposals are thought to include an extension of the period for reduction of farm subsidies. Mr Major's decision to bring the Uruguay Round to the heart of the summit involves a high-risk strategy that reflects the British government's determination to find a settlement, and to put Britain's stamp on the EC presidency. Even before Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, had completed the ceremonial welcome of the leaders of the US, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Commission, the Gatt talks were a subject of intense discussion. The issue was raised amid concern about the lacklustre growth of the world economy and rising unemployment. Mr Mazankowski noted that unemployment in the Group of Seven countries had risen to 22.9m this year from 18m in 1990. Finance ministers meeting separately agreed that the only way forward was to curb excessive budget deficits and strive for stable non-inflationary growth. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, confirmed that Britain would take an especially tough line on government spending in the current expenditure round. He pledged again to take sterling into the narrow bands of the European exchange rate mechanism at the current DM2.95 central rate as part of the British government's continuing fight against inflation. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, conceded that US growth in the second quarter of this year would not match expectations but that expansion of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent over the full year was attainable. He also predicted 'banner years' for the economy in 1993-94 if the commitment to growth to be undertaken at this summit is fulfilled. In a summit where all the nations are intent on maintaining their own economic policies, the leaders and their finance ministers underlined that a satisfactory solution to the trade talks could be an important spur to world growth. According to British officials, a success in the Gatt talks would add between 1 per cent and 2 per cent to world gross national product. Mr Major cited calculations that a Gatt success would add Dollars 200bn to annual world income of which Dollars 90bn would accrue to developing nations.

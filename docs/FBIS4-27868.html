			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  government and the ruling Democratic Liberal Party asked the  main opposition Democratic Party (DP) Saturday to go along with  them on the North Korean nuclear dispute.    The Democratic Party, however, held an emergency meeting of  its policy-making supreme council Saturday morning and adopted a  resolution urging the government to work for peaceful resolution  of the nuclear row through dialogue.    "Whatever happens on the peninsula, (we) have to prevent  another war (in Korea)," the DP said in the resolution, asking  the government to seek an independent method of settling the  dispute through active contacts with North Korea.    Earlier, First State Minister for Political Affairs So  Chung-won called DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek and stressed the need to  form a united political front as the nuclear deadlock has  reached a critical juncture. Since there would be many stages of  economic sanctions against North Korea and Seoul does not yet  know Washington's exact plans, confusion might arise if there is  a split in the nation's stance on the issue, So said.    So promised Yi that the government will brief the opposition  party on the North Korean problem when President Kim and Seoul's  ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, Kim Sang-hun, return  home. So assured Yi that the government will try to reflect the  opposition party's position when it works out concrete measures  on North Korea.    The DP resolution also called on the United States and the  United Nations to refrain from any provocative action and to  help resolve the row through dialogue.    In addition, the Democratic Party asked North Korea to stop  refueling at the 5-megawatt reactor immediately, and to allow  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special  inspections of two unreported nuclear facilities.    The opposition party also demanded that Pyongyang guarantee  the transparency of its nuclear program and scrap its decision  to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.</p>

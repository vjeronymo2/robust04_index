			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: NZ electricity group edges up ELECTRICITY Corporation of New Zealand yesterday an-nounced a rise in net profits to NZDollars 407m (USDollars 222m) for the 12 months to March 31, up from NZDollars 404m a year earlier, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. However, it warned that profits would fall in the current year: a severe drought in the South Island is affecting hydroelectricity lake levels. Mr Rod Deane, chief executive, said savings were anticipated this year, but these would be offset by interest and depreciation of NZDollars 100m relating to its Clyde dam and Cook Strait cable projects. Another uncertainty facing the group was that the government may sell its Transpower subsidiary. Further uncertainties related to pricing.</p>

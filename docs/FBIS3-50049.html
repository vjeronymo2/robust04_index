			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.Sz.: "The Former Prime Minister's Several </F> Hours' Long Talk With the Chairman of the MSZP--Miklos Nemeth Is  Not Coming Home for the Spring Election"]    [Text] According to information received by our paper,  Party [Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)] Chairman Gyula Horn and  former Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth held talks for two and a  half hours on Monday in the Socialist Party's headquarters on  Koztarsasag Square. The MSZP's three vice chairmen and the  party's parliamentary group leader were also present at the  consultation. According to our information, the discussion  focused on finally clarifying the possibilities that exist in  the event that Miklos Nemeth returns home.    Our paper was informed that Horn and Nemeth agreed to  announce the former prime minister's decision shortly in a joint  communique. In connection with the decision, we learned that  Nemeth does not want to break the contract he has until  1996--that is, he wants to stay on in the position of vice  president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) and will not return in the spring to take  part in the Hungarian election campaign.    This finally puts an end to the uncertainty concerning the  former government chief's acceptance of a political role at  home, because, according to our information, we can also exclude  any possibility of Nemeth's coming to Hungary after the  elections and, depending on their outcome, filling a position  offered to him.    It also became clear that Nemeth was not thinking of working  out any kind of Christian-Socialist alternative and that, as far  as he was concerned, only a possible invitation from the MSZP  could have played a role.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 18 (AFP)--An Iranian newspaper on  Wednesday accused Saudi Arabia of provoking conflicts in the  Islamic world, including Yemen and Afghanistan. The TEHRAN  TIMES charged that Riyadh was opposed to peace between the north  and south Yemenis and had previously done "everything to  forestall the unification Yemen."    "The Saudis have been plotting in Yemen in the past few  weeks, until they managed to impose a full-scale civil war on  that country," the English-language daily said. The paper also  accused Saudi Arabia of "instigating the civil war in  Afghanistan and of using petrodollars to finance the conflict."    Officials and newspapers here have launched a wave of  attacks  on Saudi Arabia in the past two days, after Iran was forced to  cancel an anti-US and anti-Israel rally by its pilgrims in Mecca.    The "deliverance from the Infidels" demonstration, which was  to be held Tuesday, was called off after heavily-armed Saudi  police reportedly besieged the Iranian pilgrimage quarter to  prevent them from holding it. Tehran said it had cancelled the  rally to "avoid a bloodbath."    Iran's speaker of parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri condemned  the ban on Tuesday and accused Riyadh of seeking to "please the  United States." The Saudis "want to protect the interest of the  United States. This is the main characteristic of American  Islam," he said.</p>

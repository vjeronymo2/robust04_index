			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Kim Pyong-il, North Korean  ambassador to Finland and half brother of Kim Chong-il, recently  returned home, giving rise to speculation that something may  have happened in Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported in a  report from Moscow Saturday.    Pyong-il, the son of Kim Il-song and his present wife, Kim  Song- ae, arrived in Helsinki in early March as Pyongyang's new  ambassador to Finland and presented his credentials to the  Finnish president on March 18.    The SANKEI report said the junior Kim was just about to  settle in at a newly purchased mansion when he abruptly flew  back to Pyongyang on April 22. He has yet to return and take up  his duties.    "His return home was in such a hurry that he didn't even  bother to go through the required protocol of notifying the  Finnish Foreign Ministry of his absence," the paper said.    Moreover, it said, his departure came several days before  the  Finnish president's annual reception for members of the  diplomatic corps, an occasion which an ambassador, especially a  new one, shouldn't have missed.    As Kim Pyong-il's absence drags on, Finnish papers have  speculated on the reason for his return to Pyongyang, according  to SANKEI.    One paper said Ambassador Kim's "secret-shrouded" return to  Pyongyang might have been the result of a political conspiracy  involving top North Korean leaders.    Another daily claimed Kim has been unable to resume his  duties in Helsinki because of some unusual contingency in North  Korea.    A source in the Finnish Foreign Ministry reportedly said he  didn't know when Kim would come back to Helsinki. "We don't know  if Ambassador Kim can return here at all," the source was quoted  as saying.    The North Korean Embassy in Helsinki, fueling the  speculation, is refusing to comment on the ambassador's abrupt  return to Pyongyang, the SANKEI report said.    Some reports indicated that Pyong-il has been on bad terms  with his half brother Chong-il, who is likely to succeed his  aging father as North Korea's leader.</p>

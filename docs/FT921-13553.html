			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Commodities Prices: Market Report Gold closed more than Dollars 2 ahead in active trading in London after European buying spilled over on to New York's Comex, pushing the metal through key resistance at Dollars 358 a troy ounce. Gold peaked in early afternoon business in New York at just below Dollars 361 as traders engaged in active gold-silver ratio trading before producer selling capped gold's rise. Silver recovered from a fall to 419 cents a troy ounce to close in London just 2 cents down at 428, underpinned by US fund buying. On the LME three-month nickel hit 3 1/2 -month highs before retreating on profit-taking. Cash metal closed lower, but three-month metal ended higher, supported by underlying investment fund buying interest. 'The market has become overbought, but the charts still look good ..and there is concern over Russian nickel,' one dealer said. Fears that Russian nickel plants could be closed on either economic or environmental grounds might be overdone, as the republics in the old Soviet Union need foreign exchange. Aluminium prices moved sharply higher before profit taking and hedge selling curbed the gains. Market talk of possible delays to Russian shipments because of increased export tax bureaucracy aided the tone. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Chancellor delays to fight another day: The public-spending round THE decision to delay the until Monday yesterday's planned meeting of the public expenditure committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont at least means that the embattled chancellor is not having to fight on every front at once. The hard decisions cannot be postponed for long and the signs are that public-sector pay and capital projects will be sacrificed in order to keep to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total. The desperation as Whitehall and Downing Street try to find a way through next year's expenditure is illustrated by the serious scrutiny of the manifesto pledge on child benefit to see if taxing the benefit could be made compatible with the words, whatever the spirit of the commitment. Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, is said to have knocked a 'significant sum' off the threatened Pounds 14bn overbids for next year, but the task this year is made more, not less, difficult by the mix of the old and new systems. In future years, cyclically affected spending such as unemployment benefit will be stripped out of the 'control total' so that it does not affect departmental programme spending in the years when it rises most quickly. For 1993-94 it is included within the planning total, however. That allows for social security payments to rise to Pounds 76bn next year, on the basis of a jobless total of 2.4m. The reality is likely to be 3m or more, leading automatically to an increase in spending of at least Pounds 2bn. Against that background, public-sector pay has become an obvious target. At a meeting with Tory backbenchers a week ago, MPs singled out pay as a prime area for cuts. The climate may well make the government feel it has a winnable presentational fight on its hands if it aims for an increase of no more than 2 per cent in public-sector pay. Relative job security in the public sector has an obvious value as unemployment continues to rise, while the findings of the New Earnings Survey, published last week, that public-sector pay has outstripped private-sector pay for the first time since 1986, will also provide ammunition. Much of the public-sector pay bill, running at more than Pounds 70bn and rising by about 10 per cent a year recently, is within ministers' control it. The government can determine pay for the Civil Service and for the armed forces, as well as for teachers and those health service workers who are covered by pay review bodies whose recommendations ministers can decide to stage. The main difficulty is 2.3m local authority staff, for whom the government can influence a settlement through the amount of grant it distributes, but cannot control. Councils are old adversaries for the government, but the year when the council tax is introduced is not necessarily the one ministers would have chosen for a propaganda battle on local spending. Nonetheless, the attractions of reducing the pay bill to help salvage some capital projects are evident. Both ministers and backbenchers have come under pressure from lobbies and constituents fearful that delays or cancellations will damage the construction industry still further. Inevitably, however, capital spending is not escaping unscathed. With the recession reducing traffic congestion, the Pounds 2.5bn planned for road building next year looks vulnerable, and it is hard to see the Pounds 2bn a year for the Housing Corporation surviving intact, particularly as housing has not managed to achieve the political status of health or education. Equally, however persuasive the Ministry of Defence is about the immediate costs of cancelling projects such as the European fighter Aircraft, the Pounds 24.5bn MoD budget is regarded with greedy eyes. Nor will the Pounds 26bn-plus for the three territorial departments (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) be immune in the way it would once have been under the formula ensuring that they automatically received due proportions of spending in England. There is little sign of a de minimis rule: in terms of billions, the Pounds 75m for a new prison service headquarters in Derby seems little enough, but the project has already been cancelled just a couple of weeks after the first brick was laid and the construction contract signed. One Treasury official compared the new, strict public-spending regime which the government was imposing on itself with the external economic discipline that had been embraced in joining the European exchange rate mechanism. The analogy is not a comfortable one for any of those involved.</p>

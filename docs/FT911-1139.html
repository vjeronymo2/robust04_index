			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips in lowest volume since January Tokyo FADING HOPES of an early cut in interest rates and a lack of institutional interest after the Golden Week holidays pushed share prices lower yesterday in the thinnest turnover since late-January, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 135.72 lower at 26,342.14. The index reached the day's high of 26,523.62 at the start of trading, but then declined to a low of 26,326.36, only to recover slightly on some late buying by bargain hunters and arbitrageurs. The market was closed on Friday and Monday. The broader first section Topix index was down 4.78 at 1,996.71, but the second section index rose 14.41 to 3,389.04. Only 220m shares changed hands, against 380m last Thursday, the lowest since 200m was traded on January 28. Declining issues outpaced gains by 576 to 348, while 195 stocks were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.51 to 1,505.80. In addition to an absence of buying incentives, the yen's decline against the dollar and weakness in the domestic bond market were blamed for the subdued post-holiday session. Most construction shares retreated and large-capital steels also fared badly. Kawasaki Steel fell Y7 to Y443 and Nippon Steel lost Y5 to Y474. Some precision machinery manufacturers enjoyed heavy turnover on expectations of improving business. Nikon rose Y50 to Y1,430, Olympus put on Y50 to Y1,210 and Lintec Corp jumped Y360 to Y2,780, although Dainippon Screen shed Y10 to Y1,680. Sharp was the day's most actively traded share and gained Y40 to Y1,620. Asatsu was bid-only for most of the first trading day since it lowered its trading unit from 1,000 to 100 shares; just before the close it stood at Y7,990. It was suspended at Y6,990 on April 23 in preparation for the change. Sanrio fell Y490 to Y3,500 on reports that the company's new theme park could wipe out its group profits. A Sanrio spokesman declined to comment before the release of results this month. In Osaka, the index receded 51.45 to 29,360.71 on volume of 22.5m shares. Roundup CORPORATE and political news sent Asia Pacific markets in opposite directions, with the best rise in the Philippines. MANILA jumped 4.4 per cent, with Ayala Corp, the property group, leading gains. The market was initially encouraged by President Corazon Aquino's strong stand on the US military bases. Ayala 'A' shares added 3.5 pesos at 43 pesos after a good first-quarter performance and before news of its dividend payment. The composite index climbed 46.19 to 1,100.89. BANGKOK dropped 3.2 per cent on political worries following the lifting of martial law last Thursday. The market was shut on Monday. The SET index fell 27.94 to 840.06 in thin turnover of 2.8bn baht. NEW ZEALAND continued to see demand for Brierley Investments (BIL), the investment and trading group. The Barclays index gained 1.7 per cent for the second successive day, adding 26.53 at 1,579.75. Turnover, at NZDollars 21.4m, was similar to Monday's NZDollars 21.9m. Brierley, which appreciated 10 cents the previous day, was 7 cents higher at NZDollars 1.27 on volume of 3.3m shares. On Monday the company said it had sold part of its stake in the Mount Charlotte hotels group for NZDollars 660m to two Singapore government agencies, which had also taken a 4.7 per cent holding in BIL for NZDollars 126m. Interest revived in Carter Holt Harvey, which is 21 per cent owned by Brierley and has lagged behind other leading stocks because of its high debt level. The stock advanced 9 cents to NZDollars 2.03. Another laggard, Magnum, the retail and brewing company in which Brierley jointly holds 54 per cent, rose 8 cents to NZDollars 2.80. HONG KONG gained 1 per cent on rumours that Evergo, with the backing of Cheung Kong, was planning a hostile bid for Hongkong Land. The Hang Seng index moved ahead 37.08 to 3,741.51, but turnover decreased to HKDollars 1.12bn from HKDollars 1.46bn. Hongkong Land picked up 35 cents to HKDollars 8.55 and Evergo improved 15 cents to HKDollars 3.50, while Cheung Kong recovered 20 cents to HKDollars 18.20 after falling 50 cents on Monday after a warrant issue. AUSTRALIA rose, mostly on foreign buying. The All Ordinaries index gained 15.3 to 1,537.8 in turnover of ADollars 180m, down from ADollars 187m. CRA slipped 10 cents to ADollars 13.10 after announcing a decline in 1990 profits and forecasting another fall for 1991. TAIWAN gained further ground. The weighted index added 60.48 at 6,172.57 in turnover little changed at TDollars 90.4bn. Hualon, the textile maker, advanced TDollars 4 to TDollars 64 after the release on bail at the weekend of the company's chairman. SEOUL fell sharply for a fourth session, as political tensions grew. Disappointment with government market-boosting measures also depressed sentiment. The composite index lost 5.45 to 635.17.</p>

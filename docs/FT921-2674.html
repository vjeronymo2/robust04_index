			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Stewards at Rover back work changes SHOP STEWARDS represent-ing more than 30,000 Rover car workers yesterday agreed to recommend acceptance of radical Japanese-style working practices. The workforce will have the final say in a ballot next month but is expected to approve the package, heralded as one of the biggest shake-ups for years in car-plant industrial relations. It will guarantee some workers jobs for life, scrap nearly all shop-floor demarcation and open the way for flexible team working. It also promises that there will be no more compulsory redundancies. The age-old ritual of clocking-on would be scrapped.</p>

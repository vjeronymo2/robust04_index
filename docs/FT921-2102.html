			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / S African budget runs into criticism SOUTH AFRICA'S budget fails to address the country's structural economic problems and is a short-term political expedient, economists and businessmen said yesterday. The budget was described at a post-budget seminar in Cape Town as a holding affair, overshadowed in its implications by the positive outcome of the referendum on constitutional reform. It lacked a strategy for long-term growth and its public spending and borrowing levels were too high. The budget deficit for 1992-93 is estimated at 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The need to improve the growth rate was underlined by the release of the Reserve Bank's quarterly bulletin on the economy which revealed that the downturn in economic activity had deepened in the fourth quarter of 1991. GDP in the period fell at an annualised rate of 0.5 per cent. The economy has been in recession for three years. The bank noted that with real GNP per capita having declined to R3,275 (Pounds 660) per capita in 1991 from R3,905 in 1981, it was 'important to restructure the economy in order to improve its production potential'. Professor Brian Kantor of the University of Cape Town said yesterday the budget contained few such initiatives. Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of Finance said the government's constrained revenue position had 'this year made it virtually impossible to do much about growth'. However, the previous two budgets had contained important supply-side initiatives, he said. Dr Jaap Meijer, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank said yesterday the budget did not appear to have done anything that would facilitate a cut in interest rates. He said Dr Chris Stals, the governor, would soon be making a statement about interest rates. Increased social spending and a narrowing of the gap in spending on blacks and whites was criticised by Mr Tito Mboweni of the African National Congress, as 'throwing money at the problem and not trying to resolve it.' The most significant concession to business in Tuesday's budget came in the form of expanded incentives for industrial investment with tax concessions for importers of raw materials. The stock market received a boost in the form of reducing from 10 to 5 years the period before which the disposal of shares will attract income tax. Economists and businessmen at yesterday's seminar suggested that while the referendum result was positive, the business community itself would have to ensure that sufficient attention was paid during the move to a new constitution to the needs of business and the economy.</p>

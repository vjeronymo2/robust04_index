			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF PATROLS TO THE RESCUE  </P> <P> Talk about anger!  </P> <P> Your Sept. 6 article regarding the use of Sheriff's Department deputies to  patrol portions of Long Beach indicates that certain groups are angry.  </P> <P> These people apparently object that there will be less opportunity for citizen  review, that the matter should be further studied or the morale of the Long  Beach officers will be adversely affected.  </P> <P> I live in the 5th Council District where there are no assigned patrol cars,  where a response to a 911 call can (and often does) take hours, where the crime  rate is steadily increasing and where traffic enforcement is virtually  nonexistent.  </P> <P> It will take years for the staffing of the Long Beach Police Department to be  built up to adequate levels. Just how long do the opposing politicians and  special interest groups expect us to go without police protection? Does it make  sense to hold the lives and property of Long Beach citizens hostage to their  concerns while we wait for the Long Beach Police Department to be rebuilt?  </P> <P> Thank God the Long Beach City Council saw fit to throw a life preserver to a  drowning man even if others would rather wait until after the drowning to  determine if intervention was required. Please forgive me, folks, for making  such a fuss thrashing about in the water before I sink.  </P> <P> BILL NIEMEYER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Seagram 9% lower as marketing costs rise THE RECESSION continued to dampen Seagram's wine and spirits business in the third quarter, while the Tropicana fruit juice unit performed strongly and benefited from lower overheads. Third-quarter net profit was USDollars 178m, or 47 cents a share, down 9 per cent from Dollars 193m, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, said in a statement that the Canadian group's flat performance in the third quarter was due mainly to the recession's impact on several key global markets, but also to higher advertising outlays to support its most important brands. Seagram spends around Dollars 500m a year on advertising worldwide. He said: 'But we expect our overall operating income for the full year ending January 31 will exceed the Dollars 760m reported for fiscal 1992.' Sales from the worldwide drinks business dipped 3.7 per cent to Dollars 1.45bn following the sale of several spirits brands in the US in the final quarter of fiscal 1991. In the third quarter, sales from continuing operations were steady. Operating income was Dollars 198m, against Dollars 206m. Results included Dollars 73m in dividends from Du Pont of the US, against Dollars 69m, and Dollars 41m equity in unremitted Du Pont earnings, against Dollars 51m. Net income for the nine months to October 31 was Dollars 497m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, down 6.5 per cent from Dollars 530m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 4.9bn against Dollars 4.28bn. Results included Du Pont dividends of Dollars 214m, compared with Dollars 207m, and unremitted earnings of Dollars 121m, against Dollars 185m. Seagram is one of the world's top four drinks groups, selling in 150 countries and with subsidiaries and affiliates in 34 countries. Its main expansion thrust is in Asia and Europe because of the long decline in the North American spirits market.</p>

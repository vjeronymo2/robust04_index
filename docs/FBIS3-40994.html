An official  from the Russian Foreign Ministry stated this in a conversation  with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. In his opinion, this was  made possible by an accord reached during the January trilateral  summit between delegations from Russia, the United States, and  Ukraine in Moscow. A mechanism for implementing Ukraine's  decision on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its  territory was drawn up at the meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

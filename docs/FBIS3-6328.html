The companies include such leading firms  as Pasco Corp., Asia Air Survey Co. and Kokusai Kogyo Co.    Pasco and Asia Air Survey Co. were each told to pay 200  million yen, the highest penalty ever brought against a private  company for bid-rigging in relation to public works projects.    The total of fines also marks the third highest sought by  the  FTC in such cases. The highest penalties in a bid-rigging case  totaled some 1 billion yen against contractors in Saitama  Prefecture, near Tokyo, in 1992.    The FTC said the aerial survey companies, through one  Tokyo-based land measurement association, continued prearranged  biddings from around 1984 for map production orders placed by  the Construction Ministry's Geographical Survey Institute.    The firms also arranged illegal bidding for tenders held by  the government and municipal governments for aerial photographic  surveys from 1988 to 1992. They reportedly set up intercompany  cooperative bodies in several regions to fix successful bidders  and contract prices beforehand, the commission said.    In February 1993, the FTC ordered the contractors and  association to end bid-rigging practices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betacourt; from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin arrived in  Havana on an official visit today, immediately beginning talks  with her counterpart and host, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez. When  she arrived in the Cuban capital, Mrs. Sanin de Rubio spoke to  Cuban and foreign journalists about the objectives of her visit  and the outlook for bilateral relations.    [Begin recording] [Sanin] Since the reestablishment of  relations, we have sought to obtain in-depth knowledge of our  mutual circumstances. Therefore, we are going to address  bilateral topics, exchange opinions and information on our  respective countries, and review the bilateral agenda on  commercial, cultural, and educational topics. There might also  be an opportunity to talk with important Cuban personalities. I  want to obtain in-depth knowledge of the reforms undertaken by  Cuba in economic and political areas, because we all have great  hopes that current problems will be overcome and there will be a  greater opening at different levels as a result of Cuba's  achievements and the reforms that have begun, based on Cuba's  self-determination.    [Unidentified reporter] What are the most immediate trade  prospects between the two countries?    [Sanin] Well, our overall trade amounts to $12 million.  There are great opportunities. Colombian businessmen will be  paying a visit. I am interested in speaking with the Cuban  authorities about some points which are important to promoting  greater Colombian investment in Cuba and improving trade. This  brings development and opportunities. Many of our products can  have a market here and many of your products can have a market  in Colombia. I think we have to review certain conditions, such  as the possibility of signing an agreement on investment  protection. I also want to review with the Cuban authorities  the possibilities for foreign investments.    [Reporter] Does Colombia uphold its decision to sell  petroleum to Cuba?    [Sanin] Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba without any  problem as long as Cuba can pay within the terms and conditions  Colombia establishes for the sale of oil. If you can accept the  Colombian terms, we see no problem in selling it. The letter of  credit and the terms are being discussed.    [Reporter] In your view, are relations with Cuba going well?    [Sanin] They are going well because they are developing with  mutual respect for domestic affairs and with a great sense of  cooperation and understanding. There is interest in all sectors  of the two countries.    [Reporter] How much petroleum is being negotiated?    [Sanin] I do not have that exact information because the  quantity would be established based on the terms and conditions.    [Reporter] What priorities or topics does Colombia, as  host, have for the fourth [Ibero-American] summit?    [Sanin] Economic topics as a basis for political reforms and  their sustainability, because economic and political reforms  cannot be carried out without emphasizing social aspects. In  addition to the extreme poverty of a large part of our  population, Latin America's great problem is the inequalities in  our societies. We are going to review the opportunities that  integration provides for economic development and prosperity for  our peoples, but always based on in-depth social reforms.    [Reporter] Will your visit lead to a possible visit by  President Gaviria before (?the end of his presidential term)?    [Sanin] It is not scheduled. The president's agenda is  already quite heavy. We had not [words indistinct] but in any  case we will hold the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and we  will receive President Fidel Castro on 14 and 15 (?July).    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] expect an agreement?    [Sanin] The transaction is being carried out like two normal  countries. There is talk of prices, duration, and guarantees.  The duration is being discussed. You are asking for a longer  duration than what Colombia is willing to offer and you are  offering a guarantee different from the one we are accustomed to  receiving. Nevertheless, it is a normal discussion in commercial  terms. We want it to be a normal commercial operation and we  are discussing it. Therefore, if we reach agreement, there is a  sale, and if not, it will be like so many other commercial  operations that are not carried through. It would not mean  [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Passage indistinct]    [Sanin] That is what we want, that it be a step in the  strengthening of relations, a sign of cooperation and mutual  respect, and of my country's desire to learn up close about the  reforms under way in Cuba. Everyone knows that Cuba is  experiencing various difficulties, but we are very hopeful about  the political resolve and President Fidel Castro's statements  yesterday about this being the beginning and that you are  willing to establish [words indistinct] reforms to resolve the  island's problems. We have great hope that these measures will  be effective. We respect that the reforms will stem from Cuba's  self-determination and we hope that the political resolve that  has been expressed will be clear and real. We all want the  Cuban people to be prosperous, enjoy well-being, and be able to  maintain the reforms the country has achieved in social aspects  such as education, health, and other fields. [end recording]    The program for the Colombian foreign minister's 24-hour  visit to Cuba includes meetings with Carlos Lage, vice president  of the Councils of State and Ministers, and a working luncheon  with Army General Raul Castro. In addition, she will visit the  National Library and the Casa de las Americas to deliver  donations of books and crafts. Along with the Cuban foreign  minister, she will confirm the work program of the joint  intergovernmental commission that was recently created and will  sign an educational agreement. Before leaving Cuba, Mrs. Sanin  de Rubio will hold a news conference.</p>

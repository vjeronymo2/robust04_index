			<p>BFN     [Text] The HNP's [Reformed National Party] special congress  on 31 May was held to prepare the party for the new phase in the  struggle for Afrikaner nationalism. The congress was held in  the Silverton City Hall and delegates and other members of the  party turned up in large numbers from all over the country and  packed the hall for the proceedings. The decision to hold the  congress on a historic day such as 31 May [Republic Day] met  with great approval among party members.    After leader Jaap Marais's inspiring speech on political  strategies, party members could again look forward to the  difficult but exciting road that lies ahead in the future of the  HNP. Party members once more came to realize that the HNP was  the only party which had the leader and the commitment to lead  the Afrikaner people in the dark days ahead.    The rest of the day's activities were based on possible  changes to the HNP's program of principles, the constitution,  and the party's authority structures in the light of the  struggle ahead. Changes have been proposed to improve the HNP's  effectiveness in the changing times in which the De Klerk  government has plunged us. This will put the HNP in a position  to oppose the government, as should be the case in a democratic  order.    The HNP is to take the lead in the spirit of resistance and  opposition against the humiliation and defamation of the  Afrikaner nation and its language. On the basis of nationalism,  emphasis in HNP policy will fall strongly on each nation's  preference for that which is its own.    There was a general feeling in the audience that it was only  a matter of time before HNP policy and principles were regarded  as the only ones capable of resolving the South African  situation. Through the funds that have been collected by  workers in the party, especially in parts of the Cape province,  it can be deduced that throughout the country the Afrikaner  nation hungers for truth, and that Afrikaners are once again  rallying to support the HNP in its struggle against enemies of  the Afrikaner nation.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER METER FOR EACH APARTMENT OKD  </P> <P> In an effort to promote water conservation, the Santa Monica City Council  approved an ordinance requiring all new apartment units to have individual  water meters -- which will mean individual water bills.  </P> <P> "The object of this measure is to create individual accountability," said Mayor  Dennis Zane.  </P> <P> The individual meters will add about $800 per unit to the cost of building an  average apartment structure, officials estimate. Affordable-housing  developments will be exempt from the ordinance.  </P></p>

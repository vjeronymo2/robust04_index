			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH FIRST!  </P> <P> The violent anti-slavery protests of John Brown before the Civil War, the  women's rights protests at the turn of the century, the civil disobedience of  segregation laws in the 1960s -- I think Earth First! protests can be added to  that list. Their activities, while extreme, have at least made progress to halt  the sellout of our resources to big business for an extra buck.  </P> <P> When ecological legislation is unenforced or not effective, something else must  be done.  </P> <P> Our government is supposed to be of the people, not of the companies , and our  natural resources are supposed to be protected for the people, not sold to  private companies for exploitation.  </P> <P> It's sad that the government's reaction is to hound these people instead of  joining the fight to reclaim our planet. This is not eco-sabotage for the sake  of publicity -- this is a fight for survival. I'll take the Monkeywrenchers and  their tree spiking any day in preference to one more oil spill or one more pile  of nuclear-power-plant waste.  </P> <P> SHANNON DONNELLY  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

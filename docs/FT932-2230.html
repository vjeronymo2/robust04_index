			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Dublin digests gains on punt's devaluation - Forecasts are being upgraded Having gulped down the government's remaining stakes in Greencore and Irish Life over the past two months, the Irish market is busily digesting those stocks, and consolidating its 30 per cent gain in the year to date. Mortgage rates are now hitting historic lows in the republic, and interest rates generally are expected to fall by a further percentage point or two by the end of the year, causing most market analysts in Dublin to make further revisions to their forecasts. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy stockbrokers, says: 'We are strategically very bullish and dropping our short-term caveats. We have upgraded earnings estimates for this year and next, and my instinct for the first time in several years is that we now have them too low rather than too high.' He forecasts earnings growth for the market of 14 per cent this year and 17 per cent in 1994, and expects the ISEQ index to reach 1,750 by the year end. It closed yesterday at 1.580.39. He says that the fall in interest rates since last January's devaluation of the punt has been much quicker than expected, and that wholesale rates will probably now fall to 6 per cent by early 1994. Mr John Conroy, head of research at NCB stockbrokers, believes that activity will probably remain quiet over the summer: 'Net cash inflows into institutions remain anaemic. 'The interest rate falls still have to filter through to the individual saver; but by the second half of the year mutual and unit-linked products will again begin to look attractive alternatives to cash deposits.' With more liquidity in the market and a benign outlook for strong earnings growth, upturns in the US and UK markets, where a number of the Irish companies have significant business, and the continuing downward pressure on interest rates, he is also predicting a substantial upside for Irish stocks. 'Interest rate-sensitive stocks, such as the banks and CRH, should continue to perform well, while the food companies are also coming into favour.' Jefferson Smurfit, which has been the one big disappointment in the market this year, lagging behind the other industrials, and which has a significant weighting in the ISEQ index, should also firm up, he says, as 'institutions will be reluctant to go any further underweight'. Mr Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, points out that there has been a 27 per cent growth in money supply in the republic over the past year, 'so that there is now a lot of liquidity in the system'. This should have the dual effect of boosting consumer spending, improving the earnings prospects of companies trading in the domestic market, and, as interest rates fall, encouraging greater investment in equities. This should reverse the 1992 trend which saw funds move into cash, and which proved to be a big technical problem for Irish stocks last year. 'Cash is beginning to look uncompetitive,' says Mr McLaughlin. He notes that foreign investment in the market has been the main catalyst for the growth this year, and he estimates that between IPounds 350-400m (Dollars 530-Dollars 670m) has come into the market this year from non-Irish institutions, allowing domestic institutions to meet encashment commitments without drying up liquidity. Traditionally around 80 per cent of Irish stocks have been held by Irish institutions and, although that balance will not have been significantly altered by the recent surge in foreign interest - total market capitalisation is some IPounds 10.5bn - 'it is, nonetheless, a healthy development', says Mr Conroy. The progressive lifting of exchange controls over the past couple of years - they were lifted in their entirety last January - had been identified by analysts as a serious technical problem for the market, as Irish institutions began to rebalance their portfolios by shifting a large proportion of their funds into overseas equities and gilts. That concern now appears largely to have passed. Meanwhile, a further source of liquidity is in the pipeline in the form of a proposed tax amnesty, which, it is hoped, will result in a substantial repatriation of previously-undeclared funds held overseas, estimated at IPounds 2bn. Most analysts believe that around IPounds 500m could be repatriated, of which about a half is likely to be invested in equities and property. The government wants to have the amnesty completed by the autumn. On the supply side, most of the big Irish stocks have strong balance sheets with good cash flows, and so any new rights issues are likely to be expansion-orientated, analysts say. Only some IPounds 200m was raised in the market last year, down from some IPounds 700m a year in the late 1980s. The coalition government has no plans for further privatisations following the sell-off of its remaining stakes in Greencore and Irish Life, and the only big newcomer envisaged for the market is the Irish Permanent Building Society; but that flotation is not now expected until 1994.</p>

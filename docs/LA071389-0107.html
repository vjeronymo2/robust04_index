			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO KEEP GUNS FROM CHILDREN SIGNED IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Martinez on Wednesday signed legislation requiring gun owners to keep  weapons out of the reach of children.  </P> <P> The signing occurred a day after a Florida child had wounded himself in the  finger in the sixth shooting since June 1 of the type that the law is designed  to prevent.  </P> <P> "This will assist in protecting our children throughout the state," Martinez  said. "The added public awareness will prompt adults to keep guns out of  reach."  </P> <P> The law, effective Oct. 1, requires gun owners to keep loaded weapons under  lock and out of the hands of children age 15 and younger. It also authorizes  the development of a gun safety program in Florida schools.  </P> <P> If a child shoots himself or someone else because of a gun left within reach,  the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in  prison and a $5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60  days in jail and a $500 fine if a minor threatens someone with the gun or  displays it in public.  </P> <P> There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents and those  involving stolen guns.  </P> <P> Three children died and two were wounded in the earlier shootings.  </P></p>

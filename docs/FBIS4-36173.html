			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Peace and Solidarity </F> Council; place and date not given]    [Text] The Yemeni Peace and Solidarity Council is following  with a great deal of dissatisfaction the rebellious gang's  inhuman conduct toward fraternal Arabs who came to the Republic  of Yemen in accordance with job contracts signed with official  agencies in the educational, health, and other fields. This  gang is arresting and torturing these nationals, and forcing  them to make false confessions that they are engaged in alleged  military actions. They are being portrayed as prisoners of war  captured in the battlefield.    These criminal acts are manifestations of cheap blackmail.  Similarly, they are lowly attempts to delude the world into  believing that the countries of these innocent victims are  involved in the Yemeni crisis. These cheap acts, and similar  other criminal and inhuman acts, such as using the elderly,  women, and children as human shields; dropping booby-trapped  pens, toys, and sweets to kill innocent children; and using  banned missiles of mass destruction run counter to all universal  conventions. Likewise, they violate the Geneva conventions and  their two supplementary protocols.    While denouncing these criminal acts, the Yemeni Peace and  Solidarity Council urges all international organizations, and  the International Committee of the Red Cross to condemn these  violations of human values and principles, and international  norms and conventions, as well. It also urges them to vindicate  the Yemeni people and support them against the enemies of their  unity, constitutional legitimacy, and democratic experiment.</p>

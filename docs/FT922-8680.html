			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Metra slips into FM203m loss METRA, the Finnish industrial conglomerate, announced yesterday a FM203m (Dollars 45.65m) loss after financial items for its 1991-1992 financial year which ended on February 29. This contrasts with a FM340m profit for the previous financial year. However, group sales grew 11 per cent to FM9.83bn from FM8.88bn over the same period. The board proposes a dividend of FM2 per share for the 1991-1992 financial year compared with FM2.80 for the previous 12 months. Metra said it was also going ahead with a FM60m share issue to raise capital for the strengthening of its core businesses and leading investments, including acquisitions. A total of 3m new shares is to be available at a nominal value of FM20 per share. Metra blamed its loss on a more severe business downturn, particularly in Finland, than had been forecast. This hit the group's building materials business. Restructuring measures, however, are expected to return that part of Metra's activity to profitability by 1993. However Sanitec, the group's bathroom fittings division, recorded substantial growth in the German market, with a fall in demand in Scandinavia. The locks and lock systems business was also hit by falling demand, except in Germany, and Metra said further moves were planned to adjust to this. The Wartsila diesel operation enjoyed an improved performance, with 43 per cent growth in net sales to SKr3.3bn (Dollars 556m) from SKr2.3bn, and a 13 per cent growth in operating profits to SKr177m. Metra accounts for about 20 per cent of the world market for medium-speed marine engines and diesel power plants over 1MW capacity. It forecast a rise in sales in the next financial year to FM4.6bn. The group said expected restructuring measures in its building materials and locks and lock systems manufacture should make a 'favourable impact' on future performance.</p>

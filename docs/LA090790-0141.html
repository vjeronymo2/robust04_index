			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S FEATURED GAMES;  </P> <P> TROY VS. RANCHO ALAMITOS  </P> <P> 1989 RECORDS -- Troy 7-4, Rancho Alamitos 4-6.  </P> <P> SITE -- Fullerton High School.  </P> <P> TROY UPDATE -- Offense, offense and more offense. Troy has Greg Windle, the top  quarterback in the Freeway League, and Steve Friedrich, one of the top  receivers.  </P> <P> Two other targets for Windle will be Chad Hartford and Ryan Russell, both  all-league second-team receivers last season. Chad Brasington, a 6-1, 195-pound  senior, will give Troy a solid rushing attack, running behind an offensive line  that returns five starters. In all, Troy returns 15 starters.  </P> <P> RANCHO ALAMITOS UPDATE -- Like Troy, Rancho Alamitos also returns a solid  nucleus, with nine offensive and eight defensive players back. But the Vaqueros  will sorely miss running back Dana Riddle, a workhorse who carried the ball 381  times last season. All-league players Tim Starke (linebacker) and Leonard Sims  (offensive tackle) also offer support. The Vaqueros will be inexperienced at  quarterback with Chris Singletary, who broke his leg on the first game of the  season last year. College scouts tab Singletary as a prospect at linebacker,  though.  </P> <P> KEY TO THE GAME -- Rancho Alamitos' secondary will be run ragged by Windle's  strong arm and the quick Troy receivers. Rancho Alamitos' lack of depth (only  32 players on varsity) could produce some tired players in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> CONSENSUS -- Is Troy a contender or a pretender? The Warriors want to challenge  Sunny Hills for the Freeway League title (again) this year, and a victory in  the season opener will get them off on the right foot.  </P></p>

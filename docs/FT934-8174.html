			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / CBI urges tax relief transfer TAX RELIEFS which expire at the end of the year, when the Business Expansion Scheme ends, should be transferred into new reliefs for private investment in private companies, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. 'Unless we change the way we do some things in this country, smaller businesses cannot deliver, cannot be the engine of recovery,' Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of both PAL International and the CBI's small-business council told the CBI's annual conference in Harrogate. The demand for tax relief for individual investors is part of a search for funding diversity. The CBI is concerned that small companies are too reliant on overdrafts and short-term bank finance.</p>

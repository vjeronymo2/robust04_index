			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Travel: Bird's eye view of Vietnam IT WAS when we visited the Roman Catholic church that the rumours began and the Vietnamese security men stepped up their vigil. Rumour had it that we had given the priest gold or hundreds of dollars; that one of our group spoke fluent Vietnamese; that our mission was more than our stated aim of bird conservation. Thirteen of us had gathered, from the US and England, to help 'save the cranes of Vietnam.' The project, organised by Earthwatch, the environmental charity, was a working holiday that we paid to take part in. Our job was to help the world expert on cranes, Dr George Archibald, compile data on the birds' habits and to proselytise to the locals - the Sarus crane was feared lost to Vietnam until recently and its future remains precarious. The church visit, on a rare afternoon off, probably gave the highest possible profile to the bird project. Home for 10 days was Tam Nong, a dusty town on the junction of five canals of the Mekong river system, just 12 miles south of Cambodia in Vietnam's south-west. Accommodation was the local communist party headquarters: a nondescript cement block with resident mice, cockroaches and armies of red ants, no hot water, often no electricity. Tam Nong did not exist a decade ago; now it serves as a frontier town for the thousands of impoverished farmers relocated to the area by the government. The farmers need all the help they can get to eke a living from the land: last year their rice fields and homes were completely flooded in the wet season. From the bridge that spans the main canal you can see river life in all its glory. Ripe mangoes, coconuts and bags of rice travel to market aboard barge boats, whose motors sound uncannily like wartime helicopters. Women wash their hair by the banks in the same water that washes their vegetables - the same water that serves as their outdoor toilet. Pigs and dogs and children scramble on the canal sides, providing an endless cacophony of noise. The noise level rises further still when a westerner comes to town. Mobs of curious giggling children follow Pied Piper-style, trying out their limited English, wanting to hold or shake hands. Kent Converse, a Kansas farmer, and Noel Bell, an electronic technician from California, had visited Vietnam before, to fight the communists in 1967. This time, they wanted to do something constructive for the country, to make amends for the war. And here they were, just 30 miles from where Kent was wounded in his helicopter, hugging their former Viet Cong enemies after an emotional introduction. Like us, they encountered nothing but friendliness from the Vietnamese. Nevertheless, we were watched. Tam Nong is nowhere near the tourist track, requiring a day-long journey from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, by road and water. We were definitely disrupting day-to-day life in the region, causing at least temporary inflation in a town where the staple diet of noodle soup and coconut milk costs about 10p and a French baguette - the ubiquitous legacy of French rule - 2p. After the church visit - catholicism has been tolerated locally only in recent years - a popular pastime was guessing which of our Vietnamese companions were the security men. One simply gave the game away. His Vietnamese-American phrase book contained such telling phrases as 'I am willing to do it for my lieutenant' and 'The enemies are outnumbered. They use human wave tactics.' An inkling of wartime horrors came on the day we walked across a wetland field for five hours in search of the Bengal florican, an unobliging bustard that did not show its face. The former battlefield was like a natural booby trap, scratchy thigh-high grass giving way to deep muddy bogs that held on to our legs as the midday sun scorched. The guidebook had warned: 'When fighting stopped, US estimates put quantities of unexploded ordnance at 150,000 tonnes. Only small areas were cleared.' We did not see the florican and we did not get as close to the cranes as we might have liked, but the bird-watching was still a treat. We spotted almost 100 species in the wetlands and the few remaining woodlands. Beware, though: while the Vietnamese like their birds, they also seem to prefer them in cages or stuffed, or even on the dinner table. Vietnam's poverty means that its tourist infrastructure is underdeveloped. Road travel takes time. You need government permission to travel about, and you have to pay for it. You are meant to travel with a guide, although this is not always strictly enforced. But if tourism was not so underdeveloped, it is unlikely we would have found ourselves at the wedding of a village doctor. Or sipping Russian champagne with the barefoot tourism minister and his wife. Or crying at Ho Chi Minh's father's grave, as the keeper told us - tears running down his cheeks - that Uncle Ho was a good man who was not to blame for wartime atrocities. Nor, almost certainly, would we have had an audience with a Vietnamese priest after a Roman Catholic mass in one of the few remaining communist countries.

Fifty-two enterprises  fulfilled a total industrial output value of 11.23 billion yuan,  an increase of 16.4 percent over the previous year; 18.5 percent  of the gross industrial output value of industrial enterprises  was at the township level and above. They realized 2.13 billion  yuan in profits and taxes, an increase of 30.9 percent,  accounting for 81.5 percent of the total taxes and profits of  industrial enterprises throughout the province. Thirty-six  industrial enterprises realized more than 10 million yuan in  annual profits and taxes. The Jiangxi Xiyi Steel and Iron  Factory, the Jiangxi Automobile Factory, the Nanchang Cigarette  Factory, the Gannan Cigarette Factory, and the Nanchang Steel  and Iron Factory topped 100 million yuan in annual profits and  taxes.

The  Jiangxi Xiyi Steel and Iron Factory fulfilled the target of 1  million metric tons of multi-type steel, ranking first in the  province in tax payment and profit delivery. The Jiangxi Cement  Factory produced 95 metric tons of cement, a record high.    Second, they increased their investments and fulfilled  production quotas. The Jiangxi Automobile Factory doubled the  production of Jiangling brand automobiles and realized taxes and  profits of 353 million yuan, ranking second in the province.  The Jiujiang Chemical Fiber Factory achieved good results in  carrying out technical transformation, which helped double its  economic returns.    Third, they introduced structural adjustment to cope with  market demands. The Nanchang Cigarette Factory paid attention  to improving product quality and upgrading products. In 1992 it  suffered a loss of 28.52 million yuan, but last year it made up  this deficit and began to gain profits.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Russia gives away state giants to force reform MR Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation minister, said yesterday that a mass privatisation give-away scheme was the only way to force restructuring on inefficient state enterprises. He said vouchers entitling every Russian citizen to acquire Rbs10,000-worth of shares in 6,000-7,000 medium and large enterprises would be distributed between October and December. The enterprises would be privatised next year. The unveiling of an unprecedented 'popular privatisation' programme coincides with the government's continuing battle with enterprises and the central bank governor over how much new credit they should receive. On Monday, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, plans to seek IMF permission for fresh credits to enterprises. Such permission was one of the conditions for the granting of a first loan of Dollars 1bn. Mr Gerashchenko, who favours soft credit facilities in order to boost industrial production, and who opposes rapid privatisation, is accusing the government of trying to sell weakened enterprises off on the cheap. The primary importance of the IMF agreement was to reassure foreign creditors and open the door to a debt rescheduling agreement and fresh bilateral credits. But a delegation headed by Mr Richard Erb, the Fund's deputy-director, is likely to look for guarantees that measures will be put in place to avoid a recurrence of new enterprise arrears and that additional credits, if they are agreed, will not act as a green light for enterprises to raise wages and prices. Mr Chubais acknowledged there was a danger that the speed of the privatisation plan could mean that Russians could find themselves holding shares in enterprises which were unviable. 'It is not possible to seriously count on enterprises to restructure on a massive scale . . . without a change in the form of property,' he said. 'Of course there is a risk that some enterprises will go under (after they are privatised) but this risk is an incentive for enterprises to become more effective.' 'At a time when we are talking about the life or death of reforms . . . it is only by smashing the industrial giants that we can talk about a radical change in property ownership,' explained Ms Olga Tankova, a privatisation official. Once workers had vouchers to help them buy shares in the enterprise - they are entitled to 25 per cent of their enterprise's stock free of charge plus another 10 per cent at a discount - they would exert increasing pressure on recalcitrant managers to privatise. All state-owned enterprises are required, as a first step, to turn themselves into a joint-stock companies by November. The latest to take this decision was the Zil car plant in Moscow yesterday. President Boris Yeltsin yesterday ruled out the possibility of a new coup or of hunger in Russia even though he forecast unemployment and outbursts of social discontent later this year. Speaking at a news conference on the first anniversary of the Moscow coup's collapse, he said 1993 would be 'easier for us all'. Although Russia had to rely mainly on itself to conduct radical economic reforms, he claimed Italy had been the most helpful of G7 nations, followed by Canada, Germany, the US, France, the UK, with Japan in dismal last place. Canada yesterday resumed grain shipments after it received some of the Dollars 55m it was owed in arrears for earlier deliveries, while Italy is considering freezing an existing line of credit for Russia.</p>

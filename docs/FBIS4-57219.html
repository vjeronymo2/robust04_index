			<p>BFN     [Text] Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj  has described the appointment of a new president in Haiti by the  regime there as an absurdity. He says it is an insult to the  international community and makes a mockery of attempts to  reestablish democracy in Haiti:    [Begin Maraj recording] We certainly will not recognize the  new president. We think it a mockery, a mockery, a political  mockery, and certainly the only president of Haiti that we  recognize is President Aristide. [end recording]    The Haitian military and the promilitary parliament  appointed  the head of Haiti's Supreme Court as a provisional president.  This is seen as an act of defiance of the U.N. Security Council  ruling, the penalty for which could be military intervention.    [Begin Maraj recording] If indeed the United Nations takes a  certain course of action, Trinidad and Tobago will do whatever  it can and give very serious consideration to making any kind of  contribution within its means to support any U.N. initiative in  the solution of this Haitian crisis. [end recording]    Although the foreign minister says he would not like to see  military intervention take place in Haiti, he says it is a last  option and it may have to be considred, in the final analysis.    [Begin Maraj recording] Democracy has been on the march. We  have just witnessed a dismantling of apartheid and the  establishment of the first step toward a democratic way of life  in South Africa. We cannot allow Haiti to continue like this. We  must develop a strong and positive approach and do what is  necessary at the multilateral level to deal with the situation.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION A SENSIBLE SOLUTION;  </P> <P> YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS PLAN MAKES SPACE FOR TEACHING;  </P> <P> NEW CALENDAR WILL ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LEARNING. THE FEW DRAWBACKS ARE EASILY  REMEDIED.  </P> <P> The school year as we know it -- from September to June -- is a remnant of  rural America, a time when children were needed in the summer months to help  work in the fields. The Los Angeles of farms, ranches and orange groves is long  gone, of course. In its place stands a sprawling metropolis with the  second-largest school district in the country and an alarming shortage of  classrooms and teachers.  </P> <P> In deciding to put its schools on a year-round calendar, the Los Angeles school  board selected the most cost-efficient, expedient and sensible way to relieve  grossly overcrowded schools. Stop-gap measures -- such as busing inner-city and  Eastside students great distances to less crowded schools -- provided an  inconvenient, impractical and, above all, inequitable solution.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District has neither the land nor the money --  nor, for that matter, the time -- to build enough new classrooms to accommodate  the district's projected growth of 15,000 students a year. Busing takes an  unfair toll on the children who must spend hours shuttling between home and  less crowded schools in unfamiliar neighborhoods. This routine would  undoubtedly take its toll in the classroom, as well as during what should be  peak homework hours. Children do not have limitless energy and cannot be  compared to adults who commute by their own choice.  </P> <P> The board's proposal to put all district schools on a multi-track calendar by  the year 1991 will generate 60,000 extra seats without the expense and time  constraints of additional construction. By moving to such a system, the  district will be able to increase its capacity by a one-third without  lengthening the school year.  </P> <P> What's more, contrary to the claims of some critics, a year-round calendar will  enhance the quality of education in public schools by diminishing the learning  loss that tends to occur during extended summer vacations. The 30-day vacations  will provide students with a more cohesive and continuous learning environment,  in addition to greater opportunities for more frequent remediation when  necessary. Intense concentration on subjects, with the proper guidance and  lesson planning, will enable students to retain information as well, if not  better, than during the traditional school year. Students in colleges and  universities on a quarter system arguably learn as much as their counterparts  in institutions on a more traditional and longer semester system.  </P> <P> As with any solution, there are drawbacks to year-round schooling, but they are  few and easily remedied. Critics who complain that students will be forced to  attend school during the hot Los Angeles summer forget that temperatures often  peak well within the already-established school year -- in September and  October. And installing air conditioning is cheaper and faster than building  additional facilities to house the relentless student influx.  </P> <P> Some of the most vocal critics of the proposal claim that the new school year  will eliminate the possibility for family vacations, or at least make  coordination of family-member schedules more difficult. To base education  policy on vacation convenience is absurd. The proposal does not lengthen the  school year, nor does it eliminate vacation times; it simply rearranges them.  Thirty days of vacation will follow each 90-day school term. As for anxieties  that the plan will disrupt family unity, district officials have vowed to make  every effort to place children in any given family on the same track.  </P> <P> The proposal -- in itself a flexible and creative way of addressing a serious  problem -- provides students, parents and teachers with a wide range of  hitherto unexplored options. Companies that have been creating summer jobs for  students could create regular, year-round positions that would continually be  filled by students from alternating tracks, bringing a greater sense of  responsibility and continuity to the workplace. And teachers could elect to  switch tracks when their particular track went on vacation, thus teaching full  time, earning more and alleviating the teacher shortage.  </P> <P> A decision to change what has been the accepted norm for decades takes courage  to return to the primary mission of any school district: teaching children  rather than scavenging for space.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has become a melting pot of immigrants. They come here in search of  better conditions, a better climate, a better life. Many are underprivileged;  many do not speak English; many cannot afford to educate themselves. The public  school system holds out a promise of an education and a better life for their  children. In a district as overcrowded as ours, where every day is a constant  struggle for more space, only year-round schooling can keep that promise and  allow our public schools to provide quality education for all.  </P></p>

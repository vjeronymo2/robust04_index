			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DE BEERS SIGNS DIAMOND DEAL WITH SOVIETS  </P> <P> De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond market Wednesday with an  exclusive five-year deal to sell the Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which  could total more than $5 billion.  </P> <P> The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest gem diamond  producers, will get a $1-billion advance against future diamond sales.  </P> <P> De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, will  strengthen its position as the world's dominant diamond seller. It already  markets 80% of global rough diamond production of some 100 million carats.  </P> <P> The Soviets do not disclose their output.  </P> <P> The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge stockpile of  diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond market, De Beers said.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South African-based  company because of its home country's policies of racial separation, but now is  willing to do business openly with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary  AG.  </P> <P> De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly held Swiss company in  May to head the non-South African businesses of De Beers, which is controlled  by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa.  </P> <P> De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne, Switzerland, and  made available in London that it reached the agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of  the Soviet Union for the exclusive export and sale of the U.S.S.R. diamond  production.  </P> <P> Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals and diamonds  under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De Beers said.  </P> <P> De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA, has agreed to  advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future diamond deliveries. Repayment  would be made over five years beginning in November.  </P> <P> The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers' marketing arm as  collateral for the advance, De Beers said.  </P></p>

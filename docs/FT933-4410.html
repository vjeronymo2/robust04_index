			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Long-term energy supplies 'at risk' WASTE in industrial countries and growing demand in the developing world pose a long-term threat to energy supplies, says the World Energy Council, a non-governmental body representing more than 100 countries. Although world supplies are still abundant, it says governments should take early action to secure supplies. Growing environmental pressures also require a drive towards greater energy efficiency. A study of the long-term prospects for world energy, published in London today by the council, says present consumption trends could lead to a more than doubling of energy use by the year 2020. But if strong energy efficiency measures are instituted, growth could be contained to about 28 per cent over that period, despite a more than 50 per cent increase in world population. According to the report, known oil reserves are currently large enough to last over 40 years, and natural gas over 65 years. Coal reserves are large enough to last 250 years. But the report doubts that fossil fuels will last beyond the next century because, as oil and gas run out, the use of coal may be accelerated sharply. The WEC believes coal and nuclear power are the two energy sources with strongest long-term prospects. Energy for tomorrow's world. World Energy Council. 320pp. Pounds 35.

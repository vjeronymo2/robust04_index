			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Swedish inflation at record low Swedish inflation fell to 1.9 per cent in December, the lowest annual increase since 1959, Reuter reports from Stockholm. Economists said the effective 20 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona since November 19, making imports dearer, had not yet worked through to the consumer price index. Meanwhile Finnish unemployment rose to a record 18.6 per cent last month, underlining the severity of the recession, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm. The figure compares with 16.9 per cent for November, according to the Labour Ministry. The figures will give new urgency to talks between government and opposition on measures to stimulate the economy.</p>

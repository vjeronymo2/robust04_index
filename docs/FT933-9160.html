			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / People: Owners Abroad Owners Abroad yesterday confirmed that Michael Julien, 55, former chief executive of Storehouse is to become non-executive chairman from the beginning of September. Last month, the holiday company said that group profits this year are likely to be half market expectations. While successfully fighting off a takeover bid from rival Airtours, Owners Abroad had given the impression that its prospects were rosy. Although the group insists the market deteriorated after the bid battle had ended, chairman Howard Klein announced his resignation in July. Prior to Storehouse, Julien was successively finance director of BICC, Midland Bank and Guinness.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers halved FOLLOWING halved profits for the year to March 31, Stoddard Sekers International is cutting its total dividend from 2.625p to 1.5p. Turnover of this manufacturer of carpets and furnishing fabrics rose from Pounds 46m to Pounds 55.4m, reflecting the acquisition of BMK for a 10-month period. On a comparable basis turnover fell 11 per cent, said Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman. Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 3.63m). On top of that interest charges shot up to Pounds 920,000 (Pounds 369,000) arising from the costs and debts assumed with the BMK purchase. That led to the decline in pre-tax profit from Pounds 3.26m to Pounds 1.51m. Earnings worked through at 1.6p (3.8p). The final dividend is cut from 1.875p to 0.75p.</p>

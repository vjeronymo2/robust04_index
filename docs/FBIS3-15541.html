During the visit, it discussed prospects for cooperation  between the two Armies in the materiel and technical sphere,  logistic support, and training of military specialists.    The economic crisis in our republics sharply curtailed the  ability of their Armies to purchase new equipment and weapons.  It is the times and situation that call for the states to  cooperate on a par basis. The barter system and the dollar will  become the foundation for mutual settlements between Belarusian  and Ukrainian Armies.    The sides reached an agreement that Ukraine will commit  itself to training engineering personnel for the Belarusian  Army, in particular, electronics specialists. For its part,  Belarus is ready to offer its military college facilities for  the training of Ukrainian lieutenants. Also, military equipment  surplus will be exchanged or sold to each other.

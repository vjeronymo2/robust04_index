			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MISSING CADDIE COSTS GOLFER HIS SHOT AT A RECORD ROUND  </P> <P> A misplaced caddie cost Doug Miller a two-stroke penalty and a course record.  </P> <P> Miller, a 28-year-old assistant pro from East Norwich, N.Y., shot a 5-under-par  66 to take the lead in the partially completed first round of the New York  State Open on Tuesday, but it should have been a course-record 64 on the  difficult Bethpage State Park's Black course.  </P> <P> He was penalized when he was unable to restart on time after a three-hour  morning rain delay because his caddie didn't show up on the third hole with his  clubs.  </P> <P> "He was waiting inside for me," Miller said. "We crossed signals a bit. It's my  fault. It's the player's responsibility."  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Iraq denies attacks in south IRAQ was quick to deny US reports yesterday that it was attacking villages in the south of the country in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and warnings from President George Bush. The Pentagon reported that there was sporadic shelling by Iraqi forces in the marshes area north of Basra and several villages had been burned. Mr Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said President Saddam Hussein had more than 60,000 troops deployed south of the 32nd parallel, where the air forces of the US, Britain and France have been policing an air exclusion zone since August 27. He added: 'The Iraqi military is continuing its counter insurgency campaign in southern Iraq. They continue to make efforts to build a causeway through the marshes. 'They're burning some villages and there continues to be sporadic shelling,' he said. President Bush has stressed repeatedly in the past few weeks that Iraq must obey UN Resolutions to the letter and few senior officials in Washington appear to doubt that he is prepared to sanction air strikes if Saddam Hussein's defiance continues. Perhaps with this in mind, Baghdad yesterday denied there was any shelling and claimed that prime aim of the US reports was to combat the boredom of its pilots operating the air exclusion zone. Iraq also claimed that its deployment of armoured vehicles close to the Iran border was to stop infiltration by subversives. Similar reports of villages being burned in the south were made last week by Tehran. Iraq said it had begun arming tribesmen in the south so that they could protect themselves against Iranian marauders. US pilots reported making regular radar contact with Iraqi aircraft close to the exclusion zone but they have have not made any attempt to cross the 32nd parallel.</p>

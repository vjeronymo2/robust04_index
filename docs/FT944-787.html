			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tally-ho sounds for elusive German breed - Insider dealers are hard to track down - but the hunt is on The hunt is about to start in earnest for insider traders in Germany, a breed known to exist in abundance but almost impossible to track down. Their elusive nature has been aided by a lack of sanctions and a network of cosy contacts between companies, banks, analysts and journalists. Until now, that is. Since August, insider trading has been punishable with a maximum prison sentence of five years and heavy fines. Profits of insiders caught after the act will have to be handed over to the state. The criminalisation of insider trading is part of a set of legal reforms aimed at making Germany's securities markets more efficient and attractive to investors at home and abroad. From the start of 1995, the scrutiny of insider dealings will be led by a new regulatory body in Frankfurt. Headed by Mr Georg Wittich, a former finance ministry official who dealt with international stock market matters, the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading will operate with an annual budget of DM12m (Dollars 7.60m) and an eventual staff of 97 people. As well as monitoring share transactions, it will ensure that companies publicise as quickly as possible any information that could affect their share prices. Failure to comply with such 'ad hoc publicity' requirements could lead to fines of up to DM3m. Also, shareholdings of 5 per cent in listed companies will have to be notified (as will stakes at thresholds of 10, 25, 50 and 75 per cent). The previous minimum was 25 per cent; fines of up to DM500,000 will apply if the new rules are ignored. As Mr Wittich is aware, it is one thing to pinpoint insider traders, but quite another to convict them. 'We will pursue this task energetically,' he says. Under the previous self-regulatory system, proof was hard to obtain. The system was made tougher after the government and banks became concerned about the damage to Germany's financial image of the previous laxity. European Union guidelines on insider dealings also had to be implemented. In Mr Wittich's view, the knowledge that tough legal penalties now exist will be as important as the actual punishments. 'I am convinced that the existence of an authority with the necessary investigative powers will prove a deterrent to insider dealings.' That may be so, but an early conviction or two may be needed to show the new body has teeth. It will have the power to demand confidential information on possible insider dealings from banks, companies and other sources. This can be passed on to authorities abroad. 'At last, Germany has the full ability to co-operate according to international standards,' says Mr Wittich. 'You can't pursue insider trading on a purely national basis any more.' Using special computer programs, dealings at Germany's eight stock exchanges  -Frankfurt, the world's fourth biggest, accounts for more than 70 per cent of business - will be monitored for any unusual price or volume movements. If such evidence appears, the new organisation will try to run insider culprits to ground. Insider trading has long been a tricky subject in Germany, with flurries of excitement when scandals erupt but rarely any action. The lack of punitive sanctions has hampered any clamp-down on insider information. Last year, Mr Franz Steinkuhler resigned as head of the IG Metall trade union after he had bought shares worth DM1m in Mercedes AG Holding, a Daimler-Benz holding company, just before Daimler announced a share swap with MAH and the latter's shares rose sharply. Since Mr Steinkuhler was on Daimler's supervisory board, his position became untenable once the news of his dealings emerged. He denied insider trading but stepped down from the Daimler board. Eight years previously, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange found that Mr Klaus Kuhn, then head of the AEG supervisory board, had bought shares in the company while takeover talks were continuing with Daimler. He sold the stock at a DM16,000 profit, which he later repaid. Such affairs hardly helped Frankfurt's reputation. 'The fact that insider trading was not liable to prosecution met with scepticism,' said Landeszentralbank in Hessen, the regional central bank for the state of Hesse in which Frankfurt is located. 'This was one of the reasons why foreign investors favoured the London financial market, even for their D-Mark transactions in domestic securities. Greater confidence in the supervisory system will strengthen the competitiveness of Frankfurt as an international financial centre.' The ad hoc publicity and disclosure rules will also give investors more information. Under the old rules, companies could accumulate large stakes (as Krupp did with Hoesch steel, before buying it in 1991) without the target company knowing. This will no longer be possible. Nor will the German practice of 'fireside chats', at which selected journalists are fed titbits of news. For smaller companies, complying with the ad hoc rules could be a nightmare. 'They may not know what the capital market wants,' said an investor relations official at one big German industrial concern. It is Mr Wittich's job to see they find out quickly, as well as to root out investors who abuse insider information.</p>

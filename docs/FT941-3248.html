			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Fed cops patrol speeding US economy: The outlook for interest rates in the light of soaring growth The US economy is like a speeding juggernaut and the US Federal Reserve like a traffic cop. Last month the Fed delivered a mild warning in the shape of a quarter point increase in short-term interest rates to 3.25 per cent. When Fed governors and regional presidents meet in Washington next week they may decide sterner action will soon be required. If the Fed was concerned by the pace of growth in early February, it ought to be doubly concerned today. In recent weeks revised figures have shown the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, rather than the 5.9 per cent at first reported. The jobless rate has fallen faster than expected and, at 6.5 per cent, is only fractionally higher than the level previously associated with rising wage inflation. Adjusting for severe weather, economic data since January have been uniformly stronger than expected. Sales and production of cars and light trucks are booming. Retail spending is robust despite a temporary dip in construction activity: according to the Johnson Redbook survey, sales in early March were running 14 per cent higher than last year. Industrial production appears to be growing at an annual rate of 7-8 per cent this quarter  - a slight acceleration from late last year. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing has jumped to 82.6 per cent, just short of the 83 per cent level seen as a trigger for price increases. This week bond investors were relieved that rapid growth does not yet appear to be putting much upward pressure on broad measures of inflation. But the encouraging consumer and producer price figures do not alter the interest rate outlook much because Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has signalled that the purpose of tightening policy is not to fight an inflation threat today but rather to prevent inflation getting out of hand in 1995 and 1996. Looking forward, the Fed will note that traditional leading indicators of inflation are beginning to creep higher. These include commodity prices (other than oil), the price indices compiled by purchasing managers, and various measures of capacity utilisation. The Fed is also aware that the European and Japanese economies are starting to show signs of improvement. The prospect of a concerted surge in demand in 1995 significantly strengthens the case for a pre-emptive tightening of US monetary policy this year. Analysts are divided over the likely timing and magnitude of increases in short-term rates. At one extreme, JP Morgan, the New York bank, believes the sharp rise in long bond yields in recent weeks to nearly 7 per cent is fully justified. Morgan economists argue that the economy has lost little momentum since the second half of last year when real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent. They expect growth of more than 4 per cent this year and predict the Fed will raise short rates to 5 per cent by the end of this year and 6 per cent by the middle of next year. This would not be out of line with previous business cycles. The average increase in short rates in the last six episodes of Fed tightening was nearly 5.7 percentage points. Excluding the inflationary 1970s, the increase was 3.8 percentage points, which would suggest short rates could rise to about 7 per cent in the next few years. Other economists believe the recovery is less robust and predict the rate of economic growth will decline in the second half of this year to 3 per cent or less. They doubt the Fed will need to act as aggressively as in past cycles in part because the risk of a big rise in inflation seems slight and in part because the bond market is now hyper-sensitive to inflationary pressures. 'The rise in bond yields is disciplining the real economy and helping the Fed do its job,' says Mr Bill Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The argument is that the surprisingly rapid steepening of the yield curve will curb some of the most buoyant sectors  - such as housing and business investment  - and hence reduce the required increase in short rates. The timing of any rate increases is also hotly debated. Mr Greenspan has a reputation for gradualism, which suggests he may be contemplating small quarter point increases every few months. But some analysts, such as Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corporation, a New York brokerage, argue that such tactics would amount to Chinese water torture. Rather than creating a prolonged period of uncertainty, they say, the Fed should rapidly raise rates to the 'neutral' level mentioned by Mr Greenspan in recent congressional testimony. This is widely taken to imply rates of 4-5 per cent. With the agony over, bond and share markets might then be able to recover their equilibrium, if not last year's high spirits.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   PREVIOUS EPISODES OF FED TIGHTENING  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Rise in Fed                           Duration    funds rate       From/to                          (quarters)   (basis pts)    (per cent)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1961 Q3 to 1966 Q4           21           390       1.7 to  5.6 1967 Q3 to 1969 Q3            9           510       3.9 to  9.0 1972 Q1 to 1974 Q3           10           850       3.5 to 12.0 1977 Q1 to 1980 Q1           12          1040       4.7 to 15.1 1983 Q1 to 1984 Q3            6           270       8.7 to 11.4 1987 Q1 to 1989 Q2            9           350       6.2 to  9.7 Average:                     11           568 Average ex-1970s:            11           380  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: JP Morgan  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

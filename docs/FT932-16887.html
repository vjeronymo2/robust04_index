			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK pledges to maintain Aids research drive THE UK government yesterday pledged to maintain Aids research efforts in the face of the AZT trial results, which ministers and Aids organisations admitted were disappointing. 'Over the past 10 years a great deal has been learnt about HIV and how it damages the immune system, but these results show what little progress has been made in discovering drugs which can keep people healthy for any length of time,' said Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the UK's main Aids charity. The trust is calling for greater investment in research co-ordinated between governments and pharmaceutical companies. Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister, stressed that a 'great deal of effort' would go on, with the UK government expecting to spend Pounds 200m on research and treatment in the coming year. He said the disappointing research results reinforced the need for people to recognise that Aids could be prevented by taking appropriate precautions. HIV/Aids and sexual health is one of the target objectives of the UK government's 'Health of the Nation' strategy, aimed at improving overall health standards in the country. The strategy attaches importance to obtaining better information about the prevalence of HIV among the population, and since 1990 the UK department of health has run a programme of anonymised surveys. The World Health Organisation estimates that 10m people worldwide are HIV-positive. In the UK, the first survey results have indicated rates of one in 500 for women attending London ante-natal clinics. Tests at London genito-urinary clinics show prevalence rates of one in five for homosexual and bisexual men, and one in 100 for heterosexual men. Aids workers are concerned that the Concorde study results - suggesting that early AZT treatment of those infected with HIV fails to delay the onset of Aids - may discourage people at risk coming forward for testing and counselling, if they believe there is no treatment available.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Revenge Is the Only Option"] </F>   [Text] As usual with every crime that the Zionists  perpetrate against Muslims inside and outside the occupied  territories, official statements have been issued full of the  usual rhetoric and the media has overflowed with denunciations  and condemnations. Official authorities hastened to contain the  popular reaction and called for self-restraint and responsible  behavior. Popular reaction was far ahead of the authorities.  The masses have maintained sincere feelings and a sound  awareness for 42 years. Whenever the Jews have dealt their  barbaric blows to Muslims, the main preoccupation of the  governments has not been to react to these attacks but to  contain the mass anger and control public unrest.    This continued until the regimes' policies overcame the  reaction of the man in the street. The majority of the people  thus began to pay scant attention to the violation of the  nation's dignity and the desecration of its sacred places. Many  of the older generation who are suffering from repression and  pain yearn for the 1950's, when popular awareness was boiling  from the Gulf to the ocean and the streets were erupting with  demonstrations. These were the people's recourse for their  political impotence and a necessary venting of their emotions  over the wounds to their dignity and their defeat.    But regrettably, yesterday's vigor no longer exists. Many of  the patriotic and national forces have retreated and lost their  zeal. Only the Islamic forces have remained in the arena, and  they are being pursued and attacked by the authorities and  cursed by the international forces, which accuse them of  terrorism and of being opposed to peace.    The extent of the anger that cannot be kept pent up is  evinced by the extent of the official organs' efforts to  consolidate the defeat and present a fait accompli. This was  clearly shown in everyone's desire to continue the peace process  and their calls to protect it from collapse.    The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is the bloody fruit of a  peace resulting from a defeatist and capitulationist mentality.  What peace is this they are talking about and what is its  philosophy if its price is more killings, destruction,  massacres, and violations of Palestinian human rights?    How can there be coexistence when the Jews are acting  according to the Talmud, which advocates the annihilation of the  Muslims and legitimizes the shedding of their blood?    The Zionist concept of peace is the peace of the Jews and  their security, not peace for the Palestinians and their  recovery of their lands. What the international and regional  capitals are saying about peace is only a trick to defuse  popular anger and to calm the hearts that have been shaken by  this barbaric crime.    The hurried U.S. call for the resumption of the peace talks  in Washington and everyone's eagerness to blame the incident on  sick madmen suffering from psychological complexes are only  designed to justify the logic of the false peace, while  asserting that this peace will solve our problems, make everyone  happy, and restore normality.    But this crime indicates something completely different. Its  planners chose to carry it out in a sacred place and at a holy  time in a clear indication of the essence and core of the  conflict. It is a conflict between two systems and  civilizations, one divine and the other earthly, one that  embodies harmony with what God wants and the other hostile to  God and propagating discrimination and the inequality of peoples.    The Zionist Jews' concept of security demands nothing less  than the exclusion and annihilation of the Muslim Palestinians  and depriving them of the right to life and to their land.  Hence, the logic of confrontation must take account of the real  Zionist objectives. No understanding can be reached with a  criminal enemy through the logic of the defeated peace. Real,  practical action that deprives the Zionists of their security  and safety is the only possible reply that can restore a balance  to the conflict formula.    Indifference, laxity, and dependence on negotiations will  not  restore wasted dignity or lost rights. The blood of innocent  Palestinians shed in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is merely the price  for the ostrich policy that is pursued in the region in regard  to the criminal enemy. If Muslims were in the habit of  returning blow for blow, the Zionists would not have been so  confident that they could commit their crimes so easily. There  is only one logic that the nation should follow undeviatingly in  its struggle with the enemies: namely, the logic of  steadfastness, resistance, and escalation of the confrontation,  not withdrawal and retreat. Retreat has always paved the way  for the enemies to commit more crimes. The Muslims have had  enough retreats and humiliation and everyone should now shout  for revenge. Let the secularists and pragmatists stop offering  their advice and logic, which have only compounded the nation's  humiliation and degradation.</p>

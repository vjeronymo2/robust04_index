			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Anyone for golf, chaps?: Fishing IT HAS ALWAYS been a source of wonder, and some irritation, to me that so many otherwise sensible and civilised people should be obsessed with golf. I cannot make up my mind which aspect of the game is most off-putting: the self-importance of the committee types who run it: the pettifogging rules they impose; the manicured artificiality of courses; or the inherent dullness of hitting a stationary ball and walking after it to hit it again. I dallied with golf a while ago, mastered its basics (mastered might not be quite the mot juste), then put it aside. I felt that golf and fishing were spiritually antipathetic and that I had to make a statement about where I stood. In the light of the start of the new trout fishing season, however, I am reviewing my options, reassessing my priorities and considering the possibility of rowing back. Like President Clinton's first 100 days, my first week did not fulfill expectations. The advantage of golf, I now realise, is that you are either playing it or you are not playing it. This might sound ridiculous; but what I mean is that, when playing golf, you place the ball on the tee and you hit it. It might land in a duckpond or a bramble thicket, but there is no doubt that you are playing golf. What, though, of the fisherman who has on his waders and coat, his bag and net slung over his back, his rod in his hand - but is not casting his fly? Is he really fishing when all he is doing is stalking up and down the banks, staring at the water, and cursing the absence of visible fish life? I think not. My first outing was on the last Tuesday in April. On the whole, I do not believe in April trout fishing: May 1 is the time for the off. But I had played cricket that Sunday (caught at mid-on for six, if you must know), and it had been balmy enough to persuade me that the season was advanced enough for trout to be on the look-out for the first titbits of the year. This opinion was not shared by the trout. Titbits there were in the shape of hairy, black hawthorns dropping occasionally from air to water. But the fish kept their noses down. I prowled around for a couple of hours, noted the marvellously beneficial effect on the river of a winter's decent rainfall, and scarcely bothered to cast. Give it a week, I thought. I gave it a week. Sunday's cricket had been decidedly chilly (given out leg-before for two by an umpire who was corrupt, or senile, or both), and the chill persisted. I made a bad start by looking at the book in the fishing hut in which members are obliged to record their catches. The theory behind looking at the book is sound. If others are catching fish, the confidence that you will do the same should rise. On the other hand, if they are not catching anything, you are reassured that you can do no worse. So much for the theory. I found that they had been catching fish, and big ones - three over 4lb and one six-pounder. They had all, I noted resentfully, been taken the previous Friday and Saturday when it had been warm and sunny, with a soft breeze from the south. Now, though, it was dry and the wind from the north-east was cold and discouraging. I reminded myself that those who write about fishing must fish to have anything to write about, then set off. My morning was entirely barren, as I could not find a feeding fish anywhere. I met another member, who agreed that there was no sort of a rise before confessing, with an intolerable smile, that he had managed a brace, one just above 4lb and the other just below. I asked him what fly he was using. He showed me something that looked like the business end of a garden broom. 'Doesn't look like anything on the water,' he smirked, 'but they seem to like it.' A little while later, I found a rising fish. It looked like a tiddler, so I was more than usually ill-prepared when it took, tore across the stream (ripping line off the reel) and rushed through a weed bed. By the time it came out the other side, the connection between fish and fly was no more. Muttering grimly, I stomped off to a distant part of the river where I was sure they would be feeding. I took a short cut - which involved climbing over a barbed wire fence, on which I tore my waders - and found they were not feeding. I continued on my way, at almost every step disturbing wild fowl which flapped, quacking, into the air before belly-flopping on all likely fish-holding spots upstream. At last, I returned to the hut, wrote 'Fort - nil' in the damned book and left. Since then, I have acquired some old golf clubs. I am eyeing them now, recalling the sweet satisfaction of following the progress of a cleanly-driven ball, the smell of a mown fairway, the laughs, the comradeship. Perhaps . . .</p>

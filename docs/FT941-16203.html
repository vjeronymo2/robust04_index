			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices end erratic session with a rally - Market Report A highly volatile, but finally unconvincing, session in London stocks saw share prices consolidating around existing levels rather than developing any new trends. Non-Footsie stocks again attracted significant interest although, here again, the focus was on con-solidation. Traders expressed concern over the volatility which has featured equities since Christmas. Stock index futures led share prices yesterday but there was no sign of specific pressures in the derivatives markets. Hopes for base rate cuts appeared to have been put back to spring once more, and weakness in government bonds took the bounce out of the stock market. A strong start to the new Wall Street session gave a closing boost to a London market which had moved through a near 40-point Footsie range earlier in the day. Marketmakers were still struggling to attract stocks to replenish their trading books. At its final reading the FT-SE 100 Index was down 5.4 at 3,440.6. London opened well, hoping for a continuation of Friday's advance, but was undermined when the stock index futures refused to support the initial optimism. A gain of 22 Footsie points in pre-trading was quickly wiped off within a few minutes of the opening of the derivatives markets. Shares then drifted down and the Footsie showed a loss of 16 points as it waited for Wall Street to open. The rally in London came slowly, as the Dow Industrial Average gained 15 points in UK trading hours. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also gave ground, slipping 11.1 to 3,901.4. But trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 66 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 849.1m shares, well above daily averages. Stock exchange statistics disclosed that Friday's Seaq volume of 1.4bn shares was worth Pounds 2.25bn in retail business, nearly twice the daily average for last year. This bore out suggestions that the big institutions have been busy reshaping their portfolios, often moving out of selected blue chips and into second line issues. In an unusual development, last week saw the FT-SE Mid 250 Index setting the pace for the blue chip sectors. This has in part been prompted by the powerful influence exerted on the Footsie stocks from the derivatives market, which has given rise to some concern over the valuations put on the Footsie list by the pre-Christmas boom. The market was held back by the less buoyant mood in oil shares, as well as by caution among some domestic sectors as they awaited the January round of profits statements. Uncertainty still hung over the retail sector as it looked for definitive news from the Christmas sales. However, some analysts believe that any weakness in retail sales might benefit the stock market by prompting the cut in base rates on which a further advance in share prices appears to depend. Some other consumer sectors ran into profit-takers and the banks, which outperformed strongly in December, were mostly easier ahead of their trading statements - the exception being TSB which opens the season later this week. London's ready response to Wall Street was seen as a promising indication of underlying confidence. Hopes that interest rates can remain low in the US revived last week, contrasting with the bout of nervousness over the US economy suffered in the previous week.</p>

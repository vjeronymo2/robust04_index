			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect him,  has presided over a cabinet meeting, the fifth since his  excellency the president assumed the premiership on 30 May.    During its fifth meeting, the cabinet continued its  discussion of some economic issues that were debated during the  previous meetings.    When the issue of economic inflation was raised, the leader  president made some remarks, saying: The Iraqi performance in  terms of production and reconstruction, despite this artificial  and transient inflation in the Iraqi economy, has been promoted  over the past few years, thanks to the Iraqis' minds, as well as  their role in building the future.    The leader president added: As you are well aware, the  reconstruction drive has been carried out thanks to legendary  efforts made in a legendary time period, and at low cost. This  is especially true if such a drive were to be conducted by  foreign companies. Many times the time spent and cost sustained  would have to be made available to such companies if the results  achieved by the Iraqi national endeavor were to be attained.  Additionally, Iraq's wealth has remained intact. It is still  underground. None of it has been disbursed. It has not fallen  under the domination of foreign colonialist powers. Nor has it  been plundered by these powers. Moreover, oil installations  have been rebuilt. Oil is ready to be exported once the embargo  is lifted.    His excellency the president went on to say: He who makes a  naive comparison between the exchange rate of the dinar and that  of the dollar is gravely mistaken. For can a man live on two  dollars in the United States, or even on 10 dollars, and still  eat meat?    The leader president said: So, this is not the real value of  the Iraqi dinar. For, the Iraqi dinar is supported by a broad  and extensive base of work, activities, and accomplishments, not  to mention the ration card, free education, health services, and  other services. It is true that the price of 10 dollars is too  much if these dollars were to be exchanged for dinars. But, as  a matter of fact, Iraqis can, by paying an equivalent of 100  dollars, buy more commodities and services than those Americans  can buy by paying 100 dollars. The exception to this concerns  the prices of certain imported commodities.    The Council then discussed red tape at state departments and  its side effects. His excellency the president addressed the  cabinet ministers: The disequilibrium in public offices has not  emerged overnight. Likewise, we realize that it is impossible  to correct it in a single day. Nonetheless, the level of your  hard work at present is being felt by all citizens, who feel  that their state has become more active and vibrant. To correct  mistakes in administrative functions, we need to focus on some  aspects concerning citizens' affairs and transactions in order  to simplify them. In the same vein, we need to work  energetically and actively to correct the mistakes and  deviations rapidly and firmly, because this is required by the  phase we are experiencing. If we do so, this will deter those  who make mistakes and hearten correctors. Consequently, the  determination will grow further. We want your resolve to be at  a high level on the first day. We want you to demonstrate  greater vigor until the day the remedial action is completed.  This is because any weakness in resolve will bring about new  deviations. So, what is required now is determination,  increased determination, and stronger determination.    The leader president said: The emergence of some deviations  in our country causes us harm. It also harms the march, which  you and your people seek to safeguard. Hence, we must work to  make the deviant constantly feel that he will not go unpunished  regardless of how long this might take. Your handling of red  tape should not be guided by conventional methods. The minister  himself must personally examine all transactions that concern  citizens step by step. He must delve into details, cut back on  the required procedures, paperwork, and references as much as he  can. He must set a time limit for this, and submit proposals if  necessary to amend regulations or laws. Likewise, he must  submit a copy of the measures he thinks can reduce red tape to  the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers so we may discuss  them at our cabinet meetings.</p>

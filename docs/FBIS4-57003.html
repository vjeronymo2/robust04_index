			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 9 May (EFE) -- Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza reported today that this week the  Chilean Government will extend an official invitation to Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Santiago.    He said Robaina's visit will be part of a tour that the  Cuban  foreign minister will make of Southern Cone countries in the  next few months, adding that the invitation "entails nothing  special" within the relations between the two nations.    Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations in 1973.  Consular-level relations were reestablished in 1990 at the end  of the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990,  following the election of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994) as Chilean  president).    Insulza said the Chilean Government considers an exchange of  opinions with the Cuban foreign minister on the Cuban situation  and the political situation in the hemisphere will be "very  useful."    He added that there is no specific agenda for Robaina's  visit, but he emphasized, among other topics, the commercial  blockade and the sidelining of Cuba from the inter-American  system, a situation that has impeded official contacts with the  Caribbean country, [would be discussed].    Other sources reported that the agenda will also include the  signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement that Chilean  officials announced last week, when Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa reiterated that the reestablishment of  diplomatic relations is not a short-term objective of the  Chilean Government.    Concerning relations, Insulza said that even though some  events in Cuba -- like the dialogue with exiles and the most  recent economic measures -- are regarded as positive, the  political regime continues "to pose substantive obstacles" to  the reestablishment of relations.    "We have no diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the decision  to reestablish them should be made by the president (Eduardo  Frei)," Insulza said.    He added that the Chilean foreign policy "seeks to maintain  relations with all countries," but this calls for "a political  evaluation," because there must be a "consensus" among all  sectors "with due consideration for the interests of the nation."</p>

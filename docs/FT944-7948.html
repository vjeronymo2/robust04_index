			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Incentive surges to SKr1.54bn after sale of 43% Esab interest Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, saw profits surge to SKr1.54bn (Dollars 210m) in the first nine months, compared with SKr66m in the same 1993 period. The figure, which excludes associated companies, was swollen by a SKr900m capital gain from the sale of the company's 43 per cent stake in Esab, the world's leading supplier of welding equipment, to Charter, the UK industrial group, for SKr1.4bn. The performance benefited from economic recovery, increased market shares, and acquisitions. These helped to offset higher financial costs. The group's purchase of Gambro, a medical equipment specialist, and MacGregor-Navire, the world's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, helped lift sales 49 per cent to SKr12.4bn. The underlying increase was 12 per cent. Orders were up sharply, rising 70 per cent in real terms and 22 per cent in underlying terms to SKr15.5bn. Including income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab, included, profits rose to SKr2.71bn from SKr642m. Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said he expected earnings to continue to develop favourably. He added that the group had seen a 'distinct recovery' in western Europe, while North America and Asia continued to develop favourably. Incentive gained a majority stake in Gambro through an SKr8bn bid for Cardo, an investment company, during the summer. It has sold about SKr1.9bn worth of equities from Cardo's SKr2.7bn portfolio and plans to relist the remainder of the company early next year.</p>

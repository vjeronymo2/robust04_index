			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POPE INVITED TO VISIT BEIRUT  </P> <P> The spiritual leader of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah group invited Pope John  Paul II to visit war-ravaged Beirut and guaranteed his security in the city's  Muslim western sector. The invitation by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, made  in an interview with the Rome daily La Repubblica, came amid growing  speculation in Italy that the pontiff could make a visit next month. The  Vatican has confirmed it is trying to arrange a papal trip to Lebanon. An  editorial in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said John Paul wants to  go to Lebanon as a pilgrim to a martyred land. Fadlallah has criticized the  Pope for championing the Christians in Beirut while accusing the Muslims of  trying to destroy Christian areas of the city.  </P></p>

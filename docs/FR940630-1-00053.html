			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (j) travel for indirect work <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, OMB guidelines require agencies to use 1,800 average annual hours available for work and 280 average annual leave hours (all types of leave) for computing manpower requirements. From the OMB guidelines, the ratio of yearly leave hours to average annual hours available for work (280 divided by 1800) is computed at 0.16. Thus, the indirect work factor for billing purposes is computed using the following formula: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w159,d35 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEP30JN94.000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> where: a=indirect work rate, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b=leave usage (total leave hours divided by total hours available for work). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This computation yields an indirect work factor of 1.66, which is computed from (1+0.43)(1+0.16). The indirect work factor shows that the FAA actually pays for 1.66 hours for each direct billable hour of ASI time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hourly inspector billing rate is determined by multiplying the $48.11 hourly government paid rate by the indirect work factor of 1.66 to arrive at the hourly ASI billing rate of $79.81, or $80 rounded to the nearest dollar. The proposed hourly billing rate of $80 per ASI hour is applied to airman and repair station certification actions as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed fixed fees for airman certification were derived by multiplying the proposed ASI billing rate of $80 by the total time used in the Flight Standards Staffing Standard or airman test guidelines as necessary to complete each certification activity. The FAA is not proposing fixed fees for the certification of air agencies, such as airman schools and repair stations, because the time involved in certificating these facilities varies widely and therefore there is no average staffing standard time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For certification actions where there is no fixed fee, as air agency certifications, this notice proposes that applicants, at the time of application, submit a prepaid deposit at the hourly ASI billing rate of $80 per hour for the minimum estimated time required to complete the certification applied for, as determined by the certifying Flight Standards Office (FSO). When the certification effort is completed, the applicant would either receive a refund or submit the additional amount due, depending upon the time actually required for certification, plus transportation and subsistence expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The charges to applicants by the FAA for inspector transportation and subsistence expenses, are governed by Federal Travel Regulations, and would reflect the cost expended by the FAA on the requested certification action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Future Revisions to the Fee Schedule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA plans to review actual costs incurred in the certification efforts every year, at the beginning of the fiscal year, using the same fee methodology described above, and, the FAA proposes to amend the fee schedule on an annual basis to either increase or decrease fees. Each amended fee schedule would be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and published in an FAA Advisory Circular on the subject of Inspector Fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed fee schedule that would be established as a result of this rulemaking is contained in the attached Table to this NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fee Collection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For airman certification actions, the FAA would collect the fee at the time of application for a certification, rating or approval, after first ascertaining the applicant's eligibility. The FSO or designated examiner would determine whether the applicant meets the preliminary eligibility requirements, such as age and currency. If these requirements are met, the FSO would issue a receipt as evidence of payment, ensure the deposit of fees into a U.S. Treasury approved bank, and forward the fee deposit information to the regional accounting office serving the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this NPRM, payments for services rendered by FAA inspectors would have to be in the form of a check, money order, draft, or wire transfer, and would have to be payable in U.S. currency to the FAA and drawn on a U.S. bank. Bank processing fees may also be added to the fees charged to applicants, where such processing fees are charged to U.S. Government accounts. No application would be acted upon until evidence of payment by the applicant has been presented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, there would be no refund of any fee paid for FAA certification services, including fees paid for any airman test, approval, or authorization that an applicant fails to pass. However, if an applicant notifies the FAA of a test cancellation at least one week prior to a scheduled examination, the FAA would refund the fee after deducting a minimal service charge to cover the cost of processing the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of a request for airman certification and repair station facility certifications (air agency certification), applicants would submit as prepayment a deposit in the amount specified by the certifying FSO. This prepayment would be based on the estimated minimum number of hours that an ASI would need to certificate the facility, as determined by the FSO performing the service. The hourly rate to be paid for the inspector's time would be the rate specified in Appendix A of Part 187. If the cost to complete the certification is less than the amount prepaid by the applicant, the FAA would submit to the applicant a refund to cover the difference between the prepayment and the actual charges. Conversely, if the cost is greater, the applicant would be required to submit the additional charges. As in the case of airman certificates, applicants for air agency certification would have to pay the required fees, regardless of whether an FAA certificate is issued. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

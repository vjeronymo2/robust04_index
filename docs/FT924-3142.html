			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reprieve sought by Fulham fans Fulham Football Club supporters are lobbying Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, whose decision is awaited over a plan to build flats on the club's Craven Cottage ground in west London. The planning process has ground on in spite of the recent appointment of liquidators at Cabra Estates, which owns Fulham's ground. Fulham and Hammersmith council rejected Cabra's application to redevelop the ground and Cabra appealed. Hence the inquiry, which the council said was completed in September.</p>

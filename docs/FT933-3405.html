			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Select Appts cuts losses to Pounds 692,000 Select Appointments, the USM-quoted international employment agency, cut its first half pre-tax losses from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 692,000. The figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 415,000 (Pounds 416,000). These will be reduced in the second half following the repayment of borrowings to its parent, Waverley, out of the proceeds of the preference share issue in July. Turnover increased from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 12.7m, reflecting the recent acquisitions in the US, Hong Kong and London, which are expected to benefit performance in the second half. There was a loss per share of 0.32p (0.44p).</p>

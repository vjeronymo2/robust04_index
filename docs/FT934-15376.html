			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Drambuie abandons strategy DRAMBUIE, the liqueur company, yesterday terminated a widely-publicised strategy of diversification by selling Caithness Glass, an ornamental glassmaker. Caithness has been bought by its management and employees, with backing from Bank of Scotland and from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Negotiations on the sale began in February. The price was not disclosed. Drambuie, a secretive company controlled by the McKinnon family, bought Caithness for Pounds 3.38m in 1991 and said that it would be seeking further acquisitions outside the drinks business. However, Drambuie lost Pounds 5.6m in 1991 on sales of Pounds 38.8m and in 1992 Mr Peter Shakeshaft, the finance and development director who was responsible for buying Caithness left the company. Caithness itself was badly hit by recession and last year closed one of its three factories with the loss of 120 jobs. It now employs 240 people. Last year Mr David Evans became Drambuie's first non-family chairman, replacing Mrs Mary McKinnon. Shortly afterwards Mr Peter Darbyshire, a drinks industry executive, became managing director replacing Mr Malcolm McKinnon and Mr Duncan McKinnon, joint managing directors. Although Drambuie lost Pounds 6.7m in 1992 it expects to make a profit of Pounds 2m in 1993. The workforce has been cut from 175 to 125. In March, Drambuie sold off Cockburn's of Leith, its wine merchant business. The only company it owns outside the liqueur business is Glenvarigill, a Scottish motor dealer.</p>

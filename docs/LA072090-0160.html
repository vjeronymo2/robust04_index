			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEFENSE CHIEFS CHENEY, ARENS MEET;  </P> <P> FIRST TALKS SINCE HARD-LINE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FORMED  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met today with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe  Arens in the first high-level talks between the two countries since  establishment of a hard-line Israeli government.  </P> <P> At the same time, the State Department announced that Secretary of State James  A. Baker III will meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Washington on  Aug. 9 or 10.  </P> <P> The hasty meeting with Cheney, announced Thursday in Jerusalem and Washington,  was set up shortly after Arens was named defense minister last month, a Defense  Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Pentagon discussions and next month's meeting appeared to signal a slight  warming of relations between the two countries, which have been strained since  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the rightist Likud bloc, balked at  Baker's plan for a dialogue with Palestinians to prepare for Palestinian  elections.  </P> <P> While Cheney and Arens talked at a Pentagon lunch, State Department spokeswoman  Margaret Tutwiler also faced questions about the postponement of a scheduled  meeting of a joint committee that coordinates the nearly $2 billion in U.S.  military aid to Israel.  </P> <P> Tutwiler denied the move was a slap at Shamir's new government.  </P> <P> "The postponement was an agreement between the United States government and the  Israeli government. As you know, we are in the midst of a budget summit and  there's a great deal of work associated with the summit negotiations," she  said.  </P> <P> "As a result of that, we've postponed the annual joint security assistant  planning meeting and have mutually agreed with Israel to hold it in September  to give us more time to prepare."  </P> <P> Cheney and Arens were not expected to discuss Middle East peace efforts,  leaving that for Baker and Levy. The United States is still awaiting a  definitive Israeli answer to its proposals to start a peace dialogue with  Palestinians.  </P> <P> The Pentagon discussions are the first at the ministerial level between Israel  and the United States since formation of a right-wing Israeli government in  June.  </P> <P> Arens initiated his visit when Cheney contacted him to congratulate him on  being named defense minister, a Pentagon spokesman said.  </P> <P> "These talks are part of a longstanding series of discussions between the  United States and Israeli defence secretaries, and with other friends, about a  whole range of security issues," the spokesman added.  </P> <P> A Pentagon spokesman denied that the Arens-Cheney meeting was in response to  any specific situation, but did not rule out discussions of the Israeli-made,  U.S.-funded Arrow missile.  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Turnround at Campbell &amp; Armstrong CAMPBELL &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, swung from losses of Pounds 849,000 to profits of Pounds 30,000 pre-tax for the six months ended September 30. Turnover slipped to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 31.3m) reflecting a 'more prudent approach to tendering' as overall margins remained under pressure.

Earnings of 0.4p compared with previous losses of 4.5p. The shares closed 3p higher at 17p.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Respect for the elderly: The influence of the independent Bank of Italy on its centenary Behind his desk, Mr Antonio Fazio, governor of the Bank of Italy, has placed an oil painting of the martyr Saint Sebastian being pierced by arrows. Mr Fazio, who took over as governor six months ago, jokes: 'It reminds me of all the agonising problems I face.' However, this week the 57-year-old expert in monetary theory is momentarily casting aside his problems to celebrate, along with some 40 other central bank governors, the centenary of the Bank of Italy. The bank, which started life as a joint stock company and which only became the sole bank of issue in 1926, has reason to celebrate. Its imposing structure in the heart of old Rome was conceived as the 'strongbox of unified Italy'. This is what it has been, and still is: the one institution in modern Italy to have preserved its dignity and reputation. Alone during the recent wave of corruption scandals, the bank has stood aloof and untainted. In tribute to the bank's special status, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor for 13 years, was chosen as prime minister in May. He was accepted as the sole figure with the necessary authority and impartiality to govern Italy in a difficult period of political and economic transition. Since the early 1980s, by agreement with the government, the bank has gradually divorced itself from the Treasury, so that today its independent status is similar to that of Germany's Bundesbank. Today, both formally and legally the governor decides interest rates and is not obliged to underwrite the Treasury's financial needs. 'Monetary financing of the treasury has been abolished, de facto since 1990 and by law just a few weeks ago,' says Mr Fazio. The government, he insists, is at arm's length. 'No representatives of the government participate in the bank's decisions on monetary policy, nor do these decisions require formal ratification by the government.' The moves towards independence reflect the trend in European central banking. But in the Bank of Italy's case, independence also represented a deliberate distancing of itself from its role in the 1960s and 1970s under Mr Guido Carli (1960-75) and Mr Paolo Baffi (1975-79) when the bank acted as adviser to the government. Mr Carli in particular saw the bank as a clearing house for power struggles between members of the nation's ruling class, according to economic historian Prof Vera Zamagni. The price of such influence was that the bank became the scapegoat in 1979 for a credit scandal in state industries which led to politically-inspired judicial prosecutions. Mr Baffi, the governor, and his deputy, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, were forced to resign. Although both men were subsequently exonerated in full, the incident bruised bank morale. But if 'divorce' from the treasury has brought independence, that has not necessarily been translated into greater authority outside the spheres of monetary policy and banking supervision. 'It is by no means certain that independence is synonymous with influence,' says one senior member of the bank. During the last government of Mr Giulio Andreotti from 1989-92, the Bank of Italy had a free hand with monetary policy and ministers accepted its strict adherence to fixed exchange rates in the European exchange rate mechanism, despite protests from industrialists. Yet no amount of advice from Mr Ciampi about the public sector deficit and the increasing mountain of national debt had any effect on the politicians who controlled fiscal policy. As prime minister, Mr Andreotti never had a single formal meeting with Mr Ciampi in three years. In contrast, first with the government of Mr Giuliano Amato and then with the Ciampi administration, the relationship has been both warmer and more constructive. Mr Fazio, for his part, has not been intimidated by the prospect of lecturing his former boss. The 1994 austerity budget, he recently told parliament, does not go far enough in attacking the deficit. This could well be a point of conflict with future governments. Mr Fazio sees the bank as having a strong educative function in economic policy, using the full resources of its large research department. Arguably this is the most important economic think tank in the country and working there has become a compulsory rite of passage for bank high fliers. The bank always housed a wide intellectual range and never discriminated against marxists. Today, the prevailing flavour may be monetarist but labels are disliked. Mr Fazio is a devout Catholic who, for a central banker, is surprisingly open about his social conscience. He has been outspoken on unemployment. 'The objectives of the Bank of Italy reflect the ultimate goal of defending the external and above all the internal value of the lira in a setting of orderly economic activity and growth. For Italy, in particular, this means defending the economically vulnerable and protecting savings,' he says. So far the new governor has had an easy ride on foreign exchange policy with the lira floating since September 1992. He is not prepared to hazard the future. 'As regards the lira's floating, the problem is not so much deciding on the lira's re-entry into the ERM at some stage, as deciding what that mechanism is or should be.' Critics fault the bank for complacency over its own remarkable record that allows officials to live too much in an ivory tower, and not sufficiently attuned to the fast-moving world outside. The bank was, for instance, stung by criticism that it should have foreseen and prevented the collapse of the Ferruzzi empire, Italy's second biggest private company, because of the information on its central credit register. But the bank has made an important contribution the development of modern Italy, especially after the second world war. And, as Italy now moves towards a general election early next year and the disappearance of an entire political system, an added burden falls on the bank to ensure financial stability and economic continuity. The governor himself occupies a unique position in Italy being the sole institutional official not directly appointed by the government and whose term of office is indefinite. This means Mr Fazio could be the only institutional figure to span the full period of the transition: an uncomfortable position for the governor of the bank whose role in economic policy was described by his predecessor, Mr Carli, as like 'driving a car with only an accelerator and a brake'.</p>

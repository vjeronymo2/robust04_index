			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Clash heightens confusion over Brazil economy THE conflicting signals emerging from the Brazilian government on economic policy intensified over the weekend with a showdown between President Itamar Franco and his economics team over interest rates. The confusion started on Friday night when the Central Bank announced a 0.5 percentage-point rise in interest rates to keep up with inflation, which is running at around 30 per cent a month, its highest rate for three years. A furious Mr Franco countered with an official note reversing the decision, and adding: 'High interest rates generate recession and unemployment and are ineffective in containing inflation.' Since taking office in December, Mr Franco has made low interest rates to spur growth his main policy plank. In the absence of fiscal reform, however, real interest rates remain the government's only weapon against inflation and they have been rising steadily this month. Economic uncertainty has pushed overnight market rates to 42.5 per cent a month and last week the market refused to accept 28-day Treasury paper for the first time in two years. Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy minister, and his team spent Saturday arguing the case for high real interest rates to Mr Franco. After this, in the second official communique within 24 hours, Mr Franco agreed to short-term 'technical adjustments'. However, he reaffirmed his objection to a prolonged high interest rates. Mr Haddad yesterday confirmed that the government was working on a stabilisation programme, but discounted the possibility of a shock plan. However, the public battle over interest rates has added to the uncertainty about economic policy in Brazil, and Mr Haddad's future now seems in doubt.</p>

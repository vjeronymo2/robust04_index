			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut -- The joint Syrian-Lebanese committee for  electricity affairs held a meeting yesterday in Beirut.    Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese  Council, announced that the discussion dealt with two main  topics: the establishment of a joint training center, and a grid  link between the two fraternal countries.    Khuri pointed out that it was agreed to exchange expertise  in  the electricity field with regard to power stations, grids, and  other technical aspects.    Regarding the grid link, Khuri said that it was agreed to  prepare the power lines coming from 'Anjar Power Station and the  northern region for the exchange of energy before the end of  1994.    Khuri revealed that several projects are under discussion to  increase the power link between the two countries.    Regarding the agenda of the next meeting, Khuri said the  building of a power station will be the subject of the next  meeting. The current idea, he added, is to build this station  on Lebanese territory, in the northern region of al-Biddawi, in  order to benefit from the waters of the southern al-Nahr  al-Kabir River for the cooling operations.</p>

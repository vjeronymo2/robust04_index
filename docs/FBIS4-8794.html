			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Moslems are continuing  their days-old all-out offensive on Bosnian Serb territories,  but its imminent collapse is a foregone conclusion, as it has  been checked on many sectors, TANJUG learns from Bosnian Serb  Army circles on Sunday.    Bosnian Serb Army sources estimate that the Moslem  leadership  is endeavouring, wherever possible, to provoke the Serb Army's  reaction to its attacks, in order to heighten tensions and press  on with the media demonisation of the Serbs.    The Moslems are trying, with the help of the foreign  propaganda machine, to blame their actions against U.N.  peacekeepers and NATO on the Serbs and provoke an anti-Serb  reaction from the international public which should eventually  lead to further air strikes against the Bosnian Serb Republic.    This is why a British NATO plane was downed over the eastern  Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Saturday and this is why  the plane carrying U.N. Commander for Former Yugoslavia General  Bertrand de Lapresle came under fire from Moslem positions in  Sarajevo, Serb Army sources say.    They explain that Moslem attacks and provocations intensify  on most fronts when NATO planes are buzzing overhead, with  small-arms, mortars and anti-aircraft guns in full play.    The Bosnian Serb Army is refraining as much as possible from  reacting, but makes it clear that whoever should attack the  Bosnian Serb Republic would be treated as an enemy.    Serb Army circles expect the imminent crushing of the Moslem  offensive to be followed by a regrouping of the Moslem forces  and fresh attacks on some other fronts.    The circles indicate it is high time the Moslem side  accepted  the offer of the Bosnian Serb military and political leadership  for establishing a lasting and total cessation of hostilities  throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and turning to  the peace process and a quest for political solutions.</p>

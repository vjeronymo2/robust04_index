			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Workers of the world unite with managers: The post-Soviet industrial order THE FIRST visible sign of economic change in Russia has been the addition to the cabinet in the past two weeks of three figures all drawn from the Soviet industrial past. None comes with the label of rank conservative tied round his neck. However, they are all from 'industry': and the economic radicals around Mr Yegor Gaidar - until this month the sole first deputy prime minister - have in the first part of this year seen the industrial lobby as precisely the force they must break. Now, far from being broken, that force is in the cabinet. One, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a former plant manager and deputy chairman of parliament, has been put into the cabinet as a first deputy prime minister, equal in status to Mr Gaidar; another, Mr Georgy Khizha, a former St Petersburg defence plant manager and city adviser, is now a deputy premier; the third, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin is now head of the vital energy sector - and was the Soviet gas minister. Mr Shumeiko is an often-professed supporter of reform, and Mr Khizha worked with Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, on privatisation in St Petersburg. The three ministers' presence there is proof of industry's success in counter-attacking against the charge Mr Gaidar led against them. At first demoralised by the effects of the price rises, the curbing of credit and raising of interest rates, industry has since March used its economic and political strength to increasingly good effect. It has in Mr Arkady Volsky, the chairman of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the most adroit political survivor in Russia - a man who, starting from a base as communist party secretary in Moscow's Likhachev car plant, was able to turn himself from an adviser under Andropov to a senior counsellor under Gorbachev, and most recently to a post-Soviet industrial baron. Mr Volsky has for the past three months steadily opposed the market liberalism of the Gaidar government (while all the time performing his continued attachment to reform in general) - claiming in an interview with the trade union newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna on March 31 that production was on the verge of unstoppable decline and hinting that - were policies not to change - workers and managers together could paralyse the country with industrial action. In the last two weeks, Mr Volsky and his colleagues have formed a new political party, called 'Renewal' dedicated to the support of a strong state and a viable industry - a further fragmentation of the political scene, but likely to be the powerful fragment. A union between managers and workers against the government well expresses the realities of the post-Soviet industrial order. There is as yet no real differentiation of interest: at the top, Mr Volsky can and does team up with the trade union leadership to make vague but real threats: at plant level, managers see themselves as slightly better paid members of the work collective, with no experience of firing workers and no desire to do so. The reaction of the managers to macroeconomic reform has not been to adapt at the micro level by raising efficiency, cutting prices and staff. On the contrary, encouraged by Mr Volsky and other influential leaders, it is to blame the government for the nature of the reform, and to do nothing. For these people, production has been and remains everything: they make little distinction between tanks and pocket calculators. Yet, as Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the government's main economic adviser, said on Monday: 'This remains the great fallacy of socialist thinking; the idea that sheer material output is all that counts. The services which make up 50 per cent of the advanced countries' economies don't even get a mention.' Mr Gaidar and his team are on Professor Sachs' side of the argument: indeed, Mr Gaidar told Izvestia last week that he would not save bankrupt enterprises from deserved oblivion. But even before he welcomed his new colleagues to the cabinet table, he had been forced to make concessions. An extra Rbs200bn has been promised to industry, and Rbs120bn to the oil sector. Energy prices will not be freed for some time, perhaps not this year. Taxes are set to be lowered in the latter half of the year. Money printing is being speeded up to meet the demand - backed by threats of industrial action - from workers to be paid. Privatisation has suffered long delays, most recently at the hands of deputies who refuse to pass laws allowing privatisation and bankruptcies. There is an argument, now being hopefully rehearsed by the international financial community in Moscow, which puts an optimistic gloss on all of this. It holds that the new ministers will soon see the unreality of their early calls for tax cuts and extra credits: that Mr Gaidar remains the boss under a still-committed president; and that Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the central bank chairman whose resignation was rejected by parliament last week, has by being confirmed in office strengthened the bank's position on high interest rates and tight credit. Against this, there is the view that holds that the salient opened up in the cabinet by the industrialists have blunted the reform edge and that now, the best that can be hoped for is a series of half measures. No-one, not the most dedicated expert, has been able to discover what the budget deficit is: they do not even know if the government knows. Thus, says one: 'It could be any figure between nought and 20 per cent of GNP.' Most Russians are convinced of the pessimistic option: the foreign experts here, looking for the silver in the lining, try to believe the first. Neither can know - for the main players themselves are locked in a struggle whose outcome is of the first importance, but is unforeseeable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia's Federal Industry, Technology, and  Regional Development Minister Alan Griffiths has resigned from  cabinet pending a police inquiry into possible misuse of Labor  Party's money. Michael Roland reports that Mr. Griffiths has  told the prime minister, Paul Keating, he is confident his name  will be cleared but it is best that he stands aside while the  investigation is carried out.    In a statement issued late this afternoon, the prime  minister  says Mr. Griffiths has informed him he has serious concern about  possible misuse of funds he received for party's political  purposes. According to Mr. Keating, Mr. Griffiths has also  expressed concern about the possible misuse of facilities in his  Melbourne electorate office as well as irregularities in  documentation relating to electoral fund-raising and expenditure.    The federal police have been asked to investigate. There  will also be an independent inquiry into the matters raised. In  the meantime, the industry minister has told Mr. Keating, it is  in the best interest of the government and the ALP [Australian  Labor Party] for him to resign so the matter can be fully  investigated. Mr. Griffiths has told the prime minister he is  confident of being found not guilty of any wrongdoing or  impropriety and he intends recontesting his position once the  inquiries are over. Mr. Griffiths entered the ministry in 1990  and was promoted to the industry portfolio after last year's  federal election.</p>

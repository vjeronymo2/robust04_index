			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The company that recut its cloth  -Clive Fewins describes the action that saved a textile firm from the recession THERE WAS only one way to save the family firm. At the age of 63, Malcolm Mackinnon put the Pounds 350,000 house he had owned for 22 years on the market. He and his wife then lived in a caravan for 18 months until a new, more modest, house could be built on part of the plot he had kept. The funds released helped fend off the bank, to which Textra owed nearly Pounds 1m. The company stabilised its affairs by pruning the workforce from 98 to 33 and closing its London showroom and Keighley warehouse. Textra is one of a handful of textile converters of its type in the UK. Textile converters smooth the path between the manufacturer and big customers: wholesalers, stores or large organisations such as a government department. They help manufacturers to produce the fabrics customers want to buy. But the recession was bad news for companies such as Textra, which specialised in UK-produced designs and fabrics and were dependent on a buoyant home market. 'Being specialists in furnishing fabrics we are heavily geared to the property market,' said Mackinnon, managing director of the family company. 'Three years ago when we had to take our drastic steps not only was the property market on the way down, but interest rates were rising and I had just bought out my partner. On top of that our annual turnover was dropping. 'I just managed to sell my house and half the land for Pounds 300,000 before the price dropped heavily. Even with the redundancies we fell from Pounds 70,000 profit in 1988-89 to a loss of Pounds 134,000 the following year.' It was not a happy experience for a man who might have been looking forward to retirement from the company he started in 1963. Another blow was the decision to close the company's showroom and headquarters in the West End of London, close to the premises of other leading names in furnishing fabrics, including the former Sanderson headquarters, where Mackinnon had learned his trade in the early 1950s. 'It was a worrying time transferring so much from central London to Abingdon and converting an ugly 1960s interior into a stylish showroom. We had to use all our talent,' said Mackinnon's daughter, Penny Hill, Textra's sales director. 'We wondered how we would fare without a London presence, but there was no alternative. A lot of people in the capital thought it was the end. But for various reasons other companies in the business moved out of the West End at about that time, so that softened the blow a little.' Abingdon-on-Thames may seem a strange location for a textiles company. Mackinnon had taken a lease of the 14,000 sq ft building in 1971 when the family moved house from London to a village nearby. Most of the workforce was there so it seemed logical to make Abingdon the headquarters. 'We find the majority of customers are happy to come to see us here,' said Hill. 'We have to make more of an effort to pull them in, but when they arrive here we have their undivided attention.' The Textra collection comprises British designed and manufactured furnishing fabrics. About 50 per cent of turnover comes from government contracts. Hill or Vivian Edwards, the contracts manager, frequently visit the buyers from the National Health Service or Ministry of Defence. Visitors to the showroom include retailers such as Harrods, Marks and Spencer and John Lewis, hoteliers or interior designers. 'We go out of our way to cater for them every September, when we erect a tent within the warehouse for our annual autumn event. We also run monthly courses for our customers in the Abingdon showroom,' said Hill. Textra is design-led. Although it does not weave or print fabrics it is entirely responsible for the design, whether that originates from one of the two in-house designers, or from the many freelances Textra uses. 'Father has a wonderful eye and many years of experience,' said Hill. 'We are a close family and often we have a family discussion before finally deciding on the final colourways of a design or the weights and mixtures of a set of fabrics.' Mackinnon's wife Mary, who was company secretary until she retired last year, son Tim, who is technical director, and son-in-law Paul Lewis, the warehouse manager, all play a role in this. This year Textra has added 12 designs to its collection of around 150. Mackinnon is confident that Textra has turned the corner. 'It was very traumatic having to prune so drastically,' he said. 'Some of the people that went had been with us since the age of 16. But now I look back, I am convinced it was the only possible course. 'After three years of losses and a constantly diminishing turnover we are confident that we have come through it and that the year that ended in April will show a small profit. 'I realise that when I founded the company 30 years ago I went for the hard option in sticking to all British designs and fabrics. But I do not regret this. We still produce some of the finest furnishing fabrics in the world.' 'It was the currency crisis of last October that has helped our recovery. As a result of the devaluation of the pound we have become far more competitive overseas. Doors that were closed before are now slightly ajar.'

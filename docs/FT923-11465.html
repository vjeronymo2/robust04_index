			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Community spending cut in draft budget EUROPEAN Community budget ministers yesterday agreed to scale back Commission spending proposals for 1993, overruling the wishes of poorer member states. Ministers agreed that total EC spending should be cut from Ecu63.1bn (Dollars 85.18bn) this year to Ecu62.9bn in 1993. However, the draft budget now goes to the European parliament which has the power to make substantial amendments. Negotiations over next year's budget are separate from the fierce debate over the 1993-97 budget proposals going on among foreign and finance ministers. But wealthier countries are still likely to use yesterday's deal to back their claim that the EC has money to spare. They say there is no need to increase the contributions of member states on the scale suggested by Brussels in its five-year plan. Proposed expenditure for 1993 would be equivalent to a contribution from member states of just 1.09 per cent of gross national product - well below the current revenue ceiling of 1.2 per cent. The Commission has said the ceiling must be increased to 1.37 per cent by 1997, but richer countries argue there is plenty of 'headroom' under the current ceiling. One element in the draft budget likely to be attacked in the European parliament is the decision to omit a specific figure for the 'cohesion fund' to help poorer EC economies catch up. The ministers included a specific line for a cohesion fund in the 1993 draft, but rejected the Commission's suggested figure of Ecu1.56bn, despite the protests of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, which would benefit most. The maximum committed spending under the draft agreed yesterday would drop from Ecu66.6bn this year to Ecu65.7bn in 1993. That compares with the Commission's proposal that commitments should rise to Ecu69.3bn. The proposed budget gives effect to the reform of the common agricultural policy, but will involve cuts in other areas. For example, the European consumers' organisation has already complained that funding designed for consumer protection had been halved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rob Meines: "Chamber: Zhirinovskiy's Success </F> Calls For Strong Defense"]    [Text] The Hague, 31 Dec -- A majority in the Second  Chamber wants to see no further cuts made to the defense budget.  According to the parliamentary groups of the CDA  [Christian-Democratic Appeal], VVD [People's Party for Freedom  and Democracy], and D66 [1966 Democrats], the recent political  developments in Russia are reason enough to stop further cuts to  Netherlands defense budget. Of the four main groups, only the  PvdA [Socialist Workers Party] considers it "still too early" to  make a similar decision. The PvdA wants to retain its own  proposed plan of budget cuts worth more than 900 million  guilders for the next legislative period.    However, according to the CDA, VVD, and D66, the Priority  Memorandum accepted earlier this year by the Chamber [Memorandum  to the House outlining the government's priorities] must be  carried out "to the letter." Spokesmen for the CDA, VVD, and  D66 also expect that a fundamental debate on conscription will  have to be conducted all over again as soon as the necessary  constitutional amendment is put on the agenda. "If a man like  Zhirinovskiy were to come to power, we should not give him a  chance to say: The West can do nothing because their armies are  powerless," CDA foreign affairs spokesman De Hoop Scheffer said.  Consequently, the CDA "is wary of the PvdA's call for further  defense cuts," Hillen, CDA vice chairman of the [House] Defense  Committee said. Van Heemskerck Pillis-Duvekot, the VVD's  defense spokesperson, also senses -- both in her own party "and  beyond it" -- a real unwillingness to implement further cuts  right now. "We had already reached the limit, and certainly now  that the situation in Russia has developed in this way, we  cannot allow further reductions to our armed forces." Eisma of  D66 also believes that the bottom has been reached.    Nonetheless, PvdA finance spokesman Melkert wants to adhere  to the [PvdA's] analysis that further cuts are possible.  However, he said that "if NATO were to give further security  guarantees to the countries of Central Europe and if extreme  rightist-nationalist Zhirinovskiy managed to strengthen his  power base in Russia, then we would have to reconsider the  configuration of the Netherlands Army."</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Measures of pension solvency Sir, It seems premature for David Parsons (Letters, October 6) and others to say the Goode committee's proposals on solvency are unworkable. Equally, those who suggest that any problems can be solved by all the pension funds in the country purchasing derivatives, in what would become a one-way market, may not really have thought through the issues. Goode has suggested a solvency test based on leaving service transfer values. The actuarial profession would be required to tighten up its guidelines on calculation of those values. Surely any such guidelines must allow for a market level adjustment if the bottom falls out of the equity market. There simply has to be a mechanism to prevent the position where virtually all UK final-salary schemes suddenly could be technically insolvent. Of more concern is the proposal that solvency for pensioners should be measured by the price of buying annuities. A surprisingly large number of pension funds have already guaranteed increases at the lesser of 5 per cent or the rise in prices. There is no investment available to match that liability and mature funds with a high proportion of pensioners may well face problems if that solvency standard is adopted. Roy B. Colbran, chief actuary, Buck Consultants, 10 Buckingham Place, London SW1E 6HT.</p>

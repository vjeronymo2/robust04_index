			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / World Bank official may go to EBRD MR ERNIE STERN, one of the three managing directors of the World Bank, has been sounded out about a senior position at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with a view to strengthening the EBRD's management. It emerged yesterday that the idea was floated some time ago after recent disclosures of extravagance in the fitting out of the EBRD's London headquarters and of cost overruns in the bank's travel budget through frequent use of private chartered jets by Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD president. It is thought that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, which together have a majority stake in the EBRD, would like Mr Stern to take on a chief executive role at the bank. The EBRD was set up two years ago to help former Communist countries introduce market economies. Baroness Chalker, the UK overseas development aid minister, who is also Britain's deputy governor at the EBRD, is understood to have contacted Mr Stern on a recent trip to Washington. Officials close to the bank's governing board said it was not yet clear whether Mr Stern would leave the World Bank to join the EBRD in London. The idea was 'still in play', they said. Mr Stern's name is not the only one to have been considered by the G7, which wants to give the international institutions and industrialised and former Communist countries that own the EBRD better control over the bank. The EBRD's annual meeting at the end of April decided that Mr Attali should continue as bank president despite evidence of extravagance. But some shareholders appear to expect that decision will be reviewed if necessary following a special audit of the bank's spending, which is expected to be completed in about six weeks' time. The US, the EBRD's biggest single shareholder, is making no secret of its wish to see Mr Attali leave and is irritated that the bank's big European shareholders have not yet decided that he should be made to quit. Mr Attali is said to be fighting hard for his job. One G7 official said last week he was 'hanging on like glue'. Mr Stern was offered a senior post as deputy to Mr Attali when the EBRD was set up two years ago. He decided to stay in Washington, partly it was thought for family reasons and partly because he suspected that he would not be allowed much authority with Mr Attali as president.

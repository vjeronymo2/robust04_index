			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Iraq frees Britons after Saddam sees Heath in Baghdad Former British prime minister Sir Edward Heath yesterday secured the release of three British prisoners held in Iraq, write James Whittington in Amman and Agencies. The men were freed after Sir Edward met President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. Mr Michael Wainwright, 42, and Mr Paul Ride, 33, were jailed last year for 10 and seven years respectively on charges of entering Iraq illegally. Mr Simon Dunn, 23, was arrested in June and sentenced to eight years for the same offence. They were due to fly with Sir Edward by helicopter today to the Jordanian capital, Amman, where they will be reunited with their families before travelling on to the UK. Iraq previously linked their release with Britain's unfreezing of Iraqi assets in the UK. But British diplomats in Amman stressed that 'no deal had been done'. One said the move was a gesture by Saddam in the hope UN sanctions would soon be lifted.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / New Thai cabinet appointed A NEW Thai cabinet - made up of 41 politicians, four generals and four technocrats - was appointed yesterday, almost a month after the general election, Peter Ungphakorn reports from Bangkok. The prime minister, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, and the five parties that have agreed to support him, had difficulty in agreeing on portfolios. The coalition holds only 195 seats in the 360-member lower house, so it could prove fragile. Gen Suchinda has put his own appointees in charge of the key interior and finance ministries, and kept the defence portfolio for himself. Mr Suthee Singhasaneh, an fiscally orthodox technocrat, remains finance minister, as he has been since Gen Suchinda led the coup last year. Mr Suthee's appointment means Thailand's traditionally cautious fiscal and monetary policy is likely to continue.</p>

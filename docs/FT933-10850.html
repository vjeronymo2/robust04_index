			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / ICI in 10,000-job project ONE OF the largest commercial developments in Britain is being planned by Imperial Chemical Industries on 1,500 acres at Severnside near Bristol. ICI believes that eventually there could be employment for more than 10,000 people. ICI describes the land, next to its Severnside works, as a 'major strategic holding'. Mr Andrew Sturt, group property manager, said: 'We have a fantastic opportunity and will provide competition for every major site in the region.' The company will not act as the sole developer but is in informal discussions about partnerships which might take the form of joint ventures or a consortium. Mr Sturt said: 'We will invest money to enhance the landholding but there is no prospect of ICI entering into development as a risk-taker. We are concentrating on our core businesses.' A manufacturing plant, a distribution park and a research park are among ICI's proposals for what is expected to be at least a decade of development. Most of the land is let to tenant farmers but there is a long-standing planning consent for the whole site. The University of Bristol has agreed to be part of the research park to develop closer links with industry. It said: 'Precisely what would be in our building would be decided by the nature of the companies there - it would be market-led.' The land, which ICI has owned for more than 30 years, straddles the M49 approach motorway being built to the second Severn crossing, due to open early in 1996. Planning permission is already being sought for an interchange with the M49. The site is also close to the M4, the M5 and the Avonmouth docks. Mr Robert Durie, of King Sturge, the property adviser to the scheme, said: 'It is a very exciting opportunity. It is of a very significant size and we are not going to race at it but plan it carefully.'</p>

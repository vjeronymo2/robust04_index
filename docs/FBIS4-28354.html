			<p>BFN     [Text] The Space Development Committee [SDC] (whose  chairman is Science and Technology Agency Director-General Omi)  has revealed new satellite development projects for fiscal year  1995 that include both a high-resolution land observation  scientific satellite and a data relay satellite. With Prime  Minister Hata offering a forward-leaning response to Diet  interpellation on the issue of satellite information-gathering,  a debate on reconnaissance satellites has arisen. At the same  time the United States and Russia have begun actively to sell  satellite information overseas in line with defense conversion  in both countries. With Japan, too, upgrading its observation  satellite technology, the line between the technology's military  and peaceful uses is gradually disappearing. How far will the  "information-gathering capability" of Japan's satellites go?    Among new projects under SDC consideration are the ALOS  [expansion unknown] land observation satellite and the DRTS  [expansion unknown] satellite for satellite-ground station data  transmission.    ALOS, for which the National Aerospace Development Agency of  Japan is planning a launch around 1999, will weigh approximately  3.5 tons and orbit at approximately 700 kilometers. The  satellite will be equipped with an optical sensor able to  perceive visible and near-infrared light as well as a synthetic  aperture radar [SAR] able to gauge the earth's topography by  using reflected microwaves. The optical sensor will have a high  resolution capable of distinguishing between objects 2.5 meters  apart.    The satellite's SAR will have somewhat less resolution  capability, but its microwaves will not be attenuated by clouds,  enabling the satellite to conduct observations day or night  under various atmospheric conditions.    The resolution of Japan's earth observation satellites has  improved dramatically. The resolution of its first observation  satellite, Momo, launched in February 1987, was 50 meters; for  the earth resources satellite Fuyo, launched in February 1992,  it was 18 meters. The resolution of the earth observation  platform ADEOS [Advanced Earth Observing Satellite], a  scientific satellite slated for launching in 1996, is eight  meters.    The 2.5 m resolution projected for ALOS will far surpass the  respective 30 m and 10 m resolutions of America's Landsat and  France's SPOT [expansion unknown] satellites. Making the  aperture of the light sensor's telescope and the focal distance  for the ALOS satellite approximately twice that of the ADEOS  will improve the former's resolution.    Using the ALOS, it will be easy to make maps with contours  of  1:25,000. The Science and Technology Agency explains its  significance as "a tool for cooperation with Southeast Asia,  which is having difficulties making maps." Detailed observation  of how forests are being cut and what damage is taking place due  to acid rain will also reportedly become possible.    At first ALOS was called HIROS [expansion unknown], the  "HIR"  standing for "high resolution." But the name was changed so as  not to emphasize its high-resolution capability. Apparently at  play, according to an individual involved, was the feeling that  publicizing high-resolution capability "would give a pretext to  the United States to try to sell us the U.S. high-resolution  commercial satellites soon due to come on the market."    The goal for the data relay satellite, for its part, is the  establishment of a 24-hour observation system. DRTS will  therefore be launched prior to ALOS into a high 36,000 km  geostationary orbit. The observation satellite will be unable to  send data directly to Japanese ground stations when on the other  side of the earth, but will be able to send a large volume of  information on a real-time basis via the relay satellite.</p>

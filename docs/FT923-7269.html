			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Early education is the key to effective skills training Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Save us all from the credentialist fad', August 13) is right to question the scandalous squandering of resources in training. But he does not get to the heart of the matter. The strength of the continental system is that education and training are treated holistically. Studies of the economic effectiveness of training which do not refer to education, particularly primary education, miss the point. The core of the transferable skills Mr Brittan alludes to is the set acquired in primary and early secondary phases of education. It involves what the French would call the 'formation' of an individual. It includes basic literacy and numeracy and, above all, an ability to concentrate. This produces a trainable, adaptable workforce able to acquire vocational qualifications. If the educational foundation is sound, the training function becomes simpler, more directed and less costly, and conflicts between exogenous and endogenous benefit less acute. It is the provision of a sound 'formation' to succeeding generations of school leavers that separates the sheep from the goats in national economic performance, and it is the neglect of the need to provide all our youngsters with these basic skills that is at the root of the UK's seemingly terminal decline.

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Dowty comes to earth The sad truth about TI's bid for Dowty is that the target could scarcely have tried harder to provoke attack. It may have put a brave face on things by maintaining its interim dividend last December despite a 73 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, but that cannot distract from a flawed and badly executed strategy of diversification into information technology and electronics. Dowty's market capitalisation is lower than it was six years ago, while that of TI has more than tripled. Like Hawker Siddeley before it, the company is thus left with a lame defence. The question is basically one of price. TI appears to have pitched its offer just high enough to give any lurking rival second thoughts. It can justify the price to its existing shareholders on the grounds of confidence in its own ability to sell the information technology and electronics businesses quickly. Though this is, belatedly, part of Dowty's strategy too, a new and less sentimental management would probably have more luck. With that out of the way, the merged group would be free of debt and able to enjoy the benefit of the cost savings Dowty's management has already instituted. That prospect might just about make the deal look opportunistic enough for the institutions to demand a small increase in the Hawker manner, but it is an outside chance at best.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (3): The will to get things done - Impact of the development corporation WHEN the Leeds Development Corporation was imposed upon the city in 1988, it did not receive a rapturous welcome from the local authority. City or district councils rarely like development corporations. They resent the loss of planning powers and funds to these unelected quangos. In Leeds there was a feeling that a development corporation was particularly unnecessary since the economy was flourishing and property developments would have occurred through market forces. Mr Brian Walker, chairman of the Labour council's economic services committee, says: 'A lot of the developments in the corporation's area would have happened anyway. Many planning consents had already been given. 'The corporation area covers only 1 per cent of Leeds and we were starved for money to develop the other 99 per cent.' Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the city council, says: 'We felt at the time that we, the democratically elected representatives, should have decided where money was to be spent. To channel funds into just one area could have created an imbalance in the city. We have some deprived inner city areas which require attention.' The city council set up the Leeds City Development Company, a private developer, to act as a rival to the development corporation. Since then, however, feelings towards the corporation have warmed. Mr Walker now sits on the board of the LDC. Through the Leeds Development Agency, its economic development arm, the city council has joined with the development corporation and other private sector bodies to form the Leeds Initiative. This umbrella organisation has succeeded in attracting investments to the city. The development corporation says it has created 6,500 jobs in four years at a cost of Pounds 6,000 a job and that this compares with an average cost across the 11 urban development corporations of nearly Pounds 30,000 a job. In some ways the the LDC had an easier task than other UDCs. Unlike Teesside or Tyneside, there are no large tracts of derelict, polluted land which have been laid waste by the decline of traditional manufacturing industries. The Leeds urban development area is more like Trafford Park in Manchester. It is a nexus of live industries, notably engineering and light manufacturing. The area is in need of refurbishment and environmental improvements but not wholesale redevelopment. Of the 1,300 acres under the LDC's remit, about 300 to 400 acres are considered in need of total redevelopment. The LDC itself has bought or 'assembled' only 43.23 hectares (102 acres). The main part of the developement area stretches south away from the River Aire directly next to the city centre. There is easy access and the area is the obvious place for Leeds' inner core to expand. The LDC has another tract of land in its care - the Kirkstall Valley - which is non-contiguous. In the main area there are few houses: hundreds rather than thousands live within the LDC's boundaries. This has meant there have been few costly, acrimonious and time-consuming compulsory purchase orders to implement. Ironically, the LDC has benefited from a lack of funding. When it was set up in 1988, it was to have a life of five years and was given just Pounds 15m of government money. This ruled out grand, costly infrastructural projects from the start. Mr Stuart Kenny, development director of the LDC, says: 'Because of the tight funding we never set out a vision or grand design like some development corporations. We never made extravagant claims about how many jobs we would create and never gave out specific investment or job targets. We just tried to do what we could as we went along.' What the LDC has achieved, apart from the jobs created, is to facilitate or enable 3m sq ft of new property to be built. There have been 57 environment schemes approved and 42 environment grants awarded. The LDC has spent around Pounds 36m. This, in turn, has generated over Pounds 120m in private sector investment, a ratio of nearly four to one. The development corporation's life has been extended to 1995, with hopes that that it might continue for a further term. Much of the 3m sq ft of new property is industrial factories in three business parks and refurbishments of older buildings. There has been some B1, light industrial/office projects along the River Aire, together with environmental improvements and the opening of a hotel and some restaurants. Critics of the LDC say these developments would have taken place with or without a development corporation. However, Mr Peter Hartley, chairman of the LDC, says: 'They might have happened, but certainly not in my lifetime. Some of the planning consents had been sitting there for 20 years. 'It is not a question of money making things happen, but of will. We have had the determination to push things through and speed up the planning procedures.'</p>

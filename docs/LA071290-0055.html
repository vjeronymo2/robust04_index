			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A BLOODLESS 'GHOSTS'; CUT-RATE 'CHORUS LINE'  </P> <P> Are there a few new spirits flying out of Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts"?  </P> <P> This 1881 drama has, at least on paper, acquired fresh relevance. Or so wrote  Jack Shouse, head of Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts Theaterfest,  in program notes about the new season, which shuttles shows between an indoor  theater at Santa Maria and an outdoor stage in Solvang.  </P> <P> "Ghosts" is about a man whose terrible venereal disease is apparently a product  of his now-dead father's philandering -- and his mother's reluctance to defy  convention by leaving the rake before conceiving a child with him. In the  program, Shouse connected the play to such current issues as "the social stigma  faced by those suffering from a deadly disease."  </P> <P> He also noted that "Ghosts" was "once banned because it presented situations  and ideas which were considered scandalous . . . In an era when censorship in  the arts is hotly debated," the example of Ibsen's play supports "freedom of  artistic expression . . . regardless of our feeling about one artist's specific  subject or approach."  </P> <P> In other, more explicit words, Shouse is suggesting that thoughts of AIDS and  the National Endowment for the Arts and even 2 Live Crew might flit through the  minds of audiences watching "Ghosts."  </P> <P> This effort to create a little controversy out of "Ghosts" is encouraging, in a  PCPA season that otherwise sticks to the tried and true: "A Chorus Line,"  "Little Shop of Horrors," "The Importance of Being Earnest," "Guys and Dolls"  and yet another "Much Ado About Nothing."  </P> <P> But the controversy doesn't go very far in Roger DeLaurier's staging. Perhaps  it's just as well, regarding the tenuous parallel to AIDS. The fact is that any  "social stigma" suffered by the syphilitic son Oswald is a very minor concern  in "Ghosts." His real problem is that he's going insane.  </P> <P> It's too bad, though, that this revival couldn't generate enough heat to evoke  the current censorship battle, without the prompting of Shouse's program notes.  Watching this generally bloodless production, it's difficult to imagine Ibsen  as the Karen Finley of his day.  </P> <P> The language in the new translation by Jerry Turner is no more raw than that of  previous translations; the text still doesn't even mention the name of Oswald's  disease (Shouse followed suit in his program notes by not specifying AIDS as  today's "deadly disease").  </P> <P> There is no sexual chemistry between Frederic Barbour's Oswald and Lisa  Paulsen's Regina, the maid whom Oswald later discovers is his half-sister. Nor  is it easy to understand how Dee Maaske's Mrs. Alving could have been attracted  to a younger version of Philip Stockton's wan, nattering Pastor Manders.  </P> <P> We do sense the blood flowing beneath the skin of Maaske's Mrs. Alving. She  speaks in dark, tart cadences that ring with authority, and her eyes reveal  even more. In fact, she's so strong that it's hard to believe that Mrs. Alving  was a self-destructive doormat during her marriage. But this is Ibsen's problem  more than Maaske's.  </P> <P> Paulsen is a vibrant Regina, and Carl Palmer has amusing moments as Regina's  purported father -- though his wild-man wig and beard make him look too  eccentric to be such a successful con man. But Barbour's Oswald is nothing more  than a wounded kid.  </P> <P> D Martyn Bookwalter's set, Jerald R. Enos' lights and David C. Eakin's score  add a touch of tragic grandeur to the more predictable gloom and doom.  </P> <P> The scenic and lighting design and orchestral prowess of the Theaterfest's "A  Chorus Line," which opened in Solvang while "Ghosts" opened in Santa Maria,  were not nearly so accomplished.  </P> <P> The mirrors, which almost serve as a separate character in "A Chorus Line,"  looked cheap and pasted-on -- and they didn't move from the rear of the stage  during Cassie's "Music and the Mirror" number, when they're supposed to give us  five views of her at once. The number seemed long-winded, despite the  professional efforts of Colette Bernal as Cassie. Nor could we see the  footlights or the audience in these mirrors.  </P> <P> The orchestra needs to work on intonation, particularly during the staccato  chords that punctuate the scene in which the dancers thrust their glossies at  the audience.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the actors are pretty good. Despite a few weak singers, the show  still casts a spell. Veteran "Chorus Line" watchers may wonder why the  character of Connie is no longer Chinese-American, but it's a nice touch to see  the cast singing "point me toward tomorrow" in a formation that uses the  Theaterfest's thrust stages to point out at the audience.  </P> <P>  The shows run in rotating repertory; information: (800) 221-9469.  </P> <P> </P></p>

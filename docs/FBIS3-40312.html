The Polish Economic Consortium, established by the Bank of  Industry and Commerce S.A. [BPH], Elektrim, Exbud, and  Stalexport, is the first such strong economic group in Poland.  The Consortium's chartering document was signed by president  Janusz Quandt for the BPH, while Elektrim was represented by  president Andrzej Marian Skowronski, Exbud by president Witold  Zaraska, and Stalexport by president Ryszard Harhala.    The main goal of this joint effort is a joint enterprise and  the implementation of large economic plans of a material and  capital nature, including, as was specifically noted in the  signing of the charter, participation in the highway  construction program.    With these plans and undertakings, the consortium wants to  play an active role in the transformation and restructuring of  the Polish economy, taking into consideration the needs of  healthy market competition.    At the same time, the consortium intends to play a direct  role in the process of privatizing the Polish economy by means  of the purchase of state enterprises; it also intends to create  new economic entities and to undertake proexport activities and  developmental ventures. It will also be an active participant in  the capital market, acting to secure and administer Polish and  foreign capital. The consortium also intends to be involved in  the restructuring and remodeling of Polish enterprises,  including in management.    The task of the consortium is also the creation and  management of economic entitities, the undertaking of investment  activity--it is essential that this latter point include, above  all, regions with high unemployment--and active entry into  existing economic relationships. The consortium also intends to  participate in the National Investment Funds--namely, in the  program of mass privatization of state enterprises.    The Polish Economic Consortium is not a holding company but  only an accord, which does not mean, however, that, in the  future, a holding company including these four economic entities  will not be created. The consortium counts on the realization of  an investment by the State Treasury; it is precisely this  expectation that accounts for mention of participation in the  construction program of Polish highways.    The Bank of Commerce and Industry in Krakow, created in 1989  as one of the commercial banks that emerged from the National  Bank of Poland [NBP], is one of the largest banks in Poland. In  terms of the value of its own capital, it ranks sixth among  Polish banks. It has a wide range of services in national and  foreign sales and is an active participant in both the money and  capital markets. The BPH cooperates with more than 80 banks  worldwide, including the World Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche  Bank, Barclays Bank, and the American Express Bank: The BPH's  guarantees are honored by foreign financial institutions.    Elektrim was privatized two years ago. In 1992 (1993's  results are not yet balanced), sales increased more than 30  percent, while net profit increased by over 170 percent (tax  liabilities were over Z762 billion). These positive tendencies,  in spite of the continuing recession and unfavorable business  outlook, also appeared in 1993. Elektrim is a shareholder in 18  companies in 11 countries. Exbud functions on the principles of,  and in its organizational structure as, a holding company. It is  made up of 29 companies in which Exbud holds the majority share,  as well as five economic establishments and 11 foreign  representations. In addition, Exbud has capital shares and also  majority shares in 11 Polish and 10 foreign companies of a mixed  nature.    Stalexport is not only a traditional exporter of steel and  metal products but also, for some time now, an investment firm,  specializing in the tourist nature. The company is developing  dynamically.</p>

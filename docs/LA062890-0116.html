			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROAST DUCK SALAD IS AN EYE PLEASER;  </P> <P> SALAD: MANGO, HONEYDEW AND CUCUMBER SLICES AND A SHOWER OF SPICY DRESSING MAKE  SINGAPOREAN DELIGHT.  </P> <P> Contemporary Asian cooking presents traditional ingredients in smart new ways.  An example from Singapore is a sophisticated duck salad that combines  Cantonese-style roast duck with an eye-pleasing pattern of mango, honeydew and  cucumber slices. Chopped roasted peanuts, sesame seeds and cilantro leaves are  scattered over the top, and a spicy dressing is showered over the salad at the  table.  </P> <P> The recipe comes from Violet Oon, who often acts as an international  spokesperson on Singaporean cuisine. In Singapore, she conducts cooking  demonstrations and publishes the Food Paper, a compendium of restaurant  reviews, recipes and general food news. Oon recently organized a Singaporean  dinner for a food-and-wine tasting held in Aspen, Colo. She also prepared the  salad for a dinner held in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Visiting markets here, Oon located most of the ingredients required for her  native Straits Chinese cookery. Also known as peranakan or nonya food, this  style resulted from the mixing of Chinese and Malay cultures in the historic  Straits Settlements -- Penang, Malacca and Singapore.  </P> <P> The salad calls for a Chinese-style roasted duck. These can be purchased at  Chinatown delis, either whole or in the half portion required by the recipe.  One could also substitute a home-roasted duck, or even poached chicken meat.  </P> <P> For the duck marinade, Oon uses "cooked oil" -- oil that has been previously  used to fry shallots. Oon says this removes any raw flavor from the oils.  (Crisp, fried shallot shreds are a common topping for nonya dishes.)  </P> <P> Ideal for warm weather, the salad is easy to make and requires little  last-minute work. The duck meat can be placed in its marinade well in advance  of serving. The dressing, which is based on such flavorful components as  Chinese chili sauce, plum sauce and sesame oil, also can be prepared ahead of  time.  </P> <P> ROAST DUCK, MELON AND MANGO SALAD  </P> <P> 1/2 Chinese roasted duck  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cooked oil (oil that has previously been used for frying shallots  or mild onions)  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons light soy sauce  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon oyster sauce  </P> <P> 5 ounces honeydew  </P> <P> 1 firm pear  </P> <P> 1 cucumber  </P> <P> 1 semi-firm mango  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons coarsely ground toasted peanuts  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds  </P> <P> Leaves from several sprigs cilantro  </P> <P> Spicy Sauce  </P> <P> Remove flesh from roasted duck and cut into fine strips.

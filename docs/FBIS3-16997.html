			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report under the "Cooperation" rubric: </F> "Special Conditions for Moscow. NATO's Partnership With Russia  Will Differ From its Relations With East European Countries"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yuriy Ushakov, director of  the Russian Foreign Ministry All-European Cooperation  Department, has said to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent  that as it is going to sign the "Partnership for Peace" plan,  Russia sees it as a stage on the way to reaching a wide-ranging  agreement on cooperation with NATO that could be contemplated  both within the "Partnership for Peace" concept and outside it.  The program itself is in principle acceptable for Russia at  this stage as "a compromise that has come about under the  influence of a number of factors." Moscow does not want to  approach it from a formal, symbolic point of view that  characterizes the stances of a number of East European countries  that confuse a NATO membership card with a credit card to borrow  money from Western banks. Russia's partnership, however, will  be different from the cliches of its former Warsaw Pact allies.  It is essential to take into account its weight on the  international scene, its status of a nuclear power, and the  importance of relations between the two partners -- Russia  itself and NATO. The North Atlantic Alliance, however, is  preoccupied with the search for a formula that, while formally  not recognizing Russia's privileged status within "Partnership  for Peace," would still enable them to foster a special  cooperation. A number of NATO experts talk about the "16+1"  formula, which calls for special consultations between the  Russian Federation and NATO. That is precisely what Russia  wants. Special conditions will still have to be created for  Moscow.    There is yet another reservation: Many Russian and foreign  mass media have interpreted Grachev's words as meaning that  Russia would definitely sign the "Partnership for Peace" in  March. Officials on Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry]  clarify: "Maybe in late March, maybe later." The latter is  more likely. This has been caused by the need to complete the  drafting of documents, to wind up interdepartmental  consultations, and to solve a number of technical problems.  There are two candidates for signing on the Russian side:  Kozyrev and Grachev. The site of the signing is already known  -- Brussels.</p>

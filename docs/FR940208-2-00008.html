			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Parties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The ``staff'' is the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent regulatory commission of the United States established pursuant to section 4 of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2053. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Walgreen is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois with its principal corporate offices located at 200 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Walgreen is a retail drug chain and is engaged, in part, in the business of importing and selling domestically, children's toys and novelty items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Allegations of the Staff <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. On June 2, 1992, Commission field staff collected samples of Walgreen's ``Toy Center Musical Phone,'' item  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 874409, for evaluation under the FHSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In the staff's letter of July 8, 1992, Walgreen was advised that these toys are intended for children under three years of age and are subject to the Small Parts regulation at 16 CFR part 501. The toy phone had battery and antenna components that separated when tested under the use and abuse procedures outlined in 16 CFR 1500.52(c) and (f). The battery antenna components fit entirely within the small parts cylinder described at 16 CFR 1500.4. Therefore, the toys present a choking hazard to children under three years of age. As a result, the toy phones are hazardous substances as defined in section 2(f)(1)(D) and (s) of the FHSA and the regulations at 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9), and are banned hazardous substances under section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In that same letter, Walgreen was supplied with the Regulated Products Handbook and referred to chapter 6. The letter and the handbook described, among other things, the procedures that must be followed if a firm elects to export banned products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In Walgreen's response of September 1, 1992, they described their ``stop sales'' activity and informed Commission staff that the returned goods would be ``held for return to the vendor.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. On September 30, 1992, the Commission's Central Regional office received a letter from a firm, Atico Limited of Miami, Florida which represented itself as Walgreen's agent for disposal of these toys. Atico claimed to have revised the product so that it would comply with the FHSA and included revised samples for evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The staff's letter dated November 3, 1992, informed Atico that the revised toys were still not in compliance with the FHSA, and asked again for a final disposition of Walgreen's stock of these violative products. The letter again outlined the correct procedures to follow should Walgreen elect to reexport the products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. In January 1993, the staff was contacted by counsel, purportedly representing Atico, asking for additional guidance on the Commission's export requirements. He specifically inquired about possible export to Paraguay. The staff told him that Walgreen was the importer and should file a notice of export with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. In a phone conversation held April 26, 1993, the CPSC staff again asked Walgreen about the disposition of the violative toys. Walgreen advised that Atico would be handling the export on its behalf. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. In a phone conversation held on April 27, 1993, Walgreen acknowledged that it had not filed the Notice to Export.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Subsequently, the staff learned that Walgreen had shipped 1,758 cartons of these toys back to its foreign supplier on March 29, 1993. The Commission never received the required Notice of Export from Walgreen or Atico. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Section 14(d) of the FHSA requires, in pertinent part, that any person who elects to export a banned hazardous product shall notify the Commission of its intent to export at least 30 days prior to the date of exportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Walgreen's failure to provide the Commission with advance notice of its intent to export these toys is a violation of section 14(d) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1273(d), and is a prohibited act under section 4(i) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Response of Walgreen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Walgreen denies the allegations of the staff that it has knowingly introduced or caused the introduction into commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys, that it knowingly failed to comply with export notification requirements of the FHSA, or that it violated the FHSA in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

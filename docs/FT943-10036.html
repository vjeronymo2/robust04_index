			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Experimental crop of wheat harvested The world's first experimental crop of genetically engineered wheat has been harvested in Cambridgeshire. The success of the trial, carried out by Swiss-owned Ciba Seeds, shows that scientists can alter the characteristics of important cereals in a reliable way by giving them genes from other species. The work is expected to lead to new wheat varieties with increased resistance to drought and disease, less requirement for expensive fertilisers, and other improvements. The wheat grown at Great Abington, Cambridgeshire, contains 'marker genes' of no commercial significance, chosen to prove that foreign genetic material can be passed on predictably from one generation of plants to the next. Some of the plants contained a red pigment gene taken from wild Peruvian maize. When they were harvested last week, all their grains showed red spots  -looking unlike any wheat grown before. The other plants produced bacterial enzymes which Ciba detected in simple tests, proving that the new genes were switched on successfully. Mr David Thompson, head of research at Ciba's cereal breeding business, said the 16 sq m trial plot yielded several kilograms of the wheat.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bowater to depart paper business with Pounds 158m sale Bowater, the printing, packaging and coatings group, yesterday closed the book on a decade of restructuring with the announcement that it had agreed to sell its last remaining paper businesses in a Pounds 158.3m cash deal. The company said it had reached an agreement in principle to sell its Australian tissue operations and related pulp and wood products activities to the diversified forestry company Carter Holt Harvey of New Zealand for ADollars 350m. The deal also includes Bowater's Deeko disposable tableware operations, and a 50 per cent interest in Sancella, a feminine hygiene joint venture. Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said the disposal completed 'a process of regeneration and change' which had been taking place within the company since he was appointed in 1987. However, Bowater has been gradually withdrawing from the paper industry since the demerger of its large US paper-making business in 1984. Mr Lyon said that if the cash were left on deposit the net effect of the disposal would be to dilute earnings by about 0.5p. Bowater intended eventually to reinvest the proceeds in its core packaging, printing and coatings businesses. It also hoped to increase its presence in Asia, Mr Lyon said. He stressed that Bowater's acquisitive period was largely over. The company, which completed several large acquisitions in 1992 and 1993 at a total cost of Pounds 853m, would now focus on organic growth. In the shorter term, the sale would reduce debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds from 43 per cent to between 20 and 25 per cent. In the year ended December 31, the Bowater Tissue division reported operating profits of Pounds 10.7m on sales of Pounds 145m. Net assets before debt were Pounds 150m. The deal remains subject to net asset adjustments and regulatory approval. Bowater also announced that it was considering the possibility of floating its Australian engineering business, which distributes engines and gearboxes for trucks, boats and agricultural and mining equipment. Sales last year were Pounds 114m, with operating profits of Pounds 5.5m. Net assets were Pounds 44m. Mr Lyon said flotation was unlikely before next year. Meanwhile, Carter Holt Harvey, which is controlled by International Paper of New York, said the acquisition of the Australian operations formed part of a strategy to expand its core business in the Pacific. It announced the deal in an interim profits statement which showed an 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to NZDollars 192m (Pounds 73.1m) on sales 15 per cent higher at NZDollars 1.43bn. Earnings per share rose from 10.5 cents to 12.01 cents and the dividend was unchanged at 4 cents. The Chilean associated company, Compania de Petroleos de Chile (Copec) announced doubled profits of 92.3bn pesos (NZDollars 371.4m).</p>

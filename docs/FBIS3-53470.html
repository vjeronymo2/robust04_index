This  attempt will lead to a resumption of the Washington bilateral  talks between the Arabs and Israel to finalize the Middle East  peace process that was launched during the Madrid conference at  the end of October 1992.    Peace-loving forces around the world are now asking the  question of whether the American-Syrian summit will succeed in  removing the obstacles before the peace process. In our attempt  to answer this question, we begin by saying that this issue  depends on to what extent the American role is active and  serious in bolstering the peace efforts and convincing Israel to  meet the Arabs half way, especially after the latter proved to  the whole world the extent of their seriousness and honest  desire to live peacefully with Israel. However, this should be  based on international legitimacy and the Security Council  resolutions that are based on the principle of land for peace,  namely Resolutions 242 and 338. This is precisely what the U.S.  President and Israeli rulers should realize: That there is a  huge difference between a just peace and a peace imposed on  others.    Syria has often declared its determination to proceed along  the course of peace. It has also been backed by its Arab  brothers in this regard, as became clear recently through the  statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Damascus  Declaration countries. It has also participated in all the  previous rounds of the Washington negotiations. However, Syria  wants an unconditional and just peace that guarantees security  for all parties. This is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  will confirm tomorrow during his first meeting with the U.S.  President. In addition, Washington must realize that peace in  the Middle East is an indivisible whole and that it cannot be  established except through parallel successes in all the Arab  tracks. Also, for Syria and Israel to advance the peace  process, there must be some trust between them, which is now  absent. This absence of trust was also fueled by the stumbling  negotiations between the PLO and Israel, despite the signing of  the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, and by  Israel's non- adherence to the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is considered the first step  toward peace between the two sides. We believe Washington knows  all these facts very well.    In light of all we have said so far, the ball is now in the  court of Washington and Israel. If they want to conclude the  peace process and put an end to the state of chronic tension in  this sensitive part of the world, all they need to do is take  serious steps to gain the confidence of Syria, which wants to  regain its occupied territory in the Golan Heights without any  preconditions.    The Geneva summit is considered an opportunity for the U.S.  President to rescue the peace process sponsored by Washington  from total collapse. If it is successful, not only will there  be progress on the Syrian-Israeli track, but on all the other  Arab tracks. In fact, the more important aspect is that if the  Geneva summit is a success, it will be considered a  foreign-policy success for President Clinton. This will also  bolster the status and credibility of the United States in the  international arena and within the new world order.    Egypt--represented by President Mubarak--has exerted  magnanimous efforts to establish a just peace that provides  security and the legitimate rights of the region's peoples. We  say: Egypt, which is greatly concerned about peace, hopes the  Geneva summit will succeed in realizing its aspired goals and  will emerge with positive results that will lead to the  resumption of the currently frozen Washington talks in the  interest of all the peoples of the region, so that these people  can dedicate themselves to comprehensive development and survive  in an age of economic blocs.</p>

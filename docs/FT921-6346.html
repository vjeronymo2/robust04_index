			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US-Mexico close on domestic content rule agreement The US and Mexico are close to agreement on a domestic content rule which would pave the way for free trade in textiles and apparel to compete with the giant Asian producers, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Meetings are to be held next week to offer a 'sweetener' to Canada. The Canadians, who want to maintain a different rule worked out with the US in their bilateral agreement, may be offered an exemption from the US-Mexican pact. Under the current US-Canadian agreement, textile and apparel producers can use foreign yarn but not foreign fabric to get duty-free treatment. The US-Mexico rule would require that the yarn be produced in North America along with the rest of the fabric or garment.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTA BOND ISSUE  </P> <P> Yes, Vista schools are overcrowded and need refurbishing, but the November bond  issue is a poor way of taking care of the problems.  </P> <P> How did our schools get into this pickle?  </P> <P> When our school board had the opportunity to collect sufficient fees to build  new schools, it didn't, and even now it has explicitly stated its opposition to  developer fees, and declared that general obligation bonds are the only fair  method of financing new schools. It has also stated that this $38.8-million  bond is only the first of several bond issues.  </P> <P> The figure of $45 (the average annual tax on $100,000 of assessed valuation) is  quite misleading. A more revealing statement would be to say the average  homeowner would pay $109.57 the first year, and, if he should live so long,  $12.72 in the last and 20th year. These figures are based on a $100,000 home.  If your assessed value is different from that figure, multiply it by .0010957.  </P> <P> Rapid growth means a rapid increase in need for all our infrastructure:  schools, roads, sewers, jails, courts, etc. If you favor paying for all these  things so the developers can sell more houses, here's your opportunity. If you  think growth should pay its way, however, vote no on the Vista school bond.  There are better ways to finance our problems, and double sessions won't be  necessary.  </P> <P> Vote no to show your disgust with the board's deliberate policy of delayed  maintenance. Vote no to express your disapproval of the board's spending  $20,000 for a consultant to influence the election. Vote no to say school  children should not be exploited to collect money for the campaign. Send a  message to the Vista and Oceanside city councils not to approve any more houses  until the money for schools is up front.  </P> <P> LLOYD VON HADEN  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

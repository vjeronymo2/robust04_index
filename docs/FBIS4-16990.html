			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Secretly and Retrospectively"] </F>   [Text] Premier V. Chernomyrdin signed Directive No. 451-R  31 March.    Under this document the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, headed by A. Volskiy, is allocated 1.2 billion  rubles from the government's reserve fund. And in the first  quarter of the year, which has already ended!    The aim is a fine one -- to ensure that enterprises with  competitive technologies have enough funds to take part in  Washington's "Technology From Russia" exhibition, which will run  from 4 through 15 May. But why is this being done secretly,  without coordination with the legislators? Why are the  candidates to take part in the exhibition being selected not by  the state but by a social organization? It seems a state,  legally ratified program for support for highly developed  production facilities ought to be adopted to define the specific  recipients of budgetary aid.    It remains unclear just how controls will ensure that  taxpayers' funds are spent strictly as they should be. And why  is aid going without any competition to one out of hundreds of  industrialists' social organizations, rather than to the  Federation of Commodity Producers, say? All this runs directly  counter both to the principles of a healthy market and to the  idea of strengthening a rule-of-law state.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The fourth day of the Bosniak-Croatian negotiations  on implementing the Washington agreement ended late this  evening. Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for the midnight bulletin of  Croatian Radio from Vienna:    There has still been no agreement on the cantonal maps in  the  Bosniak-Croat federation. It seems that stands have been  harmonized on the hitherto controversial issue of central  Bosnia. The area is planned to be one whole canton organized on  the parity principle to reflect the 1991 population census.  Western Herzegovina is envisaged as a Croat canton and the  eastern part of Herzegovina will also be organized on the parity  principle. The negotiations will resume at 1000 on 11 May.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Protection urged for EC-aided projects GOVERNMENT economic regeneration programmes that benefit from EC aid should be protected from public-expenditure cuts, Mr Bruce Millan, EC Commissioner for the regions, said last night. In a lecture to the Audit Commission, Mr Millan warned that cuts in government spending on such projects might break the 'additionality' rule, part of the legislation governing the use of EC structural funds. The rule forbade the use of such funds to replace government expenditure. In February, the government gave undertakings that allowed the release of EC regional fund money withheld because the Commission was not satisfied that the additionality criterion would be met. However, Mr Millan warned that the detailed implementation of the undertakings was not yet 'fully clear'. He added that a strict application of the additionality rule would mean that any funding of joint projects by national governments should be 'exempt from public expenditure cuts'. Mr Millan reiterated his commitment to a bigger role for the regions in Europe, particularly in promoting EC economic development. The Commission would develop its policy of dealing directly with regions in funding regeneration programmes. 'Subsidiarity does not stop in London or in any other national capital,' he said. 'Devolving more power to the regions to devise and implement their own economic development strategies will give better results.'</p>

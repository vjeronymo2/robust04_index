			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Man Utd profits up 65% at half time: Shares recover from worries about form on the pitch Manchester United yesterday shrugged off disappointment at its inconsistent form and suspension of star players by unveiling a 65 per cent increase in first-half profits. The Premier League leaders saw pre-tax profits grow from Pounds 4.62m to Pounds 7.6m in the six months to January 31, as the club benefited from greater stadium capacity and success in cup competitions. Sir Roland Smith, chairman, said the team's style of play - which has propelled it towards the league title and FA Cup semi-finals this season - had encouraged large attendances at Old Trafford, where a new stand has increased capacity by more than a third to 44,500. The announcement prompted a 15p increase in the share price to 675p - reversing losses following recent defeats and representing a 75 per cent gain on the 1991 flotation price. Capacity crowds and higher merchandise sales fuelled a 50 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 6.6m in the first half, the period in which the club plays most fixtures and makes more than 60 per cent of its profits. Gate receipts rose 68 per cent to Pounds 10.68m, while merchandise turnover jumped threefold to Pounds 6.66m. Together, they underpinned a 75 per cent increase in total turnover to Pounds 22.8m. Although contributions from television contracts, sponsorship and conference facilities also improved, the club said it was concentrating efforts on further developing its merchandise division. Those efforts include an agreement with Manufacturers Life of Canada to offer financial services including Peps and life assurance. The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by a Pounds 2m increase in the transfer fee reserve to Pounds 3.25m, which the club said would be used to acquire new players before the July year-end. Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said the club had also negotiated new deals with kit sponsors Umbro and club sponsors Sharp. The negotiations are thought to have centred on the team's prospects in Europe, where it could qualify for either the European or UEFA Cup and, should it win the FA Cup, the Cup Winners' Cup. 'We reckon on making at least Pounds 2m if we qualify for the European Cup,' said Mr Launders. Earnings per share rose from 25.8p to 43.2p before switching funds to the transfer fee reserve, and 26.8p afterwards. An interim dividend of 6.5p (6p) is declared.</p>

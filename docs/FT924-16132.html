			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Spending cuts deal in Sweden ALL-PARTY agreement was reached early yesterday in Sweden on a crisis package to reduce public spending next year by SKr20bn (Pounds 2.1bn). The measures - hammered out in talks on Tuesday night - are designed to calm the foreign exchange markets and improve the industry's competitiveness. Sweden's central bank cut its overnight lending rate to the commercial banks yesterday from 40 per cent to 24 per cent in response to the package. Initial market reaction was positive with a sharp fall in market interest rates and a 6.4 per cent jump in the Stockholm bourse. The main changes involve a 4.3 per cent reduction in employers' social security contributions from January 1. The loss of revenue will be met by keeping the main VAT level at 25 per cent and increasing VAT on food and transport from 18 to 21 per cent. Two days are to be cut from the current statutory annual five weeks and two days paid holiday, equivalent to a 0.7 per cent reduction in employer contributions. Income tax allowances are being reduced from SKr10,000 to SKr 7,500. The main political parties also agreed to reduce housing subsidies by around SKr15bn over the next few years. These reforms follow the SKr28bn cuts in spending and SKr7bn rise in taxes agreed on September 20. Taken together, the measures will result in a long-term budgetary reinforcement of SKr70bn, bringing a substantial reduction in Sweden's structural budget deficit, estimated at 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product. The government calculates the changes will cut 4 per cent from industry's costs next year. Along with an expected low national wage agreement and productivity improvements, industry should increase its competitiveness by 11 per cent compared with 1990, especially with Germany, its most important trading partner. Ministers believe the sharp reduction in employer costs will improve employment opportunities, increase production and enhance economic stability. But the government estimates it will add SKr6,000 a year to every household's living costs. The latest crisis package was welcomed warmly by Swedish employers. 'It will strengthen industry's competitive power and make it possible to prevent unemployment rising to catastrophic levels,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel, head of the industrial employers' federation.</p>

Mr David Dunn, chairman, said contract hire produced Pounds 473,000 (Pounds 324,000) as it continued to benefit from giving 'high quality service'.

In car sales new vehicle registrations were ahead 9 per cent but at a small cost to the used car business. The chairman said that after-sales activities remained strong, despite extended service intervals and improved vehicle reliability. Turnover came to Pounds 39.6m (Pounds 35m) realising an operating surplus of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.26m). Interest costs were cut to Pounds 492,000 (Pounds 657,000).

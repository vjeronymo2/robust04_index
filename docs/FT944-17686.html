			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Bonn in aviation research offer The German government yesterday approved DM600m (Pounds 245m) for civil aviation research but told industry that it would have to put up the same amount if the four-year programme is to go ahead. Mr Paul Kruger, technology minister, said the money would be spent on developing lighter materials for aircraft manufacture which in turn would lead to lower fuel consumption and less pollution. The new generation of aircraft would include a 600-800 seater jumbo jet and quieter helicopters. A new generation of engines using up to 25 per cent less fuel is also planned, Mr Kruger said. Mr Kruger warned that the German aviation industry, which is grouped mainly around Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, was still in the midst of massive restructuring. However, the aviation market worldwide was expected to grow sharply towards the end of the century, he said.</p>

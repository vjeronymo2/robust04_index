			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (4): Ashes without a phoenix - Western Europe (except France) is at an impasse THE nuclear industry in OECD Europe, outside France, is fighting to survive past the early decades of the next century. For with France excluded, there are no definite plans for any more nuclear capacity on line before the end of the century. Only in Britain, where Nuclear Electric has asked to build Sizewell C after completing Sizewell B, and in Finland, where Parliament has just voted down a plan to build a fifth reactor, are there signs of potential activity. Elsewhere, construction is at a standstill. In Belgium there has been a moratorium since 1989 and new demand is being met by gas-fired stations. In Spain, the 1984 moratorium, which left five stations unfinished, continues until 2000. A policy of no new construction has applied in the Netherlands since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In Germany, an extremely complex legal situation has kept a completed reactor at Mulheim-Karlich off-line since 1988, although its owners - RWE - successfully sued the local government for damages. In Switzerland, the 320MW BKW Muhleberg reactor is to be expanded to 352MW by 2000, but this hardly constitutes much of an advance. In Sweden, official policy still insists on the 1983 referendum decision to phase out nuclear, although the policy had been modified to ensure that functioning reactors would not be shut until there were alternative sources of power. The result is that OECD Europe will only see much advance on its 118.8GW of existing nuclear capacity through continuing French expansion. Here, four new 1,400MW reactors are under construction and will come on line between 1995 and 1998. Four further sites are now being chosen. Yet the French programme has not been without its problems. Steam generators have had to be replaced in phases in the 900MW series of reactors, while a generic design fault has been found in the 1,300MW series. Equally, Electricite de France's 1,140MW commercial scale fast breeder reactor - Superphenix - has been off-line since 1990. It may now be restarted at 50 per cent of its nominal capacity, primarily as a nuclear waste incinerator. All this takes place against a general assumption that 21st century Europe will need more nuclear capacity to meet the challenges of carbon dioxide output. Such an assumption has been much discussed recently because in the absence of further orders the industry will slowly wither away. Equally, it is difficult to attract young engineers. The dilemma is illustrated by the situation in Nuclear Electric in the UK. Compared with the nuclear section of the old Central Electricity Generating Board in pre-privatisation days, Nuclear Electric has been doing astonishingly well. It is finishing its first PWR reactor at Sizewell B eight months ahead of schedule and on budget and the new reactor should be on-line far earlier than the target of February 1995. Yet as important has been the improvement in performance of its AGR reactors. In 1989-90, these produced 21.7 terawatt hours and were widely held in contempt. However by 1992-93, the output had improved to 34.6 twh. The key here has been improved load factor, the amount of time these high capital cost reactors are on-line. While critics may say that its competitive position is unfair due to the non-fossil-fuel levy, or wonder why the situation was so bad under the old CEGB, the fact remains that the UK's nuclear power sector is a good deal better run now than it was four years ago. Yet there are many problems ahead. Of Nuclear Electric's 9,029MW capacity, excluding Sizewell B, 3,349MW consists of elderly Magnox reactors. These are approaching the end of their design life. While assuming successful safety inspections, many of these could continue running for some time, the expenditure involved as a result of safety reviews tends to increase the cost of operating them. Sizewell B, at 1,200MW, consequently does not compensate for the impending, if phased, closure of the Magnox capacity. Even with a continuing improvement in the efficiency of its AGRs, Nuclear Electric is still left with a fall in its capacity, and thus of market share, towards 2000. Unless, of course, it builds Sizewell C. The arguments about Sizewell C encapsulate many of the problems facing the Western European nuclear industry. The success of the French nuclear programme basically lay in the French government's decision to go nuclear as a result of perceived energy shortages. The French built their plant in series. The same design and construction teams built similar plant all over the country. One technical argument for Sizewell C is that the same design and construction people will do the job. If a decision is postponed, or avoided, that newly acquired expertise will inevitably disperse. Yet Nuclear Electric's ability to continue its new PWR series depends on raising the necessary finance. Being in the public sector, constrained government finances make it unlikely that funding will be made available. To build Sizewell C necessarily requires Nuclear Electric to be privatised or at least allowed to appeal for private funds. But even if this eventually happens, the company may have difficulty persuading a reluctant City to take on the necessary liabilities. It was these liabilities that prevented the nuclear industry from being privatised in the first place. There are frequent exhortations from government ministers, both in the UK and elsewhere, that the proportion of nuclear should rise, or at minimum stay level, for strategic reasons. Yet the intellectual tide, in a period of relatively low energy prices, is against nuclear. State involvement is frequently necessary to ease the entry of private capital. Capital costs are high and the nuclear time horizon is long. The market, by contrast, is opening out to competition all over Europe, with the thrust towards 'third party access' to national and international electricity grids. Contractual insecurity is growing as a result. It was no accident that in Britain's 'dash for gas' the power technology chosen was gas-fired because these stations could be built very rapidly and at low capital cost. Strategic energy planners for the 21st century can make as many prophecies as they like about the necessity of a growing role for nuclear. The problem is that the longer the European moratorium lasts, the more the French alone will dominate its revival, if it can be revived at all. Equally, the nuclear generating industry is still tied into the idea, prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, that very cheap electricity could be attained by closing the nuclear fuel cycle. This meant reprocessing with all its attendant public hostility, rather than final disposal of spent fuel. Yet reprocessing fuel is essentially irrelevant to generating electricity from nuclear power in fission reactors. The industry supports reprocessing at Sellafield and Cap La Hague because it has marched too far down the reprocessing path and it has become impossible to retrieve its spent fuel rods from the storage ponds at Sellafield. But if the industry is to survive and grow in Western Europe, the nettle of long term waste disposal must be grasped. Chris Cragg is Editor of FT Energy Economist</p>

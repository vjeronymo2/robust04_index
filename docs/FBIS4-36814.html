			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tawfiq Jazulit in al-Mukalla, south Yemen -- </F> italicized passages recorded]    [Text] [Jazulit] The residents of Aden today appealed to UN  envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to visit their city and learn about their  worsening conditions as a result of the war, but he apologized  for security reasons.    [Brahimi] It is difficult for me to go for one reason:  Namely, the security situation is unstable. The United Nations  is evacuating people from there. I know that there is a shortage  of medicine in the hospitals, but it is not possible for a UN  plane or for the UN envoy to go there while the cease-fire is  not holding. A Red Cross ship has been waiting for several  days, begging in vain for permission to dock and unload food.  These people have been my friends for 30 years; they are  neutral. But there is one point on which we are not neutral:  The need for a cease-fire.    [Jazulit] Before leaving al-Mukalla, Brahimi met with 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, president of the new state in south Yemen.  Because the southerners stick to their position, the meeting  produced no positive results regarding an end to the war.    [Al-Bid] I believe brother Lakhdar Brahimi has learned  about the situation. He has repeatedly said, even before he  arrived here, that priority should be given to a cease-fire. I  think he is right. We have to do everything to achieve this  objective now.    [Jazulit] Brahimi expressed the identical position to that  of  the southern political leadership concerning a cease-fire.    [Brahimi] My conclusion is what he [al-Bid] has just  said, that the brothers here support a cease-fire and the  beginning of the dialogue.    [Jazulit] Brahimi left al-Mukalla without convincing the  southern political leadership of a federation or a confederation  as a compromise solution. He also apologized to the people of  Aden for not being able to visit them for security reasons. The  southerners attach hope to a decisive Security Council decision.  Otherwise, the war of attrition may drag for long. The war  goes on.</p>

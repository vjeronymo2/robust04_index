			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Norton awaits another rescue NORTON, a famous old name in motorcycling, will be born again in corporate terms if Pounds 2.5m of new equity can be placed with institutions. Norton Group is under investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry and its shares have been suspended since March last year because of a failure to produce results. If the refinancing goes to plan, it will not be the first time that Norton has risen from the ashes. It came close to collapse in the early 1970s and the first, abortive, resurrection attempt involved a workers' co-operative at the Meriden works, near Coventry. In 1986 the shell company was revived by Mr Philippe Le Roux, a motorcycle fan and former merchant banker. He resigned as chief executive in January 1991. A new management has disposed of a problematic German fasteners subsidiary. Other problems have included trading losses of Pounds 2m at Norton Motors in 1990-91, and borrowings of about Pounds 6m. Mr Norman Wilson, a director, said motor losses were cut to Pounds 47,000 last year. Under the refinancing plan, those subscribing for the Pounds 2.5m of shares would own the bulk of a new company - still keeping the Norton name - which would be listed; existing holders would also be offered a stake. The remainder of the debt with Midland Bank would be rescheduled 'to give us a breathing space', Mr Wilson said. The company, which makes rotary engines and has a profitable US piping components subsidiary, has not produced a motorcycle for two years. The F1 racing bike was priced at about Pounds 13,000, but lost money. Mr Wilson said a new motorcycle would be brought out in the next couple of months aimed at 'the more commercial end of the market'.</p>

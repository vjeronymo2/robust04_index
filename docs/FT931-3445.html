			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Barings chairman quits after policy dispute MR Christopher Heath, the man who built Baring Securities into one of the UK's most successful securities houses in the late 1980s, yesterday resigned along with a large part of his senior management team after a policy dispute over the company's future. Mr Heath and his team are believed to have pushed for Barings to expand its securities and derivatives business in a move that could have led the group to sell a stake to another bank. Mr Andrew Tuckey, deputy chairman, said no specific proposals had been put to the board, but added that 'none of these initiatives have any appeal to us, because we have neither the capital nor the inclination' to expand the business. The move comes six months after Barings, one of the UK's oldest merchant banking groups, announced that its securities arm had plunged into loss in the first half of 1992, cutting group profits by more than a half to Pounds 11.8m. More than 100 jobs were shed at that stage, and yesterday's departures raised the prospect of further cuts in the securities arm and its 80-strong derivatives unit. Mr Tuckey said the parting had been amicable and that Mr Heath, the company's chairman and once the UK's highest-paid director, would remain as a consultant to the group. Others directors to depart were Mr Ian Martin, head of derivatives, and Mr Andrew Baylis, head of European operations, while Mr Jim Reed, head of New York, and Ms Vanessa Gibson have also left the Barings Securities Board. One of the executives who stepped down said that discussions over the future of the company had come to a head last weekend: 'One route would have been more exciting and expansionist - and, yes, might have required more capital and an extra partner. The other was more consolidating. At the end of the day, it's very difficult to back something you don't agree with.' Two other directors, Mr Andrew Fraser and Mr Diarmaid Kelly, have been made deputy chairmen. Mr Peter Norris, put in by Barings as chief operating officer last autumn, takes over as chief executive.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lamont right at the end - Ballot Box As the campaign drew to a close, it was difficult not to feel sorry for Norman Lamont. The chancellor shot his credibility last year by prematurely predicting an economic upturn 'round the corner' and espying too soon the 'green shoots' of recovery, and so has been in no position to exploit several recent signs of the economic revival. If it takes at least three pieces of evidence to make a trend, there is reason to hope for better times ahead. One survey this week has found a majority of UK businessmen expecting higher orders and sales. Another report says that Britain's purchasing managers are buying more. Retail sales have edged higher for two months and consumer confidence has risen. Such evidence may not be enough to declare an end to the recession. But should we be surprised, if, at some point in the future, statistics show that the British economy was moving upwards in April 1992?</p>

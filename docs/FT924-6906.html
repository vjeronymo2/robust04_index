			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: New offer on motor plant CHRYSLER and the Austrian government made a new offer to the European Commission yesterday in an attempt to avert duties on diesel-powered Voyager minivan imports into the EC. It would mean almost halving the overall level of state aid to the Chrysler plant near Graz. Brussels had decided to impose 10 per cent duty on the Chrysler vehicles, but delayed, to allow time for a revised offer. The deadline was to have expired today but was extended for a week to allow technical discussions. The case is sensitive for Austria, which is about to open negotiations on joining the EC.</p>

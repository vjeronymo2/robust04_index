			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SATURDAY STAR </H6>   Time for TEC To Act -- "The Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] must act now to ensure that Transkei co-operates fully  with the police in investigating last week's massacre at the  Heidelberg Tavern in Cape Town -- or risk severe damage to its  credibility," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in  English on 8 January on page 8 notes. The TEC, which is  "supposed to embody the progress reached at the talks, remains  silent, leaving this critical issue suspended in the hot air  generated by the SAP's [South African Police] increasingly  heated allegations against Transkei and [Transkei military  leader] Holomisa's absurd demands for an independent inquiry  conducted solely by foreigners." The TEC is "not being asked to  condone another raid on Transkei," but "to deliver the  accountable, flexible and responsive government that the  negotiators kept promising" as South Africans "worry about  killers being caught, not what political points are scored by  whom."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Secret Vote a Cornerstone of Democracy -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans of 4 January points out in a page 8  editorial: "One issue which continues to feature in the  country's political debate is that of a secret ballot. It is a  cornerstone of democracy, because only if voters know that they  can make a free choice at the polling booth can there be any  talk of a truly fair election. Unfortunately our tradition of  violence and intimidation serves as a weapon in the political  arsenal." "Add to this a huge new voter corps which is still  politically unsophisticated, and it becomes clear that the ideal  of a free election is threatened by threats, superstition, and  distorted information." "Just how important this matter is has  again been underlined by claims that members of the African  National Congress' military wing are joining the National Party  [NP] and the Democratic Party." BEELD continues: "The very fact  that the NP is not prepared to say who, and how many, of them  have joined its ranks is another indication that our political  climate is not healthy. The more open the process, the easier  it would be to separate fact from propaganda. No matter how  strong the urge for power, political parties owe it to South  Africa to create a culture of moral competition. It is as  strong a guarantee as a new constitution."    Police Deaths `Unaffordable' -- "Last year alone 260 South  African policemen died violently --people who, in the combating  of crime, have become the victims of that crime," notes a second  editorial on page 8 of the same issue of BEELD. For a force  working under extremely difficult conditions, this "slaughter is  unaffordably high. It is a fact that the police have an  unenviable and dangerous task, because it does not always  involve only the combating of crime. More and more they find  themselves in the crossfire of power-hungry political groups to  whom human lives, including those of policemen, have become very  cheap." "It is difficult to understand why the communities  refuse to help the police. Their refusal leads to a chain  reaction which eventually boomerangs, because it feeds anarchy  and promotes the climate of violence. In the end it is not only  the police, but the community and the country as a whole who  suffer under the chaos created by these criminals."    Siting of Parliament Already a Serious Debate -- The  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 5 January says in a page 10  editorial: "One of the most sensitive political debates in South  Africa is that of the siting of Parliament in a new  dispensation. At the moment it is still a whispered debate, but  it is already being seriously talked about. Chances are that  none of the major parties would like to bring this issue out  into the open. An election campaign is on the go, and with the  important emphasis which regional parlaiments will be given,  parties would certainly not wish to disturb or harm regional  interests." It is a fact, adds BEELD, "that the advantages and  disadvantages of two capitals -- Cape Town the legislative and  Pretoria the administrative -- are already being studied in  political, economic, and diplomatic circles. The ANC [African  National Congress] has confirmed that some of its officials are  in favor of moving Parliament, and within the ruling party the  matter has sometimes also been discussed unofficially. We do  not wish to set in motion an emotional debate because we believe  that the election campaign must deal with fundamental issues,"  but "we do await the eventual debate on this vital issue."    Right Channels Not Followed with Transkei -- A second  editorial in the 5 Janaury edition argues that: "In the light of  what has taken place in the past, one would expect the police to  be vary careful when they accuse Transkei's Major General Bantu  Holomisa." "For quite some time now efforts have been made to  prove that the general allows his country to be used as a  springboard for terrorist attacks on South Africa." Until now  all these efforts have boomeranged. The worst instance was the  defense force raid on a so- called base of the Pan-Africanist  Congress' military wing in Umtata. Now it is being alleged that  the police know exactly where the suspects of the Cape Town  tavern attack are, but that they can do nothing because these  people are hiding in Transkei. On the surface it would seem  that this sensitive matter is being mishandled. It looks as  though the correct channels were not followed to remove the  stumbling blocks. Gen. Holomisa has offered his full  cooperation in the investigation. Accept the offer, let justice  take its course, and bring the guilty to book."    Parties Have Duty to Make TEC Succeed -- A third editorial  on  5 January on page 10 of BEELD warns: "The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] has not even had its first full session of 1994  and already there is talk of a test of strength between the TEC  and the government over political and security issues in  kwaZulu." "No one wants to avoid robust politics. Nevertheless  the role players in the TEC, and in particular their political  masters, must realize that they have a duty to make the TEC  succeed. The political confidence index among the South African  public is not particularly high at present. If the TEC, in whom  considerable hope has been placed, becomes involved in a  tug-of-war at this early stage, the already difficult transition  will be made that much more difficult." Leaders should ensure,  says BEELD, "that the TEC is not discredited in the eyes of the  public as just another political wrestling ring. They must  show...an understanding for the realities of this country."</p>

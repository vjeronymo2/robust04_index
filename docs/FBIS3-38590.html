			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN)--Federal Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has called for the maintenance of Bundeswehr troop  strength at 370,000 men. Kinkel told the Cologne newspaper  EXPRESS (Friday [4 February] edition) that he recognized the  financial difficulties and the concerns of Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe. However, in his view it is "imperative to  maintain" a troop strength of 370,000 men. If the Bundeswehr is  reduced any further, it would be difficult, sooner or later, to  meet the constitutional obligation to meet defense requirements,  he explained. "We must establish what sort of troop strength we  need for which tasks, and then money can be discussed. It should  not be the other way round, under the motto `How much money do  we have, and how many soldiers can we afford on that.'"    Regarding plans by the defense minister not to take part in  any more international UN missions on cost grounds, Kinkel said  that if the United Nations should ask the German Government to  participate in another mission such as Somalia this year, "we  cannot say no from the start on cost grounds." Such a request  must be thoroughly considered on an individual basis and in the  light of the constitutional situation and all the circumstances  involved.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW COMES BACK FOR VICTORY  </P> <P> Randy Karliner, after being knocked out on Ocean View's previous series, came  back to throw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Al Cano in the corner of the end zone  with 1:09 left in the game to knock Saddleback out of the lead, and Ron  Lightner's extra point gave Ocean View a 14-13 victory Friday night at  Huntington Beach High School.  </P> <P> Ocean View's hopes for victory appeared to dim when Karliner was knocked to the  ground by Hernan DeSantos while lunging for a first down on a fourth-down  scramble.  </P> <P> Karliner fell two yards short, giving Saddleback the ball on its 30 with 3:56  to play.  </P> <P> But the Seahawk defense forced Saddleback to punt after three plays and, after  Dennis Eichen's 29-yard return, Ocean View had a first down at the Roadrunners'  36.  </P> <P> Two minutes was all Karliner needed to catch his breath. After an incompletion,  the 6-2 senior hit Jeff Bush on a crossing pattern for 22 yards and then  drilled the ball to Cano to tie the score.  </P> <P> Saddleback (0-1) scored first when DeSantos capped a 63-yard, 14-play drive by  diving over from the one. DeSantos added the extra point and the Roadrunners  led, 7-0.  </P> <P> Ocean View (1-0) answered on its next possession when Karliner threw 47 yards  to Bush to cap a three-play, 67-yard drive. Lightner hit the extra point and  the score was 7-7 at halftime.  </P> <P> After Saddleback received the second-half kick, Paul Delgado capped a 79-yard  drive with a 31-yard pass to Robert Reyes. The extra point failed after the  Roadrunners were assessed a 15-yard personal-foul penalty. That made the extra  point a 28-yard effort that DeSantos missed wide right.  </P></p>

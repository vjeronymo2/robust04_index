			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Ashdown slams 'hostile' Tory policy on Europe Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night attacked the government for allowing its policy on Europe to swing dangerously between indecision and hostility. Mr Ashdown said: 'It is time for Britain's financial and business community to put pressure on the government for a more positive approach.' He said that the exclusion of sterling from a single European currency would damage the entire country and that the City would 'suffer most of all'. Speaking to members of the Corporation of London's policy and resources committee, he forecast that a 'core group' of the 12 member states would form a monetary union within six years. Mr Ashdown dismissed the demands of the Tory Euro-sceptics that Britain should reject such a development outright, and deplored the 'wait-and-see' attitude of the government and Labour leaders. He also rejected the view that because of its strength and worldwide reputation the City would maintain its dominant position even if Britain were outside a European monetary union. Mr Ashdown insisted that such opinions were a snare, a trap and a delusion. He said: 'A single currency is not an issue that we can put off indefinitely.' He reaffirmed that after the next general election the Liberal Democrats would use their influence to ensure that Britain was not excluded from a single currency. Mr Ashdown appealed to the City to adopt a more constructive role in tackling the 'short-termism' which had held back Britain's economic development. He suggested that a committee should be appointed to examine the long-term investment needs of business and recommend how the situation could be improved.</p>

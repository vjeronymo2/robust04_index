			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Shining knights - Thrillers MEAN HIGH TIDE by James Hall Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 340 pages THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD by Lawrence Block Orion Pounds 15.99, 361 pages SACRED CLOWNS by Tony Hillerman Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 284 pages The great novelist of modern-day Florida is John D MacDonald; the word thriller is inadequate. He died eight years ago but his principal creation, Travis McGee, lives on. There were 21 Travis McGee stories and they have become classics of popular fiction because MacDonald had an idea of genius, to translate the Arthurian knight of medieval chivalry to 20th-century America. Travis McGee is therefore much more than a bronzed and battered middle-aged beach bum; he is more, and more interesting, than the routine private eye: he is an archetypal Hero. But John D MacDonald is also important because he is the master of the Florida School which today promises to dominate American crime fiction. Carl Hiaasen is one of the newer and most successful members, a Miami journalist with a wild satirical humour. James Hall is another, and is clearly pitching to be MacDonald's heir. What they all share is an obsessive rage about the rampant commercial over-development which is rapidly destroying their Florida. But their books are more than 'eco-thrillers'. James Hall's Mean High Tide is his fifth novel. Like McGee, his reclusive drop out hero Thorn is bronzed, battered, middle-aged, etc., with a similar taste for sea and sun and sex and a hatred of bureaucrats and businessmen. The same characters and locations crop up. Thorn's girl is murdered (he has a habit of losing the women in his life). There is a maniac with a loopy daughter and a plan to breed red tilapia (that's a fish]) which will destroy the ecological balance of the region. Hall's world is very violent, his villains are very villainous, and the sex is more explicit than MacDonald, the old-fashioned romantic, would have sanctioned, but he can write almost as well as his master and the dialogue is as strong as Elmore Leonard's. What he does not have - and may not understand - is the universality of McGee, the knight in not-so-shining armour. Mandarin have just re-issued Under Cover of Daylight, Squall Line and Hard Aground (not about Thorn) in paperback. Start with the first. Far to the north, in the differently-polluted streets of New York, Lawrence Block is bidding to be the eventual heir of Robert Parker. The American hero these days has to be a credible, fallible human being - a resurrected James Bond wouldn't stand a chance - and, in these enlightened times, it helps if he has a long-running Relationship with a real live woman, not a succession of bimbos. Block's triumph is Scudder, the ex-cop and alcoholic who seems to spend a lot of his books either in an AA meeting or sipping club soda in Irish bars. The girlfriend, Elaine, is an East Side call-girl. Again, they are both in early middle-age and, despite their lurid background, they both turn out to be interesting and credible people. The Scudder books have been slow to cross the Atlantic. A Ticket to the Boneyard, just re-issued by Orion in paperback, was a terrifying and brilliantly successful story of their being terrorised by a psychotic murderer. The Devil Knows You're Dead takes us into slightly quieter waters, starting with the motiveless murder of a yuppie lawyer on Eleventh Avenue. Block has the confidence to take his plot slowly and to build in a serious novelist's consideration of themes that lesser crime writers steer clear of  -the justification of suicide, for example. His underworld is convincing and alarming; he has that vital page-turning compulsion; he deserves all the plaudits. Tony Hillerman is an authority on the Navajos who had the fascinating idea of setting a crime series in today's Indian territory. His double-act of Lieutenant Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is cleverly balanced: Leaphorn is widowed and wise, Chee wants to become a shaman as well as a good cop, which offers all sorts of tensions for a novelist. To my mind Sacred Clowns, which has even more anthropological business than usual, is a bit flat, but it will no doubt satisfy the devotees.</p>

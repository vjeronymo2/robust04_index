			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY PLANS TO ACCEPT FUNDING FROM NEA  </P> <P> While some artists and arts groups across the country are rejecting or  threatening to reject grants from the National Endowment for the Arts,  objecting to Congressional attempts to control artistic content, Orange  County's Pacific Symphony plans to accept pending endowment funding of $45,000  for 1990-91.  </P> <P> Most of the objections have focused on a form, mandated by Congress, that grant  recipients must sign this year. The form states that they will not use grant  money to produce obscene artworks that do not meet standards of artistic  excellence, which are not defined.  </P> <P> Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto said Monday, "Our art form  is not under fire. Pacific Symphony will sign our grant form."  </P> <P> Spisto said the pending NEA grant would underwrite conductors' fees, not the  creation of music, therefore eliminating the possibility that the orchestra  would be producing "obscene" artworks with the money.  </P> <P> Asked whether the orchestra had considered rejecting the grant anyway, to show  solidarity with other artists whose work is "under fire," Spisto said: "We need  the (NEA) support. Our organization is not at the state in its development  where it can afford to turn down a $45,000 grant.  </P> <P> "Speaking personally, I feel the NEA should be funded without obscenity-tied  language. But it is more important that the NEA continue. That is the major  battle."  </P> <P> The Orange County Philharmonic Society also has received preliminary notice of  an NEA grant but has made no decision whether to accept it, according to  executive director Erich Vollmer. The $3,500 grant would support a series of  American artists at the new Irvine Theatre, expected to open this fall.  </P> <P> The society's trustees will discuss the matter this weekend, Vollmer said.  </P> <P> At South Coast Repertory, a longtime NEA recipient in Costa Mesa, artistic  director Martin Benson said: "We will have to consider (the question of  accepting future NEA funding) very carefully. But I think we need to accept NEA  funds, while fighting to have the strictures removed in the granting process."  </P> <P> SCR has received $1 million from the NEA since 1980, more than any other Orange  County arts organization. About $650,000 went to operating funds, $350,000 to  capital funds. Last year, the theater received $95,000 from the NEA; this year,  it applied for $180,000. The NEA's response to the current grant request is  expected in June or July.  </P> <P> "At this point," said Benson, "we are choosing plays exactly as we have for 26  years, and we will continue to do so. If the strictures reached a point where  it affected our artistic choices, we would disassociate ourselves from the NEA  or any contributors -- public or private -- who would restrict our freedom to  choose."  </P> <P> At the Newport Harbor Art Museum, spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber said, "We haven't  dealt with (the NEA issue) yet because we don't hear till the middle of June"  whether the museum will receive three grants, totaling $156,000, for which it  has applied, primarily for exhibitions.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen any document with that language (barring support of allegedly  obscene art) yet, and we haven't come up with a policy to address it," Gaiber  said.  </P> <P> A decision has been made by the museum trustees to include a statement about  the NEA issue in the July/August calendar it will send to members, but the  statement itself has not been determined, Gaiber said.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor received $111,000 from the NEA in 1989.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jan Herman and Cathy Curtis contributed to this story.  </P></p>

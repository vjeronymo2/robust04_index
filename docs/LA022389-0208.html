			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING A SCENE;  </P> <P> THE WAY OFF BROADWAY ACTING WORKSHOP IS NO PLACE FOR THE TIMID OR THIN-SKINNED  </P> <P> Michelle Fashian is having trouble getting her lip to quiver. She has just  spilled her guts but can't muster the tears necessary to carry the scene.  </P> <P> Gregory Bach, the drama instructor leading the group of 10 young adults in the  Way Off Broadway acting workshop, is displeased. His two proteges on stage are  not emoting enough. They are not believable. They're not cookin'.  </P> <P> "Agony, baby, agony," he yells as Fashian portrays an impoverished New Yorker.  "You're 10 years old. You're hurting. All you want to do is put your head on  your mother's breast. C'mon, Michelle. You need the image. Quiver! Let it out.  Full cry. Get it cookin'."  </P> <P> The small room is silent as Fashian, a 23-year-old assistant manager of a  children's shoe store, reaches into her soul, groping for the memory of some  long-ago anguish, anything that might bring tears to her eyes. When she finally  musters a quiver, Bach yelps. "You're cookin'!' "  </P> <P> The students are not actors, but most of them would like to be. They are  waiters, forklift operators, salespersons and dental assistants, almost all in  their 20s, who are taking acting classes at night at the Way Off Broadway, a  makeshift theater/studio that occupies a couple of rooms in an industrial  building off Grand Avenue in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Organized 2 years ago by Orange County actor Tony Reverditto, the  one-night-a-week workshops, which are scheduled to run from 7 to 10:30 p.m. but  sometimes stretch into the early morning hours, cost $80 a month -- and a lot  of time and energy. Most students meet 5 nights a week to study the scenes that  are performed for the class on Wednesday nights. In addition, the group is  rehearsing a full-length play, Frances Swann's "Out of the Frying Pan," one of  six productions they present each year.  </P> <P> ("Out of the Frying Pan," a Depression-era screwball comedy, will be performed  at 8 p.m. tonight, Friday and Saturday and March 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11. The  theater is at 1058 E. 1st St., Santa Ana. For more information, call (714)  547-8997.)  </P> <P> Fashian is not the only student who devotes all her free time -- 4 nights and 2  days a week -- to acting classes and rehearsals. The others rehearse just as  rigorously, knowing that if they perform their scenes badly, they will hear  about it in front of the whole class.  </P> <P> For these beginners, acting is an all-encompassing hobby that holds little  chance of becoming an occupation. They are only too familiar with the  contradictory phrase "working actor." But few are willing to let go of the  dream.  </P> <P> "My ultimate goal would be to make money at something I love, which would be  acting," Fashian says. "But it's not too realistic, is it?"  </P> <P> Reverditto -- who not only runs the studio (he is now trying to obtain  nonprofit status), but also attends the workshops -- has more credits than  anyone else in the class. Still, he knows it's a long way to Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I figure there's no room at the bottom and plenty of room at the top," he  says. "I know I'll make it. It just may take some time."  </P> <P> But Jim Huang, a salesman in Orange, says he's not sure he wants to make the  commitment needed to become a professional actor.  </P> <P> "There are so many people doing it," he says, "and it's not a high-security  type thing. Unless you commit all the way, it's hard. You have to know it's  what you're going to do with your life. But I really like it as a craft."  </P> <P> Some of the students have no interest in pursuing acting as a profession. John  Stuczynski, an agent for Farmers Insurance Group in Newport Beach, said the  classes help him communicate with customers and muster composure during crises.  </P> <P> Says Reverditto: "A lot of the people  </P> <P> who come here just want to gain more confidence in their jobs. Some have had an  interest in theater but never pursued it before, and others have been acting  for a long time."  </P> <P> The students take the classes for varying lengths of time, depending on their  experience, he adds. Some stay 6 months, others for years.  </P> <P> "What we learn here is good to use in everyday life," says Carol Giglio, a  23-year-old dental assistant who lives in Anaheim. "They are exercises in  opening your mind. They help you cope."  </P> <P> Jim Huang agrees. "It kind of breaks down your shell a little bit, breaks  through the armor."  </P> <P> Although most of the students say they love the acting classes and don't mind  the time commitment, many say their purses sometimes feel the pinch.  </P> <P> "I've kind of been hanging by a thread," says Michael Kemp, a 26-year-old  waiter. "Eighty dollars a month isn't a great deal, but when your car breaks  down it is. You can sure start feeling sorry for yourself, saying, 'Look at all  the time I'm putting into this,' but that's just the way it is."  </P> <P> Nearly all the students work during the day and study acting at night. For  Giglio, the two go hand in hand. She uses her dental career not only to pay the  bills but also to help perfect her acting technique.  </P> <P> "It's great because it's a way to really study people and their mannerisms,"  she says. "I steal from them."  </P> <P> The students are investing not only their time in the elusive goal of becoming  an actor but emotional energy as well. Wednesday's scene studies are filled  with Bach-induced outbursts of naked anger and anguish, which at times seem  almost violent in the workshop's intimate surroundings. A little hallway  adjoining the stage is used for deep breathing and profuse sweating -- a place  to regain control or cool down after a scene.  </P> <P> It took Fashian weeks to be able to quiver on command. At first she was scared  to death by the way Bach coaxed his students -- by provoking them into fits of  emotional frenzy. When Bach yelled, she winced. But now, Fashian is starting to  cook.  </P> <P> "First time I ever went to class I was scared for the person up there, the way  Greg tore into him. But it was the most I ever saw an acting teacher do," says  the former drama major. "He really gets responses. . . . He helps you do all  the work."  </P> <P> "You have to put yourself on the line," Huang says. "That's the hardest part,  sitting up there in front of a whole bunch of people and crying. It's like Greg  says, you try not to cry in real life and here you try to cry."  </P> <P> Because the Wednesday night scene studies are meant to help the students  overcome acting problems, they are no fun for the thin-skinned. Everyone is  criticized on stage. Personality quirks, nervous tendencies and habits that  inhibit or intrude are analyzed.  </P> <P> "Right now my acting problem is what Greg calls (being able to) 'cook,' but I  can't seem to let my emotions out unless he provokes me. I can't cry," Fashian  says.  </P> <P> Bach says all the students have the ability to tap that reservoir of emotion --  they just need help shedding their inhibitions and unlearning things they were  taught along the way to becoming adults. They need to become children again.  </P> <P> "We all have that little 10-year-old in us, the little kid full of imagination,  freedom and spontaneity," Bach explains. "We need to hold onto that kid when  we're on stage because he has the freedom to show his emotions, he's not afraid  of looking like a fool."  </P> <P> Bach's 21 years of directing and producing -- mostly plays in Orange County and  Los Angeles -- have taught him how to get performances out of his acting  students. He says they are like car batteries; they have to be charged up.  </P> <P> "I'm not trying to pull a psychological trip on them," says the 50-year-old  director. "What I'm trying to do is teach them how to work with directors. To  take direction."  </P> <P> Brenda Beals and Michael Gaffney, both insurance advisers and recent immigrants  from Oklahoma, are performing a scene from the James Reach play "Patterns,"  which they have been rehearsing for several weeks.  </P> <P> Unsatisfied with Gaffney's portrayal of a rising executive and his ambivalence  toward his boss, Bach goads him, at first quietly, then with shouts and orders:  "C'mon, Mike. I'll be your boss. What do you think of me? Build the core.  Improvise. Tell me how you feel. You're hurtin', man."  </P> <P> "I think you're a (expletive) pig!" Mike yells.  </P> <P> "C'mon, tell me off, how do you feel?"  </P> <P> "I think you're a (expletive) pig!"  </P> <P> "I'm your boss," Bach says.  </P> <P> "You pig! Have a heart! Have a heart! Have a heart!" Mike screams at the top of  his lungs. He's breathing so heavily he can hardly talk. He disappears into the  hallway to sweat and breathe before emerging, still shaking, to try the scene  again.  </P> <P> "Mask it, Mike," Bach says. "Sit on it. Keep that core. Build on it. Go!"  </P> <P> The scene is replayed and this time Bach is pleased.  </P> <P> "Hey, you could have stuck that one in the can," he says, indicating a wrap.  "That's serendipity, you guys. Could you feel it working?"  </P> <P> "When I was cooking up and finding my core, I found myself not so conscious of  my body," says Mike, who has a tendency to shuffle his feet and squint on  stage.  </P> <P> "That's it. Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself," Bach responds. "What's  our whole theme in this room?"  </P> <P> The class answers in unison.  </P> <P> "Look stupid."  </P></p>

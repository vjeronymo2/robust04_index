			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ling Qi (0407 3825) and Fang </F> Zhengxin (2455 2973 1800); edited by Lu Jian (7120 0256):  "Outstanding Issues in Developing Spiritual Civilization"]    [Text] [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    One is that it lacks a "position" in the brain. Some cadres  and people believe that developing the economy is hard and  practical and developing the spiritual civilization is soft and  empty. So, they lack a strong sense of urgency toward developing  the spiritual civilization. Some comrades believe that with the  whole party taking development of the economy as its core,  development of the spiritual civilization should "clear out and  make way." If we only do a good job on the economy, we can  "cover 100 uglies with one pretty," and development of the  spiritual civilization will automatically come up. In the vast  majority of enterprises, factory head and secretary are  shouldered by the same person and he has no time to attend to  the development of the spiritual civilization. In quite a few  enterprises, the full-time assistant secretary is the main  person responsible for running the factory or is concurrently  chief of the political work section, carrying little weight.  This causes the occurrence of "the factory head does not have  the energy and the secretary does not have the authority; the  factory head is not in position and the secretary is afraid to  exceed his position" in enterprise political ideology, and the  development of spiritual civilization is an "empty portfolio."  It is said from the ranks of the political workers themselves  that in the great tide of the market economy, some comrades  mistakenly believe that now is the "spring of economic work and  the fall of political ideological work." They say that "ten  years of supply and marketing makes one wealthy, ten years of  science and technology makes one highly skilled, and ten years  of political work is all in vain" and "a basket of great  principles is not equal to a single great solidarity." They have  a losing feeling, a feeling of self-pity, and a feeling of  crisis about developing the spiritual civilization. A few  comrades have the one-sided understanding that "if one has a  ticket he gets a seat and if one does not have a ticket, he  gives up his seat." They think with all there heart about  leaving their political work position and changing jobs to  struggle for money.    The second thing is not knowing how to do the work. Some  grassroots party organizations are not clear on the details of  enhancing the spiritual civilization in the market economy. They  generally feel that they "cannot use the old way, they do not  know how to use the new way, and they dare not use the reckless  way." The thinking of some comrades remains in the old set  patterns of the planned economy. They are set in their old ways  and are not apt to learn to change to a new situation. In their  work they only go by the book and by their superiors and not by  practice. They indiscriminately copy and indiscriminately go by  the convention, copying mechanically and weakening the  attraction of political ideological work.    The third thing is that they lack the ticket for input. Only  if one has input does he have output. The spiritual civilization  also is this way. The present soaring development of the economy  is incompatible with ideology and culture. Quite a few units do  not have a place for recreational and sports activities, they do  not have a book and newspaper reading area, and a few units have  even squeezed out the "grassroots party school" and the "staff  and workers house," and have relaxed the ideological education  outside the eight hours. There are some units that although they  have an activity area, do not organize activities and it is in  name only.    The fourth thing is that the evaluation lacks standards.  Achievement in developing the spiritual civilization can not be  measured in figures like achievement in economic development.  Development of the spiritual civilization has its abstract  nature. Even though there are testing norms, they start with the  hardware of developing the spiritual civilization. This time we  investigated some grassroots party committees and discovered  that not one had established a relatively complete inspection,  comparative appraisal, and testing system for developing the  spiritual civilization. A leader in a certain department said  that now from top to bottom everyone is shouting, "Grasp with  both hands, be firm with both hands." At what level do leaders  truly manage to do solid work in developing the spiritual  civilization? They just clamor, they do not establish a model. A  certificate of responsibility is signed for economic work, a  certificate of responsibility is signed for environmental  protection, and a certificate of responsibility is signed for  public security, but no department or system has signed a  certificate of responsibility for developing the spiritual  civilization. Testing lacks standards and lacks binding  mechanisms. Responsibility for evaluation does not truly fit  into the scope of the responsibility of the position of anyone  in charge of any level of the party or government.</p>

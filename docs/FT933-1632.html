			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Ex-Swan Hunter staff win Pounds 1.5m UNIONS representing more than 700 workers made redundant at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, since it went into receivership in May have won compensation for their members totalling around Pounds 1.5m. An industrial tribunal judgment, announced yesterday, ruled that Price Waterhouse, the receivers, breached section 188 of the 1992 Trades Union Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act by not holding consultation on the redundancies. The tribunal said the 90 days from May 28, when the first 420 redundancies took effect, was a protected period. Those who lost their jobs from that date were entitled to compensation of up to 90 days' pay. The six shipyard unions involved said the ruling established the principle that workers' rights could not be waived in receivership. The payments, which will come from the state redundancy fund because the company is in receivership, will be up to a maximum of about Pounds 2,600 a head because the ceiling is pegged at Pounds 205 per week. Many payments will be far less because any money received in lieu of notice or earned during the 90-day protected period is deducted from the payment. This law is due to change in November. Mr Tommy Brennan, the Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said it was an important decision. For many of Swans' ex-workers, Pounds 2,000 was 'one heck of a lot of money'. He added: 'This will also highlight the way receivers can escape any financial backlash.' The unions will now seek another 90-day protected period for the 80 Swans workers who are to be made redundant next week.</p>

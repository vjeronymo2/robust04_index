			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Impact 'need not be regressive' EVEN after VAT is imposed on domestic fuel and power at 17 1/2 per cent in 1995-96, to raise Pounds 2.3bn in that year, Mr Lamont's Budget measures need not hurt poor households proportionately more than the better off, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said yesterday. The effect would depend on how far income-related benefits were uprated in response to the measure. The institute said the restriction of the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent and the 1 percentage point increase in the National Insurance contributions of employees tended to limit the regressive effects of VAT on domestic fuel and power. Crucially, the institute assumed that all means-tested benefits, such as income support, family credit and housing benefit, would be increased, over and above normal uprating, by 2.4 per cent. This assumption was based on its calculations that households in receipt of these benefits spent one seventh of their incomes on fuel and power, whose price was set to rise by 17 1/2 per cent. A compensating increase in benefits of this magnitude was, it said, the most reasonable interpretation of the chancellor's pledge that Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, would 'take this (change in VAT) into account when the income-related benefits are uprated next year'. Were the measures the chancellor announced for 1995-96 to be imposed on current incomes under these assumptions about benefits, they would cost the average household Pounds 5.40 a week (Pounds 282 a year), the institute said. For households in the lowest decile (the bottom 10 per cent of income distribution), the overall cost would average only Pounds 0.40 per week (Pounds 21 a year), while for those in the top decile it would be Pounds 14.21 a week (Pounds 741 a year). Similarly, the average unemployed couple with two children would lose only Pounds 0.81 a week (Pounds 42 a year), while the average two-earner couple with children would lose as much as Pounds 10.67 a week (Pounds 556 a year). The proportionate reduction in household disposable income would, it said, be 2.25 per cent overall. But the proportionate reduction increases from 0.54 per cent of the average household income of the bottom 10 per cent to 2.64 per cent for the seventh decile, before falling to 2.27 per cent for the top 10 per cent. This would make these proposals progressive for the bottom 70 per cent of households, but then mildly regressive for the top 30 per cent.</p>

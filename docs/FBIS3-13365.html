Unidentified assailants opened fire from a car, hitting  people going toward the al-Moharraq monastery, 11 kilometres  (seven miles) from al-Qusiyah, which lies 350 kilometres (217  miles) south of Cairo.    The attack took place at around 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT), when  the traditional iftar meal breaks the fast during the Moslem  holy month of Ramadan.    The timing of the attack and the target indicated the  victims  could have been Christians, but there were no details available  about them or the gunmen who fled the scene.    Islamic militants have previously carried out attacks  against  Coptic Christians in the same region.</p>

			<p>Burning   Technology to Chinese Company   <F P=102> 943FE0607E Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 Feb 94 p  1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 943FE0607E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. (president:  Mr. Jiro Hoshino) will provide a garbage incineration technology  to China's leading can manufacturing equipment maker, Qingdao  Commonly-Used Machine Factory (factory head: Mr. Zhou Aimin,  Qingdao City). It is a fluid-bed type which uses sand as a  combustion medium. Recently, an agreement was signed with  Chinese [Gikishinshutsu] Company (President: Mr. Zhang Han Chen,  Beijing City) serving as a contract agent. This is the first  time that Japan is providing China with a garbage incinerator.  This is in response to China's new awareness of environmental  problems, which is gathering momentum, especially in cities.  Taking this opportunity, Mitsui is ready to provide technical  support in other environmental areas, such as treatment of  sewage, plant waste water and flue gases, as well.  <H5>  To Provide Active Support in Sewage/Gas Exhaust Treatment </H5>   The main point of the contract is that Mitsui is to provide  all necessary technologies related to the fluid-bed type garbage  incineration facilities, ranging from design, manufacturing,  construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as know-how.  Also covered by the contract is the implementation of training  programs, including those to be conducted in Japan for Chinese  trainees. Although the matter of constructing facilities is not  specified at present, if it should surface,  engineers/technicians also will be sent from Japan. The term of  the stipulations is 10 years, during which period, China will  have the exclusive right of its enforcement in Mainland China.  The Quigdao Commonly-used Machine Factory to which the  technologies will be provided, is a manufacturer of pressure  vessels and switch exchangers. Since the company has the ability  of supplying the various components of the garbage incineration  facilities on its own, what it will be receiving from Mitsubishi  is technical support in the overall process design. Currently,  Mitsubishi Engineering and Shipbuilding is in the process of  putting together a design package containing technical materials  required in design work and data for analysis. It will take  about 6 months before it can complete the transfer of the  technologies to the Chinese company.    The fluid-bed method garbage incineration is a technology  designed to use sand heated at high temperature as a medium for  burning garbage. It can deal with all types of garbage, ranging  from high-water-content low-calorie garbage to a high calorie  one containing a large quantity of plastics. Moreover, it is  characterized by high combustion efficiency, leaving very little  which remains unburned. Since 1982, Mitsui Engineering and  Shipbuilding has delivered over 20 incineration systems mostly  to self-governing bodies. Last year, the company delivered a  system facility with a daily treatment capacity of 100 tons to  Korea, the first time its product was delivered to overseas.    As for delivery to China, although there is an instance of  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' delivery of a mechanical type city  garbage incineration equipment, insofar as the fluid-bed type  system is concerned, this is the first time it will be done.  China's city garbage is more like what we consider raw garbage,  and for this reason, a high demand exists for the fluid bed-type  offering high combustion efficiency. Moreover, today, when the  protection of environments on a global scale is intensely  pursued, the need for treatment of wastes other than garbage,  namely, sewage, factory waste water, and exhaust gases, is  becoming urgent. Mitsubish wants to provide support to  activities in these areas as well.</p>

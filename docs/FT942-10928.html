			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Motoring: Take your 4x4 off-road Urban pedestrians are not the only people who need protecting from the motor vehicles they have to share their space with. What about walkers - and for that matter, riders - who say their enjoyment of the countryside is being threatened by off-road cars and motor cycles? It is a vexed question. The market in on-off road four-wheel drives continues to grow. Fortunately, the great majority of the 14,670 Land Rover Discoveries, Range Rovers, Shoguns, Land Cruisers, Jeeps and the rest sold in Britain last year will rarely if ever leave the tarmac. They were bought to enhance a life style, not to cross trackless terrain - incidentally, something it is very difficult to do legally in a crowded little island. But enough owners of Britain's estimated 150,000-plus on-off roaders exercise their right to use Byways Open to All Traffic (Boats) to cause problems. People who enjoy using these green roads on their feet or on horseback resent having to share them with growing numbers of 4x4s and trail bikes. Frank Tait, of Alton, Hampshire, for example, is among readers who have written in support of my plea two weeks ago for urban pedestrians to be better protected from cars and lorries that are driven too fast and whose drivers treat footpaths as an extension of the roadway. I suggested kerbs should gradually be made too high for vehicles to mount and that particularly dangerous areas should be railed off. And I thought we should copy the French and raise pedestrian crossings high enough to damage speeding cars. 'No doubt central and local government will say it would cost too much,' he comments. 'Only when one takes quality of life into consideration do the figures start to stack up.' Tait is no push bike-riding environmental fanatic - 'I own two cars and once had a Land Rover' - but he hates the way our green roads are being turned into quagmires by four-wheel drives. 'Legislation has allowed these byways to be used at all times by those who want to test out their vehicles under off-road conditions. So once again pedestrians are harried in an environment where they might expect peace and safety.' Unlike militant ramblers, he does not wish to ban 4x4s and trail bikes but reckons their use of Boats should be limited to a number of days each year decided by the local authority. Users should also pay a fee to help make good the damage they cause. Here there is a precedent: the Forestry Commission does exactly that when it opens its roads for car rallying. To be fair, all the makers of 4x4s give buyers literature asking them to follow a driver's countryside code of conduct produced by Lara, the Land Access and Rights Association. Lara, which fights for the legal right of off-roaders to continue to use Boats, tells them how to behave. 'Travel at a quiet and unobtrusive pace . . . do not use green roads when they risk being damaged beyond a point of natural recovery when the weather improves . . . be courteous to other road users, including walkers, and take great care when passing horses.' And it warns of pitfalls. Examples: Not all green lanes have vehicular rights so always check first. If a route is not obvious, ask locally or check maps held at highway authority offices.' Objectors would have far less to complain about if every off-roader followed Lara's code. But it is plain that many of them do not. At the same time, it has to be said that one huge farm tractor and trailer can do as much damage to a green lane in winter as a whole convoy of light 4x4s. And that some walkers feel just as venomous about riders as they do about off-road drivers, complaining that horses' hooves cut up soft ground far more than human feet. Which I am the first to admit they do. That is why recreational riders such as me are quite properly banned from areas such as Ashdown Forest in Sussex when the conservators consider horses would damage rain-soaked soil unacceptably. So what are the poor 4x4 owners, all dressed up in their knobbly tyres with nowhere to go, to do? They should buy one of the specialist off-road magazines published each month - most newsagents have them - and turn to the small advertisements. Landowners have realised money can be made from allowing 4x4 owners to play with their machines over rough country - for a fee. Some even provide a pressure washer to get rid of the filth afterwards. Off-roading on these private courses will not offend walkers or riders. It is a nice little earner for farmers who are down to their last Jaguar. And 4x4 owners who have not been on a training course will get some idea what their vehicles can do when given the chance to show their mettle.</p>

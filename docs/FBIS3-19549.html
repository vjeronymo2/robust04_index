"Finding a date that makes membership possible by January 1,  1995 while giving all political parties a chance to campaign and  spread information about the EU were the decisive factors in  selecting the date," Bildt said.    "Despite the fact that a June referendum would have been the  most direct and best alternative, I have taken into  consideration the strong request by the Social Democrats and  chosen a later date," he added.    The Social Democratic opposition had campaigned for a  November referendum.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Attorneys for KFI-AM (640) filed an appeal Wednesday contesting U.S. District  Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois' May 4 ruling enjoining the radio station from  using the term "talk radio" in conjunction with its call letters pending a  trial on the matter. KABC-AM (790) filed suit against KFI April 3, alleging  that the slogan "talk radio" had been its trademark for 17 years. KFI has  argued that the term is a generic one that describes a programming format and,  therefore, its use cannot be a trademark infringement. The case will go to  trial later this year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, </F> Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid, 12 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- An agreement on  economic and industrial cooperation was signed by Oleg Davydov,  Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, and Javier  Gomez-Navarro, minister of commerce and tourism of spain, today.    This document envisions specifically that the sides will  facilitate contacts between enterprises, organizations, and  individuals from the two countries. It has been decided to  devote particular attention to dealing with the problems of  small and medium-sized enterprises and to encourage events such  as fairs, specialized exhibitions, and symposiums.    An intergovernmental mixed commission on economic and  industrial cooperation is being set up under the agreement. It  will assemble no less than once a year, in Russia and Spain by  turn.    Commercial and economic relations between the two countries  have been curtailed recently, to a considerable extent because  of Russia's debt to Spain. However, Russia has a positive trade  balance with Spain. The raw materials drive in Russia's exports  is being maintained, most of which is oil. Russian imports from  Spain still consist of vehicles, equipment, and foodstuffs.    The Spanish side notes the interest of the country's  business  community in operating in the Russian market, but also notes  their caution on this. This is connected to the instability of  Russian legislation and the lack of proper guarantees for  foreign investors.    According to EL PAIS newspaper, Spanish businessmen are  hoping first and foremost for the provision of reliable  conditions for capital investment in Russia and a stable customs  policy.    Of 74 registered Russian-Spanish mixed enterprises, less  than  ten are actually operating. However, the experience of those  who are already functioning in Russia demonstrates that there is  great potential for cooperation in the economic sphere.</p>

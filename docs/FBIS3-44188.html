			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 26 SAPA -- The South African  Defence Force [SADF] has denied reports that additional troops  have been deployed in the East Rand townships of Thokoza,  Katlehong and Vosloorus to replace the police's Internal  Stability Division [ISD], reports SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] radio news.    This follows a claim by Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Regional  Organiser Thabani Dlamini on Wednesday that more soldiers had  been deployed in the violence-torn areas in spite of IFP  objections. Mr Dlamini said soldiers had blocked the only  access routes to hostels and people had been prevented from  going to work.    SADF spokesman Maj Christo Visser confirmed that troops in  Katlehong had blockaded some routes on Wednesday to better  control the movement of weapons. This had been done after  discussions with the IFP and the African National Congress  [ANC], he said. The SADF had also agreed to build another road  for hostel dwellers, he said, but was unsure about its progress.    Mr Dlamini claimed the ISD had proved an obstacle to the  seizure of power by ANC self-defence units on the East Rand.    He claimed SADF troops openly sided with the ANC and that  the  decision by the Transitional Executive Council to replace the  ISD with soldiers confirmed the IFP's suspicion that the council  existed merely to rubber-stamp ANC demands.    In reaction, Maj Visser said the SADF was in the townships  to  help police stabilise the area. "The South African army  distances itself from any political party and is there to serve  the community as a whole. In our actions the SADF is  apolitical, neutral and fair."    He said claims of assault and harassment were sometimes made  to discredit the defence force.</p>

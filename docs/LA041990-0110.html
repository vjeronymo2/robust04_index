			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE HELPS CS NORTHRIDGE BOLSTER RANKING IN BASEBALL  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge trails UC Riverside by 2 1/2 games in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball standings, but the Matadors are several  notches above the Highlanders in the NCAA Division II baseball rankings.  </P> <P> Northridge (25-15) is ranked seventh. Riverside (31-10) is No. 12, although the  Highlanders are 2-0 against Northridge.  </P> <P> Although Northridge's record isn't quite as good as Riverside's, the Matadors  have maintained their season-long advantage in the ratings due to the strength  of their schedule.  </P> <P> The rankings are tabulated using a "power rating" points formula. The breakdown  goes as follows:  </P> <P> Five points for a victory over a Division I team.  </P> <P> Four points for a victory over a Division II team.  </P> <P> Three points for a loss to a Division I team.  </P> <P> Two points for a victory over an NAIA team, or a loss to a Division II team.  </P> <P> Northridge's advantage over Riverside stems from the Matadors' having played  five more Division I games than the Highlanders.  </P> <P> Riverside is 6-4 against major college competition, while CSUN is 8-7.  </P> <P> "If you do rankings as opposed to the ratings, there's no way you'd have us  ahead of them," said Bill Kernen, Northridge's coach. "I'm just hoping that's  an indication of where we're going to be. This is one time that you hope the  polls are right."  </P> <P> Back to the future: Which is the CCAA's best baseball team?  </P> <P> Riverside, Kernen says. But perhaps not for long.  </P> <P> "If you look at it from the standpoint of experience and talent, they're  probably the best team in the league," Kernen said. "If you're talking about  talent for the future then maybe we are. . . But that doesn't mean we can't  catch them. Most teams, no matter how good they are, usually have a rough spot  some time in the season. They just haven't had a bad one yet."  </P> <P> Northridge plays the Highlanders in a three-game series next week.  </P> <P> "We're playing our best at a time when you want to be," said Kernen, whose team  has won 13 of its past 16 games. "I don't necessarily think we have to sweep to  win it, but it's hard for me to say. Right now I'm more worried about Chapman."  </P> <P> Northridge and Chapman play a three-game set starting today. The Panthers are  tied with the Matadors for second place in the CCAA.  </P> <P> Thinking positive: His team had just stranded 13 runners and his pitching staff  had just given up five home runs and walked 13 batters, but Kernen was far from  downcast after the Matadors' 14-13, 10-inning loss to UC Santa Barbara on  Tuesday. CSUN had 20 hits, including five home runs.  </P> <P> "This is the best offensive performance we've had here in two years," Kernen  said. "Offensively, we just buried them, but you're going to pay for it when  you walk 13 batters. . . . You don't want to focus on the negative in a game  like this.  </P> <P> "Sure, it's a tough loss, but I couldn't be happier with the way we hit."  </P> <P> Northridge's homers included solo shots by Greg Shockey, Mike Sims and Craig  Clayton in the third inning.  </P> <P> The Matador single-game home run record is seven, set against United States  International University (1984) and The Master's College (1987).  </P> <P> Home run derby: Glendale's Art Chute has set a new school season record with 10  home runs and is one short of the Glendale career record of 17.  </P> <P> He is the second Valley-area player to break his junior college's home run  record this spring. Mike Suarez broke the Moorpark season mark with seven home  runs.  </P> <P> However, the most prolific power hitter in the Valley area, J. R. Trujillo of  Canyons, remains considerably short his school's home run record. Trujillo has  hit 11 and is six shy of Pete Kuld's record total of 17, set in 1986.  </P> <P> Kirby Lee and staff writers Mike Hiserman and John Ortega contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

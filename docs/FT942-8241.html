			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein hails 'step for peace' Hopes of an end to the five-month impasse blocking progress towards peace in Northern Ireland were lifted last night when a senior Sinn Fein figure commented positively on London's response to questions about last December's joint declaration. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the ruling executive of the IRA's political wing, said the government's decision to respond to republican calls for clarification of the UK-Irish document represented 'a small step in the slowly evolving peace process'. Sinn Fein was determined to play a full and positive role in an effective peace process, which must 'embrace everyone and exclude no one'. Mr McGuinness's remarks came less than 24 hours after London stepped up pressure on the IRA to halt its 25-year campaign of violence by publishing a detailed commentary on Sinn Fein's 20 questions, answering one of them directly. The painstaking nature of the government's reply was welcomed by unionists and nationalists alike. Mr McGuinness hinted that Sinn Fein was unlikely to decide how to respond to the government's comments until after next month's European elections, saying its policy of undertaking broad consultations at all levels of its membership would cause a delay. Meanwhile, pressure on unionist paramilitaries to end their violence has intensified. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday that the Downing Street declaration had made clear there was no distinction between republican or loyalist paramilitary oganisations engaging in exploratory talks once the violence ended. Mr Ruairi Quinn, a senior Irish cabinet minister, said Sinn Fein's initial comments on the British response were encouraging. There were 'clearly tensions within the Sinn Fein-IRA movement'. One could only hope they would be resolved 'in the interests of peace'.</p>

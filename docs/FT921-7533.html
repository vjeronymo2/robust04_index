			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont attacks 'socialist' savings proposal - National Insurance contributions THE CONSERVATIVES yesterday hit out at Labour proposals for a 9 per cent 'tax' on unearned income of more than Pounds 3,000 a year, in an assault featuring a rare excursion from pre-Budget purdah by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Labour plans to extend National Insurance contributions to income from savings of more than Pounds 30,000 held by those below retirement age. Mr Lamont, flanked by a picture of a blood-filled mosquito that will star in a Tory poster campaign, inveighed against what he said was an 'envy tax on savings'. Mr Lamont, attempting to tap a vein which has proved rewarding for the government in recent campaigning, said: 'When it comes to tax, the Labour party is still socialist. It has to be - that is the price of Labour's spending plans.' He sought to highlight the contradiction between Labour's commitment to training and investment as an economic cure-all and its simultaneous espousal of a policy 'which will slash investment'. The 'worst effect' of the tax would be on the overall level of savings, said Mr Lamont. 'Fewer people will save with a top rate of income tax of 59 per cent on earnings and on savings.' Mr Lamont said the proposed savings charge could hit 1.1m taxpayers and would undermine the promise made by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that nobody earning less than Pounds 21,000 a year would pay a penny more in tax or national insurance. Some 750,000 of those affected would be basic rate tax payers, he said. 'Many people who are not at retirement age but depend on their income from savings would indeed be hit hard,' he said. Mr Lamont was supported by Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, who portrayed the tax as a last-ditch stand against a Tory-inspired revolution in inheritance. The tax would take an average of Pounds 5.40 a week from 750,000 basic-rate taxpayers and would cost a further 360,000 higher-rate taxpayers an average of Pounds 34 a week, he said.</p>

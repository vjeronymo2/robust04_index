			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal industrial unit ahead Anglovaal Industries, the industrial arm of Anglovaal, the South African mining house, increased attributable profit for the year to June by 18 per cent to R407.1m (Dollars 110.6m) from R343.7m for the previous year. Pre-tax profits rose 8 per cent to R763.8m from R704.4m, but an 8 per cent decrease in tax paid to R220.3m from R238.8m helped to lift bottom-line earnings. This was in spite of the inclusion of a one-off transitional levy of 5 per cent to help pay for April's elections. Turnover rose 16 per cent to R9.67bn from R8.32bn, of which 5 per cent was the result of acquisitions. The dividend was increased to 230 cents from 195 cents. However, due to reduced cash resources and additional borrowings, net financing costs on the year were R14.4m, a sharp reversal from the previous year's R18m in net interest income. Mr Jan Robbertze, managing director, said trading had been negatively affected by the political uncertainty in the run-up to the election but conditions had improved significantly in May and June. Mr Robbertze said certain of the group's holdings, which include Consol, plastics manufacturer; Irvin and Johnson, food processor and Grinaker, construction and electronics group, still had substantial idle capacity and suffered from pressure on margins.</p>

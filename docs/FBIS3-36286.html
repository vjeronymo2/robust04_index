This is  how Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Zlenko described  the present situation in the region of the Bosnian conflict  after a visit to the Ukrainian battalion within the UN  peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. Our state must decide what  else it may do to help heal this bleeding wound in Europe.    UN representatives have repeatedly commended Ukraine's  contribution to the peacekeeping process. The fact that the UN  Security Council turned to our state with a request to add  another 800 personnel to the battalion is proof of the prestige  gained by the Ukrainian servicemen. At the same time, despite  the considerable contingent of soldiers, Kiev does not have  observers there. The number of officers is also small. This  restricts any more extensive participation of Ukrainian  representatives in untying the Balkan knot. The military  contingent's main tasks in the region of conflict amount to  accompanying humanitarian aid convoys to the civilian  population, repairing electricity and water-supply networks, and  holding, on special orders, operations to disarm the warring  sides and demilitarizing the areas. During a meeting with  Zlenko, commander of the joint troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina M.  Rose praised the activities of the Ukrainian servicemen.  (Incidentally, in view of the severe shortage of food in the  city, our soldiers share their food rations with Sarajevo  children, and the battalion has even adopted several orphan  children.) During the talks in Sarajevo, the head of the  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stressed that a mutually acceptable  variant for resolving problems in the region is only possible if  all the possibilities and interests of the sides are taken into  account.    As well as Sarajevo, Zlenko also visited Croatia and  Slovenia. For a number of reasons, the visit there had been  delayed for a long time. That is why members of the Ukrainian  delegation tried somehow to stress their interest in the  development of relations with Zagreb and Ljubljana and held  extensive consultations to find realistic ways to intensify ties  with those countries, particularly in the economic sphere. A  legal foundation was also laid in Zagreb for expanding contacts:  Agreements on cooperation between the foreign ministries of the  two countries and on consular ties were signed. A document on  cooperation between the foreign ministries was also signed in  the Slovenian capital. At the summing-up news conference in  Zagreb, Croatian Foreign Minister M. Granic stated that a  bilateral trade agreement, which will definitely be signed  during his visit to Kiev, will promote economic ties. In his  opinion, political relations between Ukraine and Croatia are  much better developed than economic ties. It is, however, clear  that every country must now pay much attention to its own  domestic problems. An agreement on friendship and cooperation,  which has been prepared, will be yet another step toward broad  cooperation between Kiev and Zagreb. In Granic's opinion,  Ukraine might have a positive influence on resolving the Balkan  crisis and, in this context, on the position of the Serbs. He  pointed out that the declaration on the settlement of the  relations between Croats and Serbs is the first step toward  normalization, but that this process depends on Serbia. The  main problem is the restoration of normal life in reintegrated  territories. Zlenko, in turn, stated that, on many issues, the  positions of Ukraine and Croatia are very close or fully  coincide. The Croatian position became clearer after the  negotiations in Zagreb.    Observers reacted with surprise to Kiev's activity in the  Balkan region, but they pointed out that its rapprochement with  Zagreb and Ljubljana is understandable: There is a common  desire to cooperate, and they are all, while respecting the  aspirations of others, pursuing their own interests. Therefore,  Ukraine will certainly respond positively to the Croatian side's  request to help in settling the Balkan crisis and in normalizing  relations between the Croats and the Serbs, but it will not  diverge from its principles of balanced deportment. In its  contacts with Slovenia, Kiev should have long passed from words  to specific deeds, since that country presents a great interest  for us, first and foremost, in the economic sphere. Ljubljana  is also striving to establish close cooperation with Kiev. In  particular, at the proposal of Slovenian Minister of Foreign  Affairs L. Peterle, entrepreneurs from the two countries will  hold a business conference in Ljubljana. In addition to that,  Ukraine hopes that its Balkan partners with help in putting into  effect its plans for joining the Central European Initiative.    However, Kiev, while trying hard to stress its desire to  intensify relations with Croatia and Slovenia, is unable to open  its embassies in those states. Perhaps, because of this  situation, the relations between our countries have been  deadlocked. I would like to hope that the earthquake that  rocked Zagreb during the first day of Zlenko's official visit  will shake off the dust from these relations.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Kuwait orders missiles Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace company, has received a Pounds 50m order for air defence missiles from Kuwait. The announcement of the order came at the end of a visit to the emirate by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Shorts said the contract would not affect plans to cut 240 jobs at its plant in Belfast. The order - for the Starburst shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile - was said to be a surprise to the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Export Services Organisation and Shorts. Starburst - the immediate successor to the Javelin system, which Shorts has sold to more than 10 countries - has been developed to destroy high-performance low-flying aircraft as well as helicopters.</p>

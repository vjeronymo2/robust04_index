			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PUCKETT IS FIRST TO SCORE $3-MILLION SALARY  </P> <P> Kirby Puckett became the first baseball player to break the $3-million average  annual salary barrier, agreeing today to a three-year contract for $9 million  with the Minnesota Twins.  </P> <P> Andy MacPhail, the Twins general manager, and Ron Shapiro, Puckett's agent,  reached an outline of the deal Tuesday night and were to sign a memorandum of  agreement today.  </P> <P> "With the wild escalation in player salaries we've seen the last 12 months, and  recognizing the importance of Kirby Puckett to the team, we felt it was  important we got him signed," MacPhail said.  </P> <P> Puckett gets a $1.5 million signing bonus, of which $500,000 will be paid  immediately, $500,000 on Dec. 15, 1990, and $500,000 on Dec. 15, 1991. He gets  a $2.2 million salary in 1990, $2.5 million in 1991 and $2.8 million in 1992.  </P> <P> For purposes of determining salaries, signing bonuses are prorated over the  length of a contract. Puckett will be at $3 million in 1991, the same year Orel  Hershiser of the Dodgers and Frank Viola of the Mets are scheduled to crack the  $3 million single-year barrier (both will be at $3,166,667). Puckett's $3.3  million in 1992 is the highest salary ever agreed upon.  </P> <P> In addition, Puckett would get a $200,000 bonus for winning a Gold Glove,  $200,000 for winning American League MVP and $100,000 for finishing second or  third.  </P> <P> The deal continued the rapid escalation of salaries that has taken place in the  past two weeks. Outfielder Kevin Bass agreed to a three-year, $5.25-million  deal with San Francisco, pitcher Pascual Perez agreed to a three-year,  $5.7-million contract with the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals'  Bret Saberhagen got a three-year, $8.9-million extension from the Kansas City  Royals.  </P> <P> Puckett, a 28-year-old center fielder who has been on the AL All-Star team for  four consecutive seasons, would have been eligible for free agency after the  1990 season.  </P> <P> He hit .339 in 1989 with nine home runs and 85 RBIs, becoming the first  right-handed hitter to win a full-season American League batting title since  Alex Johnson of California in 1970.  </P> <P> He made $2.05 million in 1989, including $50,000 in bonuses.  </P> <P> With the way the market is moving, Puckett may have been able to get a more  lucrative deal if he had waited until after free agent pitchers Mark Langston  and Mark Davis had signed.  </P> <P> "He and we set a goal," Shapiro said. "He's not the kind of person who looks  over his shoulder at what the next guy will make."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, May 8 (AFP) -- Troops  loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Sunday captured the  south's main military airport, 50 kilometres from the port city  of Aden, Western diplomatic sources said.    The sources in the region said Al-'Anad was the only  military  airport around the southern stronghold of Aden, although the  south has a second base in the Hadhramaut, 700 kilometres (420  miles) to the east.    The northern forces have the port city trapped in a "pincer  movement," one diplomat said.</p>

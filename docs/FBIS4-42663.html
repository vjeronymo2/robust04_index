			<p>BFN     [Text] Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. President's special envoy  on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  came to Athens today with no new ideas. The U.S. official had a  meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias this evening  that lasted for one and a half hours. Nimetz will go to Skopje  tomorrow.    [Begin Foivos Karzis recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias  and U.S. Presidential Envoy Nimetz had a meeting of a rather  exploratory nature this evening, in view of the new round of  contacts in New York. Nimetz confirmed that he was not bringing  any new ideas. On the other hand, Papoulias expressed the view  that the meeting between Nimetz and [FYROM President] Kiro  Gligorov tomorrow in Skopje will be important. The possibility  that Nimetz will return to Athens after his contacts with the  Skopjean leadership remains open. In that case, Papoulias said,  we will have a clearer picture of the situation.    Papoulias expressed the hope that the meetings he and [FYROM  Foreign Minister] Stevo Crvenkovski will have with Cyrus Vance  and Nimetz in New York between 14 and 17 June will be the final  round of deliberations on the Skopje issue. In any case, it is  indicative that Nimetz's agenda this time was clearly more  limited, as he did not meet with Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou or Yeoryios Papandreou, deputy foreign minister in  charge of Greek-American relations. This morning, Papoulias  briefed President Konstandinos Karamanlis on the developments in  the national issues and described the scenarios of a triple name  for Skopje as unrealistic.

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: US interest rate fears drive Footsie below 3,100 - Market report The post US-election euphoria in international markets evaporated yesterday, driving down bond and equity markets and leaving the London market in disarray at the close of business. The FT-SE 100 index ended the session a net 27.6 lower, only marginally above the day's low, as dealers closed their books on the US elections and began to prepare for next Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington which will decide the course of US interest rates. The FOMC meeting, seen by many market strategists as probably defining trends in international markets for the rest of the year, is expected to see the Federal Reserve shift short-term US interest rates by at least 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent. A rise on Tuesday would be the sixth so far this year. There was no help for equity markets from international bond markets which drifted back in thin trading, and lacking impetus from New York where the bond market was closed for Veterans Day. Equities trading across Europe was curtailed by the closure of French and Belgian markets for Armistice Day. There was little genuine investment activity in London yesterday, with marketmakers and brokers running hard to try and clinch what little activity was in the pipeline. Turnover came out at a dismal 494.2m shares, the lowest since Monday, with trading in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for well over half the day's turnover. Customer business in the market on Thursday was reported at a disappointing Pounds 1.14bn. Dealers lowered their opening prices yesterday, responding to a disappointing performance on Wall Street overnight and thereafter took avoiding action in the face of any further selling pressure as markets became increasingly nervous about trends on Wall Street. There was precious little support for equities all day and the 100 index dropped to a session low of 3,072.0 before closing only four points above that level. Second liners were never really under pressure but were marked easier and the FT-SE Mid 250 index settled 6.4 off at 3,536.5, only 1.9 easier on the week. The 100 index was 21.7 down on the five-day period. Their unease was justified as the Dow Jones opened under pressure and continued to slip away as the session wore on. The Dow Jones Average was 25 points off an hour after London closed for the week. A senior dealer at one of the UK securities houses said the big institutions were clearly worried about Wall Street ahead of the FOMC meeting: 'The selling may have been done before the result of the meeting but there is a real worry about the possibility of a steep fall on Monday.' 'If there is any sort of panic we could see the Footsie back at 3,000 in no time at all: I feel it's wrong to be comfortable about the market,' he added. Another marketmaker took a more positive view of the market: 'We fell back on no business at all; there's no panic and I feel we will be better at the end on next week.' However, a strategist at one of the City's leading broking houses said the market had overreacted on the downside to the Wall Street worries. 'Only the poodles were trading today. I wouldn't take too much notice of what went on,' he said. He said he expected a 50 basis points rise in the Fed Funds rate but added that '75 basis points is really what is needed'. Another top commentator said: 'What the market needs is 50 points now and an indication of a further rise if US economic growth shows no signs of slowing.' Redland made strong progress and posted the best gain in the FT-SE 100 in the wake of a buy recommendation from one of the City's leading agency brokers. Bank of Scotland improved following switching into the shares from Abbey National.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Curtain up on a guerrilla war - Conference Notebook FORGET Maastricht. It is the economy that counts. For those with their eyes on Brighton, that will require a certain amount of self-discipline. Lord Tebbit offered a vivid reminder this week that the Tory party has still to catch up with Britain's distinctly modest place in the world. Lady Thatcher, who will join Mr John Major in a cruelly synthetic show of solidarity on the Brighton platform this morning, will not be silenced. Her unbridled assault on the exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht in today's issue of The European is nothing less than a direct attack on the leadership of her successor. It took more than two decades for the Conservatives to come grudgingly to terms with the end of empire. It is taking them longer still to realise that it is Britain rather than Europe which is left isolated when fog descends upon the Channel. So the emotional outpouring on the conference floor triggered by a cynically brilliant speech from Essex Man (to be followed we can be sure by a similar reception for Grantham Woman) foreshadows months of guerrilla warfare at Westminster. There will be a debate in principle on the legislation during the second week after MPs return to the Commons on October 19. But senior ministers have yet to decide whether Mr John Major can risk bringing the committee stage forward before the Edinburgh summit. Once detailed examination of the bill starts it will have to be taken 'on the run', with all other legislative business pushed to one side for three or four weeks. But during Britain's EC presidency, up to 10 ministers will be abroad on any one day. The prime minister has been told that his parliamentary business managers can guarantee majorities against the wrecking tactics of the Tory Euro-sceptics only if those ministers drop their presidency duties to stay at Westminster. So the committee stage might yet be deferred until the new year, leaving the divisions to fester throughout the autumn. Royal Assent may in the end rely on Labour abstentions. But the important point is that no one - Lord Tebbit no more than Mr Douglas Hurd - doubts that the government has the capacity to ratify Maastricht. At the end of the day Conservative heads will rule Tory hearts. The economy offers no such certainty. Those expecting Mr Norman Lamont to conjure from a magic box a blueprint for a totally new economic policy will be disappointed. Life outside the ERM is not that simple. The chancellor will set out the parameters of a strategy, which will be familiar to anyone who watched the then Mr Nigel Lawson struggle to frame his policy during the mid 1980s. The starting point is that the objective of consistently low inflation has not changed. The delivery mechanism will be tight control of public spending  -if it can, the Treasury will undershoot its Pounds 244.5bn target for next year - and a mix of monetary indicators to determine interest rates. The value of the pound will, as Mr Lawson used to say, be 'taken into account'. Sticking to the public spending targets, which are much tougher in the two succeeding years than in 1993-94, should allow modest reductions in income tax in the approach to the next election. There will be a confirmation that house prices are to join MO and M3 in the Treasury's list of monetary indicators. But the chancellor will not risk sending his audience to sleep with a detailed tour around the motorways of the money supply. Nigel Lawson tried that once in the early 1980s. It left his audience glued to their seats. Mr Lamont's first priority is to demonstrate that he still deserves to retain the keys to No 11 Downing Street - first to his audience in Brighton and through their acclaim to the financial markets. But for many colleagues his speech - and the more detailed exposition which will follow at the House of Commons next week - will be no more than a staging post. They want sterling back in the ERM - not this month or next but within perhaps a year. One of the most striking things this week has been how the conference has reinforced the natural authority of the troika of enthusiastic Europeans at the top of the cabinet. Mr Hurd saw off the Euro-sceptics in a brilliant speech. Mr Michael Heseltine did likewise in typically more flamboyant style. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the heir apparent if Mr Major were to suffer a nasty traffic accident, has added a layer of prime ministerial gravitas to his robust political style. These ministers have not been singing in their baths. Instead they have given every sign that they are concerned that the pound may go into free fall. They see no reason to fight the ERM battle now. They acknowledge the difficulties posed by Maastricht. They also see the economic case for caution about the timing of re-entry. Next spring or summer seems a more realistic bet. So for the moment Messrs Hurd Heseltine and Clarke echo Mr Lamont's formula that sterling will float for the 'foreseeable future'. But the ghost of the ERM has not been banished from the cabinet table.</p>

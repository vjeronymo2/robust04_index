			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Forowicz: "Poland-NATO; Breaking the </F> Barriers"]    [Text] In the cooperation we have had so far between the  Central European states and NATO, we have already reached the  limits of efficiency, and we need more dynamic forms, said one  of the speakers at a roundtable session in the Sejm.    Participating in the conference is a group of more than 10  representatives of the North Atlantic Assembly, a  political-advisory body of NATO, with Chairman Loice Bouverde,  Secretary General Peter Corterier, Jose Pereira, head of the  subcommittee on Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and  functionaries of the NATO apparatus. The numerous high-ranking  officials include representatives of Belarus, Bulgaria, the  Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Russian  Federation, and Romania. Poland is represented by several Sejm  deputies and senators, representatives of the Ministry of  National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, teh Academy  of National Defense, and others.    Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy underscored the expectations of  Poland and, as it seems, of all interested states in our region,  to enhance the guarantees of international security through  cooperation with NATO. He also recalled the thesis that there  is the possibility of various advancement in the construction of  links, with the use of the platforms on which there are no  longer any differences between us. "We appreciate the  significance of the Partnership for Peace program. We will  implement it. However, it does exhaust our political  aspirations."    The roundtable discussion consists of three sessions. The  first one presents "NATO's Perception of Future Relations With  Central Europe," the second, "Perception of Central European  States' Future Relations With NATO," and the third, "Prospects  for Neutral and Nonaligned States." Hans Jochem Peters, head of  the liaison section in the Political Affairs Department in NATO,  pointed, among other things, to the importance that is being  attached to the Partnership for Peace program. Vernon Penner,  political adviser to the commander in chief of allied forces in  Europe, posed the question of whether Poland and other states  applying for membership in NATO are ready to share the burden of  NATO's duties in resolving international problems. Later on, he  added that "there are not many states such as Poland that  thoroughly understand the entire issue."    Commander Ian Clapham, staff officer in the office of  special  adviser to the commander in chief of the organization in Europe,  responsible for cooperation, characterized the state of contacts  that have already been made. In 1993, the Central and East  European states took part in 220 joint military activities with  NATO. In 1994, there will be approximately 350 such  initiatives. Among other activities, this October there are  scheduled joint Polish-Czech-British-Dutch exercises of  battalions in the Netherlands, the task of which will be to test  the feasibility of cooperation in peacekeeping operations.    Cdr. Clapham reviewed the contacts to date on the so-called  second level (the first level are talks and decisions among  high-ranking politicians)--that is, experts, commanders in  charge of maneuvers, participants in seminars and courses. He  said that Slovakia had been given advice on how to organize  rapid deployment forces; Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria were  shown computer support of military exercises; various problems  of the fleets of Albania and Bulgaria were jointly analyzed. He  said that "the most substantive example of joint action" were  the early-warning flights over Hungary in connection with the  Balkan conflict.    The speakers characterized the main barriers to further  cooperation. "In contacts with some partners, we have a trust  gap," it was generally agreed. In the case of members of CIS, a  certain problem would be the different plans to transform  military structures--some of them are being changed quite  significantly, others have preserved a typically Soviet  structure. Another problem is the knowledge of Western  languages; in Poland, only 200 officers speak such languages,  whereas there should be at least several times as many.  However, there are also states in the East in which this can be  said of only a few dozen officers. Important problems are also  distances--for example, between Kazakhstan and NATO  Headquarters, as well as the poor communications network.    However, generally speaking, "the possibilities for passive  cooperation are petering out. We have reached the limits of  efficiency in this form of cooperation. We must enhance the  clarity, raise the level of trust, and grant greater assistance  to your states in the establishment of Armed Forces that are an  element of democracy," said I. Clapman.</p>

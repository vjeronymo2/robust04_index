			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Karl-Heinz Baum report: "Commitment to Friendship"] </F>   [Text] Berlin, 20 Mar -- Following the latest irritations  over critical statements by Francois Scheer, the French  ambassador in Bonn, on German European Police, Paris and Bonn  are intensively trying to limit the damage. On Saturday [19  March] in Berlin FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], stressed the "friendly  special relationship" between Germany and France. French  President Francois Mitterrand told the AGENCE FRANCE PRESS (AFP)  news agency: "We have cooperated with the chancellor in the  best spirit and we shall continue to do so in the interest of  both our countries and Europe."    In Berlin Kinkel said that this "extremely important"  special  relationship is and remains "Europe's central axis." The past  has proven that in Europe much is possible if Germany and France  cooperate, but only little if this relationship is disturbed.    "France can rely absolutely on Germany," Kinkel stressed.  Solo actions are pointless, the Germans have to remember that.  Germany does not want any prerogatives. Only together can the  tasks that Europe is facing in the future be mastered. Kinkel  noted that he was saying this in Berlin because in this city  France defended the freedom of Germany and of the world for  years. The FRG foreign minister announced a "long-planned visit  to France."    At the land party congress of the Thuringian FDP, Kinkel  said  concerning the alleged statements by French Ambassador Francois  Scheer about Kinkel's role in the negotiations for membership in  the European Union with Scandinavian countries and Austria: If  an ambassador says incorrect things, it must be possible to  refute this quite clearly. He has advocated expansion to the  north just as expansion to the south.    Kinkel also commented on the Bundeswehr. It must get out of  the parties' quarrel and needs quiet for planning, financing,  and organization. The FDP wants to prepare the Bundeswehr for  peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks. This costs money. "This  money must be available!"</p>

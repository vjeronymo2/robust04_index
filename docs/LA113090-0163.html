			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN A WHIFF TO PICK UP A SCENT;  </P> <P> FRAGRANCE: WEAR A SPRITZ OF PERFUME FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE DECIDING IF IT'S  RIGHT FOR YOU, ALFRED SUNG SAYS.  </P> <P> Alfred Sung, the Canadian fashion designer-turned-perfume mogul, advises women  to slow down and smell the flowers before buying their next bottle of  fragrance.  </P> <P> "Take a tester and wear the fragrance for a day or two," Sung suggests. "If the  scent lasts all day and still smells good when you go to bed, then go back and  buy it."  </P> <P> Also, hold the bottle to see if it's comfortable. "Studies have shown that a  woman won't use a fragrance if she doesn't like the way a bottle feels in her  hand," says Sung, who recently introduced his second fragrance, Encore, at  Bullock's Beverly Center. "Fragrance has traditionally been an impulse buy --  but you end up with a dresser full of scents you don't wear," he adds.  </P> <P> While Sung was in the store, a man walked up to the Encore counter and bought  70 bottles of the $40 eau de parfum, after taking little more than a whiff.  "There's no explaining it," Sung says with a shrug.  </P> <P> The heady tangerine and tuberose scent did $6,000 in sales the first day, even  before the 70-bottle buyer came in, a Bullock's executive said.  </P> <P> Encore is the follow-up to the 1986 scent Sung. Last year, before Christmas,  the light blend of jasmine and gardenia ranked among the top five sellers in  its price category.  </P> <P> "Buying a fragrance should be like buying a piece of clothing -- it has to suit  your personality," says the designer, whose Alfred Sung and Club Monaco  clothing boutiques are scattered liberally throughout North America. The  formula, he says, is utterly logical. "If you're quiet, don't buy a fragrance  that's overpowering. You won't wear it. If you're the kind of person who wants  to be noticed, get a strong scent and make a statement. But don't let the  spritzer girls influence you in the stores. Test. Always test."

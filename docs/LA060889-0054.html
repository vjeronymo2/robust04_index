			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL HEARS COMPLAINTS ABOUT PARAGON CABLE  </P> <P> Minutes before an El Segundo City Council meeting this week, City Clerk Ronald  L. Hart looked out at the crowd and asked: "So what brings people out?" The  resounding chorus: Paragon Cable, the company that is the sole provider of  cable television in the city.  </P> <P> Six residents, an apartment owner and three City Council members lashed out  during a public hearing Tuesday night at Paragon Cable Communications for a  recent rate increase, poor service and the growing complexity of its equipment.  </P> <P> Resident Shirley Jensen said: "It's getting where I'm beginning to feel too  stupid to turn on my own TV."  </P> <P> Several of those who spoke said their problems with Paragon began in August,  1988, when the company began overhauling the cable system to double the number  of channels to 60.  </P> <P> At the time, Paragon had just taken control of the city's cable franchise  agreement from Group W, whose parent company, Westinghouse Electric Co., was  bought out by a consortium that included Paragon's parent company, American  Television and Communications Corp.  </P> <P> Many residents complained of hidden costs and of the complexity of the new  system installed by Paragon. Many El Segundo residents must now rent a remote  control device from Paragon, for $4 a month for the first year, to operate a  small box, which costs $25 to install, that controls the cable hookup. Many  must also buy an adapter switch, for roughly $10, so they can tape programs on  their videocassette recorders while watching another channel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Looks Like a Bomb'  </P> <P> "Before, I just had one remote control that worked on everything," Jensen said.  "Now my TV has so many controls and wires it looks like a bomb."  </P> <P> Many also complained to the City Council about a $4 rate increase, the second  increase in a year, which brings the basic rate for cable service to $16.95 per  month.  </P> <P> Paragon General Manager Mark Mangiola told the City Council that the company is  doing a "good job."  </P> <P> "We've spent $1 million in upgrading the picture quality of all channels, plus  we've increased the number of channels. I think we've been good corporate  citizens," he said. Two residents and City Councilman Alan West said they were  pleased with the improved reception.  </P> <P> But Wendy White, the city's supervisor of community cable channels, said the  city has received complaints from 300 residents about Paragon since last year.  </P> <P> "Many of the complaints go something like: 'How could the city let this company  run our cable system,' and I don't have the answer," White said.  </P> <P> Councilman Scot Dannen suggested the city look into a consumer protection  ordinance that would demand better service from the cable company. "Right now,  Paragon is doing a sloppy job," he said. "Service is poor, installation  ludicrous. And, if I get a chance, we will seriously discuss if (Paragon) stays  in El Segundo."  </P> <P> No action was taken.  </P> <P> The public hearing was called partly in response to complaints about cable  service and as part of El Segundo's negotiations with Paragon over renewing the  franchise agreement, which expires in February, 1991.  </P></p>

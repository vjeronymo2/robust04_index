			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink rises 49% Wolstenholme Rink, the printing industry supplier, reported pre-tax profits for 1992 up 49 per cent, from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 3.46m. Turnover slipped from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds 49.9m. The Lancashire-based company, which also makes metal powders, said business remained difficult in the UK but widespread export sales and the inclusion of PCO, acquired at the end of 1991, had helped. Earnings per share increased 43 per cent to 29.3p (20.5p). The proposed final dividend is 10.5p for a total of 17p (16.3p). Gearing was reduced from 50 per cent to 29 per cent at the year-end. The share price gained 10p to close at 453p.</p>

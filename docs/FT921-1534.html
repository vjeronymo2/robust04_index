			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / German unions to face challenge on pay talks GERMAN INDUSTRY set the scene for future conflict with the trade union movement yesterday by challenging the basis on which wage negotiations are conducted. Criticism of pay policy by the country's leading employers' association came as Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that the national economy was losing momentum and appealed for moderation in wage demands. At the same time the public sector union announced that pay talks for the 2.3m public sector workers had failed, setting the stage for arbitration proceedings. If these prove unsuccessful, the sector could face its first serious strike since 1974. Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the country's leading employers' association, the BDA, said a fundamental change in pay policy was needed. He was protesting against the accelerating tendency towards national inflation-plus awards which ignored regional and sectoral trends. 'Banks feel they can afford a 5 per cent increase this year,' he said. But there was no way the engineering industry could match this. Economic prospects had been 'seriously endangered' by misguided pay policies. He said overall labour costs had to be reduced in the interests of stability, competitiveness and recovery in the former GDR. The only way was through a fundamental change in pay policy. 'We employers are not just talking about change, we have decided to introduce it. A course correction is inevitable and anyone who postpones it will suffer,' Mr Murmann added. Talks would start with government and unions as soon as the current pay round was finished. The employers' association insisted that productivity had to be the sole criterion governing wage increases this year. The DGB union confederation promptly rejected Mr Murmann's demands. It said it had seen no evidence of pressure for change among employers in around 20 recent pay settlements of up to 7 per cent in small industries. Mr Kohl said that, with economic growth of 1.5 per cent expected in the west this year, the room for manoeuvre over pay had shrunk. Employers and unions had to bring wages closer into line with productivity. While efficiency in the east was only 29 per cent of western levels, he said, average pay was 44 per cent of that in the former federal republic. Mr Kohl's intervention underscored the deepening gloom over the prospects for the east, which depend on massive transfers of public money and investment from the private sector. Foreign investment so far accounts for only about 10 per cent of the total spent there since unification. The declarations from the BDA, which had withdrawn from the public debate over pay as sectoral negotiations for banking, public service and engineering workers got under way in the past few weeks, highlight an underlying debate and growing anxiety within German industry. Medium-sized companies, which account for two-thirds of the national workforce, are increasingly resentful of over-generous settlements on pay, holidays and working hours agreed between unions and employers' groups dominated by large, rich companies such as Daimler-Benz.</p>

Shirokaya, Institute of Hydrobiology, Academy of Sciences of  Ukraine; UDC [577.34:574.522](282.2)]    [Abstract] Radioactive contamination of the river  ecosystems of Europe is a growing problem that is a direct  result of the growing nuclear power industry. The Volga basin  has two nuclear power plants. The Dunay basin, which had 10 in  1978, is expected to have 29 by the year 2000. The Dnepr basin  has six such plants. The work reported here was performed in  1988 and involved studies of the two radionuclides that are the  most ecologically significant -- [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]  Cs -- in the hydrobionts of the Volga, Dunay, and  Dnepr. The researchers found the following in terms of [.sup]90[/]  Sr levels in the Volga: algae  (Cladophora), 0.4-9.7 Bq/kg; higher water-plants,  0.4- 32.6 Bq/kr; mollusks, 2.3-28.1 Bq/kr; fish, 0.2-2.2 Bq/kg.  Those figures for the Dunay were 3.9-30.1 (green filament  algae), 0.2- 5.7, 3.5-64.0, and 1.4-2.3. For the Dnepr, they  were 92.1-525.4 (green filament algae), 25.5-1165.5, 6.5-4144.0,  and 5.9-120.6. Green filament algae had [.sup]137[/]Cs levels  that were 9.3- 24.5 Bq/kg in the Volga, 8.9-69.6 in the Dunay,  and 259.4-2479.0 in the Dnepr. Higher water-plants showed the  following levels: 0.6- 58.5 Bq/kg (Volga), 2.6-93.6 (Dunay), and  10.1-5920.0 (Dnepr). Volga mollusks had levels of 0.9-35.6  Bq/kg, as opposed to 3.3-11.8 in the Dunay and 9.6-148.0 in the  Dnepr. Fish had levels of 0.8-5.1 Bq/kg in the Volga, 10.7-17.0  in the Dunay, and 15.5-44400.0 in the Dnepr. References 11: 7  Russian, 4 Western.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SIDE OUT BURGER, CALIFORNIA STYLE  </P> <P> "What do you think?" my waitress proudly asked.  </P> <P> "Well, sure, it's a great hamburger," I said.  </P> <P> "No," she said, looking mystified, "what do you think about the place?"  </P> <P> Let's keep things in perspective. Yes, Randy and Sinjin's Side Out does serve  an excellent burger, half a pound in weight and about half a foot wide. The  lettuce may be a tiny bit tired and the pickle a little unexpected (a sour dill  sliced lengthwise), but this is a good beefy handful anyway, which you just  have to eat kind of fast or the whole-wheat bun will decompose in your hand.  </P> <P> But I doubt many people come here for the food, even on Saturdays, which are  Buck-a-Burger days. They come because Randy Stoklos and Sinjin Smith are top  professional volleyball players, and they have seen fit to lend their names to  this huge El Segundo bar.  </P> <P> My volleyball informants tell me the local players actually boycott the place  (or at least boycotted it when it opened last summer), because El Segundo is  the home territory of Stoklos and Smith's chief rivals. No matter;  non-volleyballers are extensively catered to. Any beachy sport will do -- along  with the abundant volleyball paraphernalia, there are tables made from  surfboards and Body Glove stickers pasted here and there on the floor.  </P> <P> People come for the continuous sports videos and the Wednesday night  invitational knee-volleyball tournaments. Or maybe they come for the pool table  and the arcade games, or the $1 cocktails on Sunday, or the disco with an  announcer who gives away Side Out T-shirts. Or maybe they come for a touch of  class; this is one sports bar where you can buy a shot of any of about 20  perfumes or colognes in the rest rooms. The puny wine list does offer Dom  Perignon ($125 a bottle).  </P> <P> Maybe they come for the happy-hour buffet, 4 to 8 p.m. on weekdays, although  (apart from vegetables and dip) the free eats are not exactly sports training  food, being mostly pretzels, potato chips, chowder crackers and two hot  casseroles a night. Some of the casseroles aren't bad (for instance, the  chicken with onions and bell peppers), but one night I had something stunningly  vague that might have been scalloped potatoes, or maybe scalloped tortillas.  </P> <P> In our gourmet-conscious age, the house salad is known as "Our Signature  Salad." To tell the truth, lettuce with grated cheese is not really the most  distinctive signature in the world; anyway, nobody is claiming the nachos or  the tostada salad, with their gooey brown chili beef, are anybody's signatures.  Or the blue cheese-less chicken wings.  </P> <P> However, Side Out does have good oysters and steamed clams, the latter with  both drawn butter and an intriguing sauce that tastes like clam juices mixed  with Italian dressing. And there are some pretty good sandwiches. The chicken  croissant comes with either teriyaki or a (particularly viscous) barbecue sauce  on the side; the tender steak seems to be served on only one half of a roll,  but it's hard to tell -- the rest might be down there somewhere under the  forest of salad stuff and cantaloupe slices. The vegetable croissant sandwich,  which is mostly mushrooms and sprouts, pales beside them.  </P> <P> There are two desserts to choose from: chocolate-chocolate cake sprinkled with  walnut or vanilla ice cream -- a full pint of Haagen-Dazs. You know it's a full  pint because it's served in the carton, with a shot of either Kahlua or  Amaretto on the side.  </P> <P> One of the volleyballers who dined with me sniffed at the place. "This is just  what somebody from the Midwest thinks California is like," she said. Hey, it's  what a lot of Californians think California is like.  </P> <P> Randy and Sinjin's Side Out, 2171 E. Rosecrans Ave., El Segundo; (213)  640-2727. Lunch and dinner 11 a.m.-2 a.m. Monday-Saturday, noon-2 a.m. Sunday.  Full bar. Parking lot. All credit cards. Dinner for two, food only, $26-$40.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 22 March reports the  following combat situation in the country over the last 24 hours:    Correspondent from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that  "bestial actions and attacks in the Bihac region continued all  of last night until now. The Serbian aggressor has been  attacking the defense lines in Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin  Vrh, and [word indistinct] with all available arms." As  Sadikovic continues to report, "our defenders are offering  heroic resistance." He also says that "Cazin and Bihac commune  were shelled early last night and this morning. There were  numerous casualties among the fighters and the civilians."    A dispatch from Mostar by the Information Service of the 4th  Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "over the last  24 hours the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] on  several occasions seriously violated the cease-fire agreement on  the Mostar battlefield. The HVO extremists have opened fire  with portable grenade launchers at the separating lines and the  town center throughout the night. The HVO snipers in the House  Economics School were not sitting idle either." "The chetniks  displayed intense combat activities on all battlefields in the  zone of responsibility of the 3d Corps," the 3d Corps  Information Service reports. "In the Bosna River valley, the  chetniks in Blizna attacked the villages Medik and Luke with a  Bofors gun and Smaljbasici from a B-1 gun. With 34 shells from a  120-mm caliber mortar the chetniks shelled our positions in  Djedovac and Zedni Vrh yesterday evening. Karadzic's criminals  from Vlasic opened fire at Turbe, using mortars and Bofors gun.  At approximately 1800 they attacked with a B-1 gun. The  consequence of this shelling are three injured civilians." It  is also reported that "the chetniks in Komare fired one tank  shell at Travnik." The 3d Corps then adds that "the cease-fire  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO is more or less  being observed. More serious cease-fire violations have been  noted in the region of (Luknica) and Brdjani in the Bosna River  valley, where the HVO soldiers fired one explosive device and  displayed intense small arms fire."    Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian  aggressor continued to shell the lines of Brcko's defense over  the last 24 hours. Yesterday at midday the enemy carried out a  powerful artillery attack at our positions in Djukici. From the  direction of Sekulic, the chetniks fired nearly 100 projectiles  of 60-mm and 82-mm caliber." Deronjic adds that "the positions  of our fighters on Kladje-Djukici line were the most frequent  target of aggressor's mortars in the course of last night. The  chetniks were attacking the central part of defense of the free  Brcko territory with antiaircraft guns. Two powerful explosions  that echoed in the most densely populated part of the  temporarily occupied Brcko at 1140 yesterday confirm that the  Serbian fascists continue to destroy the biggest town of the  Bosnian Posavina."</p>

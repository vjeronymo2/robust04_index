			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhuhai, April 8 (CNS) -- Zhuhai, a special economic  zone city in Guangdong Province, plans to transfer a batch of  well-known enterprises' shares rights worth at least RMB  [renminbi] 1 billion to foreign businessmen, a move being seen  as an important measure for collecting funds for construction in  the city.    An official from the municipal government said that the  enterprises with their shares rights transferred to foreign  businessmen would be pillar ones in the city. They are now  making good economic profits and their products already enjoy a  broad market. The Dongda (Holding) Company, for example, has  over one million square metres of land and is producing a range  of famous daily-use chemicals and electrical and machinery  products.    The news of the transferring of enterprise shares rights has  aroused the strong interest of businessmen overseas with three  enterprises' shares rights being sold to businessmen from  foreign countries including Singapore and it is expected that  another ten enterprises' shares rights will be purchased by  foreigners within this year.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Air of stability belies leaders' nervousness: The Tiananmen Square killings, five years on - Why China's government is wary of the increasing boldness of dissidents On Beijing's vast central Tiananmen Square, crowds of holidaymakers in the hot sun of early summer went about their business this week seemingly as usual. They stood before the statue to the revolutionary martyrs, had their photographs taken beneath the late Chairman Mao's portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and gazed at the imposing Great Hall of the People. These scenes of quiet coming and going might have been unexceptional if it were not for pervasive security on the square and in surrounding areas. As the anniversary approached of the 1989, June 4, Tiananmen massacre, the authorities were prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that no incident would disturb an appearance of calm. Among the concerns preying on the minds of the leadership is that this year marks the fifth anniversary of the crushing of the student rebellion. More important, perhaps, is the emphasis that China's leaders have placed on political stability since a meeting last November of the Communist party's central committee. This gathering approved a batch of sweeping economic reforms, including a belated assault on inefficient and overstaffed state enterprises. These risk antagonising a restless workforce at a time of cost of living increases and growing joblessness in cities. Officially, China's urban unemployment stands at 2.6 per cent, but this vastly understates numbers of unemployed and under-employed workers. Some estimates put jobless rates in the cities at more than 20 per cent. 'This is a whole body of people just ripe for revolution,' said a western official in Beijing who specialises in issues of social stability and human rights. Sporadic workers' disturbances have become a fact of life in towns of the north-east and Yangtze River valley dominated by state-run heavy industries. Peasant farmers are also angry over rising prices and poor returns. China's dissidents, in spite of a government crackdown including the recent arrest of their unofficial leader, Wei Jingsheng, have also been speaking out. This new boldness among political activists includes petitioning China's parliament, the National People's Congress, for the release of jailed dissidents. Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 movement, commented adventurously in a western publication this week that China's economic reforms would not succeed without progress in political reform and, in particular, a re-assessment of the Tiananmen massacre. 'After Deng Xiaoping's death, the first issue China will face will be re-addressing the June 4 events, not only at the top levels of the Communist Party but also among ordinary people,' he wrote. 'Unless it does this, China will find it impossible to make a smooth transition to a modern society.' These views will certainly not find favour with a Chinese leadership seeking to put the events of June 4 as far behind it as possible. Indeed, President Jiang Zemin, who also heads the Communist Party, sought last month in a rare direct reference to the Tiananmen massacre to argue that the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters had yielded positive benefits. 'A bad thing has been turned into a good,' Mr Jiang told the visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 'As a result, our programme of reform and opening has forged ahead with steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into even fuller play. History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good,' he added. Mr Jiang's remarks were interpreted by western officials as a toughening of a self-confident government's warning to dissidents in light of China's 'victory' over the US on the Most Favoured Nation trading status issue last month, when Washington abandoned attempts to use trade to pressure China on human rights. But the government's seeming nervousness over internal threats - its official statements are marked by constant reference to the need to maintain stability at all costs - suggests that it is far from certain about keeping disaffected workers and peasants in check. These concerns also coincide with worries about a protracted transition to a new generation of leaders. Uncertainties about Mr Deng's health and the factional disputes that might follow his death are not the least of factors at play in a complex political game now being waged on several fronts. Signs of weakness at this delicate stage would risk the government's survival. The crackdown on political dissent, and on worker and peasant agitation is set to continue long after June 4.</p>

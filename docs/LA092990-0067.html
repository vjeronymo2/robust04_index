			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUARTZ HILL POUNDS OUT 26-7 WIN BEHIND SMITH  </P> <P> Quartz Hill High's game at San Gorgonio on Friday night was a case of the haves  versus the have-nots.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill had Selves Smith, the team's defensive leader, back in the lineup.  Smith missed last week's game, a one-point upset loss to Hesperia, because of a  death in the family but returned Friday with some ferocious tackling.  </P> <P> San Gorgonio, meanwhile, was without 6-foot-7, 297-pound offensive tackle Jason  Behunin, who had an injured shoulder.  </P> <P> The result was a defensive-minded 26-7 nonleague win for Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> "I just missed the game so much when I was gone," Smith said. "It felt great to  get back."  </P> <P> Smith, a linebacker, and his defensive teammates held San Gorgonio (1-2-1) to  153 yards in offense and forced three turnovers. The Spartans' leading rusher,  Hakim Porcher, carried 12 times for just 21 yards; San Gorgonio gained only 32  yards on the ground.  </P> <P> "If you can't control the line of scrimmage, you're not going to win too many  games," San Gorgonio Coach Karl Gaytan said.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill (3-1) had no such complaints. The Rebels' Erik Thomas ran 14 times  for 105 yards and two touchdowns. He returned a kickoff 76 yards for a third  score.  </P> <P> The game's first touchdown came after a fumbled punt that Quartz Hill's David  Haney recovered at the Spartan 17-yard line. Five plays later, Thomas ran one  yard for a 7-0 lead. That score held up through halftime as Quartz Hill's  defense asserted itself.  </P> <P> On one play, Smith tackled Porcher so hard that the running back returned to  the huddle screaming at his linemen.  </P> <P> The injured Behunin could only pace the sidelines. "Gimme some shoulder pads,"  he yelled. "Forget it. Just give me a jersey. I want to hit someone."  </P> <P> After a scoreless third quarter, San Gorgonio threatened with a 17-play,  11-minute drive. But the march stalled at the Quartz Hill 34-yard line after a  holding penalty. On Quartz Hill's next possession, Thomas broke a 65-yard  touchdown run that broke the game open.  </P> <P> David Nelson added an eight-yard scoring run several minutes later and the  Rebels led, 20-0.  </P> <P> San Gorgonio spoiled the shutout with four seconds left when Bert Minjares  threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Michael Thomas on a flea-flicker.  </P> <P> The Rebels countered when Thomas returned the ensuing kickoff for the game's  final score.  </P></p>

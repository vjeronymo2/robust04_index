			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (4): Middleman keeps busy - Trading between east and west WHEN THE iron curtain was ripped apart in 1989, there was considerable anxiety among business circles in Vienna. This was because it was feared that the city would lose its special and highly profitable role as a middleman in trading - often rather murky trading - between east and west. In the event, the fears were totally unfounded. The city has already become a regional financial centre for central and eastern Europe and, along with Berlin, is a preferred base for the hundreds of western companies seeking to do business in eastern Europe. Viennese business leaders are naturally cautious about proclaiming their city a new international financial centre. 'We can never expect to compete with London,' one banker says. But a lot is happening. The big Austrian banks have all established - perhaps one should say re-established - offices in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and aggressively pursue all kinds of financial business there. The banks are also bringing trainees from these countries into Vienna to learn the business. 'We regarded it as our extended home market,' an official of Creditanstalt, the second largest bank and most aggressive in eastern Europe, says. The bank now has offices in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw and has just acquired a bank in Slovenia. Creditanstalt even intends to offer retail banking in some of these countries. 'We have advantages in eastern Europe, and for the moment there is no other competition. The Germans look fully occupied for a long time, and by the time they move in, we hope to be well established,' a bank official says. The big banks are also bringing eastern European businesses to Vienna to raise capital. More than half the volume of Hungarian shares is traded in Vienna. Mr Gerhard Randa, deputy chief executive of Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, has proposed setting up a central European stock exchange based in Vienna once exchanges are set up in a number of eastern European cities. He has also suggested the creation of a publicly financed know-how fund to aid development of companies in eastern Europe. Another element of Vienna's importance as a financial centre for the east derives from Austria's bank secrecy laws. Switzerland has passed legislation obliging banks to know their customers but Austria remains one of the few hard currency countries in which anonymous numbered bank accounts are permitted. Until recently, Austrian banks have downplayed the significance of international private banking in their strategies, but they are becoming more excited about it amid indications that large private fortunes from eastern Europe are moving into Vienna. The other main contributors to Vienna's growth these days are western multinational companies. 'We have had a boom ever since the old Comecon countries opened,' Mr Friedrich Heitzinger, deputy managing director of the Vienna Business Promotion Fund (WWFF), says. The list of international companies that have set up bases in Vienna in recent years runs from Sweden's Alfa-Laval to Yamaha of Japan, and continues to lengthen. The WWFF claims to have helped 500 companies in all since its formation 10 years ago. One banker claims that over 200 western companies have set up liaison offices for doing business in eastern Europe in the past two years. Companies choose Vienna as a base for eastern European operations for several reasons. For one thing, it has excellent and reliable transportation and communication infrastructure. 'In Budapest, you have little chance of getting a telephone these days,' a Viennese banker says. For another, the city is very pleasant to live in, with good housing and schools available. And office space is cheaper than in Budapest. The Vienna city council keeps a bank of 3m square metres of various types of office and industrial space available for newcomers. Mr Heitzinger says some western companies have set up offices in eastern European cities but then abandoned them in favour of Vienna because of the practical difficulties of operating in the east. As compared with other gateway cities, such as Berlin, Vienna also has the advantage of strong historical and linguistic links with its neighbouring countries. 'Many people here speak Czech or Hungarian, so we have no difficulty finding good people,' says Mr Katsumi Ishibashi, manager of the Bank of Tokyo's representative office in Vienna. Japanese businesses have been particularly enthusiastic about Vienna, and the city has been the beneficiary of their well-known tendency to move in packs. 'Four years ago, there were only 30 Japanese companies with offices in Vienna. Now there are nearly 100,' Mr Ishibashi says. Mr Masahiko Murakami, assistant manager of the eastern European liaison office of Matsushita Electrical Industrial in Vienna, says he appreciates the ease of getting visas for Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in Vienna. 'Even German companies set up here,' he observes. Other industrialists point to the opportunity for their children to learn German, which they feel will be more useful than learning an eastern European language, as they would have to do if they were living in an eastern European city. Because of the expansion, Bank of Tokyo will next month upgrade its 20-year-old office in Vienna to branch status. There must be few other Japanese banks expanding anywhere else in the world in these tough times. It is not clear yet whether, once the eastern European countries have reached a certain level of development, companies will set up offices there and phase down their operations in Vienna. To an extent, some observers say, this is happening already, with a few companies putting labour-intensive operations into the east as quickly as possible to take advantage of low wages. However, Vienna should keep and enhance its importance as a base for corporate services, such as legal, accounting and consulting services. H Neumann International, the Vienna based executive search group, has just established a co-ordinating office in the city for what it calls the new Europe. 'I do not believe that the use of Vienna as a co-ordinating base will drastically increase, but as a knowhow centre it will stay important,' predicts Mr Tamas Toth, manager of Neumann's new Europe division.</p>

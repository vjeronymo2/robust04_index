			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban June 2 SAPA -- The African National Congress  says one of its senior Northern KwaZulu/Natal members was shot  dead on Thursday [2 June] by men wearing camouflage uniforms,  SABC radio news reported. ANC spokesman Zipho Mkhize said  Derrick Gcaba was attacked in his house at Mtubatuba by men who  demanded his car keys and asked him where he had been during the  day. Mr Gcaba was subsequently shot twice in the head. Mr  Mkhize said the ANC had discussed security problems in the area  a week ago, but was unsuccessful in its bid to have the army  deployed in the area.</p>

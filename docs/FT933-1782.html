			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Philip Harris warning SHARES IN Philip Harris dived 50p to 154p as the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment supplier warned that profits in the current year would be unlikely to match last time's and that, in particular, this would be reflected in the results for the first six months to September 30. The company said that shareholders had been 'cautioned' by the board at the time of the preliminary results and the subsequent annual meeting. Exports, which last year accounted for 30 per cent of the education and scientific side, were running more than 50 per cent below 1992 levels because of deepening recession in continental Europe, the main export market. Expected substantial orders had been cancelled and no significant overseas contracts had been secured. In the UK, recession had hit the market for sales of scientific equipment, especially that of a capital nature, to industrial customers. The cost base in the education and scientific division had been reduced, with a redundancy programme for 9 per cent of the workforce here being implemented. This cost will hit the first half with the benefit being felt in the second.</p>

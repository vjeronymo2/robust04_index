			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS GET BUSH PLEDGE OF HELP FOR PERESTROIKA;  </P> <P> SUMMIT: THE U.S. LEADER LINKS HIS PLAN TO MOSCOW'S NEW FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS  SUPPORT FOR GULF MOVES.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, faced with a reeling economy and  plummeting popularity at home, won a commitment from President Bush on Sunday  for potentially vital U.S. assistance to underwrite his reform program.  </P> <P> "I am very much interested in assisting to be sure that perestroika is  successful," Bush told a news conference after a day of talks with Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Bush linked his proposal, which he said would be divulged in detail at a joint  session of Congress on Tuesday, to the dramatic changes in Moscow's foreign  policy and the virtual Soviet-American alliance in confronting Iraq for its  invasion and seizure of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Given the common stand of the Soviet Union and the United States have taken at  the United Nations, it seems to me we should be as forthcoming as we can in  terms of economics, and I plan to do that," Bush said.  </P> <P> The President said that the United States, faced with a roughly  multibillion-dollar budget deficit, is not in the position "to write out large  checks" but could provide other forms of assistance, perhaps  government-guaranteed credits and technical aid.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, however, told the same news conference that the Soviet Union would  not tie its foreign policy to Western rewards.  </P> <P> "It would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet  Union could be bought for dollars," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> Speaking later in an interview on Soviet television, Gorbachev described his  talks with Bush as a breakthrough that will spell relief for his beleaguered  economy.  </P> <P> "The American Administration and political circles in the United States have  passed through a certain stage in their thinking, and we were quite satisfied  with their approach," he said. "They believe, first of all, that the world  community is planning and will strive to cooperate with the Soviet Union to  help solve its problems faster."  </P> <P> As Bush and Gorbachev were meeting, a delegation of 15 prominent American  businessmen, led by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, arrived in Helsinki  en route to Moscow for discussions with Soviet leaders on concrete ways that  U.S. industry can assist Soviet economic modernization.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said the group would discuss energy development, exploitation of  mineral resources and increased U.S. investment.  </P> <P> He also said Bush had promised to clear legal obstacles toward joint  Soviet-American development of a new civilian aircraft. "This will be a huge,  large-scale project that could turn into very big business," he said, adding  that it involved conversion of the Soviet warplane industry to peaceful  production.  </P> <P> Bush also pledged that the United States would remove many of the restrictions  that now limit Western technical cooperation with the Soviet Union, Gorbachev  told Soviet television.  </P> <P> At their first summit at Malta last December, Bush offered Gorbachev extensive  U.S. technical assistance to revitalize the Soviet Union's backward economy as  it shed almost seven decades of central planning and opened itself far wider to  foreign investment.  </P> <P> As Bush envisioned it, the U.S. assistance would focus on improving the  efficiency of the whole Soviet economic infrastructure, from transport and  communications to retail distribution and banking.  </P> <P> The transfusion of U.S. managerial know-how and technical expertise would, Bush  said at Malta, help speed the transformation of the Soviet economy toward one  based on the market forces of supply and demand and entrepreneurship.  </P> <P> But in the nine months since the two presidents' Malta meeting, the Soviet  economy has deteriorated at an even faster pace, and the government can no  longer ensure the supply of even such staples as bread.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's own political position has been undercut as a result; a recent  opinion poll showed that his popularity had dropped far below that of Boris N.  Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, who advocates faster and more  radical reforms.  </P> <P> The Soviet president, speaking with reporters at the end of August,  acknowledged that in the face of growing popular discontent, his reforms are  now in their most difficult phase -- they must be implemented immediately or  fail completely.  </P> <P> Anxious to return to Moscow, where his economic program is under attack from  both radicals such as Yeltsin and Marxist-Leninist conservatives, Gorbachev  left Helsinki on Sunday evening, earlier than planned.  </P> <P> A Soviet broadcast journalist said that the president had revised his schedule  in Helsinki because the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet, is opening  today, with the central issue before lawmakers being the rescue of the economy.  </P> <P> Two rival programs have been put forward -- one favored by Prime Minister  Nikolai I. Ryzhkov that would provide for a step-by-step reshaping of the  economy, and another, advocated by Yeltsin and his numerous allies, that would  rapidly sell off state assets and let prices float to achieve the  transformation in only 500 days.  </P> <P> Gorbachev had originally been expected to present his version to the Supreme  Soviet, but he decided instead to send it first to the legislatures of the  country's 15 constituent republics this week for debate and possible  amendments.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is hoping that a consensus will emerge on the program and popular  backing grow if the local legislatures are given the right to approve or modify  it.  </P> <P> His goal, advisers have said, is to obtain approval this month before the  Soviet government's 1991 annual budget and economic development plan are  decided.  </P> <P> Bush's offer of U.S. assistance, whatever form it may take, greatly strengthens  Gorbachev's hand. The Soviet leader favors the faster approach of Yeltsin but  shares some of the concerns of Ryzhkov about moving too fast.  </P> <P> With Bush's pledge, Gorbachev can now argue that his country will have the  support it needs and ease the fears of his countrymen that economic reform will  inescapably mean unemployment, higher prices and harder times.  </P> <P> But Bush made it clear that he was not talking about large-scale financial  assistance. He specifically referred to the Mosbacher delegation, which would  put private business in the lead of any American aid program.  </P> <P> Joined by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the group of business  executives led by the secretary of commerce will spend five days in top-level  discussions with Gorbachev, Ryzhkov, Yeltsin and other Soviet officials in  Moscow and Leningrad. The delegation includes 15 executives of some of  America's largest corporations.  </P> <P> Bush said he and Gorbachev had had "a good, long discussion" about the Soviet  economic reforms. He indicated that he felt the Kremlin leadership should move  even faster and more boldly toward a market economy, but he nevertheless  reiterated his support for Gorbachev and his program.  </P> <P> Baker said later that the two presidents had agreed to push negotiations on an  investment treaty and resolving old debt claims. The Bush Administration was  also awaiting Soviet action on free emigration so that it could present the new  trade agreement to Congress for approval.  </P> <P> "We did talk about the steps that need to be taken for us to be a position to  assist economically, that is through technical economic cooperation and  otherwise," Baker said on the CNN program, Newsmaker Sunday.  </P> <P> The United States has opposed extensive Western financial aid to the Soviet  Union, arguing that most of it would be wasted because of the sheer  inefficiency of the economic system.  </P> <P> France, Italy and West Germany have nevertheless provided large credits to  finance increased Soviet purchases of not only industrial products but also  consumer goods.  </P> <P> They and other members of the Group of Seven, the major industrialized  democracies, urged Bush to rethink the U.S. position, warning that time was  running out for Gorbachev to show his people that economic reform will give  them a better life.  </P> <P> But the leaders of the Group of Seven, meeting in July, did agree to ask the  International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development to prepare a study of the Soviet economy, making  recommendations for reform and establishing criteria for Western economic  assistance.  </P> <P> That study is to be completed by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, commenting on Bush's pledge, welcomed it as a "normal element of new  cooperation in trade" and a reflection of improved Soviet-American relations.  </P> <P> But sensitive to the possible criticism at home that he had sold out Soviet  foreign policy for Western assistance, Gorbachev said, "I wouldn't want  President Bush's reply to give rise to the opinion that the Soviet Union is  going to align a certain sum with a certain behavior."  </P> <P> Baker also denied any linkage between the offer of U.S. assistance and Soviet  foreign policy concessions. "It's not a question of saying in any way -- never  even a suggestion -- that if you agree to a strong statement on the Persian  Gulf, we will be more forthcoming economically," he said on CNN. "Not even a  hint of that ever entered into the discussions."  </P> <P> MORE ON SUMMIT, GULF:  </P> <P> A6-A20  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state, who  is on an official visit to Poland, has been received by  President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. He  also had a one-hour conversation with Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski.    After years of confrontation and polarization, Walesa said  in  greeting the U.S. guest, there is now a chance to build a new  order in Europe. We have fought for 50 years for Europe without  divisions. This has cost millions of victims; the financial  costs were enormous. After the sophisticated struggle in the  1980's, there is now a chance to resolve the problems. Fast  action and courageous decisions are needed, the president said.    [Begin Walesa recording] I am convinced that, by cooperating  with the United States, we can achieve beautiful victories in  Europe. We are, however, concerned about the remnants of  communism and the Warsaw Treaty. Of course, there are no direct  dangers, but a sphere under a question mark still remains. We  wonder whether this sphere, when left alone, can rebuild the old  setup in different conditions but following the communist  pattern, or whether one should aim at unity in Europe.

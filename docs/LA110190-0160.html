			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING BELOW STANDARDS  </P> <P> Some time ago, the Redevelopment Agency and the city fathers of Glendale  approved the construction of the Carnation world headquarters building at 800  N. Brand Blvd. The main structure is complete. From the outside wrapping, it  all looks great -- an interesting office building, lots of trees, shrubs,  fountains and walkways visible from Brand Boulevard and Monterey Road.  </P> <P> But, drive past the corner, turn down Monterey Road and see the disaster that  has been created. Adjacent to the monument to Carnation is its parking garage.  There one can see a cheaply constructed, neon-lit blight. Forty-four  homeowners, who previously enjoyed beautiful mountain views, now face open  spaces filled with autos, auto fumes and rows and rows of neon lights -- even  surging above the 45-foot building height guidelines.  </P> <P> If one drives around Glendale, one notes the care and consideration given by  other developers when building parking garages at 222 Monterey, the Glendale  Federal Building at Monterey and Brand, the garages facing Goode Street between  Brand and Central Avenue, 500 N. Brand and 550 N. Brand. What did Carnation  offer Glendale to have a different set of standards laid down for it? Why is it  able to create a blight on a residential street when no other developers have  done this much damage to our commercial streets?  </P> <P> This is a time when businesses and their leaders are being called upon to pay  greater attention to the environment, to contribute their fair share to the  quality of life in the communities in which they reside. Why are we not asking  this of Lincoln Properties and the Carnation Co.? Were they excused from  corporate responsibility for the next century?  </P> <P> Our corporate "neighbors" have shown little sensitivity to the rights of  others. They have shown no sensitivity to the standards of the community they  chose and none to the environment the city fathers worked to create. This  should not be recognized as acceptable behavior.  </P> <P> KAREN ARDEN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

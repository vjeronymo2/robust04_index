			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: TAKING PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FOOD POISONING  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I recently had a severe case of food poisoning. The doctor told  me that I had gotten it from some chicken that he thought may not have been  cooked thoroughly.  </P> <P> Would you please share some more information on how to avoid food poisoning? I  don't ever want to go through that again.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, El Paso, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR READER: Food-borne poisoning can make you feel terrible and can even be  life-threatening. There are many types of food-borne poisoning:  </P> <P> One type is botulism and can be found in home-canned or other canned goods.  Always check all canned foods to make sure there are no bulges in the can. If  any food looks bad, don't taste it. If you think you might have botulism, seek  medical attention immediately.  </P> <P> Salmonella is a bacteria that is found in meat, poultry, eggs or fish. Foods  that aren't thoroughly cooked and those that are eaten raw are the major  culprits.  </P> <P> All foods, utensils and surfaces that have come in contact with raw foods  should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. If you use a wooden cutting  board to cut up the raw chicken, be sure to wash it thoroughly in soap and  water. The knife that you use to cut up the raw chicken shouldn't be used to  cut up anything else unless washed first. Don't forget to wash your hands if  you have handled the food. When taking raw chicken to the barbecue on a  platter, don't use the same platter to put the cooked chicken on unless it has  been washed.  </P> <P> Staphylococcus is a bacteria that may be found in foods that are left  unrefrigerated for longer than two hours. Some foods prone to this bacteria are  cheese, egg products, poultry, meat, pasta, macaroni or potato salads,  cream-filled desserts or custards.  </P> <P> Again, wash your hands thoroughly before and after preparation.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was given a beautiful old glass decanter that belonged to my  grandmother. There are some stains in it that I don't know how to remove.  </P> <P> I don't want to use anything that can damage it. Do you know what I should use  to clean it?  </P> <P>  -- SARAH, Roanoke, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR SARAH: I have been told by some antiques dealers that sometimes stains  cannot be removed from old glass. What works best for them is to mix about  one-quarter of a cup of dishwasher detergent compound with hot water. When the  water cools, fill the decanter to the top. Let it soak for a few hours or  overnight. Use a bottle brush to try and remove stubborn stains.  </P> <P> Some stains may remain. Rinse well and let dry. Good luck.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY VOWS TO CURB GROWTH DURING NEXT TERM  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, savoring his convincing victory  early Wednesday morning, pledged to explore all means of curbing further growth  in the congested 5th District during his coming term.  </P> <P> The councilman, who was criticized during the campaign for the amount of  commercial development in communities such as Westwood, the Beverly-Fairfax  area and Sherman Oaks, despite his co-sponsorship of the city's landmark  slow-growth measure, conceded that more must be done to protect neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "We have to take a closer look at growth," Yaroslavsky said. "My district is  overzoned, even now. . . . There's no question you'll see tighter controls on  commercial development in the Westside and the San Fernando Valley."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said he will consider moratoriums on construction, downzoning and  tougher planning guidelines as ways to slow the area's explosive growth.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old councilman said he will also focus on such citywide problems as  police staffing and the affordable housing crisis, signaling that he expects to  continue his high-profile role on the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victory Celebration  </P> <P> On Tuesday, nearly 200 Yaroslavsky supporters crowded into his campaign party  at the Beverly Plaza Hotel in West Los Angeles to cheer him on. There was wild  applause as Yaroslavsky, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, emerged to claim  victory about 10:30 p.m., and the celebration lasted late into the evening.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who was once expected to run for mayor, faced the stiffest  challenge of any Westside councilman this year. Mike Woo, who represents the  13th District, had nominal opposition and received about 71% of the vote.  Marvin Braude of the 11th District was unopposed, receiving 100% of the vote.  </P> <P> After the election, Yaroslavsky said his constituents provided a mandate for  his programs and policies when they reelected him with 63% of the vote against  environmental activist Laura M. Lake, transportation consultant Ryan Snyder and  political adviser Jack McGrath, a write-in candidate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peace Offering  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky extended his hand to Lake, his chief rival, but said his opponents,  who were highly critical of his 14-year stewardship of the sprawling 5th  District, must be more reasonable if they want to work with him.  </P> <P> "Anyone who wants to play a constructive role will have a role to play . . .  because we need to work together," he said. "But just because you don't get  110% of what you want does not mean that your councilman is a sellout."  </P> <P> Lake, the feisty Westwood activist who rallied the support of about 33% of the  voters by branding Yaroslavsky a political insider and a latecomer to the  slow-growth movement, did not immediately take up Yaroslavsky's offer.  </P> <P> She said the councilman must prove that his commitment to quality-of-life  issues is genuine before his opponents return to the fold. Lake, a UCLA  professor, said she was proud of her showing on Tuesday. She blamed her defeat  on Yaroslavsky's high name recognition and his fund-raising advantage.  </P> <P> Lake, who raised less than half of the $215,000 collected by Yaroslavsky, said  the race would have been closer if more challengers had emerged and if the  voter turnout had been higher. Nevertheless, Lake said she is proud of her  campaign. "We went into this with our eyes open," she said. "And we built a  wonderful base against a political machine that's rarely challenged."  </P> <P> Lake's campaign party at her West Los Angeles headquarters attracted about 75  people. The event was fairly lively in the early going, but turned solemn as  the returns showed Yaroslavsky holding on to his substantial lead. And by  midnight, as the final results rolled in, the room was nearly empty.  </P> <P> Lake, 42, and her family will spend several days vacationing in Northern  California. Upon her return, the environmentalist said she expects to continue  her work as president of Friends of Westwood and Not Yet New York.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ginger Thompson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

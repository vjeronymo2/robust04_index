			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Husni Khashabah: "Five Aims of the Iraqi-South </F> African Military Cooperation Program"]    [Text] London -- Sources have revealed some aspects of the  methods of trickery used by Iraq to obtain the best available  military technological secrets, and the exploratory research on  the extraction of uranium in southern Iraq. The sources, with  whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq  has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the  following five main objectives:    1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells  not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells.  Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main  design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company  coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that  purpose.    2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South  Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies  (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely  advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled  with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and  heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies  were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a  state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of  missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that  kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some  offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing  equipment.    3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has  been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a  complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery  shells.    4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim  has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources  said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South  Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and  London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the  visas were issued for "the crescent state," the expression used  in official correspondence.    5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in  South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had  indeed received some offers in this connection.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: Sharing the blame When a company performs badly, shareholders usually blame the chief executive and other senior executives. The criticism is rarely directed towards the board of directors. Boards have been 'unique among institutions in their insulation from performance review and enforceable mandates to change their procedures or membership,' says a study* by the Conference Board, a business membership organisation that researches business policy and practice. Yet there are signs that this state of affairs is changing. The Conference Board study reports 'a growing recognition' that boards have a responsibility to review and improve the effectiveness of their operations. There has been an increasing demand for director accountability following poor company results and the publication of the Cadbury report in the UK, which attempted to define standards for corporate governance. Those companies which have introduced director appraisal systems tend to stress the importance of contributions to discussions, says the report. Other issues that tend to be highlighted include analytical ability, assertiveness and skill at communicating. But formal procedures to evaluate board performance are still rare. The assessment of directors is handicapped because boards are 'a community of peers' whose role has not traditionally involved criticising their collective or individual effectiveness. As a result, devising an assessment process that commands general respect is paramount. 'Because the exercise lacks any compliance or enforcement authority, it derives its legitimacy from the integrity of the process itself,' says the report. *Corporate Boards: improving and evaluating performance.

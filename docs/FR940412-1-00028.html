			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the proposed ratemaking methodology would provide that the Director of Great Lakes Pilotage (the Director), determine the timing for reviews of pilotage rates. Interested parties would be able to petition the Director for a review at any time. However, the Director would decide, under applicable law, if a review is warranted. If the Director determined that a review is warranted, he or she would accomplish this review by following the steps detailed in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basically, these steps involve the projection of operating expenses (including pilot compensation) and revenues (using the current rate schedule), based on the anticipated demand for pilotage services, by pilotage area for the succeeding navigation period. Interest expense on the debt of the pilot organizations, and allowances for federal income taxes and the capital invested in the pilot organizations would be subtracted from this projected operating profit or loss. Ideally, projected revenues received under the existing rate schedule would be sufficient to cover projected operating expenses, interest, and allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a rate adjustment appeared warranted, the Director would calculate a new hourly rate schedule for basic pilotage service in each pilotage area by dividing the sum of the projected costs (operating expenses, interest expense, and tax and return allowances) by the projected hours of pilotage service. The Coast Guard would publish any proposed rate adjustments in a NPRM inviting comments on the changes. That NPRM, and any subsequent comments on it, would then form the basis for negotiations on pilotage rates between the United States and Canada. Once these negotiations resulted in an agreement to change pilotage rates, the Coast Guard would publish a rule establishing a new rate schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM also proposes to change the financial reporting requirements for pilot associations to more closely comport to ratemaking needs. The proposed changes to the reporting requirements, while an integral part of the ratemaking process, should be considered independently from any proposed ratemaking provisions. This NPRM also proposes to add a certification requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposals contained in the discussion section of this preamble are presented in two parts. Part A of this section discusses proposed revisions to the ratemaking methodology. Part B addresses proposed revisions to the financial reporting requirements. The order of discussion in this preamble differs from the order of presentation in the regulations. The revisions to the ratemaking methodology are discussed first because an understanding of the methodology is important to an understanding of the proposed changes to the financial reporting requirements, and because the changes to the proposed methodology are more extensive than the changes to the financial reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of Public Service Rate Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Pilotage Act (46 U.S.C. 9303) provides, in part, that the rates and charges for pilotage services shall be fair and equitable, giving due consideration to the public interest and the reasonable cost and expense of providing and maintaining such facilities and arrangements as are required for the efficient performance of pilotage services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the provision of service by the pilot organizations contains many of the characteristics and requirements of a public utility, this NPRM proposes to employ basic utility ratemaking procedures in setting pilotage rates and charges. Basic utility ratemaking concepts include the non-discriminatory treatment of users, operational and economic efficiency through the use of ratemaking standards, and other general public policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM describes the general financial structure of public service rates and proposes to apply this structure to the three U.S. pilot organizations providing pilotage services on the Great Lakes, with several economic standards applied to cost elements and specific application and designation of revenue categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General Public Service Rate Structure and Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public service rates are generally defined rates with established economic standards, most often based upon an allowed return on investment. Shown below is a basic structure for such rates: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

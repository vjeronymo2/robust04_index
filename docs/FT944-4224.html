			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Revenue raising wins approval - City reaction The City took the chancellor's package in its stride, with analysts saying the measures were roughly in line with expectations. Economists were pleased that Mr Kenneth Clarke had announced revenue-raising measures, rather than making adjustments to public spending targets, which might not then be achieved. Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, said 'we were concerned that he was going to announce further cuts in the (public spending) control total', which might have been simply due to a reduction in the contingency reserve. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist of UBS in London, said the fact that Mr Clarke 'didn't use smoke and mirrors will be taken very well'. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said the chancellor 'needed to do something which gave a rap on the knuckles to the rebellious backbenchers by imposing small but unpopular tax increases. He can lay the blame for the tax rises fairly and squarely with the rebels'. Most analysts were also encouraged by the reduction in future inflation which would result from the package. The Treasury said that, had the rise in VAT on domestic fuel and power gone ahead, it would have added 0.43 per cent to the retail prices index in April. The new package will add 0.26 per cent to the RPI from January, accordingly lowering the rate of inflation later in the year by about 0.2 of a percentage point. But Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Markets, was disappointed with the package. 'The chancellor had a golden opportunity to deal with the RPI,' he said, adding that a change in indirect taxes would have saved the full 0.4 per cent. Mr Shepherdson said: 'When inflation is around 2 per cent, 0.4 of a point is a hell of a lot.' A lower RPI would have reduced the pressure for higher pay increases, he added. Mr Shepherdson also pointed out that, by delaying the changes, the RPI impact would not come through in the December inflation figure, which was often used as a guide for January pay settlements. Furthermore, the drinks industry might not pass on the full impact of the excise duty increase to consumers. Mr Shepherdson said: 'Even at current duty levels, cross-Channel shopping is crippling the off-sales trade in the south-east.' Poor households will be the biggest percentage winners from the government's tax-raising switch, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The institute said the poorest 10 per cent of the population would gain 0.58 per cent of their net income, as a result of the replacement of the 17.5 per cent band of value added tax on fuel with higher duties on alcohol, tobacco and petrol. The richest 10 per cent of the population gained only 0.11 per cent. The institute said the progressive nature of the change was due to 'the removal of a tax that bore very heavily on the poor, and its replacement by taxes that are spread more evenly across the population'. However, the institute said pensioners gained, on average, less than the overall population.</p>

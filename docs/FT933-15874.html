			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Funds to developing countries rise 23% FINANCIAL flows to developing countries increased 23 per cent in 1992 to a record Dollars 176bn (Pounds 117bn) as a result of an explosion in bank lending, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. With direct investment also rising sharply, private money flows reached Dollars 99.8bn and exceeded official aid for the first time since 1983, the OECD's development assistance committee (DAC) said in an annual report. The panel welcomed the increase, which it said reflected positive economic and political trends in developing countries. But it cautioned the boom might not be sustainable and said that, in any case, only a few better-off developing countries were benefiting from the sudden interest. 'The ability of the vast number of the poorer developing countries to attract external resources, particularly private flows, is little changed. For them, official development finance remains the backbone of resource provision.' About half of the rich nations that make up the DAC boosted their official development assistance in 1992, with Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and Italy all reporting big increases. The US was the biggest donor in money terms, providing Dollars 11.7bn, followed by Japan with Dollars 11.1bn, France with Dollars 8.3bn and Germany Dollars 7.6bn. But for the 21 DAC members as a whole, the volume of aid was unchanged from 1991 at 0.33 per cent of gross national product - well short of the international target of 0.7 per cent and still below the 0.34 per cent average recorded between 1979 and 1988. Among big donors, Japan cut its aid by 5.8 per cent, Britain by 4 per cent and Germany by 2.1 per cent, the report said. International bank lending increased to Dollars 40bn from Dollars 11bn. Short-term lending accounted for more than half the rise. As a result the total debt burden of developing countries grew 3 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 1,530bn, the OECD said. The cost of servicing the debt was unchanged at about Dollars 150bn.</p>

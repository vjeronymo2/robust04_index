			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Slovak Prime Minister Meciar has made some harsh  and not overly diplomatic statements about the demands and  rights of the Hungarian minority. Incidentally, with this he  has also set himself against the more moderate stance of the  Slovak head of state. Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava:    [Nagy] Certain political forces exceed the limits of  tolerance when they demand collective rights for the Hungarians  of Slovakia. If in this way they want to increase tension, they  must reckon with the fact that they are confronting the power of  the state. There will not be any kind of province; we will  guarantee that. And this country will not voluntarily give up  as much as an inch of its territory, because that would lead to  a Central European conflict.    These remarks were made by Vladimir Meciar at a discussion  he  held with workers of the Slovak Defense Ministry.    In connection with bilingual placename signs he stated: The  government's wish is for the use of the Slovak name, translated  into the language of the minority, and it does not agree with  the proposal coming from the Castle [Slovak Presidency], which  recommends that the minorities should use any name that suits  them.    Minority rights are above average in Slovakia, stated the  Slovak prime minister, according to whom Bill Clinton also  rejected collective rights at the conversation he held with him  in Prague. For this reason Vladimir Meciar trusts that the part  dealing with the inviolability of borders will also be included  in the Slovak-Hungarian interstate treaty, which is under  preparation.

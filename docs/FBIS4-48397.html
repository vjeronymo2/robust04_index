			<p>BFN     [Text] A report from Malawi says voters are turning out in  their thousands to cast their ballots in [words indistinct]  election. Reports from around the country say that despite the  wintry cold weather, long queues had formed at most polling  booths before they opened, and that the crowds were generally in  a good mood. There were no reports of violence but President  Banda said in a radio broadcast this morning that he had heard  there had been shooting in the southern district of Nsanje. He  gave no details and police would not comment. There have also  been some reports of violations of the electoral code. A  spokesman for the Independent Electoral Commission said it was  requesting that action be taken against the culprits immediately  in the interests of free and fair elections, if it was found  that the election law had been violated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Galina Karelova, chairman of Russian </F> Federation Council Social Policy Committee, by Sergey Karkhanin;  place, date not given: "Integral of Well-Being. Deputies and  Ministers Plan Social Policy for This Year"]    [Text] This term has been encountered so often in the  political rhetoric of recent months that it has come to resemble  an incantation, but we should not be surprised. Given that,  according to sociological polls, "Reforms for the sake of  people, not at the expense of people" is now one of the most  popular slogans, the social dimension of every step taken by the  government is becoming particularly significant. Deputies from  the Federation Council Social Policy Committee together with  Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov and the leaders of a number of  ministries and departments recently discussed the draft basic  guidelines for social policy in 1994. Committee Chairman Galina  Karelova describes the details in conversation with a  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent.    [Karkhanin] Galina Nikolayevna, it is no secret that there  were many such drafts in earlier years too, but they usually  remained only on paper. Does the present document contain any  fundamental differences from its predecessors capable of  providing hope that it will be implemented nevertheless?    [Karelova] The similar drafts that emerged in past years  represented a mechanical summation of uncoordinated "sectoral"  programs, which were very difficult to harmonize. But the  present draft is precisely a package of measures. An attempt  has been made to create an integrated document possessing  integrity and a single linchpin. Obviously, the attempt has not  been a total success, but Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov and his "team"  have done a very great deal of work.    As we completed the preparation of our legislative program,  we deputies needed to correlate our approaches with the  government's and to agree on timetables so that the draft laws  on social policy that Russians are so keenly awaiting could be  more swiftly approved by the Federal Assembly. Moreover, we and  the representatives of the government, endeavored to coordinate  our actions connected with the budget. It is clear that the  fine words about the priority of the social sphere pronounced  from lofty rostrums are no impediment to continued funding of  this sphere on the basis of the notorious leftover principle....    Our deputies particularly noted a fundamentally important  point: A system of state social guarantees expressing in  figures what the minimum needs of each Russian citizen cost has  still not been formulated. I believe that this system has not  been formulated precisely because at present, it is impossible  to provide the money for it, since the state has almost none.  But then, in my view, people should be openly and directly told  what percentage of their needs we can provide for.    Until recently, I worked in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and I know  that the regions are keenly awaiting a law on the minimum  consumer budget, which will make it possible at long last to  determine who should be categorized as belonging to low-income  groups. At present, anybody can categorize themselves as such.  There is no officially approved criterion.... Incidentally, it  will also be useful for enterprises to have a guideline as to  what minimum wage they should provide for their workers.    [Karkhanin] So far we have been talking about approaches,  about the general nature of the draft basic guidelines. Could  you cite a few sections to show what it is like?    [Karelova] One of the most important sections is the one  about policy in the sphere of labor relations. New forms of  ownership have emerged, and hired workers often feel that they  have no rights now that the code of labor laws effectively does  not operate. So the document touches on questions of  remuneration and insurance. The government has prepared a  number of draft laws about the rights of employers and hired  workers. Moreover, a federal employment program has been  submitted to us -- this touches not only on the problem of the  unemployed, but also on the problems of support for small and  medium enterprises via the territories. Tremendous preparatory  work has been carried out here, and the regions in primary need  of assistance have been identified.    [Karkhanin] You mentioned the government's lawmaking  activity, although this role used usually to belong to  parliament....    [Karelova, interrupting] We are not abandoning lawmaking, of  course, but in my view the government's activeness is only to be  welcomed. I already have in hand around 20 draft laws relating  to labor relations, employment, migration, and the environment  prepared by the government. I think it is important for  normative documents, especially those relating to problems of  social protection, to be prepared by those who will have to  fulfill them. Having said that, there is a need for control.  You cannot allow standards to be artificially lowered in the  interests of irresponsibility.    I know that many organizations, both state and public, took  part in preparing these draft laws, and we are prepared to  accept the documents that were discussed as the basis for work.    Separate chapters in the draft basic guidelines relate to  migration policy and social support for those who are unable to  work and low-income groups. Incidentally, our parliamentary  committee will soon receive from the government a blueprint for  pension reform, and the draft law on nonstate pension funds will  clearly be discussed by Federal Assembly deputies as early as  April.    Furthermore, under the present system there are 14 types of  benefits for families with children, and there is a confusing  situation which people find it hard to understand. So the  government is proposing to introduce a clear unified system that  everyone can understand. We support this stance. There is also  the idea of restructuring the obsolete and cumbersome system for  collecting alimony, which has meant unnecessary and often futile  hassle both for the militia and mothers. Together with the  State Duma deputies' commissions, we intend to work on a plan  whereby the rights of the child will be protected by the state,  to ensure that alimony is paid from the state budget regardless  of whether the errant father who left the family without a  livelihood has been found.    [Karkhanin] Nevertheless, the most burning question for most  people today is the income of family budgets. If it proves  possible to implement the draft basic guidelines, how will this  affect people's lives?    [Karelova] The most important point is that their social  rights, including with regard to remuneration, will be better  protected. We will shortly begin to examine a new labor code  which specially notes that delays in paying wages are  impermissible. Various forms of payment were mentioned in the  debates that our deputies had with Labor Minister Gennadiy  Melikyan. If there is no cash, credit cards or promissory notes  can be used. The banks have a whole system for noncash  payments, and better use must be made of these.    Unemployed people are appearing and the problem of  employment  is emerging, and it by no means always has to be solved by  finding someone a new job. For instance, back home in  Sverdlovsk Oblast the "Uralobuv" [footwear] enterprise closed,  although its products were cheap and convenient and were snapped  up for children and pensioners. So for socially important  enterprises that find themselves in difficult economic  conditions, there must be material support from an employment  fund in order to preserve these jobs.    For this reason, the federal employment program includes a  number of sections aimed at supporting not only those who have  already lost their jobs but also those who are employed in small  and medium enterprises, especially those producing consumer  goods. These mainly employ women and young people -- the social  groups who make up around 70 percent of the unemployed.    According to the draft state budget, it is planned to  appropriate around 12 trillion rubles [R] for social purposes --  this is approximately the same level as last year. We believe  that this sum must be increased -- I am talking about the  regions that suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster and  the environmental disaster zones with equivalent status --  Kamensk-Uralskiy, Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk Oblasts, Altay  Kray. Even if expenditure is kept at last year's level, the sum  of R3.8 trillion is needed, but only half of that sum has been  agreed, so we are asking the government to fund the  aforementioned regions at least at the level of 1993.    Clearly, increasing expenditure means increasing the budget  deficit, but our committees and the Duma committees still intend  to make an in-depth examination of a number of issues and  identify where savings can be made. But I think it would be  immoral to making savings out of the calamity that befell the  victims of Chernobyl.    [Karkhanin] Incidentally, how did the debates with  government representatives go at the enlarged sitting of your  committee? What was the atmosphere like?    [Karelova] Each minister spoke about his sector's problems.  This is the information we badly need. We received all the  necessary documents. The debate was very amicable, and we  remain inclined toward businesslike cooperation.    Obviously, the draft basic guidelines along with our  comments  will be approved in the government in the very near future. Our  comments mostly boiled down to saying that insufficient account  was taken of the regional aspect. We Federation Council  deputies have worked in the regions and we know that the state  gets 80 percent of its funds from the provinces. So why does  Moscow dictate to the local authorities how to spend them? This  does not allow the oblasts to solve social questions in an  effective manner. Although the local authorities must become a  real player in social policy.    Moreover, the draft has virtually not been agreed with  nonstate players in social policy. They too should have been  made into allies. One final point -- the programs on most  topics are integrated only in terms of their elements. However,  this is natural: Ministries have always been isolated from each  other.    So it is one of our main tasks to unite. Our deputies'  committee is already setting up an interdepartmental expert  commission that will prepare draft normative acts. So we are  already taking the first steps.</p>

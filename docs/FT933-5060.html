			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Gas break-up 'should be rejected' THE GOVERNMENT should reject the recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a break-up of British Gas, says the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in a report today. 'Other than on purely ideological grounds there appears to be little justification for seeking greater liberalisation of the UK gas market,' it says. A free market would bring benefits to gas producers at the expense of consumers, it says, and would lead to higher prices because of the elimination of cross-subsidisation. Dismembering British Gas would threaten a successful and international company without offering proven benefits. The Oxford-based think-tank says gas consumers are by and large satisfied with the performance of the gas industry, and the benefits from a more competitive market are not clear-cut. Last month the MMC recommended that British Gas be made to divest its gas trading operations by 1997. It also urged the removal of its domestic market monopoly by the year 2002 at the latest. The Department of Trade and Industry will today publish the complete text of the report. However, ministers are expected to take several weeks before deciding whether to accept the recommendations of the report. Competition and Regulation in the Gas Industry.

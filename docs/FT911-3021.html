			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying fails to support Nikkei Tokyo SPORADIC buying by arbitrageurs failed to support share prices yesterday, and the weaker yen and higher bond yields added to the depressed sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell a further 291.35 to 26,038.86 after a day's high of 26,341.85 in the morning, and a low of 26,037.87 just before the close. Volume stayed dull at 380m shares and declines outweighed advances by 787 to 213, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 21.47 to 1,952.56, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.36 to 1,475.42. Traders said investors and dealers liquidating positions before the Golden Week holidays contributed to the weak trend. Miss Benedicte Ivey at Credit Lyonnais Securities said it would be hard for the market to regain strength even after the holidays as long as short-term interest rates remained at high levels. In addition, cash positions related to arbitrage trading were announced to have risen to record highs of Y917bn as of April 19. Traders said this reflected a movement towards derivatives-related transactions, due to the stagnant cash market. Profit-taking took in Sharp, firm on Wednesday on hopes of an upturn in the US economy and which lost Y40 to Y1,540 yesterday, and Tsugami, a machine tool maker, down Y27 at Y823. Big companies lost ground on the outlook for short-term interest rates, Nippon Steel shedding Y5 to Y464 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries weakening Y33 to Y716. Nihon Nohyaku, in agrochemicals, weakened Y160 to Y2,250 on selling by individuals, after a three-day rally on rumours that a speculative group was chasing the issue. But Asahi Chemical saw heavy buying towards the close, gaining Y55 to Y850 on reports that it will acquire Toyo Jozo, a liquor maker, which was unchanged at Y1,140. Akai Electric closed Y59 higher at Y840 after revising its pre-tax profits forecast up from Y1.7bn to Y3bn for the current year. Sony receded Y150 to Y6,350 on reports that it expects to lower earnings projections because of the sluggish US market. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 343.73 to 29,002.98 on volume of 31.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y300 to Y16,100 on margin worries. Roundup THE REGION presented a mixed picture, and a number of themes yesterday. Australia and New Zealand were closed for a public holiday. SINGAPORE buyers concentrated on shipping and electronics, the former regarded as relatively cheap, and with better prospects following the Gulf war. In spite of afternoon profit-taking, the Straits Times Industrial index gained 17.27 or 1.1 per cent to 1,553.94. Turnover increased from SDollars 188.5m to SDollars 229.6m. Hotels and properties showed losses. Electronics moved on speculation that the sector, valued at or below the market average, would be the first to benefit from any recovery in the US or European markets. TAIWAN gained 1.8 per cent, the weighted index climbing 107.08 to 5,913.82 on expectations of lower interest rates to boost the economy. Turnover rose from TDollars 53.6bn to TDollars 68.9bn. SEOUL's turnover nearly halved, from Won180bn to Won 94.8bn, as the composite index fell 6.27 to 626.36. Traders attributed the sharp declines of the past two days to tight local liquidity; companies have dividends and taxes to pay towards the end of this month, and the government's tight money supply has also drained liquidity from the equity market. BANGKOK ended lower, with most sectors, apart from textiles, in decline. The SET index slipped 11.74 to 883.60 in turnover of 4.69bn baht. HONG KONG was described as thin and listless as the Hang Seng index eased 10.91 to 3,594.38. KARACHI, still climbing on economic reform, set new highs for three successive days up to Tuesday, when the KSE index finished 32 ahead at 1,707 in volume up from 4.8m to 8.3m shares, forcing the exchange to close on Wednesday so that brokers could clear mountains of paperwork. It will reopen on Saturday after its regular two-day shutdown yesterday and today.</p>

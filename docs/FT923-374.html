			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Japanese fear rising yen will hurt exports JAPANESE exporters could be badly hurt by the yen's recent rapid rise, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the country's federation of economic organisations, warned yesterday after the dollar had slid to a record post-war low of Y119.65 at its close in Tokyo. Mr Hiraiwa said the break-even point for most Japanese companies was a dollar exchange rate of Y120. Manufacturers could cope with a slow appreciation against the dollar but the government would need to take emergency measures to protect them against a rapid rise in the yen, he said. Mr Hiraiwa was reflecting growing concern that the yen's rapid appreciation could dampen exports, which are one of the few sources of growth in a largely stagnant economy. The yen has strengthened markedly over the past week as investors have sought a safe haven from the turmoil in European currency markets. The dollar was also hit by worries that US employment data due to be published later this week will show the economy is still mired in recession. Government officials meanwhile sent apparently conflicting signals about the authorities' stance. A senior official at the Ministry of Finance hinted that intervention to stem the yen's rise was becoming more likely. However, Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), said most Japanese companies could cope with a stronger yen, which could help to curb Japan's growing trade surplus. Most private-sector analysts believe a further cut in interest rates is unlikely because the government would not resist a gradual appreciation of the yen to about Y115 to the dollar. However it is thought the authorities would intervene to slow the rate of the yen's appreciation. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, underlined this stance yesterday by stressing that the yen's level should be set by market forces. He indicated that the authorities' main concern was that the currency should move smoothly to a new exchange rate. The depressed state of the domestic economy was highlighted by Miti figures showing large retailers' sales fell by 2 per cent last month compared with 1991. Most significantly, supermarket sales have started to fall, by 0.4 per cent last month, suggesting that consumers are starting to cut back on everyday purchases of food and clothing as well as luxury goods. Sales at department stores fell by 3.8 per cent, the sixth successive month in which they have declined. Sales at small local shops, which is where most daily shopping for food and other necessities is done, are relatively robust, Miti said. The ministry's forecasts for steel output suggest there is little prospect of the downturn in manufacturing abating this year, with crude steel production expected to drop by 4.3 per cent in the three months to December, which would be the sixth consecutive quarterly fall in steel output.</p>

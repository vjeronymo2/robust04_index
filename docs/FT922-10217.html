			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Accounts rule change dropped A proposed requirement for companies to list their spending on items such as advertising and training has been dropped from the forthcoming accounting standard on the profit and loss account, it emerged yesterday. The Accounting Standards Board said it would not include so-called revenue investment activities in its second financial reporting standard, which is due out in the autumn. Revenue investment is designed to show expenditure charged to the profit and loss account incurred to enhance profits. It includes spending on research and development, and big maintenance and refurbishment projects. The withdrawal comes after widespread condemnation of the proposal from companies, which claimed that spending on these items was difficult to identify, and that disclosure would threaten their competitive position. But there was also a noticeable absence of support for the idea from users of accounts during the consultation period on the standard, which closed in March. 'We flew a kite but no one seemed to want revenue investment,' said Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board. 'It got a big raspberry. We don't feel this is a big enough issue to make it worth retaining.' In the exposure draft of the standard issued in December, revenue investment was to be disclosed as a separate item in the profit and loss account. The board has instead placed the onus on voluntary disclosure of revenue investment by companies in its operational and financial review, details of which were released in a discussion draft this week. Most items which would have been required under the revenue investment category are not currently disclosed. But companies already have to give some details of research and development spending under the 1985 Companies Act and Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 13. The Institutional Investors' Committee, a body representing institutional shareholders, earlier this week criticised the level of R&amp;D disclosure.</p>

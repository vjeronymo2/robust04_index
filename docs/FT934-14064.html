			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Assignment: The Price of Gold (BBC 2, 7.45) investigates the terrible effects of mercury poisoning on humans and the environment in Brazil's mining villages, the country's poorest regions. Mercury imports have been banned by the government but the valuable income from goldmining has meant far from stringent application of the ban. Auberon Waugh voices his opinions of the Booker Prize on tonight's C4 culture series, Without Walls (9.00). He is followed by Peter Wayne, a long-term prisoner who for 12 years has been researching 18th century architect Thomas Archer. The search to identify the genes responsible for causing certain cancers proceeds apace. In the informative series Cracking the Code: The Cancer Hunters (BBC 2, 9.30), David Suzuki looks at promising research into genes which cause, among other cancers, a rare hereditary form of breast cancer. A new 10-part series, Children's Hospital (BBC 1, 8.00) is about life as it really is on the wards at the Sheffield Children's Hospital. We are promised heart-warming and heart-breaking stories.</p>

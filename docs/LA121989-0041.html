			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE ALLEN EXPECTED TO TAKE LONG BEACH JOB  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach is expected to announce today that former Ram coach George  Allen will accept the football coaching job at the university, a source said  Monday night.  </P> <P> The university has scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Allen met with 49er Athletic Director Corey Johnson over the weekend, but  apparently no agreement could be reached at the time. Salary reportedly was one  problem, since no 49er football coach has ever been paid more than $60,000.  </P> <P> Larry Reisbig, 11-24 in three years as coach at Long Beach, resigned in  November.  </P> <P> Earlier Monday, Allen implied the matter was still open.  </P> <P> "I think I could have helped the school, but I have not accepted the job,"  Allen said from his office at the National Fitness Foundation in El Segundo.  </P> <P> Allen has been away from coaching since 1978, returning only as an assistant  for two weeks this past season with the school he first coached, Morningside  College in Iowa, as part of its 100th year of football.  </P> <P> He last coached in the NFL regular season with the Washington Redskins, going  67-30-1 from 1971 through 1977. His 1972 team lost, 14-7, to Miami in Super  Bowl VII. He also coached two exhibition games with the Rams in the 1978 season  before being fired.  </P> <P> Before going to Washington, he coached the Rams from 1966-70, compiling a  49-17-4 record. His previous college experience included five years at  Whittier.  </P></p>

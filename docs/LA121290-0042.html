			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AQMD ACTS TO ENSURE DUMP'S COMPLIANCE  </P> <P> Regional air-quality officials adopted a measure Tuesday that would enable them  to go to court if necessary to shut down Lopez Canyon Landfill.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District's hearing board voted 3 to 2 in  favor of an order requiring noxious gas emissions and odors to be kept in check  at the controversial landfill, whose operations and alleged health hazards have  been the subject of public hearings over the last year.  </P> <P> The measure essentially copies an agreement already approved by the Los Angeles  City Council and does little more than provide the agency with one extra  document that it could take to a judge to prove that the landfill is violating  environmental rules, officials said.  </P> <P> "Technically, it wasn't necessary but it provides us with a stronger position,  a better enforcement tool in ensuring the landfill stays in compliance," said  AQMD attorney Elliott R. Sernel. "A lot of it is due to the fact that the city  in the past hasn't always acted in the best of faith and we felt it was  necessary to have an additional document as a kind of additional hammer."  </P> <P> Christopher M. Westhoff, an assistant city attorney representing the sanitation  bureau, said he was confident such action wouldn't be needed. He also  maintained that the city-owned dump in the northeastern San Fernando Valley is  operating in compliance with district regulations.  </P> <P> Dissenting were board members William F. Banks and Mark Abramowitz, who said he  voted against the order because it was not strict enough. Banks could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Abramowitz, an environmental consultant, tried to strengthen the measure with  several proposals, including a ban on landfill expansion until any existing  violations have been corrected and the dump has been in compliance for at least  30 days.  </P> <P> But his proposal was rejected in a 3-2 vote, with members Harold Brown, Esther  Lewin and James Joyce in the majority.  </P> <P> Abramowitz said later that he believed the board had been swayed by threats  that the city would file suit if board members tried to impose any conditions  stricter than those agreed to by the City Council.  </P> <P> One additional requirement adopted by the hearing board Tuesday was an order  that the city submit a status report by April 1 on landfill operations and  compliance.  </P> <P> Phyllis Hines, a member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., said "we  were very disappointed the board didn't support" Abramowitz's motion.  </P> <P> "After 36 hearings, we hoped for just a little bit more," Hines said. But she  added that in general, "I feel the board did quite a bit of good."  </P></p>

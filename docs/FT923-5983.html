			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Foreign Affairs: Not Kuwait, but . . . - While the Balkan case differs from that of the Gulf, there is no excuse for western inaction While the Balkan case differs from that of the Gulf, there is no excuse for western inaction 'Too bad Bosnia's got no oil' was the headline on a recent editorial in the Catholic weekly, The Tablet. It encapsulates an argument now fashionable among western liberal idealists. Last year, the argument says, western governments were ready to take military action to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. Their failure to defend Bosnia shows they are guilty of double standards. Western governments can hardly complain. They asked for it by recognising Bosnia-Hercegovina on April 7, and sponsoring its admission to the UN. A month earlier, an FT editorial had warned that 'independence for Bosnia will be meaningless unless the territorial integrity of the republic can be guaranteed': an unfulfilled, and perhaps unfulfillable, condition. The Yugoslav People's Army, as it then still was, was encamped in force on Bosnian territory, with large quantities of heavy weapons. Many of its officers and men were drawn from Bosnia's Serb population, which formed nearly a third of that of the republic. The great majority of Bosnian Serbs had boycotted the referendum on independence. Many were clearly ready to fight rather than obey an independent government that did not include their own leaders. Of course those leaders were influenced by the government in Belgrade, and could expect support from it. But even had that not been so - even if there had been no Serbian 'interference' in the new state's affairs from the moment its independence was proclaimed - the Bosnian government would still have been unable to control much of its nominal territory against the wishes of a minority so large, so determined and so heavily armed. Any attempt by outsiders to help it do so would have meant joining in a civil war. An additional problem was that, although the Croats (17 per cent of the population) had voted for independence, they had done so tactically, to get away from Yugoslavia, rather than because they thought of themselves as Bosnian. In fact, no Bosnian nationality had previously existed. The Moslems had been elevated by Tito to the status of a nationality in their own right; they identified with Bosnia because, once Yugoslavia began to break up into its component republics, they had no other state to call their own. Yet by themselves they made up only 43 per cent of its people. Serbs and Croats between them are 49 per cent, and many Croats want to be part of Croatia. A majority of the Bosnian electorate might even have voted for partition, had that proposition been put to them. That would not have been a solution, since it would have completely ignored the interests of the Moslems. But an independent Bosnia could only have worked on the basis of agreement between the three communities. Oil or no oil, the parallel with Kuwait is false. Kuwait had existed as an independent state for 29 years before Iraq invaded it. Its sovereignty was not questioned by any of its inhabitants, and President Saddam Hussein could not find even a token group of them to 'invite' or support his invasion. Coming to Kuwait's rescue was therefore a very simple matter politically. None of that is true in the case of Bosnia. This being so, the EC would have been much better advised not to recognise that state until an agreement between the three communities had been worked out. The still unexplained thing is that it went ahead with recognition while negotiations for an agreement were in progress, without waiting for their outcome. Stranger still, it was apparently the US which insisted on recognition, although earlier it had opposed German pressure for recognition of Slovenia and Croatia*. None of the above in any way justifies or excuses the Serb reaction, which has been to displace the Moslem and Croat population from the greater part of Bosnia-Hercegovina by a campaign of mass terror. Nor can the Serbian leadership in Belgrade escape a large share of responsibility for this, even if the extent to which it directly planned and co-ordinated the crime remains, for the moment, unclear. Nor yet can the 'international community', that much-quoted but still elusive phenomenon, wash its hands of the affair simply because it is so complex. It makes no difference to assert that atrocities have been committed by all sides, or that some of the more spectacular mortar attacks on Sarajevo have been staged by the Bosnian army to arouse international sympathy. Those assertions may be true, but do not alter the fact that by far the largest number of victims are Moslem, and the largest number of perpetrators Serbian. Bosnia is not Kuwait. But it is perhaps a little bit like Iraq, with its three unequally matched communities condemned to live together. In both countries western governments have been reluctant to get involved militarily, especially with ground troops, for fear of being caught up in an insoluble communal conflict. In both cases their reluctance has been partially and temporarily overridden by pressure from public opinion, outraged on humanitarian grounds, and by alarm at the scale of the refugee problem. Troops did go into northern Iraq last year to secure a 'safe haven' for the Kurds; and now troops are being sent into Bosnia to protect humanitarian convoys. It might make more sense if the Iraqi precedent were followed more precisely. There, the ground troops went in for a limited period and came out again, using the threat of air strikes to deter Mr Saddam from attempting to reverse what they had achieved; and now a similar threat is being used to protect the Shia in the south as well. Why not declare an 'exclusion zone' in Bosnia as well? And, rather than expose UN troops to an escalating conflict in Serb-held territory, why not use western troops, as in Kurdistan, to secure a 'safe haven' for Bosnian Moslems, who could then hold it for themselves with a promise of western air cover, while negotiating with the other communities from a position of relative strength? Such a policy would encounter the same objection as the one in Iraq: that it tends towards a fragmentation of the country. That objection would probably be voiced especially by the Moslems themselves, who (unlike the Kurds) were scattered throughout the country and therefore have an interest in keeping it together. Yet the reality is that after what has happened they will not for a long time, if ever, be able to live with the Serbs as they did in the past. Even the pro-Bosnian 'Yugofax' magazine admits this, in a telling report from Sarajevo: 'B-H's ethnic tolerance is rapidly being eroded. It is true that 20 per cent of Sarajevo's defence forces are still Serb and the majority of Serbs ignored Karadzic's call for them to attack their neighbours. But those who did respond have caused so much torment that they have created an anti-Serb atmosphere which did not exist in B-H even during world war two. For the ordinary citizen it is hard to grasp that while all Chetniks (extremists) are Serbs, not all Serbs are Chetniks.' That being so, the only imaginable future for Bosnia-Hercegovina is one based on cantons or 'constituent units'. The proper goal of western action, both military and diplomatic, is a haven or canton large enough for all the Moslem population to live in. * See Michael Brenner, Les Etats-Unis et la Crise Yougoslave, in the latest issue of Politique Etrangere.</p>

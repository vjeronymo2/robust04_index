			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "European Election Opinion Poll: </F> Baudis at 32 Percent, Rocard at 19 Percent"]    [Text] According to a Louis Harris poll commissioned by LE  JOURNAL DE DIMANCHE, the UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally  for the Republic] election list headed by Dominique Baudis would  win 32 percent of votes cast, down by 3.5 points. In the  previous Louis Harris poll, Dominique Baudis' list had been  given 35.5 percent of voting intentions. Michel Rocard's  Socialist list has risen two points to 19 percent (from 17  percent). Bernard Tapie's MRG [Movement of the Radical Left]  has risen one point to 10 percent (from 9 percent), while  Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front has risen one-half point to  also stand at 10 percent. Next come Philippe de Villiers'  "Other Europe" list and the PCF [French Communist Party] list of  Francois Wurtz with 7 percent. They are followed by [former  Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement's "Alternative Policy"  list, whose score remains unchanged at 4.5 percent. Brice  Lalonde's Ecology Generation list also remains stable at 3.5  percent, ahead of its ecologist rival, the Greens, led by  Marie-Ann Isler-Beguin, which is down two points from 4 to 2  percent. This poll was carried out by telephone on 19 May using  a national sample of 1,013 people.</p>

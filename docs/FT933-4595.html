			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptionals behind Hillsdown fall SHARES IN Hillsdown Holdings rose 7p to 172p yesterday, although the food group announced that pre-tax profit fell 17 per cent, from Pounds 74.8m to Pounds 62.3m, in the six months to June 30. Hillsdown blamed the drop in profits on higher interest costs and said last year's figure had been flattered by exceptional profits. Sales of continuing operations increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 2.23bn, mainly because of the acquisition of a continental chilled salads business last year. Sir John Nott, the former cabinet minister who took over as chairman in April, said the group's restructuring was expected to be completed ahead of schedule and on budget, but would not produce early results. The group expects to sell its eight remaining abattoirs and two meat plants by the end of the year, completing its withdrawal from the red meat slaughtering business. More than half its property trading portfolio has been sold and the group expects to get out of this business more quickly and at better prices than initially expected. Mr David Newton, chief executive, said reorganisation in the poultry business was almost complete, with the weekly output of chickens having been cut from 3.5m birds to 2m. Mr Newton said Hillsdown had coped with the difficult trading brought on by devaluation, which increased its raw material prices by up to 15 per cent. It still faced difficult trading conditions but he forecast higher operating margins from most divisions in the current half, as a result of having achieved higher prices and the restructuring. The chief executive said the biggest disappointment in the first half was a weak performance by the European tea and beverage operations. Fierce competition for market share and a big jump in the costs of imported raw materials had reduced profitability. The businesses were being merged under a new management team, which would bring small reorganisation costs this year but help performance in future years. The non-foods division, which includes housebuilding and upholstered furniture, had seen few signs of improvements in its markets but several divestments had increased operating profits and margins. Under FRS 3, earnings per share fell to 5.1p (6.4p). The group, which has one of the highest yields in the market, held its interim at 2.2p and intends to maintain the full-year dividend at 8.8p.

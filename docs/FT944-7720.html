			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Czech utility to issue eurobond CEZ, the Czech electric utility, will become the first east European corporation to launch a eurobond next week, marking the region's growing access to international debt markets. J. P. Morgan, the lead manager, is marketing the Dollars 150m five-year issue on a roadshow and is expected to begin selling next Monday or Tuesday. A rating of BBB-minus from Standard &amp; Poors and CEZ's status as the only investment-grade east European borrower point to aggressive pricing at about 100 basis points above treasuries. CEZ is a special case in being the largest quoted company in central eastern Europe, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.95bn. While market commentators do not expect CEZ to start a rush of east European companies to the bond markets, the issue does indicate a trend. Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank of Hungary, the first bank - rather than corporation - to tap the euromarkets, this week launched its second eurobond. The DM150m seven-year issue was run by Bayerische Landesbank of Germany, the Hungarian bank's minority shareholder. On the syndicated loan markets, Ceskoslovenska Obchodn Banka and Komercn Banka of the Czech Republic set new benchmarks for east European borrowers by achieving pricing of 70 and 65 basis points respectively above Libor. A benchmark for both the CEZ issue and to some extent the landmark syndicated loans was the City of Prague's Eurobond issued earlier this year, which trades at 85 basis points above treasuries. Investment bankers expect other utilities to follow CEZ's lead. The two banks which have dipped into syndicated loans are also understood to be considering borrowing on the public market. Poland's recent agreement with its creditors clears the way for its companies to borrow long-term and internationally. First, however, the Republic of Poland has to make its return to the debt markets with a planned five-year eurobond deal. CS First Boston, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all US investment banks, are on the shortlist to manage the transaction and a decision is believed to be imminent.</p>

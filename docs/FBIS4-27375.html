			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-hun, professor of industrial economics </F> at Chungang University in Seoul]    [Text] There have recently been a series of relevant  testimonies by North Korean defectors and also a news report  about President Kim Il-song's request to a foreign country for  food aid. With this as momentum, the widespread rumor about  North Korea's difficulties in food supply has turned out to be  true, thereby arousing the general public's great interest.  Because we also had much difficulty at one time in the  seventies and in the early eighties, we all know well that North  Korea's food shortage is not of the nature that we can just  gloat over. This is because that issue is, rather than the one  that should be seen from a political or military viewpoint, a  prerequisite to the maintenance and development of human  survival and is a task that should be solved together with a  compatriotic love.    This notwithstanding, the statistics about food are still a  secret to the outside in North Korea. We are at a loss on how  to help because the truth cannot be known, and the reality is  that we cannot do anything because we might touch a sensitive  matter of taboo.  <H5>  The Food Situation in North Korea Veiled in Mystery </H5>   The only official statistics about North Korea's food  situation is the record of production of food crops which North  Korea is reporting on a regular basis to the United Nations Food  and Agriculture Organization [FAO] every year. It is  internationally acknowledged that the reliability of this report  is that it is only for reference. To sum up the data reported  to FAO, as seen in table one, North Korea recorded grain  production in 1992 at a level similar to that of 1991. In terms  of roughly refined grain, the production break-down follows: 5.8  million tonnes of rice (4.18 million tonnes in terms of finely  refined rice--about 29 million sok [one sok equals about 5.12  U.S. bushels]); 200,000 tonnes of wheat; 4.5 million tonnes of  corn; 460,000 tonnes of beans; and 200,000 tonnes of barley and  others grains. The volume of all these total as much as 11  million tonnes in terms of roughly refined grain production.  This is an enormous volume amounting to about eight million  tonnes in terms of finely refined grains. Even without the  volume of 2.5 million tonnes of potatoes, including sweet  potatoes, this means that North Korea has already been in a  chronic glut of food crops. But, the grain production volume of  North Korea is too high when compared with 1992's grain  production of no more than 5.97 million tonnes in South Korea  which has many more rice paddy fields than the North--though the  size of the total arable land of South and North Korea is  roughly the same. In other words, this means that North Korea's  per capita grain consumption is as much as 365 kg -- 65 kg more  than the maximum average volume an adult can consume annually.  Even considering its stockpiles for an emergency, North Korea,  with a population of 23 million people ought to have exported  annually about 1.5 million tonnes of grains over the past two or  three years.    In terms of finely refined grains, aside from rice, this  means that every person of North Korea's whole population  consumed about 182 kg of rice in 1992 thanks to that year's  production of as much as 4.176 million tonnes (29 million sok),  a 13.7 percent increase over 1983 when the production was no  more than 3.672 million tonnes (25.5 million sok). This amount  is as much as 70 kg more than South Korea's per capita  consumption of about 182 kg the same year. Considering that  North Korea is producing annually as much as 4.5 million tonnes  (as reported to FAO) of corn, its second most important food  staple next to rice, this is construed as meaning that rice, its  primary food staple, is in rampant excess everywhere in North  Korea.    Therefore, the details of North Korea's food statistics  which  are veiled in mystery are incoherent. The FAO is quite at a  loss as to this data under the circumstances in which it has to  compile and make public such statistics about grain production.  Even if the organization dispatches an investigator to North  Korea, then, it would also face the difficulty of making a  confirmation. Thus, it is just printing out annual reports as  received.    Under these circumstances, we can never expect anyone, if he  is not an expert, to make a comparative analysis as seen above.  On the contrary, most of amateurish North Korea researchers are  faced with a dilemma in this regard. They cannot but trust FAO  statistics, and cannot, either, flatly negate news reports about  North Korea's food shortage. By the way, an event, which can be  said to be "revolutionary," took place inside FAO this year.  FAO has made public statistics about 1993's food  production--though tentative--, about which official reports  have not been compiled yet, on the basis of an estimate which is  calculated to be 22.4 percent lower than 1992. FAO made public  data of rice production by lowering the volume by 33 percent.    Statistics compiled by ROK research institutes are also  different from one another, and have only added to the confusion  because they differ from data compiled by U.S. CIA's satellites.    In order to avoid such confusion, the National Unification  Board [NUB] has recently had the Office of Rural Development  experiment in doing farming as patterned after the reality in  North Korea, thereby making public data for a general study,  which are relatively close to the reality.    Therefore, according to the "present status of North Korea's  economic situation" compiled and released by the NUB on 21  August, 1993, with the help of a relevant agency, North Korea's  gross grain production, in terms of finely refined grains, was  4.81 million tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27  million tonnes in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993, showing  a large gradual decrease. Outwardly, these figures show a  remarkable difference in annual production by about as much as  3.5 million tonnes from North Korea's report to FAO.    According to the estimated statistical figures released  by the NUB, in 1991-1992 alone North Korea was short of at least  1.3 million-2.3 million tonnes of provisions. Meanwhile,  according to the recent data released by the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development and the International  Monetary Fund (CHOSON ILBO dated 29 April 1994), North Korea  imported 649,000 tonnes of grains from China and 177,000 tonnes  from Turkey during 1992. In addition to this, North Korea also  seems to have imported 250,000 tonnes of grains secretly from  the United States during the same year. In other words, this  means that North Korea imported a total of slightly over one  million tonnes during 1992.    However, the estimated amount of North Korea's harvest in  1993 showed a shortfall of 400,000 tonnes over 1992. As a result  of this, it is apparent that North Korea's food situation in  1993-1994 has become more serious. In view of such a situation  we cannot sternly say that some North Korean defectors' remarks  revealing that even some stockpiled rice for military use was  released and supplied to civilians as an emergency step and that  it has become impossible even to take such a step now are  totally groundless. Now North Korea also suffers from a shortage  in foreign currency and so, it cannot afford to purchase for  cash grain from foreign countries. It has relied only on its  import of grant-type grains from China.    With the recent increase in the number of North Koreans who  are escaping from North Korea via China and Russia it has become  no longer possible for North Korea to conceal its food shortage.  Furthermore, in recent years North Korea has begun to almost  openly purchase grains from foreign countries in an effort to  maintain stability in its political system in the wake of the  power transfer to the Kim Chong-il system.    Until 1990 North Korea had carried out trade on a barter  system with China by giving rice to China and taking corn of  greater quantities of its rice from it. However, afterward North  Korea began purchasing in earnest rice and corn from Thailand,  the United States, Canada, Australia, and Turkey. However, as  mentioned above, North Korea has relied on imports of grains  mainly from China since 1992.  <H5>  North Korea's failure in agriculture is caused by its </H5> political system    In 1991 and 1992 the North Korean authorities reported to  the  FAO that they had achieved a bumper crop in these years.  However, the food situation in these years and in 1993 was so  bad that food was not distributed to residents on time and that  collective resistance took place in some regions as a result.    In sum, it is evident that North Korea's food situation has  become more serious particularly in recent years, and the  people's complaints are mounting. Riced corn, which is made of  corn flour, has appeared as a rice substitute, and corn noodle  appeared as a wheat noodle substitute. Even noodle mixed with  powdered herb roots and tree bark has appeared in North Korea  today.    Chinese and Korean residents in China should bring their own  food and foodstuffs with them when visiting North Korea. People  carrying flour bags on their heads or backs are a common sight  at border check points.    The main cause for the worsening agricultural and food  situation of North Korae lies in the natural, physical, and  technological restrictions in North Korea.    As Karl Marx said, "the productivity of agricultural labor  is  closely linked to natural conditions." In view of this, North  Korea is definitely unfavorable than South Korea in terms of  natural and physical farm conditions. However, we cannot say  that North Korea is unfavorable compared to the three provinces  of Northeast China which are located north of North Korea.    Therefore, the natural and physical factors cannot become  the main cause of North Korea's agricultural failure. Denmark's  agriculture which has developed by cultivating a desert,  Israel's agriculture which has been built on swamps and barren  land, Switzerland's agriculture on mountain-side terraced  fields, and Netherlands' agriculture on the sea have created a  miracle and evoked the world people's admiration despite their  unfavorable conditions.    The main cause of the low productivity of North Korea's  agriculture should be found in the shortcoming of its  agricultural management system. In other words, the problem of  North Korea's agriculture lies in its centralized planned  economy which cannot properly adapt itself to the rapidly  changing natural, environmental conditions and in its uniform,  collectivist economic system. It is difficult to expect a  substantial technological revolution in agriculture through  North Korea's present system of ownership by all of the people  and its collectivist cooperative system of agriculture --which  have ended in failure in former socialist countries--and through  the repeated emphasis of the so-called chuche farming method.  In particular, it is also difficult to whip up the production  will of farmers by repeatedly stressing the ideological  revolution and the cultural revolution among them without giving  incentives to their production efforts as we see in the  capitalist economy.  <H5>  Agricultural exchange between the North and the South is </H5> urgently needed    North Korea has relatively favorable circumstances and  conditions in solving the basic problem of its "continuous  poverty." In the early seventies, North Korea's potential  strength surpassed that of the South Korean economy. In other  words, North Korea's foundation for material growth and human  capability, that is, its labor force, cannot be underestimated  even today. North Korean agriculture's scientific and  technological level of is not inferior to that of any developing  countries. North Korea's plant breeding and farm cultivation  technology, too, have reached a considerable level. The  foundation for mechanization of the production system of  chemical fertilizer, as well, are fairly good. The problem is,  however, that a key mechanism which can combine these factors  into one and vitalize them, is necessary. In other words, this  means that an incentive sysrem based on the market economics  should be introduced.    In light of the fact that the rate of self-sufficiency in  food supply in South Korea remains at the 30 percent level and  that agriculture is the most vulnerable field of the South  Korean economy, it is necessary for the North and the South to  seek mutual cooperation in agriculture, including the exchange  of agricultural technology and capital.    The most serious problem in South Korea's agriculture is  that  it is losing international competitiveness in the prices of  agricultural products due to the high prices of agricultural  labor forces and the increase in land prices. In other words,  the only problem that South Korea is faced with today despite  the fact that it has capital, technology, plants, and  high-standard agricultural labor forces, is the lack of  international competitiveness in the prices of agricultural  products.    Such being the situation, strengthening cooperation in  agriculture with North Korea which has basic material and human  foundations for agricultural development can, I believe, open a  new horizen in South Korea's agriculture.

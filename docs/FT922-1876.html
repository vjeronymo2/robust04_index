			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Raids start with home arrests POLICE began yesterday's events with carefully co-ordinated early-morning raids on three homes in expensive parts of London - Chelsea, Hampstead and Belgravia. For Mr Kevin Maxwell, at his home in Chelsea, it was a highly public arrest. Journalists had been tipped off and were waiting outside his four-storey home when six detectives working with the Serious Fraud Office arrived in two cars. It was the media presence that led his wife Pandora to mistake the police for journalists. Soon after 7am, Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian, who had been arrested at his home in Belgravia, arrived at Snow Hill police station in the City of London in separate cars. About an hour later, Mr Larry Trachtenberg arrived at the same police station after his arrest at his Hampstead home. In another raid during the morning, five plainclothes officers from the Serious Fraud Office went to the City office in Wardrobe Place, where Mr Kevin Maxwell had been working. The officers entered the office at about 7.30am and left at 10.40am, taking with them several sacks filled with documents and computer equipment. Two secretaries arrived at about 9.30am and remained in the building during the raid. They were joined there by a solicitor an hour later. Two lawyers representing the Maxwell family also arrived and stayed inside the building during the raid. In Oxford, life appeared to be carrying on as normal inside Headington Hill Hall, for 32 years the Maxwell family home. Mrs Betty Maxwell, widow of Robert Maxwell, still lives in the 29-bedroom Victorian mansion, but there was no sign of her. She has not been seen on the estate for a few days. A former employee, who has recently been acting as her chauffeur, is on holiday in the US. Two of the 23 Pergamon Press journalists dismissed by Robert Maxwell three years ago kept a vigil outside the automatic security gates. Pergamon Press, the company around which Mr Maxwell built his empire, is still based on the estate but is owned by the Dutch publishing group Elsevier. Two of the sacked Pergamon Press workers, production editor Mr Howard Waller, 27, and editorial assistant Mr Chris Tighe, 25, sat in deckchairs at the back of a Ford Transit truck outside the only entrance to the 14-acre estate. They watched as a steady flow of couriers brought manuscripts from Pergamon's authors. The Royal Mail will still not pass the National Union of Journalists' picket line to enter the estate and mail is collected each day from the sorting office by Pergamon staff. In the early morning, police visited the country home of Mr and Mrs Kevin Maxwell, Hill Barn, a converted barn on an isolated hill at Hailey near Wallingford in Oxfordshire. Items were taken from the house in a polythene bag. A few minutes later, three men, accompanied by another who appeared to be the keyholder, were let into a locked double garage across the gravel yard. They searched one of the garage units but emerged after 15 minutes apparently emptyhanded. The team, who said they were from the City of London police, drove off shortly before 10am on their way back to London.</p>

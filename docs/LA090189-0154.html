			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH CUTS PANAMA TIES AS NORIEGA ALLY TAKES OFFICE;  </P> <P> U.S. VOWS TO TIGHTEN FUNDS HOLD  </P> <P> The United States today cut diplomatic ties with the new Panamanian government  backed by Manuel A. Noriega, branding it an outlaw regime and vowing to tighten  the financial screws on it.  </P> <P> "The United States will not recognize any government installed by Gen. Noriega.  Our ambassador will not return and we will not have any diplomatic contact with  the Noriega regime," President Bush said in a statement.  </P> <P> Bush made the announcement in Washington as Francisco Rodriguez was sworn in as  provisional president in Panama City.  </P> <P> By citing "the outlaw Noriega regime," Bush summoned up one of the dominant  phrases used by U.S. diplomats to describe how the Noriega government would be  treated if the military leader refused to leave by today.  </P> <P> Noriega, indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida 18 months ago, is also  accused by the State Department of giving haven in the past to drug dealers  from other Latin American countries.  </P> <P> Bush said the United States will take other steps, "including the tightening of  measures to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the Panamanian  people . . . and to counter the threat posed by Gen. Noriega's support for drug  trafficking and other forms of subversion."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects Support  </P> <P> The President did not specify what financial actions the United States will  take against Panama but said he is confident that other countries would take  similar measures to support human rights, democracy and self-determination and  to fight drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Until today, Washington had recognized the government of President Eric  Delvalle even though he had been removed from power in a February, 1988, coup  and had been living in the United States.  </P> <P> Delvalle, respecting the limits of his constitutional mandate, closed the  Panamanian Embassy in Washington Thursday, handing it and more than $300  million in Panamanian assets over to the United States for safekeeping.  </P> <P> The winners of May 7 elections had been scheduled to take power Sept. 1, but  the Noriega-controlled government annulled the elections after reports of a  sweeping victory by opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara.  </P> <P> "On May 7, the people of Panama, by an overwhelming margin of votes, braved  repression, intimidation and fraud to choose democracy over dictatorship. . . .  But this act of self-determination was brutally repressed before the eyes of  the entire world," Bush said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lacks Legitimacy  </P> <P> "Panama is, therefore, as of this date without any legitimate government," the  President said.  </P> <P> Administration officials have said Washington, despite breaking relations, will  keep open the U.S. Embassy in Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command is  located.  </P> <P> If the break in relations continues, it will block the United States from  taking crucial action called for in the Panama Canal treaties. Under the  treaty, which calls for the United States to hand over the canal to Panama by  the end of the century, the U.S. Senate must approve a Panamanian-appointed  administrator for the canal by the end of 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Dividing the House of Beazer: Why the group is floating its UK operations Mr Brian Beazer has been characterised as an empire builder who turned a small family housebuilding operation into a large international business and mortgaged the company to pay for it. This week the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive of Beazer construction group proposed to sell off some of the family silver to reduce the group's large debts  - the result of its free spending on acquisitions. On Tuesday, Beazer announced plans to float off its UK housebuilding, contracting and property businesses. It would then sell up to half the shares in the new company, raising up to Pounds 250m in the process. Beazer would be left owning a large US aggregate, cement and concrete business, as well as a bare majority interest in a separately quoted company holding its UK and other European operations. The funds would be used to reduce the group's large US borrowings, most of which were raised to support the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1bn) acquisition of the Koppers cement and aggregates business in 1988. Mr Beazer put a brave face on things yesterday: 'Our primary duty is to maximise the return for our shareholders. We believe our proposals will do that and raise cash at the same time.' They mean, however, that Beazer's strategy of building a transatlantic business, based on property and contracting in the UK and building materials in the US, has come off the rails. No matter what gloss the directors put on the proposal, they would not be planning it unless they had been forced to do so by an overriding need to raise cash and reduce the strain on Beazer's balance sheet. The group's last annual accounts, for the year to June 30 1990, showed net debts of Pounds 880.5m, compared with shareholders' funds of just over Pounds 1bn. Debt has fallen since then. However, interest payments of Pounds 40m during the six months to the end of December were only twice covered by operating profits of Pounds 80m. Interest cover could reduce further during the six months to June 30, the end of Beazer's financial year. Other UK housebuilders have warned that profits will fall steeply during the first six months of this year. Profits in the US may also have declined. Beazer has had a meteoric rise. It has grown from a Bath-based housebuilder with turnover of less than Pounds 20m in 1979 into a multinational business with annual sales in 1989-90 of more than Pounds 2bn. Beazer is Britain's fourth-largest housebuilder and the second-largest aggregates producer in the US. It achieved this status through a rapid series of acquisitions, financed in the mid-1980s through the issue of large amounts of Beazer paper. Between 1983  - when Brian Beazer became chairman and chief executive  - and 1988, the number of shares issued by the company rose from 12m to 300m. By the mid-1980s investors had become disenchanted with the amount of paper being issued. A Pounds 183m rights issue by Beazer in the autumn of 1986, to support the acquisition of Gifford Hill, the US cement group, was less than three-quarters subscribed. Beazer had little choice, therefore, but to finance the purchase of Koppers through debt  - initially in partnership with a consortium of bankers led by Shearson Lehman of the US and National Westminster of the UK. Beazer subsequently bought out the interests of its partners, taking all of the debt for Koppers on to its own balance sheet. Borrowings remain uncomfortably high, despite the sale of the Koppers chemicals business and disposals of some of the Gifford Hill cement businesses. The group has forecast that net debt will fall to about Pounds 750m by the end of June  - equivalent to about three-quarters of shareholders' funds. The group's options to reduce borrowings are constrained. It is doubtful whether a rights issue could succeed given the company's current financial position. UK shareholders  - familiar with the company's previous record on issuing paper  - might be reluctant to support such a move. There would also be technical difficulties in calling on support from US investors, who account for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of Beazer's shares. The alternatives, therefore, are to sell hard assets in weak construction markets in both the UK and US, or to offer minority stakes in one of the group's main businesses. A year ago Beazer raised the prospect of floating off parts of its US operations, including Koppers. This idea has clearly been found wanting. For a start, the group would be trying to sell a stake in a business with large amounts of debt. The UK operations, by comparison, are currently very lightly borrowed. A price for Koppers might also be reduced by fears of possible future claims for environmental damage. The claims could arise from Koppers' former ownership of the chemical business for which Beazer has already made provisions of Pounds 300m. The sale of a stake in the UK business is probably the least undesirable option considering that the group needs badly to reduce its debts. A sale only to existing shareholders would be the equivalent of a rights issue, anyway. Beazer also retains the option to sell some of the stock in the UK company to new shareholders. There is also merit in the argument that the current market capitalisation of Beazer  - the share price yesterday fell from the year's high of 185p to 178p  - substantially understates the value of the group's assets. There has never been any criticism of the underlying quality of the businesses bought by Beazer. The problem has been that the company has been unable to deliver the returns necessary to justify the level of debt raised to acquire the new operations.</p>

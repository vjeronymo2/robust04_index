			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist  Party (CPC) today urged continuous and concerted efforts to put  out the forest fire in the Hulun Buir League (prefecture) of the  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    In his note to a report on the forest fire, Jiang Zemin, who  is also the president of China, said: "I hope you will make an  all-out effort, plan meticulously, issue careful directions,  unite and coordinate steps and fight consecutive battles to put  out the fire as soon as possible so as to make contributions to  protecting the forest resources of the state."    The two fires started seven days ago. One is in the western  section of the forest, which was reported to have been brought  under control. The other is in the eastern and southern parts  of the forest, which is still blazing, due to strong winds and  difficult terrain.    The fire fighters, mainly forest police, armed police,  border  police, men of the People's Liberation Army and local people,  are still fighting the fire.</p>

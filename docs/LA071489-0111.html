			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TICKET SALES FOR KEN HILL'S 'PHANTOM' ARE HALTED IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim halted ticket sales Thursday for Ken Hill's  "The Phantom of the Opera," following a threat of legal action by the  producers, who have claimed the sales are unauthorized.  </P> <P> H. Yale Gutnick, the attorney for the Phantom Touring Co., said the theater had  done "a substantial amount" of business in advance ticket sales. "We don't know  how many tickets they've sold because we are not getting good information from  them," Gutnick said Thursday from his office in Pittsburgh, Pa., "but our  conservative 'guesstimate' is in the neighborhood of $100,000 at least."  </P> <P> Celebrity Theatre officials have failed to respond to repeated inquiries from  The Times, which reported Wednesday that Hill's "Phantom" would not be coming  to the theater.  </P> <P> The musical comedy -- a version of the "The Phantom of the Opera" that inspired  Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical -- has been advertised by the theater for a  December engagement without authorization for several months, Gutnick said. He  was scheduled to speak with theater officials Thursday and said he would demand  that all ticket purchases be refunded.  </P> <P> A box-office clerk said Thursday that ticket sales had been discontinued that  morning.  </P> <P> Klaus Kolmar, the New York booking agent for the show's coming national tour,  said earlier this week that the theater had been negotiating for the show for  several months but had never concluded a contract. He said the producers  required a deposit in the "low five figures" and that the theater "never  deposited 2 cents."  </P> <P> Moreover, Kolmar said, the producers of the tour had rejected both the  theater's seating capacity and the five-day engagement that Celebrity officials  have been advertising because "it was inadequate for the production." "The  potential gross did not make any sense," he said.  </P> <P> The theater's full-round configuration has a capacity of 2,500 seats. It would  have to be transformed into a proscenium setting for the show, reducing  capacity to about 1,500 seats. Kolmar said the show needs between 1,800 and  2,500 seats to turn a profit in a limited run.  </P> <P> Hill's "Phantom" will play the the 2,198-seat Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles  (Nov. 20 to Dec. 3).  </P></p>

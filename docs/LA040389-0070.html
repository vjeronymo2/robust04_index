			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Brokerage Search Ruled Legal: A federal judge has ruled a four-day search of  Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.'s headquarters was legal and that federal  prosecutors may keep the thousands of documents they seized. U.S. District  Judge Zita L. Weinshienk denied a motion by attorneys for Blinder, who sought  to have the documents returned to the investment firm. She said Blinder  Robinson's attorneys failed to prove that a November search of the firm's  Englewood, Colo., offices by 26 federal agents was unnecessary. Agents from the  Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission converged on  the headquarters Nov. 19 as part of a Las Vegas-based investigation into  international stock fraud and money laundering.  </P></p>

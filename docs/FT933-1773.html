At the operating level, profits grew 4 per cent to Pounds 1.93m. before interest charges of Pounds 34,000 (Pounds 195,000). Earnings per share rose to 6.4p (5.8p) and an increased interim dividend of 1.8p (1.6p) has been declared. Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said trading in the second half was expected to show more satisfactory growth. The baby products side in particular, would benefit from significant Christmas gift orders already received and confirmed. Rainbow Acrylics - an importer and distributor of melamine and acrylic children's tableware products acquired in July - was unlikely to have a material impact on this year's results. Net borrowings at the half year were Pounds 841,000 (Pounds 2.84m) giving gearing of 9 per cent (36 per cent).

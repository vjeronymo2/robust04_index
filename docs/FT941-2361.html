			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Main parties lose out in German local elections Both Germany's main political parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats, suffered setbacks in yesterday's local elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. Fears of voter apathy and gains for extreme right-wing parties proved unfounded, with a 70 per cent turnout of the 2.1m voters in Germany's northern-most state. The main beneficiaries of the swing against the big parties were the environmentalist Greens and a series of local interest electors' groups in the 1,100-odd council elections. The poll, the second of 19 elections to be held in Germany this year, offers the first sign that the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), as well as the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is facing a backlash among electors. It also suggests that predictions of a rise in the far right wing may have been exaggerated, with protest votes going instead to the Greens. The first firm projection last night, issued by the state statistical office 2 1/2 hours after the polls closed, gave the SPD 38.7 per cent of the vote, down 4.2 percentage points on its total in the 1990 local elections. In elections for the state parliament, held in 1992, the party won 46.2 per cent. The CDU failed to overtake the SPD in the polls, according to the projection, but lost less support: the party was set to gain 37.6 per cent, down 3.7 percentage points from 1990. The Greens saw a clear pick up in votes, from 6 per cent in 1990 to 10.6 per cent last night, according to the forecast. In contrast, the Free Democratic party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's junior partner in the Bonn coalition, had another bad night, down from 6.1 per cent four years ago to 4.8 per cent yesterday. Far-right parties like the Deutsche Volksunion (which gained entry to the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament with 6 per cent support in 1992) and the Republicans only put up candidates in a few towns yesterday and failed to make any significant showing. Independent electors' groups, including the party for the Danish minority living in the north of the state, picked up support and seats on a number of councils. The SPD was expecting a backlash in the poll, following the resignation last year of Mr Bjorn Engholm, its state premier and national party leader. The party suffered a particularly sharp drop in support in Kiel, the state capital, falling 12 points to 39.3 per cent, while the Greens more than doubled their vote from 7.3 to 15.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Chemring advance lifts shares 55p THE CITY responded favourably to Chemring Group's announcement of a 10.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.72m to Pounds 5.21m in the year to September 30. The shares climbed by 55p to 883p. Mr Philip Billington, chairman since January 1 of this industrial holding company with interests in the defence, marine, leisure, environmental and engineering markets, said that the group aimed to 'increase its level of civil business to approximately 60 per cent of overall turnover by 1996'. Turnover rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 37.9m (Pounds 34.5m). This rebalancing was at the behest of the City, and he said it would probably be achieved via a large acquisition in marine, aviation or engineering. However, he said he was irritated by the tendency to lump Chemring with defence companies like Vickers. 'We don't suffer like the hardware companies do. Our products come out of revenue spend not capital spend.' At present, the defence business accounts for about 53 per cent of turnover. Mr Billington said there was currently a record number of ships being built worldwide. That had helped the commercial marine business to grow, though the leisure marine side had declined. Trials for Protox, the secondary sewage treatment process, should be completed by April, he said. He hoped to sell the plant and further, to sell the by-product granules into the agricultural and horticultural markets. The group is proposing a share split to increase the liquidity in the market for the shares. Three 5p shares will be issued for every 5p share held and this will be achieved by the capitalisation of about Pounds 600,000 of the share premium account. A recommended final dividend of 21.72p (19.75p) will make a total of 32.62p (29.65p), payable from unchanged earnings of 68.6p per share.</p>

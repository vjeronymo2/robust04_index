			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Down to one room instead of all Russia NEVER CLOSE, the two men who lead the defence of the Russian constitution have now fallen to argument as the relentless pressure of being cooped in a giant jar in the middle of Moscow strips away their reserves of tolerance. General Alexander Rutskoi, 46, acting president with no country to govern and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, 51, leader of a parliament abolished by fiat, insist they will never surrender. But beyond that, they have little to do with each other. They have not appeared together before their supporters outside the White House for days. Mr Khasbulatov's unequivocal prediction at 2.00am yesterday morning that an attack would come at dawn was later flatly contradicted not just by events, but also by Gen Rutskoi - though he thinks an attack is imminent. One of his advisers, asking not to be named, said yesterday the acting president was infuriated by Mr Khasbulatov's obvious assumption that the latter was the leader of the resistance - evinced most recently by a remark made by the parliamentary leader to the deputies that he would 'tell the acting president to see to it'. The acting president has risen much better to the occasion than the parliamentary leader - the former drawing on his military bearing and discipline, and a theatrical, occasionally almost absurd, populist style. On Sunday he vowed to 'stay to the death' after touring the White House with a megaphone demanding of the indifferent riot troops that they 'remember their oath to the fatherland and the constitution'. Later, he led a few thousand of the defenders, a ragged-trousered army, round the building, its various Soviet, Russian Imperial and St Andrew's Cross flags flying bravely. Mr Khasbulatov has not so responded. Most effective when commanding the split and formless parliament, he is not fitted to the public gesture. At a press conference yesterday, he fell back on repetitions of 'there will be no compromise - it is not for us to compromise with this criminal regime - the only compromise is a restoration of the constitution', mixed with irrelevant anecdotes and bad jokes. He maintains an impressive calm, but at the expense of coherence. 'I don't know what Khasbulatov and Rutskoi are doing together there in the dark,' said Mr Yeltsin in a television interview at the weekend, with confident suggestiveness. Yesterday, his deputy chief-of-staff, Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, said that 'if the law doesn't judge them guilty of some criminal act, they can decide their own fate'. President Yeltsin and his team have already consigned them to oblivion, and that may indeed be the fate of two men, not old for politicians, who rose dizzily from, respectively, the positions of an Air Force colonel and a professor of economics to challenge the president of Russia for power. For Mr Khasbulatov, sharp tongued and by nationality a Chechen (one of the north Caucasian tribes), there is little support. For Gen Rutskoi, a Russian, a decorated Afghan veteran and an obvious patriot, there will be more. Thus it is to him that Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a candidate for president and a self-appointed go-between, went with advice to drop his 'no surrender' stance and attempt to negotiate himself out of the jam. 'I have asked the other (presidential) side not to drive Rutskoi into a corner,' said Mr Yavlinsky. 'He said he would consider my words, but I think he's not taking his own decisions.' In Mr Yavlinsky's view - and it is a common one of Gen Rutskoi - he is an outwardly impressive but shifting figure, with no strong convictions and thus prey for powerful or unscrupulous advisers. That cannot be said of Mr Khasbulatov who, whatever his limitations, goes his own way. For mixed motives of ambition, belief and hatred, both men had found themselves ground below the stone of Mr Yeltsin's new-found determination to be rid of his enemies. If there is a way out 'with dignity', it is a small one and it is closing fast.</p>

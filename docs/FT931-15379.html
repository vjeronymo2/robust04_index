			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Part-time work for managers increasing PART-time work is making inroads into managerial jobs and seven out of 10 private-sector companies have at least one part-time manager, according to a survey published yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Part-time work has traditionally been concentrated in junior service-sector jobs. Of the 5.7m part-timers in the UK, only 2.3 per cent (136,000 people) are classified as managers. If public-sector professionals (mainly teachers) are included, the proportion rises to 7.6 per cent, still low compared with some Continental countries. The survey of more than 100 companies found that the trend is growing, especially among women managers with children in service-sector businesses in the south-east. The survey says employers have found that productivity gains and savings from the retention of trained staff makes employment of flexible managers a 'good deal' for them. It also finds plenty of scope for more part-time work among managers, but warns that part-timers are less likely to be promoted. Job sharing, where two managers share responsibilities, is comparatively rare. Most employers and managers prefer individuals in self-contained jobs to work between two and four days a week. Two and three-day patterns are more common in retailing, while general services financial services and hotels use part-time managers most. There are more than twice as many women part-time managers as men, with most men concentrated in the 65-69 age group and in the financial services sector. Many women do not have children - 54,000, compared with 76,000 who do.</p>

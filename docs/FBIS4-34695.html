			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the scheduled 3 October  general elections in Brazil.  <H5>  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN </H5>   Interior Votes To Decide Elections -- The elections this  year  will be decided by the voters living in the interior of the  country, and not by those in the capitals. A study conducted by  the Superior Electoral Board (TSE) shows that 70 million of the  voters who will elect the new president live in the interior,  and only 20 million in the capitals. The study was based on  data collected during the 1993 plebiscite. The study indicates  that Sao Paulo, with the largest number of voters in the  country, has nearly 22 percent of Brazilian voters, and Minas  Gerais, the second largest, about 12 percent. The TSE believes  that more than 100 million people will vote in the 3 October  elections. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 May 94  p 9)    Main Presidential Candidates View Unemployment -- The four  main presidential candidates have commented on their plans to  fight unemployment. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers  Party (PT) candidate, wants to build agricultural villages and  cooperatives, invest $25 billion in projects to create jobs, and  build huge warehouses where small entrepreneurs can set up their  industries without having to pay rent. Democratic Labor Party  (PDT) candidate Leonel Brizola wants to register unemployed  people and update the data on how many they are, grant  incentives and technical assistance to micro and small  enterprises, create new temporary jobs in public construction  work, and invest Severance Pay Fund and Workers' Assistance Fund  resources to create jobs and incorporate 8 million families into  the job market. Progressive Renewal Party (PPR) candidate  Esperidiao Amin wants to create 10 million new jobs in five  years by making the micro-enterprises more dynamic and by  granting incentives to agriculture, agro-industry, exports, and  tourism, and by implementing a "Program to Fight Unemployment."  Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) candidate Fernando  Henrique Cardoso proposes creating 8 million jobs by defeating  inflation, which will result in an increase in governmental  resources, a reduction in taxes on salaries, and the possibility  of allocating more funds to professional training and irrigation  programs. Cardoso believes that these programs alone will create  nearly 2.7 million direct and indirect jobs over the next four  years. Finally, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB)  candidate Orestes Quercia promises to invest in the  infrastructure, but has not yet defined his goals and does not  want to reveal his financial means. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in  Portuguese 5 Jun 94 p 3)    PDT Convention Participants Polled -- A Datafolha poll  conducted among the members of the PDT convention held on 29 May  shows that 53 percent of them approve of a PDT alliance with the  PMDB; 41 percent an alliance with the Brazilian Labor Party  (PTB); 13 percent with the PSDB; an equal number with the PT;  and 10 percent with the PPR. The poll also shows that if Brizola  is not elected in the first round of elections, PDT members will  support Lula (27 percent), Fernando Henrique Cardoso (20  percent), none of them (44 percent), and 8 percent still do not  know whom they will support. Asked whom they would support if  they had to choose between Lula and Quercia, 43 percent would  choose Quercia, 24 percent Lula, 26 percent neither of the two,  and 8 percent remain undecided. If the choice had to be between  Quercia and Cardoso, 43 percent would support Quercia, 26  percent Cardoso, 24 percent neither of the two, and 7 percent  are undecided. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 31  May 94 Section 1 p 4)    Lula Gains Support in Bahia State -- The Bahia office of the  PSDB and the PT reached an agreement on 1 June that can benefit  Lula: The PT withdrew the candidacy of its candidate for the  Senate, Zezeu Ribeiro, and added its support to the PSDB ticket.  The PSDB candidate for the Bahia governorship, Jutahy Magalhaes  Jr., believes that this alliance will give Lula more than 1  million votes and increase support for him by 20 percent to 30  percent of state voters. In his first rally in Bahia, which is  scheduled for 2 July, Lula will already be accompanied by  Magalhaes. Lula believes this agreement will reduce the PSDB  presidential candidate's possibilities. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA  ESTADO in Portuguese 2156 GMT 1 Jun 94)    PT Congressional Candidates Threaten to Rebel -- Forbidden  to  participate in Lula's rallies, the PT candidates for federal  deputy have threatened to rebel against the PT national  coordinating board that is coordinating the presidential  campaign. Deputy Chico Vigilante, Federal District, said that  the PT leadership is comprised of "a bunch of stupid  bureaucrats," and he fears that the prohibition is harming  Lula's candidacy. Deputy Helio Bicudo, Sao Paulo, also  protested the decision. When Lula visited Brasilia at the  beginning of June, only gubernatorial candidate Cristovam  Buarque and vice presidential candidate Paulo Bisol were allowed  to participate in the rallies organized there. Rio Grande do  Sul Deputy Jose Fortunatti, PT leader in the Chamber of  Deputies, harshly criticized the decision. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA  ESTADO in Portuguese 2331 GMT 16 Jun 94)    ACM Support Not Helping Cardoso -- The latest polls  conducted  in Bahia State show that despite Antonio Carlos Magalhaes'  support of PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, only 13 percent of the people support him, while 54  percent support the candidacy of the PT's Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva. This is the lowest level of support for Cardoso  countrywide. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94  p 6)    Cardoso Campaign in Financial Difficulties -- The Liberal  Front Party (PFL) leader in the Senate, Marco Maciel, has  complained about the financial difficulties being faced by PSDB  presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso's electoral  campaign, the cost of which has been estimated at $75 million.  Maciel said that the new electoral legislation seeking to  ensure the openness of political campaign financing is  frightening entrepreneurs who had planned to contribute to  Cardoso's campaign. The PSDB-PFL-PTB coalition was the first to  request campaign bonuses at the Superior Electoral Board. The  requested bonuses amount to 10 percent of the overall cost of  the campaign. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2156 GMT  13 Jun 94)    Poll Shows Cardoso's Voters Hesitating -- A poll conducted  by  the Gerp Research Institute indicates that PSDB presidential  candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso's supporters are the most  hesitant: 37.1 percent of them may switch their support to  another candidate before the 3 October elections, while only  23.4 percent of PT candidate Lula's supporters and 27.4 percent  of PDT candidate Brizola's supporters would do so. The poll,  which was based on interviews conducted with 3,213 people during  the first week in June, shows that 36 percent of voters support  Lula, 17 percent Cardoso, 7 percent Brizola, 5 percent PMDB  candidate Quercia, 3 percent the PPR's Amin, while only 1  percent support Liberal Party presidential candidate Flavio  Rocha. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2036 GMT 14 Jun  94)    Quercia Registers as Presidential Candidate -- PMDB  President  Deputy Luiz Henrique registered his party's presidential  candidate, Orestes Quercia, for the 3 October elections. The  PMDB estimates that its electoral campaign will cost $58.5  million. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2202 GMT 8 Jun  94)    Polling Companies To Register at Electoral Board --  Companies  conducting polls on the electoral preferences of Brazilians must  register at the Superior Electoral Board. They must also  include in their reports, among several other things, the name  of the person who requested the poll, its cost, who financed it,  the methodology used, and the period during which the poll was  conducted. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1748 GMT 13  Jun 94)  <H5>  STATE CAMPAIGNS </H5>   Front Created in Sao Paulo -- On 1 June the PT made official  in Sao Paulo the Popular Brazil Front, which supports Federal  Deputy Jose Dirceu's gubernatorial candidacy. The coalition is  comprised of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB); the People's  Socialist Party (PPS); the Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B);  the Unified Socialist Workers Party (PSTU); the Brazilian  Communist Party (PCB); and the National Mobilization Party  (PMN). During the ceremony the candidacy of the PT's Antonio  Galdino for the Sao Paulo vice governorship was also made  official, as were the candidacies of Luiza Erundina (PT) and  Joao Hermann (PSB) for the Senate. The Front will present 141  candidates for the Sao Paulo Legislative Assembly, and 71 for  the Chamber of Deputies. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in  Portuguese 2330 GMT 1 Jun 94)    Poll Shows Support of Rio's Gubernatorial Candidates -- The  Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute released on 14  June the figures of a poll, requested by the PSDB, on support  for Rio de Janeiro's gubernatorial candidates. The figures  indicate that Marcello Alencar is supported by 31 percent of the  people, Jorge Bittar and Anthony Garotinho by 14 percent each,  Newton Cruz by 6 percent, and Milton Goncalves by 5 percent.

These candidates are affiliated to  13 different political parties. The favorite candidate, however,  is former Social Security Minister Antonio Britto, the PMDB  candidate, who will probably be elected governor. In Minas  Gerais State, five party conventions were held during the  weekend of 28-29 May. During these conventions the names of  several gubernatorial candidates were defined. Governor Helio  Garcia presented former Belo Horizonte Mayor Eduardo Azeredo, of  the PSDB, as the candidate to succeed him. Former Education  Secretary Walfrido Mares Guia is the candidate for vice  governor. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 31 May 94 p  7)    Alagoas Convention Ends at Police Precinct -- The PFL  convention in Alagoas State, which was held on 28 May, ended at  a police precinct because Deputy Jose Bernardes, the party's  former president in that state, pressed charges against PFL  Secretary Roberto Mendes, who disappeared with the book of acts  right after the end of the convention. According to Bernardes,  the book is in the hands of Godofredo Palmeira, brother of  Senator Guilherme Palmeira, vice presidential candidate on  Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket.

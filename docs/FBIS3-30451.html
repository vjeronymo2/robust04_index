Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which emerged victorious at the  Russian recent parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the  Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few  breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the  Czech Republic."    Lebedev said that Zhirinovskiy's views did not reflect any  official or semi-official line, but were his own opinions.  Judging by his statements, it can be said that Zhirinovskiy  knows the rules of the "propagandist game" that the more  extravagant and wild are the ideas expressed the greater  attention they attract. "And this is what he needs. So let us  take this with humour," Lebedev said.    He said he did not have information so far about  Zhirinovskiy  being prepared to visit the Czech Republic. Lebedev pointed  out, however, that Zhirinovskiy is travelling to the states in  Russia's vicinity. "We shall see what his plans are, but I know  nothing about them thus far. However, if he were to decide to  visit the Czech Republic, given his statement that in Czech  breweries the beer will turn bitter, it would mean that he would  try to drink some good beer in time," Lebedev said.</p>

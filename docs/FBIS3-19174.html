			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures has called  for an emergency meeting of the Supreme Military Council (SMC)  before the potentially explosive Nevroz festivities and the  local elections.    The meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 18 but  military sources told the Turkish Daily News on Tuesday [8  March] that the date may be rescheduled by a day or two "but  will definitely be held before March 21," the day the Nevroz  festivities are to be held. In the past, separatist Kurdish  terrorists have used the festivities to wreck [as published]  havoc in southeastern Turkey.    The unprecedented meeting is designed to pinpoint the  assessments of the leading Turkish generals and admirals  regarding the Southeastern problem and to convey the military's  views to the National Security Council (NSC), which will convene  under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel on March 30  after the local elections.    The Supreme Military Council meets twice a year according to  the law to discuss strictly military matters. However, the  chief of staff also has the authority to call for an emergency  meeting of the council which is chaired by the prime minister.  The presence of the prime minister is usually only a formality.  The prime ministers open the military council meetings and then  leave the generals and admirals to deliberate amongst themselves.    Political observers say it is meaningful that the council,  which normally meets in December and August, is being called to  an emergency meeting only a few days before Nevroz and about a  week before the local elections.    They say this will mean the military leaders will discuss  the  outstanding issues and reach a consensus to be conveyed to the  civilian authority.    According to the law, the military council is only charged  with "presenting the views of the military" and handling  promotions and retirements of officers. However, the law does  cover a broad scope of issues on which the military can present  its views.    The law says the military can do the following: disclose its  views on the determination of military strategical concepts to  be developed by the general staff and the reassessment of these  concepts; to disclose its views on the main programs and targets  of the military; to comment on the laws, statutes and  regulations concerning military matters; and to air its views on  various military issues seen fit by the minister of defense, the  chief of staff and the prime minister.    The law does not mention "internal security" as an issue to  be discussed by the military council, yet as the Army is charged  with handling security matters in southeastern Turkey, this  situation entitles the military to discuss the problem within  the context of the "military strategic concept," according to  observers.    Besides the prime minister and the chief of staff, the  members of the military council include the defense minister,  the commanders of the Land, Navy and Air forces, the Gendarmerie  commander, the commanders of the First, Second, Third and Aegean  armies, the commander of the fleet, the commander of the war  academies, the commander of the NATO Southeastern Allied Land  Forces, the secretary-general of the National Security Council  and, last but not least the second chief of staff. As most of  the leading commanders cannot participate in the National  Security Council meetings they can air their views on the  "protection of the integrity of the state, of the unity of the  country and measures to preserve calm and tranquility in Turkey"  at the military council meeting.    Under normal circumstances the military council cannot  discuss security issues regarding the nationwide local  elections, yet as the military units are charged with restoring  law and order in southeastern Turkey along with police forces,  the commanders can discuss this issue as it is allowed to debate  all issues that concern the military.    It is known that the military wants the government to  legislate a new wide-ranging anti-terrorism bill and is  disturbed with the delays. The military council which can voice  its views on laws concerning the military may officially convey  its concern to the civilian authority on the delays regarding  the anti-terrorism law.    There is also talk that the military council may discuss the  need for the proclamation of martial law in the troubled  southeastern provinces, especially in view of the expected  violence during the Nevroz celebrations. If a majority of the  generals and admirals press for martial law, the council may  convey such a request to the Supreme Military Council meeting at  the end of the month soon after the local elections. Martial  law can be proclaimed by a request from the Supreme Military  Council.    The Cabinet then convenes under the chairmanship of the  president and proclaim martial law for a period not to exceed  six months.</p>

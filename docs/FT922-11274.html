			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Leading Article: A strategy on asylum FOR ALL their local difficulties caused by economic slowdown, the rich industrialised countries are now, more than ever, havens of peace and stability for fugitives from troubled parts of the world. Even a recession-hit island cannot insulate itself from the trend. Britain registered 45,000 applications for political asylum last year. Although making up less than 10 per cent of all asylum requests in western Europe, the UK figure was 10 times as large as in 1988. The British government saw a political need for action. Last November it set out legislation to toughen significantly the conditions for foreigners requesting refugee status. After the Asylum Bill ran into a torrent of criticism from churchmen, lawyers and the United Nations, the government toned down some aspects, and then abandoned efforts to push the legislation through parliament before the general election. This was a wise decision. An attempt to rush through the measure, ignoring objections that it was neither just nor practicable, would have looked like crude expediency. When the bill makes a renewed appearance in the Queen's Speech on May 6, the government can make maximum use of the calmer post-election atmosphere. It should take full account of criticism that the bill, particularly by greatly restricting appeal procedures, could have turned away refugees with a genuine case for protection from persecution. Only then will parliament be able to vote through new measures with a clear conscience. Backlog of cases There is no doubt of the general need throughout the west for measures to improve screening of asylum applicants and speed up processing. Britain has a backlog of 60,000 undecided asylum cases. This not only clogs up the system, but also prevents attention being focused on the most vulnerable. Bureaucratic inefficiency has provided loopholes for unscrupulous applicants to request asylum in several different names, enabling them to lodge multiple claims for social security benefits. To combat fraud and speed verification of claims, the Home Office has increased its processing staff 12-fold since 1988. Tighter administrative procedures since last autumn have already had a substantial effect in reducing abuse. As a result of closer checks into bogus asylum requests, the government now admits that last year's figure of 45,000 applications was inflated. Over-recording The full extent of the asylum 'phantoms' is not yet known. But a drop of more than half in the number of UK applications in the first three months this year gives an idea of the scale of last year's statistical over-recording. Had the government this spring pushed through an unnecessarily draconian bill on the basis of application figures now known to have been exaggerated, the result would have been a travesty. As it is, the government now has the opportunity to think again before a new bill becomes law, either in the autumn or in summer next year. There is a strong case for western governments to harmonise regulations for dealing with asylum-seekers. The feature of the Asylum Bill allowing introduction of finger-printing - in line with the position in all EC countries except Ireland - is clearly sensible. If asylum is to be preserved, its credibility must also be maintained. For this reason, those seeking a better economic life must be distinguished from those motivated by fear of persecution, however arbitrary that distinction may sometimes appear. But for economic refugees, too, a policy will have to be found, one that allows at least some immigration. More important, however, is the need to give hope to people in the places where they now live. If western governments are unwilling to open the door to goods from developing countries, they are likely to face flows of people instead. A more generous economic policy would be thrice blessed: it would enrich those who offer greater opportunities for trade; it would enrich those who receive them; and, by alleviating poverty, it should also help reduce the political instability and oppression that creates seekers of political asylum.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Senshu University professor, Kimihiro Masamura: </F> "Create `Fair Society' Through Economic Reform: Do Comprehensive  Reform of Tax System; Changing Tax Burden Requires Public's  Trust"]    [Text] 1. Economic reform" is the next priority task, even  for the purpose of completing "political reform," so, regardless  of how the framework of the coalition government may change, the  new cabinet has the responsibility to place before the Japanese  people the prospect of building a society which has a sense of  security and a sense of fairness.    2. Reform of the tax system is essential, but it is a  question that should be be raised as one part of a package of  economic and social policies aimed at creating administrative  reform and a welfare society.    3. What is required now will be self-evident if we fix our  eyes on the future and study in a thorough and concrete manner,  and the foundation of unified policy for the coalition  government will also be found in this.  <H5>  Success or Failure of "the Economy" Is the Very Thing That </H5> Will Influence Evaluation    The Hosokawa cabinet was short-lived, but it accomplished an  important advance by "political reform." We have finally begun  to discern the end of "postwar politics." But, bearing the  legacy of "postwar politics" on their backs, politicians are  running about in confusion, and the Japanese people still do not  know what meaning politics can have for them, or what it would  be best to demand of politics. The new government also had a  troubled beginning.    There is no need to reject "postwar politics" in its  entirety, but we cannot respond to the demands of the times by a  posture which merely clings to the slogans of the past as though  they were "magic charms." If one says "protect the  Constitution," one has a responsibility to show in detail what  kind of policies will be effective for the purpose of giving  life today to those principles of pacifism (independent  participation in international peace), liberal democracy  (protection of human rights and freedom), and social democracy  (guarantee of the social rights which form the foundation of a  welfare society) which are incorporated in the Constitution.  Political parties of which the form in which they would like to  make the Japanese nation and society in the future is not  visible have no reason to exist.    The end of Japan's "postwar politics" is linked deeply with  the "end of the postwar period" in terms of world history, which  is shown by the conclusion of the cold war and the decline of  American leadership. Japan is an economic superpower which  accounts for 15 percent of world GNP. Japanese must bear a  commensurate responsibility for preservation of the earth and  the survival of mankind. That is essential, not for the sake of  the people of other nations, but for the sake of Japanese  themselves.    Japan, which became the final nation to succeed at 20th  century industrial civilization, must shoulder a leading role in  grappling with a task in terms of human history, the conquest of  20th century industrial civilization.    There is a strong possibility that, in contrast to Japan's  international responsibilities growing ever heavier, the  vitality of Japan's economy and society will, rather, go on  declining rapidly. Japan is approaching a time of great change.  The number of children is declining, and aging is progressing  more than previous estimates. The working age population (15-64  years of age) will soon begin to decline, and because of  problems in education, there is also concern about the "quality"  of the human resources that will be provided. Japan is  confronting "a crisis in the possibility of the continuation of  society itself."    First of all, "political reform" is not a goal in itself.  The  goal is to prepare conditions for political structure and  political entities by which it will be possible to form  agreement on policies to deal with important tasks at home and  abroad. It is natural that the Hosokawa cabinet raised  "economic reform" as the next task following "political  reform," and preached the necessity for administrative reform,  deregulation, decentralization of authority, and so on. We  must bring to an end, not only "postwar politics," but the  "postwar economy" as well.    Transforming the "postwar" administrative system, which was  formed by carrying on the legacies of the promotion of industry  and increased production since the Meiji era and of wartime  control, is an important key to "economic reform." Unless the  prospect is shown of creating, through "economic reform," a  society with a sense of security and a sense of fairness, the  public's interest in politics will not increase, and dialogue  between politicians and the public concerning policy will not  develop. "Economic reform" is also essential for "political  reform."    For politicians to abandon their efforts toward "economic  reform," and engross themselves in the changing alliances among  political parties can only be described as a self-destructive  act. I would like them to recognize that the success or failure  of "economic reform" is the very thing that will be the greatest  factor in determining voters' evaluation of the politicians of  the coalition governing parties.    There is great significance in the fact that the Liberal  Democratic Party lost control of the government, and that the  structural obstacle of politicians and bureaucrats joining  together to prevent reform was removed. The significance of the  "Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] versus non-LDP" setup will  disappear if self-destruction of the LDP advances, but for the  present it is better not to allow the LDP to return to power.  The LDP should probably elaborate its policy plan for returning  to power after it has seriously examined the ideological and  structural defects of its past reign.  <H5>  First, Put Japan on the Track of Stable Growth </H5>   Administrative reform and tax reform are also not ends in  themselves. One cannot be certain what form administration,  government finance, and the tax system will have unless one  makes clear what the government will do for the sake of the  future. In the period of LDP rule, the "backward-looking  elimination" called "reducing the budget deficit" and "doing  things in such a way that government does not become too big"  was dominant. The LDP lacked a doctrine of a welfare society,  and even had a tendency to criticize Keynesianism and the  welfare state, so its conservative policy ideas were too strong.    When the Hosokawa cabinet took office a "future-oriented,  goal-oriented" debate was finally seen even on administrative  reform. It is important that conciousness has become stronger  of wishing to create a system in which one can do on a priority  basis things which the government should do in order to improve  the "quality" of life, build a foundation for social stability,  and strengthen security for old age.    At the same time that we simplify administration by  eliminating "guidance" and "regulation," and promote  decentralization of authority, we must strengthen such social  rules as fair trade, environmental preservation, and labor  standards, and the function of such things as urban planning.  What should probably be demanded of the central government and  of local governments is that they abandon the senseless  scattering of money and adopt positive initiatives to establish  reliable social welfare programs and promote regional welfare.    Before inauguration of the new cabinet, the parties which  make up the coalition government tried to identify the items of  their agreement on basic domestic and foreign policies.  Governments exist precisely for the purpose of executing a  series of policies, so when new problems are raised or there is  a change in prime ministers, it is natural that the government  try to strengthen the coalition's foundation by identifying  anew the items of policy agreement. Increasing the  opportunities for dialogue on policy is also an important way of  putting an end to "postwar politics."    Regardless of how the framework of the coalition may change,  the basic tasks of the government will not change. Many people  point out the ideological disunity of the parties that make up  the coalition government, and predict that conflicts will  surface every time they discuss policies in a concrete manner,  but the tasks that Japan is confronting are important, so what  the government must do will reveal itself if the government  fixes its eyes on the future and studies in a concrete manner  what it must do now.    The reason why conflict among the governing parties looks  serious is that many political parties and politicians are  prolonging the "postwar politics" in which ideology continued to  exert a great influence. Discussion of policy will not deepen  the conflict among the coalition governing parties; one should  probably say that rejection of policy discussion will expand the  conflict.    I hope that efforts will be made to demand thorough debate  on  policy, both among the governing parties of the coalition and  between governing and opposition parties, without fearing  policy debate. I think this is also one of the Hosokawa  cabinet's important lessons of August. It should probably be  said that it cannot be helped if, in the course of such debate,  there emerge political organizations or politicians who are left  behind by the times and abandoned by the public.    I have previously written in this column (dated 5 January)  on  the basic tasks of economic policy, so I will not repeat much of  it, but, first of all, it is necessary to realize stable growth  for the Japanese economy. We are now in a period of transition  from "moderate growth" to "low growth," and even growth on the  level of 3 percent will not be difficult if adjustment of  corporate and household resources progresses. For that reason  also, it is necessary to increase the reliability of Japan's  economic system and the government's medium and long-term  economic policies.    Second, such things are needed as priority allocation of  resources for the purpose of dealing with extreme aging by  strengthening such social welfare as custodial care and  nurturing, improving the housing and living environment and  building a foundation for future expansion. Administrative  reform which includes decentralization of authority and  relaxation of regulations will be an essential precondition.  Third, it is necessary to make clear the revenue source support  for those positive measures.  <H5>  Organize a Working Committee To Restudy the Tax System </H5>   Reform of the tax system is an unavoidable task, whoever may  be in charge of the government. Government finance is in a  structural crisis, and it is clear clear that there a limit to  depending on direct taxation. An increase in the rate of the  consumption tax is essential, even as a measure to provide  funding for reductions in such things as income tax and  residential tax which have already been decided on. But it will  probably be necessary to give consideration to the following  points in regard to reform of the tax system.    First, is the fact that it is necessary, to not treat tax  reform independently, but present it as one link in a  comprehensive "economic reform" program as a policy package.  Unless a start on administrative reform and reform of  government finance is shown, efforts toward a welfare society  are made concrete, and the prospect of a life in which a sense  of security and sense of fairness are guaranteed becomes clear,  many Japanese will not be able to understand the necessity for  reform of the tax system. And it would also result in the  scoring of points by irresponsible political parties which  pander to the public by calling only for opposition to raising  taxes.    Public pledges which do not show the backing of necessary  sources of revenue are no more than irresponsible political  propaganda; in order to change the public's tax burden, there  must be public confidence in the effectiveness and fairness of  the government's policies as a whole. For a government to  propose only a change in the public's tax burden, without  indicating in detail what the government will do for the people,  would be a foolish policy. It would be impossible to gain  agreement for something on the level of tacking on a vision of  welfare, without showing the prospect of reforming  administration and government finance as a whole.    The use to which the tax increase will be put is not the  only  thing that will be asked, it will be asked whether  administration and government finance as a whole will be made  over into something effective. The government will probably  have to show the public its determination to use administration  and government finance as a whole in a priority manner to  enhance national welfare, rather than clinging to patchwork  methods like "taxes for specific objectives."    The second is the fact that an overall restudy of the tax  system itself is needed. Japan's current tax system has become  much too complicated because of the piling up of "stopgap  measures" since the Shoup recommendations, so transparency has  been lost, and fairness has been impaired. In addition to the  present pressing task of tax reform, within the year, which  includes measures to fund tax reductions which have already been  put into effect, it is probably necessary to set a definite  deadline and organize a working group for the purpose of a  sweeping restudy of the tax system.    In order that the working group not become a body for  adjusting competing interests, it will be made up of only a  small number of experts who can be trusted; it is necessary to  commission theoretical and technical study under the terms that  it comprehensively cover national and local taxes, taxes and  social insurance premiums, and benefits and enforcement.</p>

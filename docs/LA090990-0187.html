			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCELING EGYPT'S $7-BILLION DEFENSE DEBT  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein, with the enthusiastic support of his people, is causing the  civilized world billions of dollars in defense and related expenditures.  Starting with the first day of the invasion of Kuwait the American people have  been forced to pay higher prices for gasoline, and within a short time other  goods and services were more expensive.  </P> <P> Our taxes will reflect the military expenditures for this insane adventure of  Hussein.  </P> <P> It would only seem fair that the United Nations seek reimbursement so that all  its members can be paid for the proportionate share of this project. Iraq is  one of the largest oil-producing countries. After a successful conclusion, the  American people and their allies should see concrete evidence as a result of  Iraq's reparations in lower gasoline prices and lower taxes.  </P> <P> We should contact President Bush, our congressmen and U.S. senators at this  time to make plans for reimbursement to the American people and the entire  civilized world.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. RHEE  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Funds to follow fashion - High income and emerging markets are the current favourites. Are they attractive? IF THERE is a dominant investment theme of the moment, it is the desire for investors to get a decent income. Years of high inflation and high interest rates have led most investors to regard 'decent' as being more than 10 per cent. The problem, with base rates at 6 per cent, is that it is hard to get a double digit income without taking some risks. As we reported last Saturday, Fidelity, a leading fund management group, has written to the regulators expressing concern about a number of products which appear to offer a high level of income, but which may well just be paying back the investor's capital. A classic example of this kind of product was launched this week by Life Association of Scotland, which is offering an income of 10.1 per cent (net of basic rate tax), paid quarterly for five years. What is the snag? Like previous products from Acuma or Save &amp; Prosper, LAS does not promise to return your original capital. It will only do so if the FT-SE 100 Index grows at 8.75 per cent per annum over the next five years. It does guarantee that the total of your income payments, plus what is left after five years, will at least add up to your original investment. In other words, if you invest Pounds 10,000, you will get Pounds 4,870 in interest over five years, and if the FT-SE Index does not grow you will get Pounds 5,130 of capital back. There are a couple of things to note here. The first is that the interest payment equates to Pounds 974 a year, not the Pounds 1,010 which one might naturally expect to get if offered 10.1 per cent on Pounds 10,000. This is because an income paid quarterly is deemed to 'compound up' at a higher rate than income paid annually. Secondly, the guarantee offered is very similar to that available from other products, which promise stock market growth or your money back. The LAS product just parcels up the same return in a different way. Investors should realise that if the guarantee comes into play after five years, they will have lost out. If they had kept the money in the building society, they would have earned interest on top of their original capital. The product is really only a good deal if investors get their capital back as well as the interest payments. How likely is this? LAS calculated that, in all the five year periods, from 1984 to the present day (ie Jan 1, 1984 to Jan 1, 1989, Jan 2, 1984 to Jan 2, 1989 and so on), the average growth rate has been 9.59 per cent. So a target of 8.75 per cent, it argues, is not too steep (as with many other products in this field, investors get no credit for the dividend yield on the index, but LAS's calculations allow for this). But if the index rises by more than 8.75 per cent per year, investors will get no credit for the excess. Provided investors understand all the nuances, this is not a bad product (higher rate taxpayers should note that the yield for them falls to 8.6 per cent). The concern is that people look at the income figure and do not bother to read the rest. To avoid these problems, LAS says it asked Lautro, the life industry regulator, for an opinion on its promotional material. The brochure certainly does explain the risks; potential investors should make sure they read it in full. Another very fashionable area of the moment is emerging markets, the stock markets of developing countries; we reported on the launch of a Govett investment trust last week. Kleinwort Benson is also launching a trust in the area but it claims a more 'scientific' approach to emerging market investment. Asset allocation is more important than stock selection, says Kleinwort, since analysis shows that two-thirds of the movement of an individual stock price can be explained by the change in the general level of the emerging market. Kleinwort also says that many of the current emerging market indices are too heavily weighted towards individual markets (particularly Mexico and Venezuela) and are thus very volatile. It favours a more balanced index, where weightings are equally spread and regularly rebalanced to allow for market movements. The new trust will follow a number of rules. It will never have more than 10 per cent in any one emerging market; if a market has risen by more than 50 per cent in the preceding year, the trust's maximum weighting will be 7.5 per cent; if a market has fallen by more than 50 per cent in the previous 12 months, the trust's minimum weighting will be 2.5 per cent. Kleinwort says its disciplined approach has worked for its offshore Emerging Markets fund, which has risen 22.8 per cent since launch in February 1992, compared with a rise of 12.8 per cent in the IFC Composite index (the standard benchmark for emerging markets) over the same period. The new trust will be launched on July 2. Shares will be offered at 100p each, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000.</p>

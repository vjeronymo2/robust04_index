			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / People: GEC Alsthom - Bray to manage largest division Kelvin Bray has been appointed managing director of GEC Alsthom's power generation division, created this month to allow the Anglo-French company to respond more effectively and rapidly to changes in the world market. In his new role Bray, right, one of the best-known names in Europe's gas turbine industry, is running by far the largest of GEC Alsthom's divisions, which the reorganisation has reduced in number from seven to five. Consequential appointments remain to be made, although GEC Alsthom did say that Wilhelm Heitmann would continue running the boilers and environmental systems activities. Bernard Dufour, former head of the old electromechanical division, has left to join Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer. Bray, 59, has spent more than 30 years in the gas turbine industry, and was appointed to the management board of GEC Alsthom in 1990.</p>

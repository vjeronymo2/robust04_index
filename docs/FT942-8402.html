			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Conrad Black cuts his stake in The Telegraph Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, has cut its stake in The Telegraph, holding company of The Daily Telegraph, from 66.2 per cent to 57 per cent. However, Hollinger indicated that it was committed to retaining control of The Telegraph and had no further plans at this stage to reduce its stake further. With the proceeds from this sale, totalling about CDollars 152m (Pounds 73m), Hollinger has more than recouped its entire CDollars 314m investment in The Telegraph over the past nine years, as well as having earned a sizeable rate of return. The company realised CDollars 187m from a portion of its Telegraph shares when the UK company made a public offering in 1992, and raised another CDollars 17m late last year. Hollinger said there was no particular significance in the timing of the sale, except that it had planned for some time to get back the money it had ploughed into The Telegraph as a form of 'discipline' in its investment strategy. The sale involves 12.5m shares, which were sold at 587p each to Goldman Sachs and Cazenove. Shares in The Telegraph closed yesterday down 20p at 600p. Mr Black paid 100p per Telegraph share when he made his initial investment in 1985. A year later, Hollinger paid 50p per share to bring its investment in The Telegraph up to 50 per cent. Hollinger said the proceeds of the latest sale would be used for general corporate purposes. It added that the transaction was unrelated to its recent purchase of the Chicago Sun-Times, or the withdrawal of a small public offering planned by UniMedia, a wholly owned Canadian newspaper group.

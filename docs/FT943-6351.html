			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Government as venture capitalist What do Intel, Apple Computer, Cray Research and Federal Express have in common? All are now Fortune 500 companies. But in their youth they also all received financial help from a hybrid venture capital programme that brings the private sector together with the US government. Despite recent problems, the Small Business Investment Company programme has proved a valuable way to get development capital to early-stage companies in the US but is a model that most governments elsewhere have chosen not to imitate. The programme was set up in 1958 after a Federal Reserve Board study found that long-term loan and equity finance was not generally available to growing companies. Led by the Small Business Administration, the SBICs have invested more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) of private and public funds in 73,000 small businesses. But despite the list of illustrious names with which SBICs are associated, the programme has not had a happy recent history. The recession prevented many companies backed by SBICs from maturing and distributing profits. At the same time the SBICs still had to pay interest on the government-guaranteed debentures they had issued. Caught in a cash squeeze and dogged by poor management, many of the SBICs failed, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the losses. The Clinton Administration is now trying to revitalise the programme. Early this year it announced a new funding mechanism that should eliminate the SBICs' cashflow squeeze. The new government-backed security will be in the form of a redeemable preferred stock, or participating security, on which payment will only be made when the SBICs have retained earnings from their investments. According to Robert Stillman, the SBA's associate administrator for investment, the 56 venture capitalists wanting SBA licences for new SBICs want to invest Dollars 1bn of equity in the new companies. The SBICs are privately owned and run. But for every dollar the private sector commits to them the government provides up to three. And because the government only looks for an all-in return of about 11 per cent on its investment, compared with one well above 20 per cent sought by private-sector venture capitalists, the overall cost of capital to the early stage company is reduced. The scheme has congressional approval for Dollars 550m until the end of 1995. But it may need an appropriation of more than Dollars 3bn over five years to match the private sector's apparent enthusiasm, a commitment Congress may not have fully taken on board. Supporting its pitch to Congress, the SBA says SBICs have been a cheap way of creating jobs. Policy makers outside the US, who are pondering whether an equity gap exists in their countries, will be interested in the Small Business Administration's definition of a small business. The SBICs are allowed to invest in businesses that are relatively well-established but the SBA believes they still lack access to capital. Investments can be made in companies with a net worth of up to Dollars 18m or Dollars 6m of post-tax profits, although 20 per cent of funds are allocated to companies making up to Dollars 2m. With investment limits set at this level, some observers say the SBICs are doing little more than provide government-subsidised capital to ventures that would have raised the finance anyway. Would Federal Express, for example, which raised about Dollars 50m in venture capital in a first tranche, really not have taken off without an SBIC investment? Erskine Bowles, the SBA administrator, says there is no way of proving that the SBIC programme is not replicating what the market is already offering. But he insists it will introduce equity into companies that would not otherwise have raised capital. The SBA is also trying to strengthen the SBIC programme by requiring private-sector partners to put up more capital and by applying a more rigorous quality test to the venture capitalists applying for licences. But in the most novel development, the new mechanism will give the government a share of profits in successful investments. One can only speculate how much higher the SBA's stock would have risen had this equity kicker been in place when the SBICs backed Intel, Apple and Federal Express.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: Good Friday for whom? The world's financial markets are in a bit of a tizzy about Easter. Problem is that Good Friday coincides with the first Friday of the month, when the US Bureau of Labour Statistics normally puts out its employment figures. It might be a religious and a bank holiday, but it is not a federal holiday, so the bureau, despite fierce lobbying from the financial community and even Congress, reasons that it should publish and be damned. As the numbers are some of the biggest market-movers in the business, the Chicago futures exchanges have decided to break with precedent and open some contracts for a short session. Not that it was an easy decision. The Chicago Board of Trade has changed its mind about the proposed holiday three times in a matter of days in a bid to keep pace with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. To make matters doubly confusing, the CBOT is still closing an hour earlier than its arch rival, the Merc. Don't bet they won't think again.</p>

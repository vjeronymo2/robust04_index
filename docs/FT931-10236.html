			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Total sees 52% drop in earnings TOTAL, the smaller of France's two oil groups, yesterday estimated a 52 per cent fall in annual net profits, mainly due to a sharp decline in refining margins, reflecting the impact of recession on the demand for refined products. The profits fall, to FFr2.8bn (Dollars 512m) from FFr5.8bn in 1991 is in line with Total's warnings at the end of 1992 that net earnings would fall by more than the 47 per cent recorded in the first six months. This contrasts with a 35 per cent profits decline at Elf Aquitaine, Total's larger French rival, reflecting Elf's lower exposure to refining. Refining margins, of Dollars 4.1 per barrel, were exceptionally high in 1991 because of the demand unleashed by the Gulf war, and nearly halved to Dollars 2.1 per barrel last year, reflecting 'world wide economic stagnation', said Total. As a result of the difficult economic situation, Total has taken a FFr500m non-recurring charge in last year's accounts. Group operating profits fell by 30 per cent to FFr7.2bn from FFr10.3bn over the period, within which refining and marketing profits were more than halved to FFr2bn from FFr4.9bn. Total's US refineries recovered from difficult markets in 1991 to break even last year. Exploration and production profits were unchanged at FFr2.9bn, while trading profits fell to FFr600m from FFr1bn. The chemicals division produced a rise in operating profits to FFr1.7bn from FFr1.5bn, helped by an improvement in the profitability of the recently reorganised inks and resins companies. Total's worldwide reserves rose over the period to 531m tonnes of oil equivalent from 513m tonnes, not including Total's interest in the new Cusiana oil field in Colombia, discovery of which was unveiled last year. Cash flow fell slightly to FFr10.1bn from FFr13.7bn in 1991 while capital spending was unchanged at about FFr15bn. By the end of the year, debts stood at 35 per cent of shareholders' funds. Elf Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals arm of Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group, yesterday said it expected net profits of more than FFr1bn in 1992, up from FFr950m in the previous year. The group, which last month announced a merger with Yves Saint Laurent, one of the best known names in French fashion, attributed the improvement to the benefits of its alliance with Sterling Winthrop, the US drugs company.</p>

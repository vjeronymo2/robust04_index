			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (NA) -- Neuquen Bishop Jaime de Nevares accused  President Carlos Menem yesterday [15 January] of being  "obsessed" with his bid for re-election and urged him to spend  more time thinking about how to cushion the poorer sectors of  society who he said were bearing the brunt of current government  economic policy.    The bishop, who two weeks ago announced that he would stand  for election to the constituent assembly on behalf of the  left-wing Frente Grande coalition, said in an interview with  NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency that the fact that Menem was  "obsessed" with re-election was "vox populi."    He added that he personally was in favour of maintaining the  current law that bars presidents from serving a second  consecutive term and that the head of state should continue to  serve the country for a period of six years.    However he drew comfort from the fact that his contribution  to the constituent assembly would at least help the cause of  securing some "positive aspects" in the reform of the national  charter.    Later in an outspoken critique of government economic  policy,  the prelate said: "The social cost of economic success is very  high for all to see." He concluded that "there must clearly be  an alternative to the current model," and one that reached out  to "all sectors of society and not just one."    Responding to a question as to whether the clergy should not  be allowed to play a direct role in politics, he denied that  there was any conflict of interests and said he was not taking  part in party politics, but rather "acting for the common good."  He also categorically ruled out any future in the political  world after the constituent assembly ends its assessment of the  need for constitutional reform in April of this year.</p>

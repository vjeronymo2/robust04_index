			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / German workers settle for modest pay increase The first significant deal in west Germany's 1994 pay negotiations has resulted in insurance workers settling for a 2 per cent across-the-board award. According to officials of the DAG white-collar union, a one-off payment and travel subsidies will boost the total value of the 15-month package to about 3 per cent. The agreement, reached during Tuesday night, is the first concrete evidence to support hopes of deflationary wage rises in the new year. West German inflation is widely forecast to average around 3.5 per cent in 1994, dipping steadily as the year progresses. A tendency towards more moderate union demands has played an important part in encouraging the Bundesbank council, which meets today, to continue its programme of cautious interest rate reductions. The traditionally moderate DBV bank workers' association this week requested a 4.5 per cent increase for the new year. The real test for negotiators starts next week, when engineering and metal industry employers are due to open talks with the IG Metall union, which has posted claims for between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent. However, economists note that the industrial sectors represented by IG Metall have shed around 400,000 jobs in the past two years, and doubt that the membership has the heart to resist employers' pressure. A month-on-month increase of just 0.1 per cent in west German import prices during October and a 1.5 per cent fall compared with the same month last year, reported by the federal statistics office yesterday, also indicated continuing reductions in inflationary pressure. Meanwhile, industrial output figures suggested that the past year's decline is slowing. Production fell a provisional 0.4 per cent during October, according to the economics ministry. This followed a sharp upward adjustment for September, when output was unchanged from August. Combined figures for September and October, a measure used to iron out short-term fluctuations, showed production up 1 per cent on July and August. Only consumer goods and food and luxury products registered declines.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Delors: I'm no Socialist miracle worker Without their acclaimed emperor, the French Socialist party has few clothes. Mr Jacques Delors' dramatic decision to end weeks of mounting suspense by announcing on prime-time television last night that he would not be their candidate for the presidency has left the Socialists looking pretty naked. Before last night's announcement, some in the party who had predicted the European Commission president's answer would be no were already regretting that he felt compelled to give it so soon. One Socialist MP had appealed to Mr Delors not to accelerate the timetable of his answer so as 'not to shorten the suffering of the right'. But while the right may have last night breathed a collective sigh of relief at seeing the front-runner in the opinion polls rule himself out of the race for the Elysee, it knows it now faces a different kind of suffering - that of increased civil war between rival conservatives for a prize that looks to be within each one's grasp. Mr Delors would himself have clearly liked to postpone announcing his decision. Even last night, he insisted on talking about the European Union's just-concluded Essen summit for 40 minutes before answering no to the only question his listeners were interested in. He went on to explain that, in addition to the personal and family reasons for wanting a break after 10 years running the Commission, he was 'no miracle doctor'. Even if he managed to somehow levitate into the Elysee, he could not carry Socialist fortunes high enough with him to win a leftwing majority in new parliamentary elections. Some leading Socialists last night put a brave face on their misfortune. Ms Segolene Royal, a former environment minister, claimed that Mr Delors' standing in the polls - ahead of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur as well as Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris - 'shows the right is in a minority' in the country. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, leader of the party since the June ousting of Mr Michel Rocard, called on the party to take heart and promised a party congress in January to designate its presidential candidate. But the party could then fall to its traditional factional feuding, in contrast to its congress last month when all rallied around an appeal to Mr Delors to run for president. One particular Socialist fear is that Mr Bernard Tapie may leap into the void left by Mr Delors. Mr Tapie's political label is that of the Radical party, a small traditional ally of the Socialists. But Mr Tapie, who said last night 'Jacques Delors's ideas are shared by a majority of French', has proven voter appeal among the young and working class. He might see a presidential bid as way out of the tax and bankruptcy litigation in which he is mired. Mr Emmanuelli reacted by warning Mr Tapie that the left needed a candidate who could at least come second in the first round of voting on April 23 and therefore make it into the May 7 run-off. Causing immediate jubilation on the right last night was precisely this prospect that for the first time since 1969, the May 7 run-off will be between two of its own. This will cheer up Mr Chirac. The mayor of Paris still trails Mr Balladur despite having formally opened his campaign, but can now hope to come in second on April 23. But a close supporter of Mr Balladur reacted with the argument that the prime minister's appeal to centrists - particularly within his coalition partner of the UDF - made him the best candidate, since 'Jacques Delors has abandoned the centre, and that is where the presidential battle will be fought out'.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW MASTER STORYTELLER COMMENCES HER REIGN;  </P> <P> THE STORIES OF EVA LUNA BY ISABEL ALLENDE TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH BY MARGARET  SAYERS PEDEN. ATHENEUM, $18.95, 288 PAGES  </P> <P> Never mind the Grand Vizier, the heartless king and all the unfortunate virgins  who preceded Scheherazade. In all essential respects, the narrator of Isabel  Allende's "The Stories of Eva Luna" is the reincarnation of that marvelous  storyteller, as the epigraph from "A Thousand and One Nights" suggests.  </P> <P> Readers of Isabel Allende's memorable earlier novel, "Eva Luna," will recognize  her at once: the peasant girl from the hinterlands of a generic South American  country who becomes a self-taught "seller of words." By the end of that novel,  Eva Luna had achieved fame, joy and an adoring, if temperamental, lover in Rolf  Carle.  </P> <P> In the brief prologue to the new "Stories," Carle asks Eva for a story, and she  obliges with 23 enthralling tales in which folkloric themes are enhanced by a  cosmopolitan, contemporary sensibility.  </P> <P> The result is arresting and altogether distinctive, powerful and haunting; a  collection of stories to be read aloud, memorized and repeated for generations.  In common with other writers from countries colonized by Europeans, Allende's  language recalls the rhythm of earlier centuries without being in the least  archaic.  </P> <P> As in traditional legend, the characters are larger than life -- embodiments of  passion, cruelty and virtue. Look elsewhere for failing relationships,  uncommitted lovers, jaded sophisticates and adolescents in search of  themselves. Allende's people know exactly who they are and what they must do to  survive.  </P> <P> The first story, "Two Words," sets the mood. Belisa Crepusculario has  christened herself for "beauty" and "twilight," having come from a family "so  poor they did not even have names to give their children."  </P> <P> Stronger and more resourceful than her doomed brothers and sisters, Belisa sets  out across her country's arid plains toward the sea. Along the way, she learns  to read and write, earning a pittance as a storyteller, letter-writer and  itinerant chronicler of village events.  </P> <P> Her reputation eventually reaches the ruling tyrant, who wants to become the  legally elected president. He orders his brigands to kidnap Belisa and bring  her to the camp to create his campaign speeches . . . and the rest of that  story should only be told by firelight, to a rapt audience.  </P> <P> "Wicked Girl" is a tale of unrequited love in which an awkward 11-year-old girl  becomes obsessed with the wandering minstrel who rents a room in her mother's  boarding house.  </P> <P> For several weeks, Elena was "repelled by the brilliantine-slick hair, the  polished nails, the excessive zeal with a toothpick, the pedantry, the brazen  assumption they all would serve him."  </P> <P> Repulsion turns to adoration, however, and the child lies down beside the man  while he's napping, only to be thrown to the floor when he awakens and realizes  he's mistaken her for her mother. Seven years in a convent erase Elena's memory  of the incident but only intensify the man's.  </P> <P> He has married the mother but lives in the grip of desire for the girl, who now  stares at him speechlessly, unable to "remember any particular Thursday in her  past."  </P> <P> Several of the stories take place in the fictional town of Agua Santa, an  impoverished, isolated settlement that forms the perfect milieu for these  modern legends: large enough to contain a full complement of human  eccentricity; small enough so that every event is visible to the entire  population.  </P> <P> The unofficial mayor is Riad Halabi, a Middle Eastern peddler who settled  there, prospered, and has been showing his gratitude ever since. Halabi  reappears from time to time, functioning as catalyst, philanthropist and  conscience.  </P> <P> Socially and economically, the town is typical of many benighted places in this  country of extremes, but what other village has both a secular saint and a  myth-maker?  </P> <P> There is violence in these stories -- revenge, madness, death, lust and greed  -- but also compassion, vitality, humor, tenderness and generosity, and all in  exquisite balance and proportion.  </P> <P> Superbly translated from the Spanish, the language creates an aura of mystery  and wonder even in the tales clearly based on actual events and firmly rooted  in the present.  </P> <P> If Allende's life, like Scheherazade's, actually depended on her narrative  gifts, she'd not only survive, but reign.  </P> <P>  Next: Carolyn See reviews "Vital Signs" by Robin Cook (Putnam).  </P> <P> </P></p>

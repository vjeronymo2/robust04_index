			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / East Midlands business leaders want government spending to be maintained in real terms Business leaders in the east Midlands want government spending to be at least maintained in real terms, and believe that any increase should be financed by extending the scope of value added tax. A poll of 100 executives by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, found most wanted higher government spending on transport and capital infrastructure, but lower spending on social security benefits. The survey of business opinion in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire was published yesterday. The business leaders are anxious that Mr Lamont should extend indefinitely the temporary increase, announced in the last Autumn Statement, of capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings.</p>

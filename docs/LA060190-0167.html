"There were about three  different storm systems. Two dropped tornadoes."  </P> <P> The funnel clouds were "too numerous to count," he said.  </P> <P> Ten mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed, while a church and a  restaurant were heavily damaged. Mayor Burl Buchanan estimated that 5% of the  town of 3,500 had property damage.  </P></p>

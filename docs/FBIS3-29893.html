			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The government adopted a  set of measures on Monday afternoon to control price spiral,  which feature the emergency importation of those farm goods  whose prices jumped recently. The steps also include a stern  order handed down to the proprieters of public service concerns  such as public bath houses and restaurants to withdraw their  recently raised charges.    The measures were adopted at an emergency price-related  ministers meeting held at the Kwachon government office under  the chair of Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok.    To stabilize the prices of seasoning materials, 3,000 tons  of  Welsh onions, 5,000 tons of onions and 3,000 tons of garlic will  be imported.    The meeting decided that if service charges and industrial  goods prices would increase or increased fees and prices are not  brought down despite Monday's steps, the tax office would absorb  all increased amounts as taxes.    To ensure rice price stabilization, the meeting decided to  auction off 700,000 soks (100,800 tons) of rice held by the  National Agricultural Cooperative Federation.    If the amount is not enough to check rice price rise,  government- held rice will be released limitlessly.    Due checks will also be made to keep real estate prices from  going up.    The price meeting took place after President Kim Yong-sam  urged Deputy Premier Chong earlier in the day to take sweeping  steps to control price spiral.    The attendees included home affairs, finance,  agriculture-forestry-fisheries, trade-industry-energy,  construction and health-social affairs ministers plus the Seoul  mayor and the head of the National Tax Administration.</p>

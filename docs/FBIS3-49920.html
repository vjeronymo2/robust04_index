Director of the Press and Information Department in the  Foreign Ministry Wladyslaw Klaczynski told newsmen after the  meeting that U.S. President Bill Clinton described the  initiative as opening doors, not setting up barriers.    President Lech Walesa stressed Poland's doubts concerning  the  initiative in the light of both Polish past experience and the  present situation. President Walesa pointed out Poland's  determination to effectively and quickly integrate with the  European structures which is not intended to work against the  interests of Russia.    Bill Clinton reiterated that U.S. security is connected with  the security of the central and eastern Europe and said that the  "Partnership for Peace" is a project valuable as such and is not  a compromise between doing nothing and full NATO membership.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who was referring mainly to  economic issues, stressed the need to start a "partnership for  development." Bill Clinton replied that he had encouraged  businessmen present at the recent E.C. summit in Brussels to  expand their investments in eastern and central Europe and  appealed to western leaders to facilitate the access of eastern  European goods to western markets.    President Lech Walesa especially emphasized the necessity  for  western Europe's greater effort in the integration processes.</p>

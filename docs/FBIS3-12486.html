			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In its appeal no. 97, the Unified Leadership of the  Intifadah [ULI] called on the PLO leadership to immediately  suspend the current talks and return to new bases that  guarantee, first and foremost, the removal of all settlements  from the occupied territories, leading to a comprehensive and  inseparable Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied  territories, above all holy Jerusalem. This should be done on  the basis of international legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of  all Resolution 242.    The appeal said that talk about peace and negotiations has  become a delusion and called for a series of activities,  including:    -- The immediate launching of a comprehensive and  responsible  national dialogue with the participation of all national and  Islamic forces in a bid to unify our people in confronting the  developments of the present stage.    -- A new formulation of national unity on militant bases and  under the umbrella of Palestinian national constants.    -- The hoisting of black flags in the streets and on roofs  throughout the occupied territories for a period of 40 days.    -- The holding of conferences by national and popular  institutions and prodding international organizations and human  rights committees to provide temporary international protection  for our defenseless people.    -- The opening of businesses from the morning hours until  1700. Merchants are urged to adhere to this time.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Boots joins queue of UK groups seeking long finance BOOTS, the pharmaceutical and retailing group, yesterday launched a Pounds 250m 25-year bond issue - the latest UK company to raise long-term funding in the international bond market. The deal was wholly underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which lead-managed a Pounds 400m 14-year issue by Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, on Monday. However, unlike the Hanson deal, the paper issued yesterday was entirely placed by BZW. The bonds are unusual in paying 10 1/8 per cent coupons quarterly. The lead manager said the structure matched the cash-flow requirements of a handful of institutional investors. Bankers speculated that the issue had been 'stripped' by BZW: the coupons had been sold separately from the underlying bonds. Stripped bonds are often bought by insurance companies, which use the coupons as backing for long-dated obligations such as annuities. Boots will use the proceeds of the issue to repay short-term bank borrowings. At the end of the last financial year, the group showed short-term debt amounting to just over Pounds 300m. Some of the proceeds of the deal were swapped in floating rate sterling, although the longer-dated portions will be held as fixed-rate obligations. At an issue price of 100.325, the bonds yield around 140 basis points more than UK government paper. There are few comparable corporate bond issues outstanding, since most other deals of this maturity are secured on the assets of the issuer. Yesterday, the Hanson bonds were trading at a yield spread of around 126 basis points, from 128 basis points at launch. Elsewhere, Confederation Life, the Canadian life insurance company, raised Pounds 100m five-year funds from a deal lead-managed by Warburg Securities. The 9.5 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.20, where the yield is 40 basis points more than gilts. Participants in the deal said the pricing was fair for a company rated AA+, just one notch below the top triple-A credit rating, by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US agency. Against this, the deal was Confederation Life's first sterling bond issue and the company remains less well known in the UK than in North America. However, demand was easily sufficient to support the issue. By the close in London, the issue was trading at around the launch spread. Britannia Building Society also raised Pounds 100m, from a four-year issue of floating rate notes. The paper pays 15 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.73. At this level, the bonds pay a margin of 24 basis points over Libor, roughly in line with outstanding Britannia paper in the secondary market. In the Eurodollar sector, Thyssen, the German industrial group, made a rare appearence in the public debt markets. The group raised Dollars 200m seven-year funding in a deal lead-managed by Dresdner Bank. Thyssen does not carry a credit rating but is one of Germany's best-known industrial groups. The 7 1/2 per cent bonds, priced to yield 84 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, sold briskly to continental European retail investors, banks and some investment institutions. City of Yokohama launched a long-awaited Dollars 130m 10-year issue lead-managed by Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. The paper was priced to yield 36 basis points more than Treasuries - considered tight by some participants in the deal, and unnecessarily generous by others. Republic of Ireland yesterday raised Dollars 300m in the US bond market. The 10-year yankee bond issue, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, was priced to yield 40 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Bankers said that the borrower achieved a lower cost of funds than issuing in the international bond market. A Eurodollar issue may have been priced to yield up to 10 basis points more, although higher fees are charged by underwriters in the US market. Ireland is rated AA3 and AA- by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies. The long-term debt rating of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) has been downgraded by Moody's from Aa1 to Aa3. About Dollars 2.7bn of debt is affected. The rating agency cited concerns about asset quality and the effectiveness of the bank's risk management controls, as well as the longer-term profitability of the bank.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER WATCH;  </P> <P> SAVINGS PLAN  </P> <P> Hey, Southern California -- Congratulations! Average water use throughout the  region has dropped significantly, thanks to you.  </P> <P> In the last couple of months, ever since it became clear that we're well into a  fourth year of a drought, voluntary conservation efforts slashed consumption to  an impressive 15.5% below standard levels in Los Angeles and to 15.8% below in  San Diego.  </P> <P> Orange County, less pinched because of an underground reservoir, reduced its  water use by an average 8%.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District this year told Southern California communities  that a 10% savings is needed over the short run to compensate for predicted  shortfalls in water.  </P> <P> How did we do it?  </P> <P> In some communities, bans on hosing down driveways and daytime lawn watering  have helped water districts stave off the forced rationing they feared would  become necessary. Only a few districts, such as Santa Barbara, have instituted  rationing.  </P> <P> Many more have chosen to keep the issue of conservation alive by making  customer cutbacks mandatory. Los Angeles is considering just that course of  action now, but opponents of Mayor Tom Bradley's mandatory conservation measure  are pointing to the success of the voluntary program to justify their  opposition.  </P> <P> That's shortsighted: The area's water shortage is a long-term problem.  Voluntary conservation can help. But in some areas of the state it won't be  enough.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 22, BNS -- One more person has tested  HIV-positive in Lithuania, increasing the number of reported  incidence of the AIDS virus to 21, the Lithuanian AIDS Center  reported.    The center said the infected person is around 20 years old,  a  seaman, who got infected through sexual contact abroad. The man  has a family whose members are not infected.    The center said 5 HIV-positive persons registered in  Lithuania earlier already have AIDS. Children were born to two  AIDS carriers. No presence of the AIDS virus was found in the  children although the conception occurred when the parents were  already infected.    Four out of 21 registered AIDS-infected people already died,  but AIDS was the cause of death only in two cases.    Experts say that each HIV-positive person is surrounded by  some 50 to 100 potential AIDS carriers, therefore the number of  people infected with AIDS in Lithuania may be greater than  indicated by official statistics.</p>

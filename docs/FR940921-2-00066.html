Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this Chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing the supplement to the Iowa State Plan as a proposed change and for making the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The standards are identical to the comparable Federal standards and are therefore deemed to be at least as effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation and notice would be unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision is effective September 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Section 18, Public Law 91&hyph;596, 84 Stat. 1608 [29 U.S.C. 667]). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Kansas City, Missouri, this 20 day of June, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John T.

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac In the space of five years, Tarmac has swung from a restated pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 400m into a Pounds 350m loss. Battered shareholders must be hoping for an equally drastic reversal of misfortune as recovery takes hold. But despite the cyclical nature of its markets, Tarmac will find it far harder climbing back up the cliff than falling off it. The trouble is that Tarmac's balance sheet is still out of kilter with the state of its market. After exhibiting an unhappy knack of sinking money into falling markets a few years ago, Tarmac is now applying the reverse skill of withdrawing working capital from the rising housebuilding market. This lack of aggression partly reflects Tarmac's commendable determination to ensure growth is sustainable this time round, but it also stems from continuing financial constraints. Despite a Pounds 147m disposal programme, Tarmac ended the year with Pounds 577.1m of debt. Cash will remain frightfully tight even though another Pounds 150m should be realised from disposals this year. Tarmac is probably right to believe that its steady restructuring progress will bear fruit in the medium term. That, though, hardly represents a ringing reason to buy the shares at present, especially given the dull outlook for its quarry and contracting businesses. Short term attention is likely to focus on nimbler housebuilders. Significantly, Bryant Group became just the latest of these to tap the stock market yesterday for expansion funds.</p>

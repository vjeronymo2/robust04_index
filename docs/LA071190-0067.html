Moammar Kadafi was behind the attack.  </P> <P> The Bonn sources were commenting on a report in the latest edition of the news  magazine Stern, which said a man with an Arab name is being held under tight  security because he is considered a prime witness in the case.  </P> <P> According to the security sources, the man is suspected of taking part in the  transport of the explosives used in the disco bombing.  </P> <P> Stern also said East and West German police have been cooperating since May in  the hunt for a Palestinian, Yasser Chraidi, who is suspected of belonging to a  Libyan assassination squad operating in Berlin.  </P></p>

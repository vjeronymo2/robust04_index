			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey reveals variety in accounts BRITISH COMPANIES disclose more financial information and data on social issues than their overseas competitors, according to a survey of the annual reports of leading quoted companies from nine countries. Swedish companies provide most detail in their operational review and Italian ones least, the study from Shelley Taylor &amp; Associates, a London-based corporate strategy consultant, shows. UK and French companies revealed most in their accounts about factors such as shareholders, cash flows and segmental information by sector and country - which readers consider important. The Italians revealed least. The analysis considered disclosure of non-statutory information in the most recent of 160 company accounts chosen from the 1,000 companies with the largest market capitalisation in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the UK and the USA. The UK rated highest on disclosure of corporate social information such as equal opportunities, training, health and safety and the environment. Scoring required a discussion of the issue to be clearly visible and consume at least 50 words of text in the annual report. However, more than four times as many US as UK companies offered any numbers to back up the words or linked their social activities to business performance in some way. French companies also scored twice as highly as the British on this measure. Swedish companies disclosed most about in their management review about strategy, the risks of business, research and development and political and economic trends. The UK came sixth. About two-fifths of companies in the nine countries had a 'mission statement' expressing their objectives, and 78 per cent had a statement of strategy. Although 91 per cent of companies provided information on prospects, only 63 per cent set any quantified objectives. Only US companies included statements showing management's responsibility for internal accounting control and for the financial statements. *Full Disclosure. A study of annual reports.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States decided Wednesday to conduct this year's "Team  Spirit" joint military exercise in November if North Korea  continues to refuse additional nuclear inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and does not show  sincerity in resuming inter-Korean dialogue.    The decision came at an hour-long meeting between South  Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his U.S. counterpart  William Perry at the Defense Ministry. They evaluated the  current situation concerning the North Korean nuclear dispute  before arriving at their position.    The top defense officials decided to consider suspending the  joint military exercise in case North Korea meets such  conditions for a third round of Washington-Pyongyang high-level  talks.    Accordingly, the governments of the two countries will hold  the Team Spirit exercise should they find no progress in talks  over the North Korean nuclear issue after watching the  developments of the end of October.    Yi and Perry discussed ways to maintain the kind of  deterrent  force which has defended peace on the Korean peninsula for the  past four decades in preparation for eventualities in the future.    The two defense ministers shared the view that the  deployment  of such advanced defensive weapons as Patriot missiles at  American military bases in Korea would help beef up anti-air  raid and anti-ballistic missile defense capability and  contribute to joint Korea-U.S. deterrence of war.    In the meeting, Minister Yi said the Korean military is  seeking to increase anti-artillery and night combat capabilities.    Perry said that the United States is persistently pushing  for  the modernization of its forces in Korea.    The ministers, however, agreed that there are no particular  signs of North Korea moving to militarily provoke for the  present.    The U.S. defense secretary, who arrived here Tuesday,  conferred with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and senior  presidential secretary for foreign and national security  affairs, Chong Chong-uk.    The defense secretary is scheduled to visit the Second U.S.  Infantry Division Thursday before leaving Seoul for Japan.</p>

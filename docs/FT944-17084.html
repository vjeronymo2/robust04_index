			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (11): Before the high-tech shoulder bag bursts / A look at a bewildering array of gadgets from laptops to modems The business traveller in the 1990s faces a bewildering array of electronic wizardry designed to boost personal productivity, collect, store or transmit information or simply to entertain. Thanks to advances in technology, particularly silicon integration, many travelling business executives now carry a bulging shoulder-bag of high-tech gadgets, including a notebook PC, fax-modem and perhaps even a digital cellular telephone. Add to this a pocket-sized electronic diary/organiser which will, if required, interface with the portable PC, a compact 35mm zoom camera and portable mini-disc or CD player for entertainment and the collection of electronic gadgetry is almost complete. The popularity of lightweight 'notebook' portable computers in particular highlights the strides made by technology in recent years. It is less than 15 years since the first desktop computers began arriving in offices, and yet today PC manufacturers can pack most, if not all, of the processing power of an early super-computer into an A4-size package weighing around six pounds. Low-power chips, together with improvements in screen and battery technology, have enabled engineers to build machines with brighter colour displays and longer battery lives. These improvements, coupled with tumbling prices, have turned the notebook computer into the fastest-growing segment of the world computer market. Last year in Europe alone, end-users spent Dollars 3.6bn on portable computers - mostly notebook or even smaller sub-notebook machines - according to Dataquest, the market research organisation. Unit sales of notebook PCs alone grew by over 18 per cent to 1.33m with four vendors - Compaq, Toshiba, IBM and Apple - accounting for more than half the total market. Two years ago, a typical mono notebook with an Intel 386 processor, 2Mb of Ram and a 60Mb hard disk cost about Pounds 2,000 in the UK. Now, a much more powerful machine based on an Intel 486 processor with 4Mb of Ram, a 210Mb hard disk, PCMIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) card slots for add-on peripherals, a dual-scan colour screen and a tracker-ball for mouse-style pointing under Microsoft Windows can be bought for under Pounds 1,500. Some manufacturers have developed specific machines for niche applications. For example, Toshiba offers a machine which includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo speakers, detachable keyboard and other facilities to make multimedia presentations while travelling. For those who require paper print-outs but do not want to lug around a separate printer, Canon has developed machines which incorporate a bubble jet printer. For serious portable computer users a modem (modulator/de-modulator) is another essential piece of kit to be packed alongside the spare battery pack, the power adapter and connecting cables. A modem enables a computer to exchange digital data over an older-style analogue telephone line with another machine, typically a head-office computer which is also equipped with a modem. A modem link typically enables a travelling executive, salesman or engineer to exchange data such as sales or product information or customer details with the office network, send electronic mail or capture information from a commercial database. Using a modem link, a traveller can even look up airline flight details and make or change reservations on one of the airline computer databases. Modems come in a variety of forms and are getting faster, smarter and cheaper. Some, based usually on proprietary designs, fit inside the machine but external devices - including some which fit into PCMCIA card slots - usually offer faster transmission speeds together with sophisticated data compression and error correction features. The current business standard is for data transmission at 14,400bps (also known as V32bis) coupled with V42 error correction and V42bis data compression which allow even higher transmission speeds. Most also provide the facility to send and receive faxes direct from the screen. Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed to be plugged into a telephone wall telephone socket. However, some niche products are available to cope with special situations - for example, the public call box or the hotel telephone which does not unplug from the wall. In addition, wireless modems have begun to appear which are designed either to work with existing analogue cellular mobile telephone services or with the new breed of dedicated digital mobile packet-switched data networks. These devices represent the ultimate in portability since they will allow mobile computer users to transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually anywhere. Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since, at least in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device, including portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile telephones operating on digital cellular networks. Over the past few years the advent of digital cellular technology has spawned a second generation of cellular networks throughout Europe and elsewhere. In Europe and other areas of the world which have adopted the GSM digital cellular standard, these new networks offer other advantages for business travellers. GSM networks offer more secure and clearer voice communications. Perhaps even more importantly, because they are based on a common standard, once so-called 'roaming agreements' are signed between network operators, travellers will be able to use the same telephone anywhere where there is a GSM system. Potentially, that means that for the first time it will be possible to drive from one end of Europe using the same pocket-sized handset  -and be available on the same telephone number. Although the uptake of these new GSM services has been relatively slow in the UK, where the analogue networks are well-established and provide superior coverage, elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, GSM services have grown rapidly. By the end of the decade even more ambitious cellular telephone systems based on new telecommunications satellite technology will usher in the truly global mobile telephone which will be capable of being used literally anywhere on earth. Plans for multi-billion dollar global satellite mobile communications systems such as Iridium, Globalstar and Inmarsat-P are already well advanced and on target to launch services beginning in 1998. Most of them are based on a new breed of low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites which operate at altitudes of 400 to 1,000 miles. Because they are closer to earth than traditional Geo-stationary satellites, Leo-based systems will work with less powerful, smaller, lighter and cheaper equipment. Most strategists believe that these new services, coupled with the continued convergence of telephone and computer technologies, will eventually lead to multi-purpose handheld digital devices which will combine the functions of voice and data telecommunications. Sales of the first generation of so-called personal digital assistants, such as Apple's Newton, have failed to live up to expectations, largely because they lack sophisticated wireless telecommunications facilities. However second generation devices which combine the data-processing features of a hand-held computer and the convenience of the electronic organiser with wireless voice and data telecommunications features should be available in a few years' time. Such devices could provide a full range of information, navigation, communications and entertainment services in a pocket-sized package. Perhaps then the shoulder bag stuffed full of high-tech goodies will look as out-of-place as a portable typewriter does at an airport departure lounge today.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Year-end rally resumes in Frankfurt and Paris Hopes of a successful outcome to the Gatt talks gave senior bourses the excuse to resume their year-end rally, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was lifted at the outset by the Gatt prospect, and climbed further on institutional buying. German stock market turnover rose from DM7.6bn to DM10.4bn as the DAX index closed the official session 32.67, or 1.5 per cent higher at a new all-time high of 2,148.13. In the afternoon, dealers and investors seemed to have the bit between their teeth, and some big speculative positions were taken, some of them in large companies, as the Ibis indicated DAX put on another 17.82 to 2,165.95 for an overall gain of 1.8 per cent since the previous post-bourse close. Big blue chips were in the frame, Siemens rising DM11.90 to DM737.40 on optimism about the transrapid electromagnetic train project, and hitting DM746 in the afternoon; Thyssen moved from DM242.50, through DM245.90 to DM251 on similar grounds. Telecoms prospects also got excited, Veba touching DM495, up DM14.80 from the previous day's close on plans to go deeper into the industry, and Mannesmann rising DM14.40 to DM386.90 overall. However, profit-taking hit AEG before the sale of its household appliances unit to Electrolux was confirmed, and the shares fell DM7.90 to DM178. PARIS strengthened solidly, some analysts giving credit to the the Gatt talks. The CAC-40 index advanced 29.19 or 1.3 per cent top 2,205.31. Turnover was good at an estimated FFr4.5bn. The solid performance of the bond market also contributed to the day's positive outlook. However, a different picture emerged from two new indices which were launched yesterday, the SBF 120 and the SBF 250, both of which showed slight declines on the day, the former closing at 1,494.20 and the latter at 1,429.34. The new indices, compiled by the Societe des Bourses Francaises, are computed at present only for the market's opening and closing, although the SBF 120, comprising some 80 per cent of the market's capitalisation compared to the CAC's 56 per cent, will become continuous from March 1994. Among the day's gains, Generale des Eaux put on FFr97 to FFr2,728 after a US broker was reported to have reiterated its buy recommendation. ZURICH returned to its record-setting ways after Tuesday's consolidation as strength in the franc prompted speculation that the Swiss National Bank would act shortly to cut the discount rate, perhaps as soon as this Friday when it maps out strategy for the next 12 months. The SMI index rose 9.0 to an all-time high of 2,843.8, after an intraday peak of 2,854.7. Registered shares in Sandoz, a recent laggard, rose SFr85 to SFr3,935 for a cumulative three day rise of 4.7 per cent. The shares were supported by a warrant issue and hopes of higher sales in Japan. News that Sandoz had sold a subsidiary of its chemicals division was welcomed by analysts as evidence that the group planned to concentrate on the higher margin biological side of its business. A SFr24, or 3.1 per cent jump in Swissair to SFr794 was attributed to its latest traffic figures. SMH shed SFr16 to SFr1,038 after a bank noted that sales of Swiss plastic watches was slowing. AMSTERDAM built solidly on its early gains, although analysts remained largely mystified by rises in certain stocks, including Heineken, up Fl 4.20 at Fl 212.10. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.0 to 140.8 in turnover estimated at Fl 1.4bn. Other underperformers in the market also put on a good showing, with DSM rising Fl 4.10 to Fl 106.40 and Akzo Fl 1.30 to Fl 184.90. STOCKHOLM was mixed with Ericsson B shares SKr8 lower at SKr356 as US investors became sellers of the stock for the second time in recent weeks. The Affarsvarlden index picked up 2.4 to 1,359.2. Volvo's B added SKr14 to SKr475 on renewed foreign demand while the Trelleborg firmed SKr2.50 to SKr73, attracting interest on rising metals prices. BRUSSELS saw a late burst of Bel-20 basket-buying take equities to a slightly higher finish, the Bel-20 closing 3.32 higher at 1,433.77, with turnover a solid BFr2.2bn. ISTANBUL picked up 3.2 per cent as bargain hunters returned after Tuesday's 3.6 per cent fall. The composite index added 553.6 to 17,935.6.

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> SUIT ON LAND JURISDICTION  </P> <P> The state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles is expected to hear a suit April 19 by  two Santa Monica Mountains property owners, challenging the California Coastal  Commission's inland jurisdiction.  </P> <P> The suit was filed by Quaker Corp., owner of 272 acres about 6.5 miles from the  ocean near Mulholland Drive and Las Virgenes Road, and by Michel T. Ghosn, who  owns 160 acres in the same area.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the property owners seek to remove coastal zone and coastal plan  jurisdiction at the ridgeline from Kanan-Dume Road to Topanga Canyon. They  argue that maps of the area drawn by coastal commission staff and approved by  the state Legislature were drawn in error.  </P> <P> The suit also requests damages for the plaintiffs, who for years have tried to  develop the property.  </P> <P> If successful, the litigation would remove thousands of acres of mountain land  from coastal commission jurisdiction and open up development in the Santa  Monica Mountains.  </P></p>

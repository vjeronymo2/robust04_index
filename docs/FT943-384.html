			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Beazer sales rise helps lift shares 6% The share price of Beazer Homes rose by more than 6 per cent to 131p after Britain's fourth largest housebuilder announced that sales had risen by a fifth since July 1 and had not been dented by the recent rise in interest rates. The company also announced better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.9m for the nine months to June 30. This compared with Pounds 37.8m for the 12 months to the end of September 1993. The City had been concerned that the rise of half a percentage point in interest rates might have upset the housing market recovery following comments by Tarmac on Tuesday that net reservations had halved during the previous two weeks. Mr Dennis Webb, Beazer's chief executive said: 'We have seen no sign of a dip since interest rates increased and volume sales are up by 20 per cent since June, compared with the corresponding 12 weeks last year.' The company is selling homes from 40 more sites than at the same stage last year following its Pounds 31m purchase of John Mowlem's housebuilding operations. Other large housebuilders yesterday agreed that sales had not fallen since interest rates rose on September 12, although some said that the traditional autumn surge had been more muted than expected. Tarmac, the country's second biggest housebuilder, had said that its net reservations, after allowing for cancellations, had fallen to between 50 and 70 a week, compared with between 100 and 150 before the interest rate rise. Mr Victor Benjamin, Beazer's chairman, said yesterday: 'While it is too early to evaluate the outcome of the recent interest rate increase, we believe that in the current market it is uncertainty over interest rates rather than the actual rates which unsettles consumer confidence. 'A further modest rate rise should not impact on sales, so long as the national recovery is maintained.' Beazer, which was floated earlier this year by Hanson, is paying a final net dividend of 1.8p - which it says equates to 5.4p for a full year. Earnings per share of 9.5p were equivalent to 12.7p for 12 months. The company sold 4,015 homes over the nine months, at an average of Pounds 62,000 after sales incentives, against 4,805 homes sold in the previous 12 months. Operating margins fell marginally to 13.3 per cent (13.6 per cent). COMMENT The market had under-estimated the strength of Beazer's performance, hence yesterday's bounce in the share price. Margins in particular have held up better than the company forecast when it was floated. A strong balance sheet, with about Pounds 60m of cash in hand after the Mowlem purchase, is a very healthy position. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m puts the group on a prospective p/e of just over 9, which still looks cheap. Longer term there must be some concern about what a volume housebuilder does when the market eventually turns down - hence Tarmac's decision to reduce the proportion of capital employed in UK housing.</p>

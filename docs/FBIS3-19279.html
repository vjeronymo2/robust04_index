"However," he said, "the United Nations has failed to lift  the embargo."    Speaking to the Anatolian News Agency al-Tikriti said the  economic embargo including the closure of the Turkish-Iraqi  pipeline should be lifted.    "Western countries again use a double standard as they are  doing in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said.    Al-Tikriti said the closure of the pipeline negatively  affected Turkey and Iraq adding, "Turkey calls for the lifting  of the economic embargo, why does the West fail to take this  into consideration."    "Iraq cannot have pre-conditions for the opening of the  pipeline as we are not the ones who closed it," he said.  "However we always support the continuation of bilateral talks  with Turkey."    Referring to the four-way meeting between Turkey, the United  States, Britain, and France which centered around the future of  the multinational force, al-Tikriti said such meetings meant the  intrusion into Iraq's internal affairs.    "Iraq is an independent country and Turkey is our neighbor  and friend, but we cannot accept the United States, Britain, and  France making decisions for the region," he said.    Al-Tikriti also claimed that the Kurdish problem in northern  Iraq was created by the West.    The ambassador said the Iraqi administration did not impose  a  blockade on northern Iraq.    "But the UN-imposed economic embargo affects the whole  country," he said.</p>

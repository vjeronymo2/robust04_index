			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific puts its future in Hong Kong - The airline has redesigned its livery to emphasise its Asian image The twin elements of Cathay Pacific's strategy for beating the recession in the airline industry came together this week when the Hong Kong-based carrier unveiled the first of its newly-acquired, long-range Airbus A340s sporting its new livery. The redesign of Cathay's corporate identity is meant to shift the airline's image from that of a British to an Asian airline. The acquisition of the A340s is intended to allow Cathay to offer a better service by providing more direct flights - especially in Europe - than it has currently been able to do. Cathay's investment in new aircraft - it has orders for Dollars 4bn worth of Airbus aircraft, produced by a European consortium - and the new corporate image underlines a third, but less stressed, aspect of the message it wishes to convey. This is that Cathay, which is currently 52 per cent owned by Swire Pacific, the UK conglomerate, has a future in Hong Kong after 1997. 'The old livery had been with us for more than 25 years,' says Mr Peter Sutch, Cathay chairman. 'It was distinctive and had done us proud, but its association is with old Hong Kong. I don't like to use the word 'colonial', but as with the tail, which used to carry the Union Jack (flag), the old livery was outdated. We wanted something that reflected that change: we wanted something Asian in appearance: we wanted a quality look with an Asian flavour.' This desire came from the fact that nearly 80 per cent of Cathay's passengers are Asian. The research Cathay conducted as part of its image redesign underlined its overwhelmingly Asian customer base, and that it was not 'catering quite as much as we should to these customers'. Although Caucasian travellers saw Cathay as an Asian airline, Asians, who perceive the airline as being well-managed and safe, did not. Cathay is trying to change that. The airline now offers a wider range of Asian meals and has begun to communicate in Asian languages. In-flight information and reading materials are now provided in Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as English. Furthermore, as the result of a management reorganisation last year the airline's four general managers in charge of routes were given greater authority to alter the services to reflect local taste. Taiwanese travellers, for example, want to eat real Chinese food and want to buy duty-free goods on board. Within the constraints of a one-hour flight Cathay is attempting to meet that need. Mr Sutch says the airline always thought the Boeing 747-400 would serve its long-haul aircraft needs, but the recession in the airline industry and changing consumer tastes altered that. 'Serving smaller airports with the 747 became exceedingly expensive as landing fees and over-flight fees rose,' he said. As the airline was flying half-full 747s to Zurich via Rome it found it was losing out to Swissair and Alitalia which were offering a direct service and operating the smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11. 'We had a good formula in Asia where we used TriStars on the smaller routes but 747s on the big routes such as Tokyo and Singapore,' says Mr Sutch. 'We thought a similar approach could be used on long haul. Zurich couldn't justify a non-stop 747 service - the market is not big enough  - so it became a choice between the Boeing 777 or the A340. At the end of the day, while the 777 is a superb aircraft, the economies of a four-engine aircraft for ultra-long haul are better than those for a two engine aircraft.' The Airbus had two other advantages. Cathay preferred the seat configuration to that of the 777. The A340 offers six abreast in business class, rather than seven abreast for the 777, and eight abreast in economy, rather than nine abreast. Another compelling factor was 'commonality'. There are many common features between the A340 and its smaller sister aircraft the A330, and indeed the even smaller A320. This means that pilots do not need to spend as much time learning to fly others in the Airbus family once they have learned to fly one. This is a large cost saving for airlines and leads to greater pilot productivity as they can be switched between long- and short-haul routes. Cathay is probably the only airline which has its future regularly questioned. The change from UK to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 is something which leads many to question whether China will allow Cathay to exist in its present form while being UK-controlled. Earlier this year Cathay received welcome reassurance of its future when China Southern Airlines, the Canton-based mainland carrier, withdrew from discussions to buy Air Hong Kong, a small local air freight carrier. Cathay was the other bidder and when China Southern withdrew it snapped up 75 per cent of Air Hong Kong for HKDollars 200m (Dollars 25.88m). What was interesting about China Southern's withdrawal was Beijing's intervention. Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, personally intervened to prevent China Southern buying Air Hong Kong. Failure to have done so would have undermined, possibly fatally, the guarantee to Cathay implicit in Sino-British agreements that it would be the sole airline for Hong Kong after 1997. Mr Sutch demurs when asked about the Air Hong Kong talks - in which he represented Cathay's interests. 'I understand that (China Southern) did not have the wholehearted support of the authorities in China. 'If that is the case then it was just another reflection of the policy of the state council, namely, that Hong Kong should be able to develop independently as it has in the past.' Inevitably, the firmness of Swire's 52 per cent ownership of Cathay is questioned. Mr John Godfray, conglomerates analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong Kong, believes that after 1997 Swire may well find it prudent to trim its stake in the airline to below 50 per cent. He believes a merger between Cathay and Dragon Air might be the answer. 'It is logically possible to wrap them up into one group,' he says. Without commenting directly on Mr Godfray's suggestion, Swire executives concede that as things develop there may be a need to conduct some fine-tuning of the Swire shareholding, but nothing dramatic. 'One has to be realistic,' observes one executive.</p>

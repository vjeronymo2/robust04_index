			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Currency board warning Currency boards, which issue local notes and coins convertible into a foreign reserve at a fixed rate, are unlikely to solve the long-term problems of monetary instability in east European countries, Ms Anna Schwartz, a monetary expert and colleague of Mr Milton Friedman, said last night, Emma Tucker writes. Speaking at the annual Wincott lecture in London, Ms Schwartz said such a system would not work because political authorities in modern democracies do not want to give up discretion over monetary policy. However, the example of Argentina, which has recently established a currency board arrangement whereby the peso is fixed to the US dollar, suggests 'rules rather than discretion are now thinkable by heads of government', said Ms Schwartz.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] An attempted coup has taken place in the central  African country, Burundi. It was organized by Tutsi Army  officers. The Burundi Army chief says the coup has failed.  Other reports say it is still in progress. The Army is still  controlled by the minority Tutsi people in Burundi.    All members of the Burundi Government have gone into hiding,  probably in a Western embassy. This was confirmed to the BRTN  [expansion not given] by the interim president, Ntibantunganya,  last night.    Meanwhile the Army has taken action against three rebellious  Hutu districts in Bujumbura. These are surrounded. The Tutsi  military want to disarm militias from the majority Hutu people.  The minister of defense has asked all inhabitants of the Hutu  district to leave to prevent innocent victims.    The Belgian Embassy has asked all the Belgians in Bujumbura  to stay inside.    Some Hutus formed military militias in the last few days.  This followed reports from the Hutu party, Frodebu, that the  Army is preparing for violence against the majority Hutu people.

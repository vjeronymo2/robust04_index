			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / European interest rate cuts likely AN EARLY round of European interest rate cuts looked more likely yesterday after Denmark cut its discount and key deposit rates by 1/2 point to 8.25 per cent, writes James Blitz. The Danish authorities may have been encouraged to make the move by the krone's strong performance against the D-Mark in recent days. Some dealers also noted that the French authorities had allowed the cost of overnight funds to drift down by 0.2 points to about 7.15 per cent, bringing it closer to the intervention rate, which marks the effective floor for France's rates. The intervention rate has not been cut since the exchange rate mechanism's bands were widened last month. Currencies, Page 15</p>

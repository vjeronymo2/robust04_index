			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with LDP President Yohei Kono by TOKYO SHIMBUN </F> correspondent Makoto Ogino; place and date not given; last  paragraph is TOKYO SHIMBUN conclusion]    [Text] [Ogino] What is your evaluation of the Hosokawa  administration?    [Kono] They are even worse than I expected. In particular,  they have absolutely no capability of handling economic policies  for redressing the recession. The government's pump-priming  package came out too late, and it will cost a lot to make up the  loss caused by the policy failure. As for its diplomatic  policies, the coalition destroyed the favorable Japan-U.S.  relations that had been built up by the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP]. The LDP cannot support such an administration. We shall  confront them.    [Ogino] The LDP is taking a strong stand on the 100 million  yen in loans to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa from the Sagawa  Kyubin Co. Do you intend to defeat his government over this  issue?    [Kono] Right now, Mr. Hosokawa's involvement in the scandal  is the primary reason for the public's distrust of politics.  The public will never become confident in politicians unless he  fully explains his own position. Depending on Mr. Hosokawa's  attitude, our party may promote campaigns to defeat the cabinet.  We will determine our course of action depending on Mr.  Hosokawa's attitude.    [Ogino] Several LDP leaders noted that the next general  election may take place even before implementation of the new  electoral system. What is your comment on the remarks by LDP  members?    [Kono] I do not really know whether those people meant that  the election is technically possible or whether they actually  want to hold the election right now. But, in my opinion, there  are still certain possibilities of such an event.    [Ogino] What do you say about the coalition parties' moves  toward a realignment of political parties?    [Kono] A certain circle in the coalition is discussing  interparty tie-ups without consideration for a conformity of  policies. I wonder whether it is worth calling such moves a  political realignment.    [Ogino] But even the LDP may be involved in the moves. Don't  you think so?    [Kono] The coalition is just seeking its own survival  without  dealing with pressing political issues. The LDP has a policy to  cope with such an irresponsible administration. We have no  intention of listening to proposals from them.    [Ogino] Some of coalition parties are seeking the so-called  great coalition with the LDP.    [Kono] It may be possible for us to cooperate with the  coalition in such fields as public welfare or national security,  but this does not mean that we can support the coalition  government. Any temptation (from coalition parties) will never  damage the unity of the LDP.    [Ogino] It appears that former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe is showing a positive stand toward a tie-up with the  coalition....    [Kono] The LDP is various individuals, and members may hold  various personal opinions. But I believe that their actual  behavior as LDP members is another story.    [Ogino] Do you think it is possible that a major breakup  will  occur in the LDP and that some members will join some groups in  the coalition?    [Kono] I think that is unlikely. The LDP is a party of  various people who gathered under the great framework of  liberalism, democracy, and the market economy. The LDP is  functioning as a stabilizer of the Japanese political scene  because it consists of wide-ranging political opinions. If the  LDP were a more ideological and exclusionary party, the  political scene would have been extremely unstable.    [Ogino] What is your plan for adjusting the LDP's lower  house  members to the new single-seat constituency system?    [Kono] The party's Internal Reform Headquarters is expected  to formulate guidelines for the nomination of candidates in  mid-April, and the Election Committee will prepare for election  campaigns in line with the guidelines. I would like to prepare  a well-planned system so that all our candidates can win.    [Ogino] What is your strategy for winning back power?    [Kono] It is very difficult to win back power when the  Hosokawa administration maintains a high level of public  support. However, the administration is rapidly losing its  popularity because the public is becoming aware of its real  nature. In particular, I am talking about the increase in its  negative ratings. We will try our best to increase support for  the LDP, and we must urge the Hosokawa administration to step  down from power when it lose the support of the public.    At the interpellation in the beginning of the present Diet  session, Mr. Kono clearly said that "the Hosokawa administration  is ready to be overthrown." However, it appeared that he still  has no strong determination to seek the dissolution of the  administration, or the lower house at any rate. While he said  that the breakup of the LDP would "never" occur, the party is  likely to face rough going hereafter over party tickets for the  next general election.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Head of State Lamine Zeroual is continuing his  meetings with the various political parties, national figures,  and social and economic organizations. Following the statement  issued yesterday by a political party that indicated that the  leaders of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] were to  participate in the current national dialogue, a source close to  the presidency said that this matter was related to a biased  interpretation of the content of Zeroual's talks with the  various parties that he has received to date.    The same source recalled the content of the statement issued  by the presidency on 18 March on the eve of the resumption of  the national dialogue. [passage omitted]    It is worth mentioning that Head of State Lamine Zeroual has  met to date with the National Liberation Front [FLN], the  Movement for Democracy in Algeria, the Islamic Society  Movement-Hamas, the Ennahda Movement, and the Party of Algerian  Renewal [PRA].</p>

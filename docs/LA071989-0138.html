			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'STRICKEN' PILOT WAS SEEN MOVING IN PLANE  </P> <P> Military pilots who chased Thomas Root on his flight down the East Coast saw  his head move back and forth several times during the 800-mile trip when he  claimed to be unconscious, a federal investigator said today.  </P> <P> Andrew Alston, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board  said military pilots also noticed changes in the position of the sun visor on  the plane's windshield.  </P> <P> And officials said a blood test screening for carbon monoxide in Root's blood  system turned up negative, raising further questions about whether he fell  unconscious.  </P> <P> Root was confronted with the pilots' accounts this morning but was unable to  explain the movement, Alston said. Root has maintained that he lost  consciousness and traveled on autopilot before ditching in Bahamian waters last  week.  </P> <P> "Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the right his head  would turn to the right and as he was intercepted from the left, his head would  move to the left," Alston said. "The sun visor moved position at least three  times during the flight."  </P> <P> Alston said any criminal investigation about the mystery flight would be  handled by the FBI.  </P> <P> Root, 36, remains in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood with a  gunshot wound to the abdomen. He has said that he doesn't know why he passed  out during the flight and claimed that his .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson  revolver, kept in the plane's glove compartment, discharged during the crash.  </P> <P> Dick Bachmann, vice president of Smith &amp; Wesson, told the AP that the gun's  safety features make such accidental firings impossible. "Suggestions that it  could are absolutely false," he said.  </P> <P> And Witt, a veteran homicide investigator, told the AP there was "indisputable  scientific proof" that Root's bullet wound was at least four hours old when he  arrived at the hospital.  </P> <P> Witt's claim supported the findings of U.S. Coast Guard surgeon James Rahman,  who has said that peritonitis -- or inflammation of the abdominal cavity --  showed Root must have been shot at least two hours before he was rescued.  </P> <P> "All this would indicate that Mr. Root is being less than truthful," Witt said.  </P></p>

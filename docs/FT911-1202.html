			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Innovation - the government's role and industry's challenge (1) Sir, For many years those of us who manage manufacturing companies have realised the importance of innovation to our companies' competitive performance. Your leader, 'And Ridley Begat Lilley' (May 1), stressing the need to improve innovation, will therefore encourage those of us trying to gain a competitive advantage by incorporating new products and processes into our business and financial policies. More welcome was your call for the DTI actively to promote and encourage innovation. You are right - government can influence a number of areas which have an important bearing on innovation; chief among these is the skills training needed to implement the technology. Also, government can encourage collaborative R&amp;D with industry, even entering into partnerships. The DTI can provide product and technical information, lay dawn compatibility and standards policy, better protect intellectual property and encourage the financial institutions to consider product development as an important objective and invest in it long term. However, given the record of the DTI over the last 10 years your call will fall on deaf ears. How refreshing, therefore, to turn the page of the same edition and find Mr Gordon Brown - a Labour MP - explaining that under a Labour government the DTI would actively apply itself to these matters by which government can so influence innovation. The conclusion must be that Labour's industrial policies deserve more sympathetic consideration and support. Simon Haskel, chairman, The Perrotts Group, 63A Ockendon Road, N1 3NL.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Pin-up will help re-shape Japan's politics: The nine main opposition parties are seeking a new name Japanese politics has become enlivened by Ms Fumie Hosokawa, a former pin-up whose curvaceous shape elicits the envy of half the electorate and the admiration of the rest. Ms Hosokawa, unrelated to the former prime minister of that name, has been chosen by Japan's nine main opposition groups to join a panel to choose a name for the mega-party they plan to form next month. They hope it will deliver the final blow to the conservative Liberal Democratic party's weakened monopoly on power. It may mark a step from the present arcane wranglings, which has left nearly 45 per cent of the electorate unable to support any political party, to a more coherent balance of power between two or three evenly-matched players. Ms Hosokawa, a television personality who whimsically confesses she knows nothing of politics, is a walk-on player in the newest of the series of realignments that have over the past 18 months, opened cracks in Japan's power structure and let in much fresh air in the process. The starting signal for the latest realignment came on Sunday, when the party that triggered the present upheavals, an LDP breakway group called the Japan New party, disbanded two-and-a-half years after its formation, in order to pave the way for a merger with its eight opposition allies. The marriage of the nine is due to take place at what is billed to be a spectacular celebration on December 10 in Minato Murai 21, a futuristic complex around the world's most expensive building in Yokohama. The organisers no doubt hope it will symbolise the new party's trend-setting aspirations. Ms Hosokawa and the other 15 members on the opposition's party-naming panel are due to announce the title of the new group, to an orchestral fanfare in Minato Murai 21, conducted by Mr Tsutomu Hata, former prime minister and karaoke supremo. The opposition nine formed a parliamentary voting bloc last month under the name of Kaikaku, or renovation. They have been provisionally named by the local media as Shin-Shinto, or New-New party. Nobody has suggested a catchier alternative, though a Y200,000 (Pounds 1,273) mystery gift from the opposition and a tour of parliament awaits the winner of a public competition to find one. The razzmatazz surrounding the birth of the New-New party, or whatever it will be called, is a consequence of the sharper competition for power emerging ahead of a new electoral system and tougher controls on fund raising to take effect from January. The old system, in which assiduously cultivated personal relationships are what counts, is being challenged by the vote-catching smile of Ms Hosokawa and the public image of her professional political colleagues. Ideologies on each side are about the same, so presentation is what matters. This is starting to look like a US election campaign, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun daily complains. To accuse Japanese politics of becoming like the US may be looking a long way ahead. Yet it is true that the the present 13-party Babel that inhabits Japan's lower house of parliament is embarking on the final stage of the search for a more orderly balance of power. It might even, say supporters of reform, pave the way for an ideological debate about Japan's future. All involved in Japan's political realignment know they must complete their regrouping soon. This is partly because the new system, which favours large parties, will take effect (barring the unexpected) in two months. To add to the urgency, Japan faces local elections next April, followed by elections for half the upper house in July. A general election could come at any time, depending on the whim of the government and the New-New party's skill in wooing defectors from the ruling side. So it is that the old and some new relationships on both sides of parliament have been melted fast by Ms Hosokawa's smile and by the political heat to come. Soka Gakkai, the influential Buddhist movement, announced last week that it will abandon its traditionally exclusive support for Komeito, the Clean Government party, which Soka Gakkai formed 30 years ago and is now a mainstay of the opposition. Mr Koshiro Ishida, Komeito's leader, even said he would support a former LDP man as candidate for leadership of the New-New party , so removing one of the main obstacles to agreement on a leader for the opposition nine. Main candidates include Mr Hata and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, another ex-prime minister. Both are former LDP heavyweights. Existing alliances are similarly up for renegotiation among the three-party ruling alliance of LDP, Social Democratic party and New Harbinger party, former enemies who joined forces last June to oust Mr Hata's coalition government. The shared interests of the three government parties are surprisingly strong, thanks to the SDP's decision to dump most of its old foreign, defence and fiscal policies. Yet, gutted of its core ideologies, the SDP now looks ready to implode. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the first SDP prime minister in 47 years, admitted as much recently when he assented to plans by his party's majority right wing to form yet another new party. This would embrace like-minded politicians from government and opposition, of obvious interest as a potential ally for the new-new party. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, power behind the scenes of the New-New party, is tentatively seeking to woo the SDP defectors to cross the floor of the house and rejoin him, just as the SDP did, to its regret, in the previous two coalition governments. According to Tokyo political gossip, Mr Sadao Yamahana, leader of the defectors from the right-wing of the socialists, might be offered the chance of becoming prime minister of a future New-New party government, to help him make up his mind whose side to join. The prospect of a new government under a prime minister from the same party as the old one might sound fanciful. Yet it illustrates the high-stakes bargaining now under way as Japan's fragmented political factions struggle to reorganise along clearer lines.</p>

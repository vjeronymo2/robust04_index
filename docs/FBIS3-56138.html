			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 12 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- A whole range of  forecasts about an allegedly inevitable reform in the Interior  Ministry system have appeared in mass media in the last few  days. Hypothetical assumptions are also being made about  personnel changes, says a statement released today from  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary.    However, absolutely no such conclusions can drawn from the  decree "On the structure of federal executive bodies" signed by  the Russian president a few days ago. The government structure  outlined in the decree retains the Interior Ministry, only  specifying its constitutional accountability to the Russian  president.    It is only natural that the logic of reforms leads to  changes  both in the government and in the operation of individual  ministries. However, as far as the Interior Ministry system is  concerned, I have been authorized to state that the president  and the government have no short-term plans either to reform  Interior Ministry bodies or to make any personnel decisions,  says the statement from the Russian president's press secretary.</p>

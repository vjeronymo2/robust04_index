			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television There is, it seems, nothing the BBC will not now do to disguise the fact that they are showing yet more repeats. BBC2 screens the first of three profiles of famous modern architects, Master Builders, billing them as a 'New Series'. In fact they are repeats of items already shown on 'The Late Show'. Today's subject is Philip Johnson, 86, who was once more than a little sympathetic to Nazism (7.45). Since the enthusiasm for demonising one faction in the Bosnian civil war seems highly dubious to me, I shall be interested to see Joan Philips' programme in C4's Free For All (8.00). We are told that the BBC's Martin Bell is among those who support her assertion that journalists have not given enough attention to covering all sides. The third of BBC2's series about the Mongol hordes, Storm From The East, finds a monk, Friar John of Plano Carpini, being sent out to eastern Asia to investigate 'the devil's horsemen' and arriving in time to witness the enthronement of The Great Khan (9.45). BBC2 also offers a 'Late Show' special on The Art Of St Ives.</p>

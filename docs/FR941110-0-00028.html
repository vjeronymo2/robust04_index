The rule eliminates a 2-year landing requirement for permit renewal, which had an unintended detrimental effect on lobster fishery permit holders. The rule also modifies existing notification and reporting procedures. The implemented changes are intended to improve administration, monitoring, and enforcement of the fishery.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  December 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of Amendment 8 and the associated environmental assessment may be obtained from Ms. Kitty M.

A proposed rule to implement Amendment 8 was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40515). The proposed rule provided background on the following provisions of Amendment 8: (1) Removing the requirement for a vessel to land at least four lobsters for each trap normally used during 1 of the 2 most recent years in which fishing was allowed as a condition of permit renewal; (2) establishing a framework procedure for reviewing, with the possibility of changing, the target catch-per-unit-of effort (CPUE) used in the formula to derive the quota for the fishery from 1.0 lobster per trap-haul to a number that is more reflective of the current status of the lobster resource; (3) establishing a framework procedure authorizing, under some circumstances, fishing for the purposes of obtaining fisheries data or alleviating economic hardship, when the initial quota is zero; (4) requiring vessel owners to notify NMFS of the location and time of offloading of their catch; and (5) requiring information from the first-level buyer to be attached to the Sales Report, if available, and requiring first-level buyers to make records of their transactions involving management unit species available to authorized officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The measures establishing framework procedures for the review and possible change of the target level of the CPUE in the model used to calculate the annual quota and to allow fishing under some circumstances when the initial quota is zero (numbers 2 and 3 above) have been disapproved by NMFS. These two measures are neither necessary nor appropriate for conservation and management of the fishery as required by section 303(a)(1)(A) of the Magnuson Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There has been a substantial decrease in recruitment to the lobster fishery. This, the total closure of the fishery during the 1993 season, and the great difference between the initial quota and the final quota during the 1994 season has prompted a complete review of the model used to determine the annual quotas and the quota system in general. For this reason, the provision allowing changes in the target CPUE pursuant to framework procedures is premature. Any change in the model should be postponed until an analysis of the model is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purposes of the framework procedure under which fishing might be allowed when the initial quota is zero are to obtain fisheries data or to relieve economic hardship. The proposal to consider allowing fishing to relieve economic hardship is ambiguous because the term ``economic hardship'' is not defined. Without defining the term, it is unclear how and when allowing fishing would be considered and how it would meet the goals of the FMP. Allowing fishing to collect data duplicates section 681.26 of the implementing regulations regarding experimental fishing. Issuing experimental fishing permits is an effective way of allowing fishing that ordinarily would not be permitted so that fisheries data can be collected. The other provisions of Amendment 8 have been approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment and Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only one comment was received on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One individual commented that eliminating the landing requirement gives the resource in perpetuity to those who currently hold permits. He felt the point system for new entry should be maintained. The holders of these permits may or may not view the fishery as a long-term trust. This commenter also indicated it was a mistake to allow the transfer of permits given that carrying capacity now exceeds the capacity of the resource.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issues of maintaining the point system or not allowing the transfer of permits are not within the scope of Amendment 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the landing requirement, coupled with transferable limited entry permits, was intended to ensure that there always would be sufficient capacity to harvest the optimum yield. The number of permitted vessels was based on an assumption of stable recruitment and would provide the greatest economic return from the fishery. Presently, productivity of the resource is low and the harvesting capacity of the fleet is greater than needed; however, the Council did not propose changing the number of permits allowed in the fishery. There are numerous restrictions to protect the resource, including size limits, a closed season, protection of berried females, and a quota based on productivity of the resource. When productivity is low, the quota is low.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliminating the landing requirement relieves vessel owners from fishing for lobster when investing fishing effort would be poor business; therefore, an unforeseen and unintended economic burden will be removed. The point system has not resulted in and would not be expected to result in new entry. Permits are transferable, and permit holders would likely transfer permits rather than forfeit them. In addition, at low quota levels, there may be risks of overrunning the quota before the fishery can be closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

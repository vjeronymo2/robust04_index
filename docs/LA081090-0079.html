			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMBIA BEING READIED FOR LIFTOFF IN UNPRECEDENTED SHUTTLE SHUFFLE  </P> <P> The repaired space shuttle Columbia inched past its grounded sistership  Atlantis and was returned to the launching pad Thursday for liftoff around  Sept. 1 on a critical flight to end NASA's long summer that saw no shuttle  launchings.  </P> <P> In an unprecedented shuttle shuffle, Atlantis, crippled by a fuel leak, was  rolled off launching pad 39A late Wednesday to make way for Columbia.  </P> <P> The two vessels passed each other shortly before dawn Thursday, with Columbia  completing its 3.5-mile trip to the seaside firing stand around noon.  </P> <P> If all goes well, Columbia, carrying five astronauts, two civilian astronomers  and a cargo of telescopes, will blast off around Sept. 1 on a 10-day astronomy  mission that was grounded on May 30 by a hydrogen leak. The ship has since been  repaired.  </P> <P> If the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's revised launching  schedule holds up, only seven shuttle missions at most -- possibly as few as  six -- will be launched this year. The space agency originally hoped to launch  as many as 10 flights in 1990.  </P> <P> One flight was lost because of problems readying the shuttle Discovery for  launching earlier this year to carry the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in  April, and fuel leaks with Columbia and Atlantis have prevented any flights  since then.  </P></p>

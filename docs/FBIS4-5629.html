			<p>BFN     [Text] Unemployment in Australia has fallen to 10.3  percent, prompting a government prediction that the rate would  end at 10 percent by the end of the year. Linda Mottram reports  the March figure is the lowest since November 1991, down from  10.5 percent in February:    [Begin recording] [Mottram] Driving the continued fall is  seven consecutive months of employment growth. Seven thousand  more jobs were created in March, but they were part-time rather  than full-time positions. But the government is very encouraged  by the figures overall. Federal Employment Minister Simon Crean  predicted the jobless rate would be below 10 percent by the end  of this year, disputing OECD claims that the jobless rate would  remain in double digits for two more years.    [Crean] The figures show that we have done better than what  the OECD suggests. I believe we can get below that figure in  the not-too-distant future, but it will only happen with the  continued strong economic growth.    [Mottram] The federal opposition also welcomes the lower  number of jobless, but opposition leader John Hewson maintains  the country is locked into 10 percent-plus unemployment.    [Hewson] We are concerned that it seems the improvement in  the labor market seems to be slowing and we are now left with a  situation. We've still got over 900,000 people without paying  jobs and over 50 percent, or about 50 percent, are those who are  long-term unemployed. [end recording]</p>

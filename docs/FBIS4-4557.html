			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 1 April Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade  and industry, told a news conference on 1 April after a cabinet  meeting that "if an annual report on foreign trade barriers  recently compiled by the United States is linked to sanctions to  be imposed in accordance with the Super 301 provision, Japan  cannot watch idly with indifference." Commenting on the  inclusion of three priority sectors discussed at the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks in the annual report, he stated, "If  the Super 301 provision is applied to the three sectors, the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks would collapse. Both Japan  and the United States need to work to avert such a situation.  They should resume the framework talks to discuss bilateral  economic issues in a calm atmosphere and work for a conclusion  of the framework talks. This is the way to expand and balance  Japan-U.S. trade." In this way, Mr. Kumagai urged the United  States not to abuse the annual report and stressed the need for  resuming the framework talks.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DESPITE 2ND DC-10 INCIDENT, FAA CHIEF SAYS PLANE IS SAFE  </P> <P> The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said today that despite a  second incident of a DC-10 engine breaking up in flight the McDonnell Douglas  wide-body plane remains safe to fly.  </P> <P> FAA Administrator James Busey said the fact that the pilot on the Northwest  Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Minneapolis shut down the tail engine and  made a safe emergency landing in Denver on the remaining two engines Wednesday  night showed the system worked.  </P> <P> Busey told a press conference that the Northwest plane's engines were built by  Pratt and Whitney, unlike the one on the United Airlines plane that  disintegrated on a Denver-to-Chicago flight July 19.  </P> <P> A total of 111 people of the 296 aboard the United flight died when the plane  crashed and burst into flames trying to make an emergency landing in Sioux  City, Iowa.  </P> <P> The United engine, whose parts sprayed through the plane's tail section and  severed the DC-10's main and two backup hydraulic control systems, was made by  General Electric.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government-Industry Study  </P> <P> After the incident, the FAA announced a joint government-industry study into  the ability of wide-body planes to survive after such catastrophic incidents.  </P> <P> It said the study would later extend to other planes with similar hydraulic  systems that terminate in the tail section.  </P> <P> Busey said there was no reason to ground the DC-10 as a precautionary measure.  He said of the plane, "It's safe."  </P> <P> He said the two incidents were being investigated by the National  Transportation Safety Board and "when we know what needs to be done, then (we  will) take the requisite action."  </P> <P> Busey added that it would be irresponsible to act without sufficient  information.  </P> <P> He said, "We know of no hard facts at this time that would lead us to take any  kind of action to ground the DC-10."  </P> <P> But Busey said, "Rest assured, as the facts become available out of the  investigatory process, we are prepared to take whatever action is indicated by  those facts.  </P></p>

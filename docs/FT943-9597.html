			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / CU in Pounds 322m rights to fund Victoire buy Commercial Union, the UK's strongest general insurance company, yesterday announced details of a Pounds 322m rights issue to help finance its Pounds 1.5bn acquisition of Groupe Victoire from Suez, the French holding company. The deal, signalled in June, coincided with further indications of a recovery in the UK general insurance market, with both CU and its rival, Perth-based General Accident, reporting better than expected first-half results. CU reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m - up from Pounds 66m - while GA posted even more impressive figures, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 203.2m, compared with Pounds 124.7m. Both companies have benefited from reduced claims, as well as efficiency improvements, more careful underwriting and rate increases, which followed industry-wide losses between 1990 and 1992. CU expects to pay about FFr12.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) for the main part of Groupe Victoire's life and general insurance interests, although the final price will be determined by Victoire's first-half performance. Approximately FFr800m of the consideration will be paid in the first half of 1995. The rights issue is on a one-for-eight basis at 475p per share compared with yesterday's closing price of 563p, up 11p. Societe Generale, the French bank, will acquire a further 21m shares at 533.89p, through a conditional placing and subscription agreement to raise Pounds 111.2m, increasing its stake in CU from 3 to 6 per cent. Suez will buy CU shares worth Pounds 70m, acquiring a stake of about 2 per cent. Societe Generale will also underwrite the rights issue along with Kleinwort Benson and Morgan Stanley, while its UK stockbroking arm, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, is arranging sub-underwriting with Hoare Govett and Cazenove. CU will pay some Pounds 200m from internal resources and is to borrow a further FFr7.65bn after agreeing five-year bank facilities with a syndicate consisting of Societe Generale, Citibank, Barclays and National Westminster. The loan will increase CU's debt to Pounds 1.1bn, raising gearing to 55 per cent. Mr John Carter, chief executive, said the deal would increase the proportion of revenues generated by life insurance and improve earnings quality. Suez, which should be left with cash of around FFr8bn, intends to increase its interests in the financial services sector, according to Mr Gerard Worms, its chairman. He said the group might invest further in life insurance and was interested in expanding its Banque Indosuez subsidiary's presence outside Europe. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 19</p>

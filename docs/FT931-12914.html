			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Lamont details economic factors THE CHANCELLOR issued the following statement: Interest rates are set to meet the government's target of 1 to 4 per cent inflation, as measured by the 12-month growth rate of the retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments. There was a slight rise in this measure of inflation in December, from 3.6 per cent to 3.7 per cent. However, the latest information suggests that, notwithstanding the impact still to come from the easing of policy undertaken in the autumn and the recent more buoyant surveys of consumer and business confidence, a further 1 per cent reduction in short-term interest rates is consistent with the necessary restraining influence on inflation. Indicators taken into account include: A fall in broad money in December, bringing annual growth in M4 below the bottom of its monitoring range, and the continuing low level of bank lending. While M0 growth was quite strong in December, this has not been reflected as expected in strength in retail sales, which fell by 0.7 per cent seasonally adjusted in the month. The rate of pay settlements has fallen appreciably over the autumn. Unit wage costs in manufacturing fell in November, and in the latest three months were just  1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier. House prices have continued to fall following the cuts in interest rates in the autumn, albeit much more slowly on average over the last two months. Producer output price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) was 2.4 per cent in November and December, the lowest since April 1969. Manufacturers' input prices (excluding food, drink and tobacco) rose by 7 per cent between August and November (seasonally adjusted), but fell marginally in December.</p>

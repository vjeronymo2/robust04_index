			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Kuwait toughens funds law KUWAIT'S National Assembly is tomorrow expected to approve a law to enhance public scrutiny of the Gulf state's overseas investments and considerably toughen the punishment for individuals found guilty of misusing public funds. The law would be the strongest yet promoted by the 60-seat assembly, which was elected in last October's general elections, and a clear signal by the opposition-dominated parliament of its determination to force more open accountability for Kuwait's remaining overseas wealth. The parliament's move follows widespread concern in the Gulf state following the revelations last year of billions of dollars of losses from the Spanish holdings of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office and evidence of possible improprieties. The bill is due for a second reading during tomorrow's weekly sitting of the assembly but would become law only after promulgation by the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah. The legislation would require all state companies, and those in which the Kuwait government holds a stake of at least 25 per cent, to report to the government's auditors all changes in investments within as little as 10 days of the transaction. The auditors would also be required to report on all state investment activities to the assembly every six months. Delay in reporting investments would be liable to prosecution, while anyone found guilty of misusing public funds would face a sentence of life imprisonment, up from a previous maximum of 10 years. The move, which diplomats in Kuwait City expect to win the backing of the emir himself, is aimed at addressing a popular feeling in Kuwait that the country's previously substantial overseas investments have been managed with too much secrecy and too little accountability. Before the Gulf war, the KIO handled a portfolio worth an estimated Dollars 100bn (Pounds 65.7bn), though this is believed to have fallen to nearer Dollars 30bn or less after sales and drawings to help pay for Kuwait's substantial post-war costs. Both the government, through the prosecutor-general, and the assembly, through its own parliamentary committee, are investigating the KIO's Spanish and other investments. It remains unclear whether the proposed law would permit retroactive prosecution for any individuals found to have been guilty of misuse or misappropriation of the KIO's funds, the bulk of which were financed out of a portion of Kuwait's oil revenues. Neither is it clear whether the law would apply to two officials of the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company who were charged earlier this month with conducting illegal transactions.</p>

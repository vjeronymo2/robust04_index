			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Ukraine's PM vows to fight corruption VOWING TO fight corruption, Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's newly-appointed prime minister, yesterday purged ex-communist functionaries from his cabinet and replaced them with industrialists and nationalist politicians. In a hard-hitting speech which won the applause of parliament, Mr Kuchma asserted that 'the wholesale theft of the country is taking place . . . Government officials have used chatter about market reforms to disguise their incompetence and dishonesty'. As a specific example of corruption, he cited this year's re-export of 8m tonnes of Russian oil. Mr Kuchma said the re-export of oil sold by Russia at subsidised rates had unfairly enriched bureaucrats and left Ukraine with an energy shortage. Among other examples, he named Mr Volodymyr Horiunov, head of the state oil concern and an associate of Mr Vitold Fokin, the former prime minister, saying his refinery had re-exported fuel without a state licence. As the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, looked on, Mr Kuchma won parliament's approval for a new cabinet which will exclude a troika of ex-communist functionaries - former deputy prime ministers Mr Valentyn Symonenko, Mr Oleh Slepichev and Mr Konstantyn Masyk. Mr Ihor Iukhnovsky, a respected physicist from western Ukraine who led the nationalist block in parliament before Ukraine became independent, takes the number two job as first deputy prime minister. Mr Vasyl Ievtukhov, leader of Ukraine's industrial lobby, was also appointed a deputy prime minister. The key ministries of defence and foreign affairs were left untouched, but Mr Kuchma, who took a trip to Moscow just a week after becoming prime minister, called for a thaw in Ukrainian-Russian relations. 'This government will put an end to the economic cold war with Russia,' he said. Judging by his appointment and his brief statement to parliament, Mr Kuchma seems intent on reshaping the former Soviet Union's second largest economy in the image of the efficient but state-dominated military industrial complex where he built his career. The 'order' he promises is likely to be order of an old-fashioned variety: Mr Kuchma, who spoke warmly of the Chinese economic model, lambasted Ukraine's reform-minded central bank for what he described as its preference for lending to commercial banks rather than bailing out Ukraine's state factories. Mr Kuchma asked for and obtained an instant change in the constitution to bring under cabinet authority the central bank and the State Propety Fund, the body which oversees privatisation.</p>

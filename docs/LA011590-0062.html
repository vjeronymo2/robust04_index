			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> MINORITIES CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF 2 PAPERS  </P> <P> A boycott of Boston's two major newspapers was called by a group of minorities  to protest "racist attitudes" in the investigation of the slaying of a city  furrier's pregnant wife. The Boston Boycott Committee, which calls itself a  grass-roots group of blacks and other minorities, urged a boycott of the Boston  Globe and the Boston Herald from today to Jan. 22.  </P> <P> The group expressed outrage over initial media reports that a black Boston man  had been considered as the prime suspect in the slaying of Carol Stuart in the  city's Mission Hill section. Investigators now believe Charles Stuart shot his  wife before wounding himself to conceal his involvement in the crime.  Meanwhile, new published reports cited more than 50 people who said that the  police made a practice of searching young blacks and Latinos in sweeps of the  working-class sections of the Mattapan, Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods  even before the Stuart shootings.  </P></p>

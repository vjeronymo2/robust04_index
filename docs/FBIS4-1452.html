			<p>BFN     [Text] Libreville, 28 Apr (AGP-GAB/PANA) -- Official  sources in Libreville have disclosed that on 26 April, there was  a technical reshuffle of the cabinet formed by Prime Minister  Casimir Oye-Mba on 25 March. The reshuffle follows the  resignation of Jean-Pierre Bagnena, leader of the opposition  Gabonese Socialist Party, and Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane,  member of parliament of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party.    Mr. Bagnena refused the post of secretary of state for  health  because he was not consulted beforehand, while Ntoutoume Emane  refused the post of minister of state control, decentralization,  territorial administration, and regional integration because he  was dissatisfied with the duties and functions assigned to his  department.    The resignation of the two ministers brings the number of  cabinet ministers down from 38 to 36. The presidential decree  which announced the technical reshuffle also stated that the  state secretariat for health has been scrapped. Furthermore,  the decree stated that Pierre Nziengui Mabilat, minister of  small- and medium- scale enterprises, has been named interim  minister of state control, decentralization, territorial  administration, and regional integration.</p>

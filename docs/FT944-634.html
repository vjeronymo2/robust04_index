			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): New issues A quiet week in the new issues market was enlivened by the news that BAS International Holdings, a supplier of low-cost soft toys, stationery and giftware, intends to float in the new year. BAS, which is based in Manchester, is hoping for a market capitalisation of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m after its debut. It plans to raise about Pounds 12m through the float. The company said that the money raised will be used to fund organic growth in the distribution business, and help finance a new regional distribution centre in north-west England. BAS is owned by Martin Abramson, chairman and founder, who has a 70 per cent stake, and Tyrone Farber and Richard Rosenburg, both managing directors, who hold 15 per cent each. The company, which operates through four subsidiaries, had total annual sales of around Pounds 22m and pre-tax profits for 1994 are forecast at Pounds 2m, against Pounds 992,000.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Strong rise in home sales adds to Treasuries gloom A STRONG rise in home sales, improved leading indicators and upbeat remarks on the economy from the chairman of the Federal Reserve left bond prices lower yesterday, although late short-covering lifted the market off the bottom. In late trading, the benchmark issue had recovered from an early  3/4 -point fall and was down  11/32 at 100 25/32 , yielding 7.924 per cent. The two-year note also bounced back from initial losses, and by late afternoon was unchanged at 99 27/32 , yielding 5.442 per cent. Prices opened easier and lost further ground on the news that US home sales rose 12.9 per cent in January, more than double the expected increase, and that the index of leading economic indicators had risen 0.9 per cent in January. They were the latest sets of data to point to a recovery in the housing market. Sentiment took a further knock when Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the recent easing of monetary policy was 'clearly working', and that he believed there was probably sufficient stimulus in the system to ensure a recovery. However, as he did at other recent Congressional appearances, Mr Greenspan left the door open for further interest rate cuts, which would act as a form of policy 'insurance' if economic growth was too sluggish. THE COMBINATION of the yen's weakening against the US dollar and the overnight drop in the US Treasury bond market helped push Japanese government bond prices lower yesterday. The dollar traded at Y130.05 in Tokyo on optimism about the state of the US economy, compared with Monday's Tokyo close of Y129.53. Traders said there was no sign of central bank intervention in Tokyo trading as the Japanese currency weakened. The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a yield of 5.41 per cent and closed at 5.44 per cent. The key June futures ended at 101.90, down from Monday's close of 102.18, having traded in a range of 101.86-102.14. Meanwhile, overnight unsecured call rates eased slightly, trading at around 5.56 per cent yesterday. The market is waiting for Friday's quarterly 'Tankan' report from the Bank of Japan in the hope that it will encourage a cut in the official discount rate. The report is expected to show growing pessimism among businessmen over the state of the Japanese economy. BUDGET and election worries prompted profit-taking in the UK government bond market yesterday, with long-dated issues losing over a quarter of a percentage point. Traders noted some switching from long-dated gilts into shorter maturities, but said market participants saw little scope for a significant advance in gilt prices over the next few weeks because of the UK Budget and election campaign. Trading was mainly futures-driven, with yesterday's volume of 29,000 contracts well above average. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 116 9/32 to 115 31/32 . Among short-dated stocks, the 10 per cent gilt due 1996 slipped from 102 3/32 to 102.00. GERMAN government bonds regained their early losses to close higher on the day, with the March Liffe bund futures contract rising from its opening of 88.07 to trade at 88.19 by late afternoon. Traders noted some switching out of five-year bunds into shorter-dated issues, mainly two-year paper. The market remained fairly quiet because of the holiday: in the futures market, only 23,000 March futures contracts and about 24,000 of the June contracts were traded . The June futures contract takes over from the March contract this week.</p>

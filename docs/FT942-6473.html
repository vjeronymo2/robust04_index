			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Funds for UK arms of metal group Metallgesellschaft, the German metals group, has injected fresh funds into two UK subsidiaries as part of its policy of strengthening core trading activities. The move comes in spite of deep financial troubles at the company. The paid-up capital of its London Metal Exchange trading business, Metallgesellschaft Ltd (MGL), has been increased from Pounds 33m to Pounds 47m (Dollars 70.5m). Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of MGL, claimed this made his company the most heavily capitalised ring-dealing member of the exchange. In the six months to March 31, MGL - which is 86 per cent-owned by Metallgesellschaft, 9 per cent by MIM of Australia, and 5 per cent by Nissho Iwai of Japan - made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.3m, compared with Pounds 10.4m for the whole of the previous 12 months. Metallgesellschaft has also injected a Dollars 30m long-term subordinated loan into The Metal and Commodity Company, its physical non-ferrous metal trading arm in London.</p>

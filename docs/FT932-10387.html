			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Rebuilding the mill: an exceedingly slow grind: Clive Fewins on a group of pensioners who are restoring a landmark NINETEEN years after they started work, Quainton Mill's 'Magnificent Seven' at last have their end in sight. When the small group of enthusiasts started restoring the windmill as a retirement project in 1974 they thought it would be a five- or six-year task. The mill is Victorian, it stands 75ft and when it was built it was the most up-to-date in the Vale of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire. In 1984 the group decided not to hold a tenth birthday celebration as there was so little visible progress. Nine years later they are in a jubilant mood, as they have just completed the massive task of building and erecting the four 30ft wood and canvas sails, each weighing a ton. Last weekend the sails turned successfully and tomorrow, Sunday, to celebrate National Mills Day there will be tours of the mill and a photographic exhibition inside. 'Who knows, we might be milling in time for the millennium,' said the project leader, architect Patrick Tooms. At 61 Tooms is one of the younger members of the group. They hope to complete the task in four to five years, and that they will be able to achieve this using entirely voluntary labour without exceeding the original budget of Pounds 15,000. They have spent some Pounds 13,000, of which about three quarters came in grants from various public bodies and the New Horizon trust, which supports unusual activities by retired people. 'Heroic' would be a fitting word for some of the efforts of the restorers, for whom the first task was to rebuild from scratch the huge wooden gallery that surrounds the building at a height of 35ft, without the use of a scaffold. One of the next jobs was rebuilding the top few courses of brick-work so that they could start restoring the mechanism that allows the giant metal cap to rotate on a circular metal track on top of the walls. 'At the time we had a psychiatrist working with us whose hobby was bricklaying,' Tooms said. 'But that wasn't the only mad thing we have got up to.' Perhaps the maddest thing of all was building the mill in the first place. It is picturesquely but impractically sited in the lee of the hill that forms a backcloth to the village. It was this situation, coupled with the fact that the mill never worked very efficiently, that meant the basic structure of the building was in such good condition when the group started the restoration. Although the mill, the tallest in Buckinghamshire, was equipped with all the latest technology when it was completed in 1832, the one thing it always lacked was a good blow. So after a working life of some 50 years - latterly assisted by a huge steam engine - it was abandoned. It remained in that state, an eyecatching relic, until the late 1960s, when the parish council decided the community would benefit if it could be restored. 'Today people jokingly suggest that our main achievement has been to add value to every house in the village as the mill now adds so much to the character of the place,' Tooms said. 'Until we recog much of the main spur wheel - one of the major remaining tasks - and get all the machinery working, we shan't know whether there's enough wind to grind corn. It's a case of suck it and see,' said Tooms' right hand man, retired airline pilot Gordon Rodwell, 70. Nevertheless the great task continues every Sunday. The total workforce numbers nine, though there are never more than seven present at the weekly work sessions. The oldest member is retired sales executive Denis Moreton, 80, the youngest, and the only one who is not retired or semi-retired, is carpenter Bob Bleasdale, 40. There is an air of optimism in the group, and as part of the transition from millwrights to millers they plan to pay a joint visit to one or two of the four commercial working windmills in the country. 'We shall soon be able to run the machinery and see what happens,' Tooms said. 'We are used to taking one thing at a time, so no setback is too catastrophic. With an average age in the group of 63 all we hope is that we are all alive to see the end result]' Quainton Mill is open from 10am-1pm on Sundays.

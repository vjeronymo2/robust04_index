			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TICKETS FOR SAN DIEGO DAVIS CUP MATCH IN GREAT DEMAND  </P> <P> It has been six days since the Greater San Diego Sports Assn. began taking  phone orders for the April 7-9 Davis Cup, when the United States will meet  France in the Sports Arena, and 6,000 tickets already have been sold.  </P> <P> "We've been inundated with calls," said John Reid, executive director of the  sports association. "The Monday after the announcement was made we got so many  calls, no one got through. It was crazy."  </P> <P> The United States Tennis Assn. announced on Feb. 4 in Ft. Myers, Fla., that San  Diego had been awarded the cup match, and the GSDSA was immediately swamped.  The association added three phone lines -- "We wanted to take advantage of the  demand," Reid said -- to serve the tennis-hungry public.  </P> <P> According to promoter Irv Grossman, there are approximately 1,500 tickets left,  but the association will take orders beyond the arena's 8,500 configuration.  </P> <P> Tickets are being sold in a three-day package, with box seats selling for $120,  loge for $90 and terrace seating $60.  </P> <P> "Some people are disappointed because choice locations have been sold,"  Grossman said, "but we do have a waiting list."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed to use the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM) as the most appropriate diagnostic coding system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ICD is a classification system developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for recording morbidity and mortality information for statistical purposes, for indexing hospital records by diseases, and for storing and retrieving data. Effective with the Twentieth World Assembly of WHO, nomenclature regulations were adopted on May 22, 1967. Article 21(b)(2) of these regulations specifies that ``members compiling mortality and morbidity statistics shall do so in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death as adapted from time to time by the World Health Assembly. This Classification may be cited as the `International Classification of Diseases'.'' The United States is signatory to the WHO's agreements, which include the above nomenclature regulations binding the United States to the use of the ICD system for official government health statistical purposes. The nomenclature regulations became effective on January 1, 1968.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clinical modification of the ninth revision to ICD (that is, ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM) is a coding system for reporting diagnostic information and procedures performed on patients in hospitals or other types of health care delivery systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM was developed under the guidance of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to adapt the ninth revision of the ICD classification system to the needs of hospitals in the United States. The modifications were intended to provide a mechanism to present a clinical picture of the patient. Thus, ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes are more precise than those included in ICD&hyph;9 since greater detail is needed to describe the clinical picture of a patient than for statistical groupings and trend analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective January 1979, after nearly two years of development by numerous national experts on clinical technical matters, the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM became the single classification system intended for use by hospitals in the United States. This system replaced several earlier related but somewhat dissimilar classification systems. Once the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM classification system was in place, several errors and omissions were noted. Consequently, in September 1980 a second edition of ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM was published. The preface to the second edition noted that the continuous maintenance of ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM is the responsibility of the Federal government. The preface also stated that no future modifications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM would be made by the Federal government without considering the opinions of representatives of major users of the classification system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In September 1985, the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee (the Committee) was formed. This is a Federal interdepartmental committee that maintains and updates the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM. This includes approving new coding changes, developing errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM to reflect newly developed procedures and technologies and newly identified diseases. The Committee is also responsible for promoting the use of Federal and non-Federal educational programs and other communication techniques with a view toward standardizing coding applications and upgrading the quality of the classification system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Then she asked, "Do you  think men are looking for a sense of humor in women?"  </P> <P> Replied Jane: "I think men are looking for women who are naked. If they have a  sense of humor, it's a bonus. But naked is the key word."  </P> <P> Although she appears in comedy clubs around the country, Jane prefers to stay  close to home in Los Angeles so she can be available for acting auditions.  </P> <P> A couple of years ago, she starred in a play written and directed by Sean Penn  that ran in an experimental theater.

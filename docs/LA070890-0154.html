			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUBBLE BUILDERS GOT AWARD FEES, MAGAZINE SAYS;  </P> <P> SPACE: NASA PAID AS MUCH AS $1 MILLION IN BONUSES TO TWO TELESCOPE CONTRACTORS  FOR THEIR COST-CONTROL EFFORTS, A PUBLICATION REPORTS.  </P> <P> The government overpaid as much as $1 million in bonuses to two Hubble Space  Telescope contractors for their cost-control efforts on the device, whose flaws  have become a major problem for NASA, a magazine reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Congressional Quarterly reported in its Saturday edition that the overpayments  occurred at the same time costs for the expensive telescope were rising  dramatically.  </P> <P> The original cost estimate for the Hubble was $678 million, but its final price  tag was more than $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> The magazine said information about the bonus was contained in a July, 1989,  audit report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's office of  inspector general. The material was obtained through a Freedom of Information  Act request.  </P> <P> The Hubble telescope was launched April 24 and NASA announced June 27 that its  two main mirrors would not focus properly. A manufacturing error was suspected.  </P> <P> Congressional Quarterly said the inspector general's report accused NASA  management of "not properly considering all . . . cost overruns" in figuring  cost-control bonuses paid to Hubble's two principal contractors, Lockheed Corp.  and Perkin-Elmer Corp., now Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which built  the telescope's mirrors.  </P> <P> Lockheed received $14.4 million in bonuses and Hughes-Danbury was paid $6  million in bonuses through April 30, 1987, the report said. If NASA had fully  considered the cost overruns, the bonuses may have been reduced by as much as  $1 million, the report said.  </P> <P> Attempts Saturday to reach either of the contractors and NASA were  unsuccessful. But Congressional Quarterly quoted project managers at Marshall  Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., as disagreeing with the audit  conclusions but promising to implement many of the report's recommendations.  </P> <P> A Lockheed official also took issue with the report. The magazine said  Hughes-Danbury declined to comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs has reported on the memorandum distributed at the  Council of Europe [CE] in Strasbourg on 26 May in connection  with Romania's observance of the pledges it made at the time it  joined that body. The document replies, point by point, and  makes topical all the pieces of information contained in the  Koenig-Jansson report.    After taking note of the conclusions in the report that show  appreciation for the favorable basis existing in Romania to  further pluralist democracy and after acknowledging the toilsome  efforts made by the rapporteurs, the document points out certain  outdated pieces of information which have been overtaken by  recent evolutions in Romanian society as well as certain  inaccurate or distorted pieces of information stemming from the  fact that the sources were sometimes one-sided.    The memorandum also contains a number of additional  clarifications, such as the fact that on 17 May Romania's  president promulgated the law ratifying the European Convention  on Human Rights and its additional protocols and that Romania  acknowledges the exceptional importance of its adherence to the  European Convention on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and  Degrading Punishment or Treatment of Persons, a document which  it signed on 4 November 1993.    The competent commissions of parliament are examining two  draft laws on ethnic minorities, one elaborated by the UDMR  [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] and a second one  elaborated by the parliamentary group of [non-Hungarian] ethnic  minorities in the Chamber of Deputies. The education draft law  currently being debated in parliament is based on the  stipulations of the Constitution, which guarantee the right of  persons belonging to ethnic minorities to study in their mother  tongues and their right to education in their mother tongues.  The aforementioned draft law, the memorandum assesses,  surpasses the existing standards of the CE in the domain of  education and training in the mother tongues of ethnic  minorities.    The document elaborated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  also presents further information which has been made topical or  supplemented, ensuring the CE that Romania's Government will  make all necessary efforts to accomplish, as soon as possible,  all the pledges made at the time of the country's adherence to  that body.    In view of the fact that the procedures used in the process  of verifying are still being discussed by the [CE] Committee of  Ministers, the document assesses that the current system of  reports, in its existent form, is an outdated method of  verification.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major  General John Martin Inienger, says ECOMOG will discharge its  mandate in Liberia thoroughly as provided for in the Cotonou  accord. Gen. Inienger told a two-man UN delegation of electoral  advisers that among such obligations was the need to disarm all  the combatants in the Liberian crisis (?before) peaceful  elections are held in the country.    Gen. Inienger reiterated that the parties to the conflict  should demonstrate sufficient good faith by ensuring that the  disarmament process is quickly ended to create an enabling  environment for free and fair elections to be held. Gen.  Inienger expressed concern over the clear reluctance of the  parties to disarm as fast as it had been anticipated when the  date for the general elections was fixed.    An ECOMOG release says the field commander told the UN  electoral advisers that ECOMOG, a multinational group of  professional military men, has the responsibility of providing  security for free and fair elections to be held, but noted that  it was not within the scheme of duties of ECOMOG to determine  for Liberians what electoral system would be most suitable for  them to adopt in electing their leaders.    Gen. Inienger said what ECOMOG would be most delighted to  experience would be the day Liberians would once again  democratically elect their leaders as they had been doing since  the last century. He observed that the parties to the conflict  have not made the job of ensuring a healthy environment in  Liberia any easier for ECOMOG due to the internal problems being  faced by ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia] and fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the  NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeastern  Liberia.    Gen. Inienger said he hoped that those problems would be  solved and disarmament concluded before the 7 September date  fixed for the general elections. [passage indistinct]</p>

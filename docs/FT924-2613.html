			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wage cuts as Archer dives to Pounds 938,000 AJ ARCHER, the Lloyd's agency, is to cut senior staff salaries by at least 10 per cent as part of a vigorous programme of cost reduction. 'There has got be rationalisation,' said Mr Richard Maylam, chairman. Reductions in staffing - which has risen to more than 200 following the takeover of Kellett agencies - were not ruled out. Details of the moves emerged yesterday as Archer announced a sharp fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 938,000 (Pounds 3.12m) for the year to September 30. Earnings fell to 3.1p (8.7p) and although the dividend is maintained at 4.4p with a final of 2.2p, Mr Maylam warned that shareholders could expect a reduced pay-out next year. Archer announced cutbacks earlier this year but is now preparing more radical surgery in the wake of one of the most difficult years at the insurance market. Record 1989 losses of Pounds 2.06bn, which Lloyd's reported in June in line with its three-year accounting policy, have depressed profit commissions paid by Names to agents across the market. At Archer, profit commissions fell from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 718,000 and with further losses from the 1990 and 1991 years in store, the immediate outlook is gloomy. Operating expenses rose to to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 2.41m), the increase attributed to some Pounds 200,000 in costs arising from takeover negotiations between Archer and Cuthbert Heath, a rival agency. The talks were called off earlier this week after the two companies failed to agree terms. Mr Chris Burton, a director, said 'the impact of the cuts would be immediate and permanent', although precise details were still being worked out.</p>

Sofia Vieira reports:    [Vieira] According to the minister, the main foreign policy  objectives for 1994 are to strengthen diplomatic relations with  the United States of America and to strengthen cooperation with  Mozambique. During his appraisal of Portugal's role in the  international scene in 1993, Durao Barroso hinted that Lisbon  had enjoyed diplomatic success. The foreign minister recalled  Portugal's work in the European Union, with strong positions in  the Uruguay Round, namely regarding the textile sector and in  the debate concerning the reform of the Twelve's institutions  and in securing further structural funds for Portugal until 1999.    Durao Barroso also spoke of East Timor and Angola. Last year  every effort was made to conduct successfully the difficult  negotiations underway. For this year the minister promised that  Portugal will be even more committed to these issues, always  based on the main guidelines governing Portuguese foreign policy.    [Begin Barroso recording] A deepening of our expertise in  certain specific areas, of which the Portuguese-speaking  countries are a good example; strengthening this position before  our Community partners and others; the importance of the  transatlantic relationship, bearing in mind the opportunities  for cooperation opened to us in the context of the post-cold-war  era; a greater and better use of the mechanisms to which we can  resort on a multilateral basis, in areas such as promoting  respect for human rights; the promotion abroad of Portuguese  culture and language, and through that the country's image which  we project beyond our borders.

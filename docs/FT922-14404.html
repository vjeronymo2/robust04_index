			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Severfield-Reeve dives to Pounds 0.53m SEVERFIELD-REEVE, the USM-quoted structural steelwork group, reported a sharp decline in annual profits as the recession placed further pressure on tender prices. The final dividend is omitted. Nevertheless, Mr John Reeve, chairman, described the pre-tax outcome for 1991 - Pounds 530,000 compared with Pounds 1.86m - as a 'significant achievement when measured against the performance of the sector.' The result would have been better, he said, but for a bad debt charge of Pounds 200,000 which was taken above the line. 'We maintain a cautious approach when tendering for contracts and this has enabled us to avoid any bad debts in the current year.' Gearing at the year-end rose to 51 per cent, up six percentage points from the half-year statement. Interest payments of Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 412,000) were covered 3 times by operating profits of Pounds 1.1m. Both were adversely affected by the exceptional charge, Mr Reeve stressed. He also attacked current pricing levels: 'The sector cannot sustain the present idiotic level of pricing which has come about by panic tendering.' He expected a further reduction in overall capacity to correct over supply. Turnover dipped some 20 per cent to Pounds 16.9m and margins at the operating level slumped from 11.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. After tax and Pounds 12,000 minorities, earnings emerged at 4.2p (11.9p) per share. The final dividend is passed, leaving just the interim of 1p for the year (3p).</p>

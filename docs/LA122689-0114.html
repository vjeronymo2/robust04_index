			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WESTERN'S SABBARA GETS HIS KICKS PLAYING BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Sam Sabbara did not polish his athletic ability on the basketball courts of  Western High School, rather he honed his skills on the soccer fields in Jordan.  </P> <P> "(In Jordan) basketball is nonexistent and everyone plays soccer," said  Sabbara, a 6-foot-1 point guard at Western.  </P> <P> Sabbara first played organized basketball in seventh grade, five years after  his family moved from Jordan to the United States.  </P> <P> "I was a pretty good soccer player," he said, "but basketball intrigued me  more."  </P> <P> But if Sabbara started playing basketball late, he has more than made up for it  recently.  </P> <P> Take last week, for example. Sabbara, the Times' Athlete of the Week, scored 75  points in three games in the Fullerton tournament.  </P> <P> He scored 23 points and had nine assists and nine rebounds Friday to lead the  Pioneers to an 83-60 victory over Fullerton in the third-place game.  </P> <P> It was the second time that Western (6-2) finished third in a tournament this  season, each time losing in the semifinals to the eventual champions.  </P> <P> Sabbara has played a key role in Western's success. He is averaging 27 points  and eight assists a game.  </P> <P> Western Coach Greg Hoffman said those totals would be higher if Sabbara was  playing more. He averages only 21 minutes a game because he is taken out in the  fourth quarter of Western routs.  </P> <P> Sabbara is shooting 54% from the field, 54% from three-point range and 94% from  the free-throw line.  </P> <P> "I'm not blessed with the great height or the great body size," he said. "I'm  just an average guy. You need to work hard to become better."  </P> <P> In the off-season, Sabbara plays everyday if possible, looking for pickup games  from Redondo Beach to Irvine.  </P> <P> But Sabbara's true intensity shows during the season, including practice.  </P> <P> "He almost practices harder than he plays in the games," Hoffman said.  </P> <P> Hoffman said Sabbara, who is also Western's student body president, is a  natural leader who demands hard work from his teammates.  </P> <P> Sabbara is so demanding that Hoffman has asked him not to chastise his  teammates so vehemently in practice.  </P> <P> "I've had to tell him, 'That's my job,' " Hoffman said.  </P> <P> "Not all the guys are used to working as hard as Sam does. If they all worked  as hard as Sam, we would never lose."  </P> <P> Which is what Sabbara wants. He said the Pioneers have yet to play as a team.  </P> <P> "We don't match up with the south county boys talent-wise, so we have to play  harder and better to win," Sabbara said.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Rob Johnson was named the most valuable player of the Carson City, Nev.,  tournament after leading El Toro to the championship Friday. Johnson scored 18  points in the Chargers' 59-50 victory over Carson City in the championship game  and had 15 and 19 points in earlier tournament games.  </P> <P> Loara's Tes Whitlock scored 23 points as the Saxons (8-0) beat Villa Park,  90-73, and had 29 in a 67-64 victory over North of Riverside.  </P> <P> San Clemente center Eddie Morgan scored 79 points in three games last week. In  the San Dieguito tournament, he scored 29 points in a 93-90 double-overtime  loss to Newport Harbor. He scored 18 and had 13 rebounds in a 71-49 victory  over San Marcos and had 32 points and 14 rebounds as the Tritons beat Anaheim,  76-71.  </P> <P> Sam Sabbara  </P> <P> Western High School  </P> <P> * Position: Point guard  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 6-1, 170, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Sabbara scored 75 points in three games as he led Western to third  place in the Fullerton tournament.  </P> <P> * Season: Sabbara is averaging 27 points and eight assists.  </P></p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Clinton still requires a winning Nafta vision: The president's uphill battle to win the hearts of Congress PRESIDENT Clinton tomorrow formally launches his uphill battle to make the North American Free Trade Agreement acceptable to a dubious US Congress. With ex-presidents Bush, Carter and Ford expected at the White House for a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr Clinton will sign the supplemental agreements on labour, environment and import surges negotiated over seven months with Canada and Mexico. The White House is also hoping to acquire the salesmanship skills of Mr Lee Iacocca, former head of Chrysler and a pitchman notable enough to challenge Mr Ross Perot, leader of the strong Nafta opposition. There is now a determination in the White House to portray the pact, along with its side agreements, as 'Clinton's Nafta' and therefore one which should be more acceptable to labour and environmentalists. However, if the side pacts have won any adherents, they have yet to announce their conversion. As is usual with trade issues, the spotlight is on Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, whose backing is seen as key to Nafta's passage in the House. Mr Gephardt leaves a tantalising opening in his current insistence that he cannot support the pact - as it stands. Mr Gephardt has been demanding for a long time a fixed funding source, dedicated to pay for environmental clean-ups at the US-Mexican border and for worker retraining. An outline of the financing plans may be released tomorrow. The administration plans to propose a scaled down version of a North American Development Bank. However, this could be expanded by Congress, where there is support for an institution capable also of start-up business loans in districts threatened by job losses. Currently, the proposal is to limit the Nadbank to environmental projects at the border and to locate it within the InterAmerican Development Bank. However, congressional supporters of a larger bank may well prevail when the plan gets to Capitol Hill. It has been suggested that Mr Gephardt might find acceptable a cross-border tax which would provide the embryonic funding for a Nadbank. The tax would be 'finite' - in place only until it raised the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m) currently envisaged from the US and Mexico for paid-in capital - which may make it acceptable to the business lobby. Vice President Al Gore yesterday suggested that the implementation of Nafta may be delayed beyond its scheduled launch on January 1 1994. He acknowledged that the vote may not come until early next year, but scoffed at press reports that the administration is backing away from the controversial agreement. The White House has established a Nafta 'war room', reminiscent of the quick-response team which won high praise for its wit and speed in last year's presidential campaign. Nafta captains are in place - Mr Bill Daley, an accomplished Democratic backroom deal-maker, and Mr Bill Frenzel, a former Minnesota Republican congressman - although neither has been visible much in public. Mr Clinton's lack of enthusiasm in defending Nafta has fuelled doubts about his commitment to the cause. He has seemed remote from the fray, unable to inspire the public and unwilling to articulate a vision of an expanded home market with more jobs to gain than to lose. He can hardly be pleased about the rift it is creating between the moderate and liberal wings of the Democratic party. However, reports that the White House is backing away from Nafta have 'enraged' the administration. One jubilant official said: 'The political will is there; the fight is now starting.'</p>

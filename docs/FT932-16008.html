			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Inner-city phoenix is slow to rise: George Graham chronicles the attempts to revive small businesses in the wake of last year's riots IN THE inner city of Los Angeles, the credit crunch which many US small businesses complain about takes on a different form. Many businessmen - under the shadow of last year's riots, and amid fears of more to follow - believe that banks may remain reluctant to lend in the inner city and that scarcity of capital will prevent them catching the rising tide when southern California eventually emerges from recession. Also, many Los Angeles banks complain that the shortage is not so much of bank capital as of qualified borrowers with sound proposals for commercial loans. Founders National Bank, the only black-owned bank in California, sits in the middle. Set up two years ago from the remains of a failed savings and loan institution, Founders has been able to attract new capital in the wake of riots. Arco, the Los Angeles-based oil and gas group, has invested Dollars 1m in the bank. Bank of America sold Founders two of its branches in south central Los Angeles, taking payment in Founders preferred stock and capital notes. Mr Carlton Jenkins, Founders managing director, says he can turn these stakes into 15 times as much investment in the south central community where he grew up. He hopes to announce other investors shortly. 'We have just tried to be a good model of corporate creativity and show by example that you can do business in the inner city and make money,' he says, noting that Founders made a Dollars 1m profit in its first year and will report one of about Dollars 1.3m for 1992. But Mr Jenkins notes wryly that his own business has had no luck with traditional sources of finance such as investment banks or pension funds. 'I still don't have any investment bankers knocking on the door. I think it is principally because my little bank sits in the inner city,' he says. Finding sources of finance remains a problem for business people in the inner city. 'We have a lot of entrepreneurs who are at a level that, with a good shot of capital and a bit of 'mentoring', they could take one of these chicken restaurants we have and turn it into a chain,' says Mr Jenkins. Rebuild LA, a private sector task force set up after the riots last year to try to help spur investment and economic development in the more depressed areas of Los Angeles, hopes to meet a part of this need by setting up an equity fund to make investments of between Dollars 250,000 and Dollars 1m in expanding businesses. Dr Kathleen Connell, an academic and investment banker who chairs RLA's business investment task force, hopes to raise Dollars 10m. With backing from the federal Small Business Administration, that could turn into a Dollars 40m pool. The fund is expected to be ready for launch in June. One side effect of the fund may be to remove an excuse for financial institutions which say they would really like to invest in the inner city but somehow never quite get around to it. 'They all say they are looking for the vehicle. We are going to give them the vehicle,' says Dr Connell. As important, however, may be the need for much smaller capital injections to bring people with entrepreneurial potential into the formal economy - for example, to help an illegal street vendor buy a shop. Finance at this level can be difficult for a bank to take on. A recent survey of minority-owned banks doing business in riot-affected areas of Los Angeles showed that most complained of unsophisticated borrowers with inadequate financial statements, non-existent business plans, limited borrower's equity and a lack of financial guarantees. Disney, the entertainment group, has undertaken a project in Los Angeles providing loans of less than Dollars 20,000, at interest rates below 5 per cent over five years, to small entrepreneurs without collateral. The loan funds are administered by Los Angeles Renaissance, a programme run by the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in south central Los Angeles. Some of the city's Asian communities have well-established networks for informal financing, but Dr Connell says this form of silent capital does not exist to the same extent in the black or Hispanic communities. However, Mr Greg Hightower, who was able to secure finance to buy a cleaning business on south central's Crenshaw Boulevard when the former owner moved out after the riots, considers himself living proof that the money is there if you look hard enough. 'It's not like it's Battle Creek, Michigan - there's a lot of money out there,' he says. 'You're in Los Angeles. If you just keep spreading the word, you might get lucky.'</p>

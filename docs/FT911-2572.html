			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Manufacturing in search of a silver lining: The CBI's worries over when a recovery in production will take place ARE they waving or drowning? The question is being asked of UK manufacturers, whose capability to mount a sustained recovery from the recession is coming under scrutiny. The Confederation of British Industry last week said that parts of manufacturing industry were in a slump, with order books in many sectors lower than for 40 years. In recent weeks, official statistics have shown a slowing in the rate of growth of exports and a large decline in manufacturing output between January and February. Publication tomorrow of the latest CBI quarterly survey will give a more detailed view of manufacturers' prospects. Even though manufacturing accounts for just over a fifth of total UK output  -down from a third in the mid 1970s - the sector has a disproportionate importance for the UK economy. Many other parts of the economy, including most service sectors, feed off it. Four fifths of UK exports are factory-made goods. Since manufacturing production reached an all-time peak last March, it has fallen by more than 7 per cent. In that period, employment in the sector has declined by about 170,000 - some 3 per cent of the workforce. The CBI expects another 300,000 jobs to be lost by the end of 1992. Many manufacturers are pinning their hopes on an economic upturn around the summer. The likely path of any recovery is bound up with the changes in UK manufacturing since the 1980-81 recession, which claimed 2m jobs in the sector. Since then, according to one argument, companies have become better managed, more efficient and subject to fewer disruptive labour practices. Others, however, point to a large projected fall in manufacturing investment this year. They are also concerned about the disappointing results in recent years by British businesses in high-tech areas such as electronics and advanced engineering. Mr Correlli Barnet, a Cambridge historian who is a specialist on Britain's industrial decline since the Second World War, says: 'During the 1980s we have seen a lot of successful site clearance (in manufacturing), but not enough reconstruction.' Central to the argument is the CBI's forecast that manufacturing investment will fall this year by 17 per cent, after a 5 per cent decline in 1990. That followed several years of high ing for a big reduction in outlays on plant and machinery in the early 1980s, it leaves levels of investment in UK manufacturing no higher than they were at the start of the decade. According to some, that puts Britain at a disadvantage compared with other countries such as Japan and Germany, where production companies have steadily increased investment during the 1980s. One point of view is that companies will need to increase capital spending during the 1990s at a greater rate than during the past decade. Against that, Mr Giles Keating, director of economic research at Credit Suisse First Boston, a Swiss-owned stockbroker, argues that bald figures do not always give an accurate description of the usefulness of new investment. 'A lot of spending on capital now is more efficient than it was 10 years ago,' he says. In bare statistical terms, however, the outlook does not look promising for British factories in terms of investment. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, non-residential fixed capital formation in Britain - which includes much production-related investment - will decline by more than 3 per cent this year. On the positive side, in recent years exporters have reversed the long-term decline in the proportion of world trade accounted for by UK goods. The proportion now stands at just over 6 per cent, as against just under that figure in 1986. Even though manufactured exports have grown at a healthy rate over the past decade, imports have increased faster. That led Britain to switch from a surplus on factory-made items of Pounds 3bn in 1980 to a deficit last year of Pounds 11bn, itself an improvement on the record deficit in 1989 of Pounds 17bn. In spite of the recession and what many in industry argue is an overvalued exchange rate, exports held up well last year and are still growing - albeit more slowly. In volume terms the underlying level of manufactured exports - which exclude erratic items such as ships, aircraft and gems - grew by 9 per cent in 1990. However, if the first quarter of 1991 is compared with the first quarter of 1990 the comparable rate is only 2 per cent. Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist at the Engineering Employers Federation, believes that the export record gives only one side to the story. He says that a large part of the increase in exports over the past few years is represented by the assembly or repackaging of imported manufactured goods, particularly in high-value areas such as advanced electronic equipment. Although such 're-exporting' of goods bought from other countries is a factor of all modern industrial economies, Mr Thompson suspects that the growth of the phenomenon has been stronger in Britain in recent years than in other nations - although that is difficult to prove with hard data. 'My contention is that the UK manufacturing sector will not be big enough to support the kind of expanding economy that we need in the 1990s,' he says.</p>

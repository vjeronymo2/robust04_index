			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. BURTON ON ERADICATING COCA CROPS IN SOUTH AMERICA  </P> <P> Burton ignores two laws: the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1989,  U.S.; and the resolution by the United Nations, signed by 80 nations, to  control drug abuse and chemicals.  </P> <P> If these laws were fully implemented, we could shut down most, if not all, drug  production in the Andean nations.  </P> <P> It would not be necessary to violate the borders, infiltrate nor negotiate with  the countries.  </P> <P> The laws prohibit the importation of the necessary chemicals to make cocaine.  The drug war can be won by an offshore, peaceful shutdown of these chemicals.  It will not be necessary to eradicate crops or create hostility by using  air-dropped plant-killing chemicals that will no doubt go astray and create  other problems.  </P> <P> It is obvious that any activity within the producing nations will be met with  strong resistance, assassinations, etc. The laws are in place -- now for the  will to use them.  </P> <P> JOHN ANDERSON  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Clinton plans 'new approach' to North Korea President Bill Clinton said yesterday he planned to discuss a 'new approach' to North Korea at his meeting in Washington today with President Kim Young-sam of South Korea, Our Foreign Staff reports. The US has been reported to be considering a less confrontational approach over North Korea's refusal to accept international inspections to ensure its nuclear programme remains frozen and that it is not moving to acquire nuclear weapons. Speaking at a White House press conference Mr Clinton said: 'It was obvious to me that no one in the region wants North Korea to become a nuclear power, so we're going to do everything we can, in close consultation with the countries most affected in the region, to try to find a resolution to this.' He said he expected to announce an initiative after meeting Mr Kim. Mr Clinton discussed the issue with several Asian leaders in Seattle last week.</p>

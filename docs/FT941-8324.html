			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / IG Metall steels itself for strike Germany's engineering industry will face its worst labour conflict in more than 10 years if employers persist with their demands for a pay freeze and an end to holiday bonuses, Mr Klaus Zwickel, president of the IG Metall union, warned at the weekend. The union had enough reserves to fund stoppages for several weeks, despite the cost of DM41m (Pounds 16.1m) a week for every 100,000 people called out, he said. Bracing members for selective strikes, expected to start in the second week of March, Mr Zwickel said talks could resume only if employers tabled a firm new offer. However, industry officials showed no signs of obliging. Mr Dieter Kirchner, chief executive of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, said he no longer believed a peaceful settlement was possible. IG Metall had removed the prospect by demanding the employers should surrender their position as a precondition for further talks, he added. The union's national leadership is due to meet in Frankfurt today to select the region in which to call the first strike ballot. The old industrial heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse and the northern part of Baden-Wurttemberg, are among the most likely targets. The choice will depend on the union's chances of causing maximum national disruption by cutting off supplies of parts and equipment for factories elsewhere, and regional leaders' reports on the likelihood of winning maximum backing in a ballot. Strike action requires a 75 per cent Yes vote. Despite the apparent inevitability of stoppages, observers suggest the conflict will be short-lived, although bitter. Employers have warned they will resort to lock-outs at non-striking factories affected by stoppages elsewhere. If no negotiated solution is found in the period between the ballot and the start of strikes, industry observers expect the two sides to agree to binding arbitration sooner rather than later. Both sides have already shown considerable flexibility. The union has backtracked on original claims for wage rises of up to 6 per cent, while employers have relaxed their insistence on the scrapping of holiday bonuses, worth some 75 per cent of a month's pay. The main difficulty has arisen over the issue of how workers should be paid for working flexible hours - between 30 and 40 hours a week according to individual factories' needs. Although both sides have already accepted this in principle as the most suitable means of slowing the rate of job cuts, Gesamtmetall claims the union's demands will raise hourly pay rates and unit labour costs. The employers justified their original proposals, based on a nil pay increase, with claims that German wages were making the whole industry uncompetitive. Labour costs in the automotive industry, for example, are now almost double those in the UK. Although the figures are not strictly comparable, since social contributions account for 43 per cent of German wage bills compared with 27 per cent in Britain, such disparities are blamed for the wave of engineering job cuts, running at around 30,000 a month. The most damaging engineering strike in recent history was in 1984, when IG Metall led stoppages for several weeks in pursuit of reduced working time.</p>

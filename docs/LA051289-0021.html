			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SMITH THE CATALYST AS BRAVES WIN SEVENTH IN ROW  </P> <P> Maybe it was only fitting that on a night when the Flyers' Stanley Cup bid was  extinguished by the Montreal Canadiens, the Philadelphia Phillies would be  tormented by Lonnie "Skates" Smith and Tom Glavine, a former second-round draft  pick of the Los Angeles Kings.  </P> <P> Smith, who earned the nickname "Skates" for the way he spun his wheels  offensively and defensively for the world champion Phillies in 1980, was guilty  of high-sticking and slashing as he singled, doubled, homered, stole two bases  and scored three runs in Atlanta's 8-3 romp at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Glavine, a high-scoring high school center in the Boston area who has competed  against several current NHL stars, improved to 5-0 with his second victory over  the Phillies in a week.  </P> <P> Smith has stamped himself as a comeback player of the year candidate with a  blistering start that has earned him a spot high in 10 of the National League's  12 major offensive categories. He was the driving force behind Atlanta's  seventh consecutive victory, its longest winning streak since May 15-22, 1986.  </P> <P> Smith had drug problems in the past, one reason the Phils traded him to  Cleveland for Bo Diaz.  </P> <P> "I cried when that happened," Smith said. "I love Philadelphia. I was hurt when  they traded me, that's one reason I reacted so badly when it happened."  </P> <P> Smith tried to convince managements in Philadelphia and St. Louis to sponsor  his comeback before landing in Atlanta. He is now batting .342, leads the  league with 28 runs scores and has a .587 on-base percentage. He's second in  the league in stolen bases with 13 and in hits with 41.  </P> <P> "I just have the desire to play right now and I'm happy," explained Smith of  his best start, better even than when he was the MVP runner-up in 1982. "I  don't know how long it will last."  </P> <P> Glavine's start is the best by a Brave pitcher since Pascual Perez went 5-0 in  1983.  </P></p>

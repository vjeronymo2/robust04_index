			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / November trade at record levels The recent improvement in the UK's visible trade performance continued in November, with Britain recording its lowest underlying deficit with non-European Union countries since January 1988. If oil and erratic items such as precious stones are excluded, the November deficit with non-EU countries was Pounds 293m, down from Pounds 390m in October. According to the Central Statistical Office, increased exports of chemicals, material manufactures and some finished manufactures were responsible for the improvement. The overall deficit narrowed slightly to Pounds 361m, from Pounds 420m in October. Both exports and imports reached record levels, boosted by increased trade in precious stones. The CSO said that the trend was for a flattening in the deficit. In the first 11 months of the year the deficit was Pounds 5.4bn, compared with Pounds 8.6bn in the same period last year. There were further positive signs for manufactured goods. The UK had a deficit of Pounds 146m in finished manufactures in November, up slightly from Pounds 124m in October. The Pounds 571m deficit for the three months ending in November was the lowest three-monthly total since July 1991. Imports of semi-manufactures jumped between October and November. Mr Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC markets, said: 'This points to further strong growth in manufacturing output in the months ahead.' Export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, rose 3.5 per cent between October and November to reach a record, while imports increased 2 per cent. In the three months to November export volumes were 8 per cent higher than a year ago, while imports fell 2 per cent. The CSO said, however, that its estimate of the trend in volume was of continued growth in exports, with some signs of imports turning up. Import prices have been falling in recent months, due to a drop in the dollar and yen against sterling. Balance of payments figures for the third quarter, which include trade in invisible items such as services and tourism, will be published today.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EU COUNTRIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Ex oil and erratics*               Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992           46,774    56,430    -9,656    40,687    48,124    -7,437 1993           57,469    66,724    -9,255    50,036    57,415    -7,379 1993 Q4        15,235    16,856    -1,621    13,583    14,969    -1,386 1994 Q1        15,323    17,430    -2,107    13,263    15,217    -1,954      Q2        15,665    17,166    -1,501    13,571    15,178    -1,607      Q3        16,210    17,207      -997    14,005    15,096    -1,091 June            5,289     5,697      -408     4,566     5,046      -480 July            5,445     5,803      -358     4,616     5,013      -397 August          5,412     5,718      -306     4,672     5,040      -368 September       5,353     5,686      -333     4,717     5,043      -326 October         5,319     5,739      -420     4,737     5,127      -390 November        5,634     5,995      -361     4,924     5,217      -293  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

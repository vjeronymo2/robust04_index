			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Farmers gave free apples  to pedestrians in Tokyo's Ginza District Wednesday [20 April] to  protest imports of apples from New Zealand.    The first batch, a sample consignment of some 50 kilograms,  was due to arrive at Narita Airport on Wednesday. Some 100 tons  of New Zealand apples will arrive by ship in mid-May.    Apple imports were liberalized in 1971, but with only minor  exceptions were essentially banned, with agriculture officials  citing risks associated from insects possibly arriving with the  imported apples. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry, however, cleared New Zealand apples for import last  June.    Japanese apple growers are now attempting to devise ways of  producing apples at equally competitive prices. The apples  given to Ginza pedestrians came from Aomori Prefecture in  northern Honshu, where much of Japan's apple crop is grown.    Ginza pedestrians receiving the free apples were told they  risk ingesting residual agricultural chemicals if they eat  imported varieties.    Wednesday's imports, a variety known as "Royal Gala," are a  sample batch brought in by the New Zealand Embassy for testing.    Consumers will not find New Zealand apples on supermarket  shelves until late May. Apples from the United States are also  expected in Japan in autumn.    Transport and insurance costs for the Royal Gala apples will  effectively put them in the same price range as locally grown  ones, but future bulk imports are expected to result in price  drops.</p>

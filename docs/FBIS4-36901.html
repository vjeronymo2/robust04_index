			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish] </F>   [Text] Opposition parties strongly suspect the positive  response of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) to their  demand for making the long-awaited national dialogue more  inclusive is nothing but a "conspiracy" to divide their own  ranks. Opposition figures argue that the NDP, by including the  chairmen of all political parties in a preparatory committee,  sought to give "opposition doves the opportunity to swallow up  opposition hawks".    In a letter to President Husni Mubarak last month, the  opposition demanded the inclusion of all parties, regardless of  their size or role, in the preparatory committee. Mubarak, who  chairs the NDP, responded positively and decided to expand the  committee from its original 25-member set-up. The committee's  exact make-up, however, is yet to be announced, although it was  said at the time that its first meeting would be held the first  week of May.    Opposition figures feared that the minor, and largely  moderate, parties would automatically align themselves with the  NDP if they were represented on the preparatory committee, and  would back the NDP in what the opposition views as its attempt  to impose a "government-inspired" agenda on the proposed  dialogue, thus pouring water on the burning issues opposition  hawks seek to raise.    The NDP's decision to enlarge the preparatory committee  "appears to be a positive response to opposition demands but in  fact it is aimed at ensuring that a significant number of  opposition parties take sides with the NDP and its  government-inspired agenda", said Dr. Hilmi Murad, deputy  chairman of the Islamist-oriented Labour Party.    At issue is the opposition demand, to which the NDP objects,  that political reform be given top priority on the dialogue's  agenda. Murad fears the minor parties would back the NDP's  position that economic reform should take precedence over  political questions.    Lutfi Wakid, deputy chairman of the leftist Progressive  Unionist Party [NPUG], described as positive the NDP's decision  to enlarge the preparatory committee. "But what really counts  is action on the ground, the government's response to the  people's demand for greater democracy," Wakid said. "Only when  the dialogue materialises and results are achieved will we be  able to say whether the NDP's decision was a good move."    Wakid said the decision, in itself, does not prove the good  intentions of the ruling party. "It could be aimed at bypassing  the opposition's demands," he said. "The course and results of  the dialogue alone are what counts."    Murad, for his part, rejected repeated assertions by Safwat  al- Sharif, the NDP's assistant secretary-general, that the  hoped-for dialogue would not be a "dialogue of confrontation".  Al-Sharif had argued the NDP did not plan to face the  opposition across the negotiating table but, rather, all parties  would be involved in the exchange of views.    But for Murad, a confrontation is inevitable. "The NDP has  its declared policies and the opposition parties have declared  theirs," Murad said. "If the NDP Government plans to simply  listen to the opposition's views, the dialogue will be useless.  The government must have the true readiness to be persuaded  that other (opposition) policies might produce better results  than its own policies."    However, Murad added this did not mean opposition parties  shared identical positions. Wakid likewise noted there are  "clear contradictions in opposition ranks", declaring some  opposition parties were "more reactionary" than the NDP. As an  example, he said the NPUG and Wafd shared similar positions on  the demand for greater democracy and public freedoms but were  divided by basic differences on the questions of social and  economic development.    Murad conceded that the opposition parties were divided on  the agenda of the proposed dialogue, but said coordination  between them was possible. He stressed, however, that political  reform should top the agenda "since political reform must  constitute the basis of all other reforms, providing solutions  to other problems".    Murad argued political reform would spell the end of  terrorism. "All parties condemn terrorism in all its forms, but  the dialogue is not meant to produce a declaration of  condemnation. We should search for ways to uproot terrorism.  Here, the importance of political reform emerges. Once young  people have confidence in the ballot boxes, everybody will  respect the decisions taken by the majority, even though those  decisions may run counter to some people's interests," Murad  said.    He said the NDP's Government did advance solutions to some  problems "but those solutions did not work as a result of other  actions by the same party. This underlines the importance of  political and democratic reform to create the opportunity of  democratic change through the ballot boxes," Murad said.</p>

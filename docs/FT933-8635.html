			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Losers in a Gatt deal Sir, While Adrian Hewitt and Sheila Page (Letters, August 4) rightly stress the overall economic gains to developing countries from the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade package, they fail to point out that these gains will be unevenly spread. Their own work, as well as that of others, shows that the very poorest countries may lose out. The world's poorest countries will suffer from the erosion of the value of their current trading preferences, higher prices for imported food, and a decrease in bargaining power resulting from the new investment regime. Their heavy reliance on primary products and a lack of capital, skills and technology mean that they stand to gain little from the trade liberalisation and a growth in world income. In our haste to conclude the Uruguay round, let us not forget the needs of the poorest. Peter Madden, Christian Aid, PO Box 100, London SE1</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.F. Potapchenko, director of the SET </F> limited-liability partnership: "Computerized Information Data  Processing at the Service of Transport"]    [Text] In order to unite the railroads' efforts to  accelerate informatization and develop the infrastructure for  computerized information data processing and the area of data  processing services, the Association for Practical Cooperation  in the Area of Establishing, Developing and Operating  Computerized Systems in Rail Transport (the SET Association) was  established at the beginning of 1991. Its tasks included the  practical development of long-range standard planning decisions  for computerized systems, the improvement of servicing systems  for computers and peripheral equipment, the exchange of  experience in incorporating standard developments, and the study  of the world's computer market. With the assistance of the SET  Association, the railroads received an opportunity to conduct an  antimonopoly policy with respect to the producers of computer  equipment and the developers of computerized systems. This is  being achieved by analyzing the competing proposals of computer  suppliers and organizations of experts and alternative research  and development of computerized system hardware.    In 1992, the SET Association was converted into a  limited-liability partnership called "Contemporary Electronic  Technology in Transport" (TOO SET). A total of 24 railroads  (eight of them railroads in the countries of the near abroad),  three scientific and engineering centers, and three enterprises  servicing computer equipment were among the founders.    A general meeting of representatives from the founding  railroads elected a Council of Empowered Delegates to manage TOO  SET activities. Within the TOO SET framework, this body  implements technical policy in the area of establishing,  incorporating, and expanding computerized systems in rail  transport, which the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways has  developed.    TOO SET functions as an independent juridical person with  complete self-financing. The profit received from providing  services (basically from shipments of computer equipment) is  directed toward the fund for expanding production and the  special funds formed for designing computer equipment for rail  transport. There have been definite successes in this, which  must be mentioned.    The development of a technology for transmitting operational  information to the computer network of a line enterprise having  remote installations, yards, stations, loading and unloading  frontages, sections, and approach lines with the help of  portable information recorders occupies the central place. The  solution of this technical problem will permit one to obtain not  only the complete work technology of the stations and sections,  but also the planned effectiveness from incorporating electronic  document turnover. TOO SET is developing a portable information  recorder based on using the experience of the VNIIZhT [All-Union  Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transport] and the  Scientific Research Institute for Railroad Automation. The need  to supplement train and freight information in non-regular  situations arises even with the availability of automatic  information output. In addition, global automation for reading  information is not always economically advisable and requires  that it be combined with less expensive technical solutions at  installations with negligible work volumes. The use of a  portable information recorder will permit one to monitor the  authenticity of information directly when performing freight and  commercial operations and to correct a mistake on the spot when  necessary.    The technical specifications for the portable information  recorder provide for connecting the device to the Transport  series radio station and also to intra-station wire  communications when possible. Standardization of design, which  allows for the possibility of an electric power source, both  from the radio station, using a convenience outlet, and from an  independent power source, using a plug-in unit, is provided for.  The portable recorder can be used by the freight car data  collector and inspector during the commercial inspection of the  rail cars at the checking point, container site, and permanent  way division sections. For this, the personal computer for the  radio channel or wire communications channel automatically  installs the program for processing the information units that  is appropriate for this operation in the information recorder  when the user of the recorder plugs into the "type of  information." A sufficiently voluminous indication area permits  the portable information recorder operator to carry on a  dialogue with the PEVM [stationary computer], receiving  management and reference information from it in order to  eliminate detected errors.    The design of the portable information recorder permits one  to use it under difficult climatic conditions having a large  range of unfavorable temperatures and humidity; the luminescent  display insures operations when there is insufficient  illumination. At the present time, work on the design plans and  specifications for the portable information recorder is being  done. Trial operation and introduction are planned during the  first quarter of 1994 at installations of the Gorkiy Railroad.  Series production will begin in 1994.    The subject second in importance within TOO SET plans is the  development of a standard multi-task and multi-terminal computer  complex based on the PEVM for the line enterprises of the  railroads. This development will permit one to reduce the  resulting cost of one automated worker position (ARM) by a  factor of 2.5 to three, in comparison with the version that  embodies a computer for individual use at each work position.  This complex should be responsive to the peculiarities of the  technical processes in processing train and freight information  at stations, depots, and other line enterprises, and those  involved in bookkeeping and accounting at the machine  calculating stations of the railroad divisions. These  peculiarities are characterized by standardized document forms,  a regulated sequence of events and operations, and the presence  of a common data base concentrated in one computer. Technical  solutions that permit one to combine imported personal computers  with domestic display stations and telecommunications controlled  by base software that is a domestic product are being found and  tested.    In order to add the multi-task and multi-terminal computer  complexes to the unified network for transmitting ASUZhT  [automated control system for rail transport] data, the base  software includes a network component that permits the user to  describe the protocols of the local and global networks, within  which it is planned to use these complexes.    The widespread use of these computer complexes in rail  transport will not only permit capital investments in the  development of automated systems to be used more fully. They are  completely necessary to re-equip systems preparing data for the  information and computer centers of the railroads, the machine  calculating stations of the railroad divisions, and the  accounting groups in the locomotive depots, locomotive and  railcar repair plants, material warehouses, and worker supply  departments. With the massive shift to personal computers,  industry has stopped producing such data preparation systems as  the SPD-9000 and YeS-9003 (9005), which are used a great deal on  railroad networks but which are outdated.    When beginning the development of standard multi-task and  multi-terminal computer complexes, TOO SET counted primarily on  the machine calculating stations of the railroad divisions;  however, during the work, in which specialists from the  Kuybyshev and Gorkiy IVTs [information and computer centers] and  the MIIT [Moscow Railroad Transport Engineers Institute]  actively participated, standardized solutions, which permit the  computer complexes to be adapted to a whole number of  technological processes involving the massive preparation of  information even in other enterprises, are being found. At the  present time, test models of multi-task and multi-terminal  computer complexes have been delivered to the Kemerovo,  Kuybyshev, Krasnoyarsk, and West Siberian Railroads.    At the initiative of TOO SET, the development of a standard  system for automating the processes for processing information  at freight stations is being carried out. The project is being  worked on using share financing by TOO SET and the railroads.  The experience from incorporating similar systems at freight  stations and container sites is being considered during the  development of the project. The basic difference from previously  completed work is the completeness of the technological  processes and the complete inclusion of all categories of  workers participating in the planning of freight operations, the  drawing up of transportation documents, and the carrying out of  station accounting. In addition, the system provides an  opportunity through automation to combine professions, expand  service zones, and minimize the volume of information processed  at work positions. The system provides a "friendly" interface  for users with the computer and achieves the maximum clarity of  the current situation at the stations.    The system is based on personal computers operating in the  network multi-terminal mode. This makes for a low equipment cost  in comparison with similar systems and is oriented toward  stations with a small rail car turnover (up to 500-600 rail cars  a day). TOO SET developments with respect to the portable  information recorder and the multi-terminal computer complexes  will find application in the most concentrated form. At the  present time, the technical specifications for a standard  automated system and a detail design are being developed.  Introduction will take place during 1994 on the Gorkiy Railroad.    Within the TOO SET framework, a commercial computer network  for rail transport (SKIT) has been established, is functioning  and is being expanded. It provides for compiling and allocating  information on the supply and demand for deliveries of  production items, consumer goods, and agricultural products, and  for supplying various types of services and other types of  commercial activity to regional centers and network subscriber  points.    Since the SKIT computer network is mated with the RIKO  [expansion not given] network, it has available on a daily cycle  more than 5,000 urgent requests from more than 60 regions of the  former USSR. The SKIT computer network has nine regional  centers, which are based on the information and computer centers  of the railroads. This permits one to give supply-demand  information to the material and technical supply and worker  supply agencies of the railroads, and creates favorable  conditions for their rooting in the market through the  establishment of their own subscriber points in the regional  stock exchanges, trading houses, brokerage offices, and large  enterprises in the region.    In addition, the establishment of regional SKIT centers on  the railroads provides an opportunity to obtain income from  subsidiary and auxiliary activity, consisting of information  servicing of the newly established non-transport user subscriber  points. For these purposes, contracts can be concluded with  enterprises in the regions to establish and operate subscriber  points in the SKIT network and to rent underutilized computer  resources and communications channels. The next general meeting  of TOO SET founders will define ways to expand further.    Relying on cooperation with the railroads and scientific and  engineering centers with respect to the development and  production of computer equipment and coordinating plans for the  development and incorporation of automated systems with the  Russian Federation Ministry of Railways, TOO SET, besides  standard work in the area of transport computerized information  data processing, delivers computer equipment and accessory and  operating materials at the requests of the railroads. In 1993,  the volume of such equipment deliveries to the railroads  exceeded R200 million for a products list of more than 40  positions.    When organizing deliveries, the capabilities of the regions  are considered, and special research is conducted to evaluate  the reliability level of the equipment being acquired, prices  and the conditions for warranty servicing. The results of the  cooperation with the suppliers and producers of computer  equipment for actual transport needs are discussed during  seminars of specialists from the information and computer  centers of the railroads. Information bulletins, which help the  railroads orient themselves in the computer market, are  published on a regular basis.    During the three years of the existence first of the  association, and then of TOO SET, dependable partner contacts  have been established with the suppliers and producers of  computer equipment, and work has begun on establishing its own  servicing service for the maintenance of computers. At the same  time, it has failed to use all existing capabilities for the  fuller satisfaction of the railroads' requirements for computer  equipment and the expansion of computerized systems. Several  reasons are not permitting this work to be conducted more  actively. First, we have still not managed to establish special  funds in the amount required to finance standard works. Second,  from the time of the establishment of the SET Association, the  charter fund was not indexed, and it acquired a purely symbolic  value with inflation. Third, TOO SET does not have its own  material and technical base--production premises, equipment and  transport for expanding its own production. That is why the  increase in work volumes takes place dependent on financial  capabilities.    According to its status, TOO SET is related to enterprises  engaged in commercial activity. At the same time, the TOO SET  general meeting of founders and the Council of Empowered  Delegates have established a number of limitations on economic  activity that are used in state enterprises.    The production expansion fund and the special funds are  expended for standard designing of computerized systems for the  railroads' line enterprises. Using its own assets, TOO SET  performs expert research, conducts conferences and network  seminars, and publishes information bulletins. The mechanism for  controlling TOO SET activity, the cooperation in carrying out  the programs on an interested and mutually beneficial basis, and  the established mutual settlement procedure put TOO SET  completely under the control of the railroads. In turn, this has  allowed for the avoidance of instances of failure to meet  obligations for a long time. This has determined the railroads'  trust in the measures being conducted within the TOO SET  framework.    TOO SET is forming special-purpose funds for carrying out  NIOKR [research and scientific work] from its own production  expansion fund and the payments of the railroads participating  in the share financing on matters that are of interest for this  or that participant. The scientific item that is created through  this fund becomes the property of the participants in the share  financing. The sale of the produced scientific item to the  railroad network is done at contract prices that support the  planned level of profitability, including the replacement of the  payments of the participants in the share financing together  with a percentage of the profit from the sale of the scientific  item in proportion to the percentage contributed to the  special-purpose fund. Under these conditions, an item that  enjoys demand on the railroads "survives" and quickly pays for  itself. It becomes economically beneficial for the railroads to  finance such research and development work.    Besides the NIOKR plan, however, the railroads' capabilities  to finance a TOO SET subject are extremely limited, and this  slows the rate of research and development. If the railroads and  the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways, as well as the  management boards of the railroads in the other countries of the  former USSR, supported TOO SET initiatives more actively,  everyone would win from this. Having extremely limited financing  capabilities, TOO SET can select only a subject that does not  require the investment of large assets and has an easily  realizable technical solution and also evident effectiveness in  its use.    At the present time, TOO SET is mobilizing all its existing  resources so that work to incorporate new equipment on the  railroads will become the basis for its activity during 1994.  What is this intention built upon? First, on the correctness of  the fundamental design selection, confirmed by world and  domestic experience. Second, the confidence that transport  science should not be locked into its own research and  development. TOO SET is involving new creative collectives,  which previously did not have any experience in participating in  the solving of transport problems, in its subject matter. Here  there are costs connected with the need to adapt to rail  transport's specific conditions. However, the novelty of a  design solution, which is not connected with a certain  stereotype of thinking, is worth this. Third, on the conviction  that a mechanism for financing NIOKR on a repayable basis will  find application with time and that the principle of cost  recovery will also be expanded to that portion of the NIOKR  subject plan controlled by the Russian Federation Ministry of  Railways which concerns research work undertaken at the  initiative of the railroads. Fourth, on the hope that the  urgency of the selected subject will be evaluated at its true  worth and attract the attention and support of the railroads.    A similar situation is taking shape with the financing of  capital investments in the development of computerized systems.  Of the assets that have been allocated by railroads to the  acquisition of computer equipment, from 5 to 40 percent are  being assimilated within the TOO SET framework. The presence of  numerous sources for the receipt of computer equipment and, in a  number of cases, insufficiently qualified decisions in selecting  suppliers, accessories, and delivery conditions are leading to a  situation where equipment that is manufactured according to  different standards and using a different element base is  arriving in the railroad system. This is hindering the operating  process and causes complications when expanding computerized  systems. In addition, this situation does not permit one to  conclude long-term contracts that are beneficial in a commercial  respect; opportunities for selecting among competitive proposals  of producers and suppliers of computer equipment are not being  used; and complications arise with the delivery and safe-keeping  of the delivered computer equipment and with the conducting of  reclamation work during the warranty period.    TOO SET has definite experience in the area of delivering  personal computers, peripheral and telecommunications equipment,  and operating materials; however, it does not have the  capability of using it fully, due to a shortage of working  capital. It seems that this experience should be used more  fully, especially when the struggle for large buyers is  intensifying in the world's computer market. TOO SET can ensure  beneficial delivery conditions--the more so since, when working  with foreign firms, the delivery of computer equipment takes  place according to contract prices, and TOO SET services are  paid for in accordance with the delivery and at rates regulated  by the Council of Empowered Delegates.    One cannot fail to point out also the opportunities which  TOO  SET has for organizing deliveries of computers in accordance  with bank credits. Today, the practice of partial prepayment has  already been introduced in TOO SET. This was done considering  actual conditions where the railroads cannot accumulate within a  short time significant payment assets for the purchase of large  batches of computers. Naturally, it is unprofitable for the  supplying firms to import unpaid-for batches of computers at  their own risk. However, it is necessary to fight for a big  customer. If the goods arrive at the moment of final settlement,  the firm takes steps to accelerate the delivery periods and  toughens the sanctions addressed to the customer for the delay  in payments.    Under such conditions, the requirement for bank credit to  purchase large batches of computers is reduced twofold. If one  considers that the interest payment for short-term credit is  compensated for by losses of working capital from inflation, the  trade discount for consolidating batches of purchased computers  makes the alternative of purchases for bank credit and partial  prepayment profitable. With the availability of guarantors in  the person of the railroads, the bank is prepared to offer TOO  SET short-term credit.    Besides organizing deliveries of imported computer equipment  to the railroads, TOO SET carefully studies the state of affairs  with new works and the putting of domestic computer equipment  into production in Russia and the CIS. For this purpose,  cooperation with the Elektronmash Association, which is one of  the TOO SET founders, is organized. Work is being performed with  a whole range of scientific centers to develop computer  equipment and with manufacturing plants.    The railroads of neighboring states in the near abroad--the  Southwest, Lvov, Odessa, Latvian, Transcaucasian, Azerbaijan,  Central Asian, and Tselina--are TOO SET founders. Their interest  in participating in TOO SET measures is based upon a desire to  use the standard designs for computerized systems that are being  used on Russia's railroads. Within the framework of its  activity, TOO SET has the capability of assisting them in this  direction. Without having a clear branch program for automation,  however, it does not seem possible to propose a form of  interested participation in the work to them and provide them  with the necessary recommendations. Existing programs contain  the traditional subject matter, NIOKR amounts, and the periods  for introducing them into the leading installations, and can be  carried out only with clear financial support. This is difficult  to do under present conditions.    The attempt to formulate its own program within the TOO SET  framework has not been crowned with success. It is evident that  only the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways can assume this  work, involving qualified scientific collectives in the  development of automation programs. TOO SET would like for a  link between the level of automation, the capital investments to  achieve the given level of automation, and the effectiveness  obtained to be established as a result of this research. Having  such recommendations, the railroads would be able to invest more  soundly in information science considering the peculiarities of  operating work, the extent of the avenues' equipment, financial  situation, and so on.    A general meeting of TOO SET founders will sum up the work  results for the first three years of activity. A third technical  conference will also be held during the second half of the year.  TOO SET would like the founders to firm up their plans for  participation in TOO SET measures during the preparations for  the conference and provide interesting recommendations for the  subject plan based on their experiences. TOO SET also hopes that  the Russian Federation Ministry of Railways and the management  boards of the railroads in neighboring states, on their part,  will suggest ways to expand cooperation in the area of rail  transport information science.

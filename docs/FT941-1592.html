			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Irish Permanent plans flotation this summer The way has been cleared for the public flotation of the Irish Permanent Building Society on the London and Dublin stock exchanges this summer, following approval of the conversion and flotation plans by the mutual society's members. The IPBS is Ireland's largest building society, having a 30 per cent share of the residential mortgage market and assets of IPounds 2.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn). It is the first to convert to a plc. Conversion will involve the issue of 84m free shares to about 227,000 members and a cash distribution of IPounds 200 per person for a further 100,000. On completion of the flotation, which aims to raise up to IPounds 50m in new capital through the issue of 34m shares, the company is expected to have a market capitalisation of IPounds 180m-IPounds 200m, giving an indicative share price of 150p-166p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Sasic: "A Sale of White Flour Against a </F> `Rainy Day'"]    [Text] Pancevo, 5 April -- This is the report from Banat:  Everyone has flour to sell, but there are few buyers.  Immediately after introduction of the superdinar in late  January, 50 kilograms of Type 500 white flour could be bought  for 25 dinars in the vicinity of Pancevo. Just 10 days later  that same sack of flour cost 20 dinars, then 16, and in recent  days the same amount of flour has been offered for 13 dinars in  a newspaper ad, while farmers at the Pancevo market have  sometimes been selling it for even 10 dinars. The man from  Omoljica who offered a sack of flour for 13 dinars in the  newspaper ad says that last year he planted wheat on the field  returned to him, "since that was the simplest thing to do." He  had been waiting for the right price, but there is nothing to  wait for -- 13 dinars for a sack of white flour, he says, still  allows him to earn something on the deal.    The relatively low purchase price of last year's wheat crop,  along with the troubles in collection, had the result that the  farmers kept a fairly large portion of the wheat under favorable  conditions in silos and waited to see what the government would  do. It was expected that with the new harvest a few months away  it would be compelled to offer a high price for remaining  quantities of wheat. Ratar of Pancevo, one of the largest of our  milling industries, received large quantities of farmers' wheat  for storage. In return for 100 kilograms of wheat, the farmer  received 56 kilograms of Type 500 flour and a bit of bran. But  right now Ratar is paying from 0.14 to 0.16 dinars per kilogram  for grain. They say at Ratar that some mills have already halted  production or will do so in a few days because of the large  amount of flour in inventory. They are also fighting  considerably more fiercely with one another for the market.  While the price of Type 500 Pancevo flour is 0.25 dinars per  kilogram, fob the purchaser, there are already mills selling it  for 0.21 dinars. You cannot walk down any street in southern  Banat this spring without seeing in a window a sign advertising  flour at a good price.    Farmers who have several metric tons of wheat and flour  stored with milling firms need money for spring planting. To  compound their trouble, flour consumption has dropped off  considerably. Large trade-union purchases have had the result  that there is no family that does not have at least one sack of  flour stored away, so that retail purchases have almost died  out. We have to assume, then, that the price of that flour  stored in the attic "for a rainy day" will drop even further.  Especially if weather conditions indicate a good harvest this  year, the experts say.    It has turned out that those who traded their flour for  fertilizer last summer have fared best. At that time a kilogram  of KAN nitrogen fertilizer could be obtained for a kilogram of  wheat. Today a kilogram of KAN is 0.33 dinars, which means twice  as much as for the same amount of wheat. Thus in these  transactions, with the tricky prices, the Pancevo nitrogen  fertilizer plant Azotara, trading fertilizer for wheat, became  the owner of 65,000 tons of wheat last summer. They say at the  fertilizer plant that in spite of the modest price of wheat,  they cannot complain, because it made it possible for them to  survive the factory's shutdown for six months. The price of gas,  the largest item in nitrogen fertilizer production, was  considerably lower last year, and so this offset possible large  losses in the trade, which the government was pushing. At this  point the fertilizer plant still has 20,000 tons of wheat and  does not want to sell it cheaper than 0.18 dinars per kilogram.  They say, of course, that if they now had the fertilizer which  they gave for wheat back then, they would today be the most  profitable factory in the area.</p>

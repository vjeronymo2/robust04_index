			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANOLA BECOMES VIABLE ALTERNATIVE CROP  </P> <P> Canola may become an economic lifesaver for farmers in the South and Midwest as  the low-fat cooking oil squeezed from the plant's seeds becomes more popular  with health-conscious consumers.  </P> <P> Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than other popular cooking oils, including  coconut, soybean and corn oils, experts say.  </P> <P> Saturated fat has been linked to cholesterol, a substance that can contribute  to clogged arteries and heart disease.  </P> <P> "We think it will be a viable crop for the mid-South and at yields that will be  successful for economic returns," said John F. Bradley, superintendent of the  University of Tennessee Agriculture Experiment Station at Milan. "It will give  our farmers in this area an alternative crop.  </P> <P> "We are not saying it's going to be the salvation of the farmer but it is real  promising," he said.  </P> <P> Canola is a trademark for a variety of rapeseed, from which the oil is  squeezed.  </P> <P> Canada and Europe are the largest producers of canola. Before 1985, the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration listed the seed's oil as toxic to humans and  banned its growth. But genetic engineering produced an edible variety and the  FDA removed the restrictions.  </P> <P> "This released us from having to import from Canada and Europe," Bradley said.  "We have found that it can be grown in the mid-South and the Midwest."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, only about 70,000 acres are grown in the United States. U.S.  Department of Agriculture statistics show 440 million pounds of canola oil were  imported this year.  </P> <P> Researchers say canola's seed production is high and that on a profit basis it  outperforms soybeans.  </P> <P> Kentucky and Illinois are the chief producers of canola in the United States.  Kentucky growers planted about 2,000 acres of canola in 1987, then 8,000 acres  as it caught on in 1988, according to a study by the University of Kentucky.  </P> <P> Farmers in Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan so far have only dabbled in  the crop. But Bradley believes that during the next five years canola will  become commonplace throughout the mid-South.  </P> <P> Canola has become more popular with consumers recently as health concerns have  arisen over the use of tropical oils, found to be high in saturated fats.  </P> <P> "I think we will see probably more people going over to canola oil as their  cooking oil," said Wayne Flinchum, professor of plant and soil science at the  University of Tennessee Agriculture Extension Service in Jackson.  </P></p>

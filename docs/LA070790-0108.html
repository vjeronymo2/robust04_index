			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNEMPLOYMENT DIPS 0.1% DESPITE SLOWER JOB GROWTH  </P> <P> Despite a continuing slump in manufacturing and construction jobs, the nation's  unemployment rate edged down 0.1% in June to 5.2% of the work force, the Labor  Department said Friday.  </P> <P> Although the latest figures suggested that the economy has not emerged from its  lengthy slowdown, analysts said the Federal Reserve is not expected to move  quickly to nudge interest rates down to stimulate growth.  </P> <P> "There's no real zip in this economy," said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin  &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York, "but you don't have the combination of  recessionary forces to drag it into negative territory, either."  </P> <P> Indeed, a sharp upward revision in May's job figures -- showing that about  155,000 jobs were added outside the government work force instead of the  original estimate of 19,000 -- convinced some investors on Wall Street that the  economy has been somewhat stronger than they thought.  </P> <P> The result was a selloff in the bond market, where traders had been hoping that  a weak employment report would persuade the Federal Reserve to cut short-term  interest rates after six months of holding monetary policy steady.  </P> <P> "This report will not force the Fed to ease," said Robert Dederick, chief  economist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. "The month before was revised up,  and unemployment was lower."  </P> <P> The Fed is expected to wait for evidence later this month that should indicate  whether consumers will boost spending enough to sustain a recent production  upswing. Retail sales have slumped for three months in a row, an unprecedented  downturn for a non-recessionary period.  </P> <P> But some economists believe that the Commerce Department's estimates of a sharp  spending falloff are mistaken. Government economic reports are frequently  revised as experts gather more data, often providing a sharply different  portrait of the economy than the first evidence suggests.  </P> <P> A separate calculation of unemployment that includes military forces stationed  in the United States fell to 5.1% in June from 5.3% in May.  </P> <P> Businesses added a modest 97,000 payroll jobs last month, according to the  Labor Department report. But overall non-farm employment rose by just 40,000,  largely because the Census Bureau began layoffs of hundreds of thousands of  extra workers it had hired for the once-a-decade population count.  </P> <P> The 40,000 increase in jobs came on top of an explosive employment gain of  356,000 in May, more than double the 164,000 first reported. Roughly 200,000 of  the jobs added in May were attributable to the hiring of census workers.  </P> <P> In California, the jobless rate fell to 4.9% from 5.4% for the previous two  months.  </P> <P> Unemployment has remained remarkably steady for roughly two years, but job  growth has slowed to just half the pace of a year ago.  </P> <P> Only about 290,000 Americans have entered the work force so far this year, said  Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to 1.5  million who either found jobs or were actively looking during the same period  last year.  </P> <P> Most of the private sector job growth in recent months has occurred in service  industries, while the nation's manufacturing sector has shed jobs for more than  a year.  </P> <P> Factory payrolls lost another 31,000 jobs in June. It was the 14th time in 15  months that manufacturing employment has fallen, cutting roughly 335,000 jobs  from the post-recession peak in March, 1989. Construction employment fell by  14,000, the fourth monthly decline in a row, reflecting a weak housing market.  </P> <P> "The apparent steadiness of the economy is an illusion," complained Lawrence A.  Hunter, an economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Underlying two years of  stable unemployment rates are significant job losses in manufacturing and an  increase in the number of discouraged workers who have dropped out of the job  market."  </P> <P> Despite the weakness in the June job market, however, other clues in the Labor  Department report indicated that the U.S. economy might be regaining some  momentum.  </P> <P> The average manufacturing work week remained at a relatively high 41 hours for  the second month, and overtime held at 3.8 hours, suggesting that factories  have started to boost output.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, labor costs -- which some central bankers worry may fuel higher  inflation -- continued to rise, with average hourly earnings moving up to  $10.01 in June from $9.98 in May.  </P> <P> "Given their worries about inflation being stuck at an unacceptably high level,  the Fed is likely to do nothing to cut rates," said David Levine, chief  economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> UNEMPLOYMENT  </P> <P> Percent of work force, seasonally adjusted  </P> <P> June, '90: 5.2%  </P> <P> May, '90: 5.3%  </P> <P> June, '89: 5.3%  </P> <P> Source: Labor Department  </P></p>

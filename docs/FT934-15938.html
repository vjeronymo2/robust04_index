			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices held in a narow range at the London Metal Exchange and ended slightly lower, with the three months position at at Dollars 1,695 a tonne, a loss of Dollars 4. The market now looks to be trying to consolidate at present levels following its recent inability to overcome overhead resistance and producer selling above Dollars 1,700. Three months ZINC at one staged reached a low of Dollars 898 tonne but sizeable trade buying aided a recovery back up to Dollars 906, a loss of Dollars 8. ALUMINIUM, boxed in a narrow Dollars 4 range found little impetus to move away from recent levels amid the lack of metal-related news and producer action. Last business for three months was at Dollars 1,112 a tonne, a loss of Dollars 3. Support on dips to around Dollars 1,110 remained evident. LEAD edged higher on short-covering following recent trade buying attracted by recent low levels. Last business was at Dollars 381 for three months metal, a gain of Dollars 5 from Wednesday's finish. TIN finished higher following dealer short-covering, with the sharp rise in nickel appearing to aid the rise. The continuing strike at Brazil's largest tin mine also helped to underpin the market.

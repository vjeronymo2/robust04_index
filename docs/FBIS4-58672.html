			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  stated the following: In continuation of the scenario prepared  by the gang of al-Ahmar, whose bloody appetite was stimulated  after the aggression against the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Imran,  this bloody gang of al-Ahmar, which thirsts for blood and  devastation, at 8:15 tonight began to attack the Martyr Ba  Suhayb Brigade Camp in Dhamar town. This daring brigade, in  these decisive historic moments, is waging a fierce war against  the enemies of the homeland and is confronting with bravery,  death, and defiance the mercenaries of the adventurist gang of  al-Ahmar. [passage omitted]    While the Defense Ministry deals with this crime, it assures  the masses of our Yemeni people that it will remain loyal to the  pledge by individuals of our armed forces to protect our people  and their national and democratic options. In these historic  moments, it calls on all the honorable sons of our people, the  heroes of their Armed Forces and the generous forces to stand  united to confront this imminent danger to the homeland and its  unity, and inflict defeat on the bloody gang of al-Ahmar. Our  people are lying in wait for them.</p>

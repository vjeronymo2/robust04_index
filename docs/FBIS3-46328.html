			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The uncooperative  attitude the British Government is taking on the Hong Kong issue  is likely to affect Sino-British trade ties, said Wu Yi,  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.    Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Information  Office of the State Council here this morning that the bilateral  trade relations are not bad on the whole, and the potential for  their development is also great.    Last year, the bilateral trade volume reached 3.59 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of 86 percent over the previous year.    However, Wu said, it is very difficult to say that the  uncooperative attitude the British Government is taking would  not affect the bilateral trade ties.    The situation is what the Chinese side would not like to  see,  and the British side should shoulder the whole responsibility in  this regard.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GOOD CLASHES WITH EVIL UNDER THE PUNISHING 'SUN OF SATAN'  </P> <P> True grace is to forget. . . . The supreme grace would be to love ourselves. .  . . Human agony is beyond all an act of love."  </P> <P>  -- Georges Bernanos  </P> <P> In "Under the Sun of Satan" (opening today for one week at the Nuart), Maurice  Pialat plunges us into a slate-gray world where good and evil, love and hate  war implacably under a punishing sky.  </P> <P> The source of the film is the novel by Georges Bernanos, whose books also  inspired Robert Bresson's classic films "Diary of a Country Priest" and  "Mouchette," and it's a story which Pialat, an unbeliever, has adapted with  unusual devotion. He keeps the shiveringly pure line of the plot, strips the  dialogues to a hard, blanched core.  </P> <P> An ominous hush breathes over his landscape, with its steep hills, icy plains,  tangled forests. The boundaries between the two contending forces become misty,  confusing. The devil adopts the guise of a smiling Good Samaritan, plants a  cold kiss on the hero's lips. God seems distant, remote. The hapless people  buffeted between them remind us of the mad howl of Shakespeare's Lear: "As  flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport."  </P> <P> The action, set in provincial France around the 1920s, revolves around two  characters who, presumably, embody the extremes of good and evil. Father  Donissan (Gerard Depardieu) is a young priest who mortifies his flesh in his  quest for godliness -- whipping himself, wearing a hair shirt. Mouchette  (Sandrine Bonnaire) is a wanton teen-ager who becomes pregnant, accidentally  kills one rich lover, confesses her crime to another and is plunged into the  abyss after a chance confrontation with the suddenly all-knowing Donissan.  </P> <P> It is Bernanos' and Pialat's point that the priest and murderess are not  opposites, but spiritually akin: that Donissan, by revealing Mouchette, may be  succumbing not to God's will, but Satan's. Donissan's quest for absolute purity  is, in its way, as terrifying as Mouchette's reckless pursuit of desire. Both  priest and girl search for something beyond the visible, mundane surface, and  Satan loves Donissan, his mortal enemy, just as God loves the wayward, luckless  Mouchette.  </P> <P> Depardieu and Bonnaire have done some of their best work for Pialat, and both  achieve here, as before, an almost animalistic spontaneity, a holy on-screen  savagery. But the crescendoes are all Bonnaire's. Depardieu becomes like a wild  animal trainer lashing the beast within his own bosom. Shambling, lurching  painfully through sacristy, forest or farmyard, Donissan is a saint, clumsily  tying himself to the stake.  </P> <P> Pialat has cast himself as a kind of mediator, Donissan's superior, the urbane  Father Menou-Segrais, who knows his own carnality, sees the follies of both  saintliness and sin. Good and evil are ultimately not incarnated in individual  characters here but in the forces that gather around them, and the synthesis is  aesthetic as well as moral.  </P> <P> Pialat has always had a style -- restless, propulsive, fixated on the  spontaneous truth of a scene -- which suggests, more than any of his French  colleagues, John Cassavetes. And two opposing cinematic streams seem to be  merging here: on one hand, the rigor and crystalline grace of Bresson, who  wants his actors never to express any visible emotion; on the other, the  emotional explosiveness of Cassavetes, who wants his actors to prod, probe and  tear themselves open. They coexist, eerily, in a tremulous balance. Once again,  spirit and flesh.  </P> <P> Good and evil are subjects so vulgarized and cheapened by hordes of  opportunistic, empty, un-moral movies that it may be hard for audiences to  focus on them. For some, "Sun," which was booed by the crowed when it won the  Cannes Film Festival grand prize in 1987, will be a movie of punishing  ambition, hammering severity.  </P> <P> Yet, Pialat and his two great actors, Depardieu and Bonnaire, make good on  their ambition. They give mystery and power to a story of spiritual struggle.  If the opening of "Sun" (Times-rated Mature for adult themes), in a succession  of grisly interiors, casts an oppressive pall, the film begins to surge with  emotion when Pialat moves Donissan to the hillsides, beneath the cold sky and  under Satan's dark and sinister sun.  </P> <P> And it keeps moving inexorably to a splendid climax. That emotion is the  blackened current that drives on to the end, toward death or grace, redemption  or damnation, the occasional darkness of good, and evil's bright illusions.  </P></p>

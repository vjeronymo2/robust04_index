			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Offshore industry assets reported Big international companies continue to dominate the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, says Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultants, in a report published today. Wood Mackenzie points out that British companies account for only 43 per cent of the Pounds 40.2bn of total UK upstream assets in exploration and production. The figure assumes that Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, is counted as wholly British. British Petroleum, however, remains the leading company in the sector, accounting for 14 per cent of the total value. It is followed by British Gas with 12 per cent of the total assets.</p>

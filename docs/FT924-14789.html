			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Cost of council cover 'to rise 50%' COUNCILS face steep in-creases in insurance premiums as a result of the demise of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurer, a conference organised by local-authority associations heard yesterday. The increase could average at least 50 per cent from last year's estimated total of Pounds 600m, according to the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Nine out of 10 councils bought their insurance from Municipal Mutual, which stopped writing new business and renewing existing policies last week, leaving a number of councils temporarily without insurance cover. Municipal Mutual, which is still seeking to sell its home, motor, life and health insurance businesses, is again meeting claims from policyholders after temporarily suspending payments last week. Mr Ken Kennedy, risk and facilities manager with Surrey County Council, warned the meeting that insurers would increase rates and 'saw councils as ripe for the picking'. Risk prevention was necessary for councils to 'lever' improved rates out of their insurers, Mr Kennedy added. However the associations say that the spending restrictions imposed by the government could make it difficult for many councils to improve risk prevention. 'We will happily undertake better risk management,' said Mr Clive Grenyer, under-secretary of the Tory-led Association of County Councils, 'but it costs money and we are financially constrained'. Spending on measures including sprinklers and alarms was needed to improve the security of schools vulnerable to arson, but such spending could be subject to government controls on capital spending, said Mr Grenyer. The cost of installing sprinklers in a school can be between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 25,000. He added that local-authority association leaders had made the point forcibly to ministers during recent meetings. Mr Colin Hamling, liability underwriter with St Paul International, said councils must improve management to reduce claims. He added that many minor claims stemmed from lack of maintenance and were avoidable.</p>

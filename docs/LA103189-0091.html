			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK PANEL CHIEF ASKS BUSH TO FIRE S&amp;L REGULATOR;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: IN A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT, REP. HENRY B. GONZALEZ CITED TESTIMONY  ALLEGING THAT M. DANNY WALL INTERFERED WITH A LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN  INVESTIGATION.  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Banking Committee on Monday called on President Bush  to fire M. Danny Wall as the federal government's chief thrift regulator for  his alleged improper interference with a probe of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of  Irvine.  </P> <P> In a letter to Bush, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) noted that the Banking  Committee has heard testimony that Wall blocked efforts by federal regulators  in San Francisco to collect evidence of misconduct at Lincoln in 1987.  Testimony also showed that Wall met with Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr.  while the thrift was a target of the federal probe.  </P> <P> Gonzalez reminded Bush that government seizure of Lincoln last April created  the biggest savings and loan failure in the nation's history. It is estimated  that insured depositors will receive $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury as a  result of the action.  </P> <P> He also recalled that the President had assured the nation that it would be  spared another savings and loan crisis under his Administration, and added: "I  question that the assurance has meaning while Mr. Wall remains in office. In  view of your commitment to not let those responsible for these costly failures  remain in positions of authority in your Administration," Gonzalez wrote, "I  believe it would be reassuring to the American taxpayers who have been asked to  pay for this regulatory failure if Mr. Wall steps aside."  </P> <P> Gonzalez has long been a critic of Wall, director of the Office of Thrift  Supervision, and has previously suggested that he step aside temporarily while  the committee investigates his actions in the Lincoln case. However, Monday was  the first time that the chairman had sought Wall's permanent dismissal.  </P> <P> Gonzalez has been upset since members of the Senate Banking Committee demanded  last August that Wall retain his position as part of a House-Senate compromise  over legislation designed to bail out the ailing thrift industry.  </P> <P> Under the bill, the Office of Thrift Supervision was created as the successor  agency to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Wall had headed since July,  1987.  </P> <P> At a House Banking Committee hearing last Thursday, federal regulators from San  Francisco testified that Wall had "shot them in the back" by blocking a timely  federal takeover of Lincoln in 1987, when the thrift was found to be making  risky loans.  </P> <P> Moreover, Wall has acknowledged that he met personally with Keating in 1987,  about the same time that he was considering the recommendation of San Francisco  regulators that Lincoln be seized. The two men knew each other before Wall took  over at the FHLBB.  </P> <P> Wall and Keating have been subpoenaed to testify before the committee next  week.  </P> <P> Gonzalez told Bush that Wall's continued presence at the thrift supervision  office is impeding the committee's investigation of the Lincoln case. He noted  that Wall had summoned two employees from the San Francisco office to a meeting  at the agency's Washington headquarters before their testimony.  </P> <P> "Even the most honest, straightforward witness finds it difficult to give the  committee the full benefit of their knowledge while Mr. Wall has control over  their future," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it appeared that members of the House Banking Committee may be  moving toward a decision to hear testimony from Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)  and four other senators who intervened with the FHLBB in 1987 on behalf of  Keating, who was a major contributor to their campaigns.  </P> <P> It would be unusual, but not unprecedented, for a House committee to request  testimony from members of the Senate.  </P> <P> Committee sources said Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.) has decided to present the  committee with a resolution requesting testimony from the five senators if  Gonzalez does not arrange for them to appear voluntarily.  </P> <P> Julie Black, a spokeswoman for the committee, said Gonzalez opposes issuing a  subpoena to the senators, as he has done with all of the other witnesses who  have appeared before the committee. But she did not rule out the possibility of  an informal arrangement under which the senators could speak to the committee.  </P> <P> Likewise, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said he would oppose issuing  subpoenas to the senators. "I consider it unusual in the extreme, and a  practice that I think should be avoided," he said. "(But) it doesn't mean that  members cannot appear, obviously."  </P> <P> In a private meeting with Gonzales on Oct. 3, Cranston offered to cooperate  with the House probe, but he did not volunteer to testify, according to a  Cranston spokesman.  </P> <P> The five senators are also under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee, which  has asked them to respond to charges filed against them by Common Cause, the  self-styled citizens lobby. Common Cause has accused them of bringing improper  pressure to bear on the FHLBB on behalf of Keating.  </P> <P> Although the Ethics Committee has asked all five senators to respond to the  charges in writing, sources cautioned that the panel has not decided to launch  an investigation. "It is not a preliminary investigation," emphasized a Senate  aide.  </P> <P> Currently, according to these sources, committee employees are collecting  information to be presented within the next few weeks to Chairman Howell Heflin  (D-Ala.) and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), who then will decide whether  to hold a meeting of the full committee to discuss the allegations raised by  Common Cause.  </P></p>

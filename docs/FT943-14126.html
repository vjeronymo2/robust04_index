			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (21): A good idea that fell to earth - The antics of sales agents and reports of regulators' efforts to curb them have taken their toll on sales. But the product may at last be reaching those to whom it is best suited It has not been a good year for personal pensions. Securities regulators dropped a bombshell last December, when they revealed that a study by an independent auditing firm had discovered that 400,000 to 500,000 people may have been urged to transfer out of an employer's scheme into a personal pension against their own best interests. The affair has tarnished the reputations of some of the leading household names in the British insurance industry. Norwich Union has had its 800-strong sales force suspended for retraining. Legal &amp; General and Cornhill were fined hundreds of thousands of pounds for their failure to control their sales forces; and every big clearing bank has halted its sales of transfers from occupational pension schemes. While the insurance industry struggles to sort out what type of compensation may be due to each victim, increasing public cynicism suggests that the five-year love affair with the personal pension may be cooling. Newspaper headlines, detailing both the antics of unscrupulous sales agents and the efforts of regulators to curb such activities have taken their toll on sales. After having sustained the insurance industry through the long years of the recession, sales of new personal pension policies fell sharply in early 1994, according to data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The number of new, single-premium personal pension policies - the type most closely associated with transfers from occupational schemes - plummeted 44 per cent in the first quarter. Yearly premium policies also suffered, albeit by a more modest margin. Total policy sales of this type fell to 286,000 in the first quarter, from 335,000 in the first quarter of 1993, representing the lowest figure for any quarter since 1989. The data suggest that, in particular, the public is avoiding the traditional with-profits personal pension policy, in which investment returns are 'smoothed' over the life of the contract by the insurance company. Sales of annual and single-premium policies of this type fell to 142,000, from 204,000 in the first quarter, while unit-linked policies - the type sold heavily through banks and building societies - took a more modest drop to 253,000 from 297,000 the year before. Nor does the future look any more encouraging. From January, a tough new disclosure regime will force sales agents to tell prospective customers much more about how much each policy costs and how much the sales agent will earn in commission. Also, the Securities and Investments Board has cracked down on pension transfers, setting rigorous guidelines intended to ensure that only those who are actually better off with a personal pension are allowed to switch out of their employers' scheme. Meanwhile, the National Association of Pension Funds, the occupational pensions lobbying group, has called on regulators to ban personal pension advertising showing 'telephone number' calculations of benefits upon retirement. Perhaps most important, the Department of Social Security has launched a discussion paper for the introduction of so-called 'age-related rebates'. This would end the system of National Insurance contribution rebates, which have made personal pensions such an easy sell to young people by offering them far more to opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme (Serps) via a personal pension than they would receive if they remained in it. While the restructuring, due to take effect in April 1997, will encourage each policyholder to keep his personal pension longer, it will undoubtedly make the sales of new policies more difficult. The implications of the sharp fall in sales are alarming, both for the insurance industry and for government policymakers who have made personal pensions a linchpin of their plan to devolve social security spending to individuals. So far, the government has shown no official sign that its commitment to personal pensions is wavering. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has reiterated his support for personal pensions, and said he will not exercise his powers under the initial legislation to control either the marketing of, or charges on, personal pensions. But Treasury officials are said to be privately furious at the failure of both the Department of Social Services and the self-regulatory bodies for the retail financial services industry to control sales agents. The cost to the public purse has been enormous. Data from the DSS show that over Pounds 10.5bn in NI contribution rebates were paid out between 1987 and December 1993, to encourage people to opt out of Serps. However, because individuals can opt back in as they get older and the tax incentives shrink, only a small portion of that expenditure will be recouped in savings. Moreover, the data show that significant numbers of personal pension holders will actually be worse off in retirement than if they had remained in Serps. Many are too old, or earned too little, to be entitled to NI rebates that would buy them better benefits. For instance, DSS data show that, by April 1992, more than 296,000 men over the age of 45 and 206,000 women over 40 had contracted out through personal pensions, even though they would have been better off staying in Serps. At that time, 49.9 per cent of all personal pension holders earned Pounds 8,000 or less. Rebates on earnings below Pounds 8,000, after taking account of charges, offer pension benefits lower than those which could be obtained by remaining in Serps. Perhaps worst of all, the data suggest that little additional long-term savings has been encouraged by personal pensions. By April 1992, only 40 per cent of policyholders were contributing anything to their pension in addition to the NI contribution rebate. In the light of such damning statistics, the question remains whether personal pensions have a future. Ironically, the latest figures from the ABI show signs that perhaps the industry is beginning to redeem itself by selling pensions to those for whom they are truly the best, and indeed, only, alternative. While a single quarter's sales cannot tell a whole story, regulators may well be encouraged by what they see. All told, the data suggest that finally, personal pension sales are being targeted at those for whom they really are the best - and indeed, only - satisfactory way of making pension savings. First, the average annual personal pension contribution appears to be rising to Pounds 940, from Pounds 800 a year ago. In 1989, the average contribution was little more than Pounds 250 per year, a level at which, after charges, little pension provision would be afforded. Also, while the number of new policies is falling, premium income remained broadly stable in the first quarter. Even if fewer people hold personal pensions, the data suggest that those who do are those for whom personal pensions are indeed a good deal. Even more encouraging, renewed single-premium contracts - those to which a new lump sum is added every year - actually rose in the first quarter, to Pounds 257m, from Pounds 248m in 1993. These policyholders are more likely to stay the course, and will not bear the punitive charges associated with early terminations. The tragedy of the personal pensions saga over the past year is that, for many people, the product is a tax-efficient and effective way of ensuring a reasonable standard of living upon retirement. The question is whether the industry has the foresight to see that, by selling to those who cannot possibly benefit, it risks alienating the public on whose goodwill its survival depends.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four comments addressed the term ``homeport.'' Two of the comments contended that the term is incorrect. They suggested use of the terms vessel's ``port of certification'' or ``port of record.'' One of the comments stated that the NPRM should address procedures for plan approval should a vessel change its homeport. As discussed earlier, the Coast Guard has eliminated the requirements to have plans, revisions, and annual letters submitted to the COTP or OCMI at the ship's home port. Therefore, the term ``homeport'' is no longer used in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment writer found the reference to ``appropriate appendices'' confusing, and suggested that a better approach would be to use language similar to that contained in &sect;155.1070(a)(3). The Coast Guard agrees that the reference to ``appropriate appendices'' could be misunderstood. Therefore, &sect;151.28(d) has been revised to specify that a record of the annual review and changes to the plan must be maintained in the last appendix of section six.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four comments expressed concern about consistency with other plans, such as the vessel response plan and the Washington State contingency planning requirements. Their biggest concern was that the requirements of this plan may cause major revisions to their existing plans, and that they may not provide for a rational mix of the requirements. The Coast Guard understands the concerns expressed in these comments. However, this plan does not require extensive revisions to any plan. The VRP IFR allows for the submission of a vessel response plan which complies with both sets of response plan requirements. Tank vessel owners or operators may find it helpful to refer to &sect;155.1030 of the VRP IFR for additional requirements. This rule does not address other State or local requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Foreign Ships <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment argued that the rule discriminates against foreign flag vessels and, therefore, is not in accordance with customary international law. Furthermore, the comment states that U.S. vessels should be subject to the same standards as foreign vessels in the navigable waters of the U.S. Both U.S. ships and foreign ships must carry a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan on board while in the navigable waters of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Discussion of Other Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment supported the Coast Guard's efforts to require a larger segment of the maritime industry to plan for spills and supports working within the MARPOL Convention to establish international consistency. Furthermore, the comment stated that consistency in planning requirements is the key to a better and more efficient system. The Coast Guard agrees that ensuring consistency in planning requirements is one key step towards a more efficient system. The Coast Guard finds that this plan is consistent on an international level. The comment also urged the Coast Guard to increase the specificity of the planning requirements. The Coast Guard finds that an appropriate amount of specificity is included. Therefore, the Coast Guard has concluded that it has provided a sufficient framework to build on. One comment requested an extension of the comment period. The Coast Guard received comments after the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking had closed. These comments were reviewed and included in the discussion of comments and changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket (CGD 93&hyph;030) for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Evaluation is summarized as follows. This rule will not result in annual costs of $100 million or more. It will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or other aspects of the economy, and will not result in a major increase in costs and prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

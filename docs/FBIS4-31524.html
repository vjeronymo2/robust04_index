			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Draft Orders for All Officials in Croatian </F> Institutions"]    [Text] Mostar -- The communal secretariats of Tuzla,  Lukavac, Zivnica, and Banovici, have in the past few days opted  for a forced mobilization of some 1,500 Croats into the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Radio Herceg-Bosna reported on  Wednesday. As reported by the correspondent of the Herceg-Bosna  radio station in Tuzla, the military police of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 2d Corps -- after serving draft orders  -- immediately transfers the Croats into the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army ranks and the military strongholds on Mt. Majevica and Mt.  Konjuh.    The draft orders were served to high-ranking officials in  all  Croatian institutions. The Herceg-Bosna radio reports that among  the mobilized are two members of the Croatian Democratic  Community [HDZ] Regional Council in Tuzla, 14 presidents of HDZ  branches, Josip Simic, president of the Croatian "Hrvatski Dom"  Society, Drago Juric, manager of the "Sol" company, Janko  Divkovic, president of the HDZ Youth in the Tuzla region, and  the majority of members of the "GLASNIK HDZ SOLI" [newsletter]  editorial board. The radio stresses that the consequence of  this mobilization of Croats is their massive exodus from the  region, in which they are aided by the Bosniak authorities, who  are taking care of all the paperwork needed for leaving Tuzla.    Colonel-General Milivoj Petkovic, head of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] General Staff in the Croatian Community of  Herceg-Bosna, confirmed that a note on the mobilization of  Croats had arrived from Tuzla on Tuesday. "We have informed  Kresimir Zubak, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation,  about this," General Petkovic told Croatian Radio Herceg-Bosna  on Wednesday, and added that this would "create numerous  problems." General Petkovic assessed that this was "incorrect of  the Muslim authorities," and that it was a "calculated move."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Wifo: Further Reduction in Number of Jobs in </F> Industry"]    [Text] Vienna -- Production in industry would have to  increase by 4.5 percent per year for the number of jobs to  remain unchanged. In order to maintain the number of jobs at the  same level, the economy has to grow by 2 percent altogether, a  study of the Economic Research Institute (Wifo) says.    In the event of economic stagnation, the number of  employees,  including the self-employed, would decrease by about 0.5  percent. This year, with the same growth rate, the progress in  productivity is the same as in the past, the Wifo stresses.    The struggle against unemployment is, above all, complicated  by the relatively low long-term economic growth and a major  increase in the labor supply: If economic growth were to  increase by 1 percentage point, employment would increase by 0.4  percent or about 12,000 persons.    Despite the decrease in the average retirement age in the  past 15 years, the labor supply increased by well over 1 percent  per year. Almost half of it is due to the influx of foreign  labor.    Therefore, in the long-term, unemployment will only  stabilize  when the economy grows by 3 percent.    The domestic labor market shows a clear discrepancy in its  structure. Many new jobs in the services sector and in  construction were not filled with unemployed, but largely with  persons from the "hidden reserve" and from abroad who were  looking for jobs.</p>

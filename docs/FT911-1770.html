			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Toronto Symphony Orchestra - Barbican Hall So many visiting orchestras have brought us Brahms symphonies recently. It hardly seems worth an orchestra crossing the Atlantic to give us another, but the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is not the kind to make the journey for nothing, to judge from this determined showing. The orchestra's tour has taken in London and Glasgow. At the Barbican on Wednesday it offered what might have looked a dour programme. A new work by Raymond Luedeke and Bartok's Viola Concerto did not exactly make a festive start for a concert in the presence of royalty. But there were compensations and it is not meant as a slight on the orchestra to say that the outstanding feature up until the interval was the playing of the soloist, Yury Bashmet. The Bartok concerto is a late piece, which refuses to give up its true feelings easily in what seems a hostile musical environment. Bashmet played it supremely well, not only making sure that the viola was always the prime mover in the orchestral texture, but also voicing his part with a marvellous freedom and spontaneity. The opening of the slow movement can rarely have been so hauntingly sad. This was the 'difficult' modern music on the programme, not the Luedeke. The North Wind's Gift is an orchestral piece lasting about 10 minutes, the token example of new work from its own country that many a visiting orchestra brings, well crafted, but quite unmemorable as to its content. The music felt like the accompaniment to something more important and it was no surprise to read that it is taken from an opera in progress. And so to Brahms's First Symphony. Gunther Herbig has been Music Director in Toronto more or less since Andrew Davis left in 1988 and he is evidently shaping his orchestra into a fine vehicle for the German classics. The Toronto players gave us Brahms with none of the spurious heaviness of the Oslo Philharmonic a few weeks ago; they made wind and brass parts engage with a vigour missed by the Leipzig Gewandhaus last autumn. Everything was well balanced, purposeful, warm enough in sound. For his part Herbig did nothing untoward or exaggerated, but brought to a central, Germanic style of performance just the combination of urgency and passion that so miserably eluded Giulini recently in the Festival Hall. This was a Brahms First Symphony some way above the average. Well worth the journey, in fact.</p>

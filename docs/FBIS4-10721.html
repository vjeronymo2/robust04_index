			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Persio Arida, president of the National </F> Economic Development Bank and co-author of the FHC2 Plan, by  Suely Caldas in Rio de Janeiro; date not given: "Arida Preaches  Free Market Economy" -- first two paragraphs are O ESTADO DE SAO  PAULO introduction]    [Text] According to this economist, who helped write the  FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso-second economic program] Plan,  the state should not intervene in setting wages or freezing  prices as it did eight years ago under the Cruzado Plan, which  he also helped write.    Rio de Janeiro--After 10 days of a viral infection that kept  him in bed with a temperature of 40 degrees just before  Carnival, and then another 10 days in Brasilia to help complete  the economic stabilization plan, the president of the National  Economic Development Bank, Persio Arida, was finally able to get  back to work last week. One of the authors of the Cruzado Plan  along with economist Andre Lara Resende--the "Larida" duo--he is  now back on the scene with a package of measures aimed primarily  at a free market economy without the persistent state  intervention that occurred eight years ago under the Cruzado  Plan. Although he agrees that the current plan is conceptually  very close to the plan published under the Sarney  administration, "the principle involved is that prices and wages  must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely  fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program,"  Arida says in this interview with O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO.    [Caldas] Economist Affonso Celso Pastore says that this plan  has resurrected the original version of the Cruzado Plan as  proposed in an article by you and Andre Lara Resende in 1984.    [Arida] The plan is conceptually very close to the article  we  published in 1984 as far as its basic outline is concerned. But  its similarity with the Cruzado Plan as that plan was actually  implemented is minimal. This plan has no price freezes,  schedules, or price controls. The basic idea is that prices and  wages must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely  fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program.  Brazil is still living with the concept underlying the Cruzado  Plan, and it is surprising that later programs were attempts to  repeat that experiment successfully. This program is abandoning  that underlying concept. We are announcing in advance every step  that we take, our policy is one of absolute consistency, and  with the exception of the wage issue, what we have done now is  exactly what we announced last December.    [Caldas] But it was announced in December that the prices of  public services would immediately be converted into URV's [units  of real value], and that did not happen.    [Arida] There are differences in detail--in the pace--but as  far as the basic concept is concerned, what we are doing now is  exactly what we announced in December. We are implementing a  program without surprises on the principle that Brazil is a  market economy.    [Caldas] Does the plan contain an alternative for relieving  the hardships suffered by the needy?    [Arida] We are going to rethink the government's structure  of  social expenditures. We are studying conceptually interesting  proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income  program, one such proposal being the one drawn up by Senator  Eduardo Suplicy. The idea is to improve living conditions for  the poor population by using budget resources shifted from other  items so as not to throw the budget out of balance. That idea is  being discussed, and since its implementation requires only an  administrative decision by the executive branch, it will not be  long in coming.    [Caldas] You talk about the importance of leaving prices and  wages unregulated. Why were rules for wages adopted?    [Arida] That aspect has frequently been misunderstood. If we  left wage negotiations entirely unregulated, it is possible that  some wages would be below average while others would be above,  depending on the category and especially the region involved.  Forced conversion to the average actually functions economically  as a protective mechanism. It does not result in any losses at  all, and it protects the poorest sectors of the working class.  Moreover, forced conversion has legal justification derived from  the rules for the nominal irreducible wage level guaranteed by  the Constitution. This differentiates wages from all other  prices. And it was what led us to adopt conversion to the  average.    [Caldas] There are proposals in Congress to amend  Provisional  Measure 434 in the direction of a wage trigger. Would the  administration go along with that?    [Arida] The concept underlying the Cruzado Plan is  surprisingly alive in society. Proposals for wage triggers and  for price increases expressed in URV's are being revived without  a clear understanding of what the URV is, the reason being that  everyone is always raising prices. It makes no sense to agree to  a wage trigger. The correct economic response in cases of price  speculation is to let the market operate.    [Caldas] The oligopolies are not accustomed to obeying the  rules of the marketplace.    [Arida] There are exceptions; there are specific cases that  cannot be ignored. But as a philosophy, the concept must be that  of the marketplace--that is what makes sense for this program.  The provisional measure does not prevent the existence of  indexing clauses. It requires only that they run for one year.    [Caldas] Will the increases negotiated between unions and  employers be unregulated?    [Arida] Of course. The principles of free negotiation will  be  respected. But there is a big difference between a wage increase  based on free negotiation, increased demand, or increased  productivity and one based on automatic application of the  indexing clause. There is nothing to object to in the first  case, since it involves natural phenomena in a market economy.  The second case is based on a predetermined situation that we  must avoid. As for the question of whether losses will or will  not occur when the real is introduced, I would point out that  the entire matter of rules for issuing the real and providing  backing for it has not come up yet. That is an important point  to be brought up further down the road.    [Caldas] Could you tell us anything about it?    [Arida] I prefer not to. But the point I would like to make  is, once again, that we do not want to repeat previous  experiences in which, even though the unit of currency was  changed, there was no substantial change either in the  institutional framework or in the conditions for issuing the new  currency. I am using generic expressions--institutional  framework, rules of issue, and backing for the currency--to  emphasize that we are talking about a different monetary system  associated with the new currency. That contrasts with the  previous plans, in which the monetary system remained unchanged.    [Caldas] Is there really a two-month deadline for adopting  the real?    [Arida] Look, so far we have not done anything based on the  electoral timetable. We said that we would not begin the second  phase until the first was completed, and that was how it turned  out. The third phase will actually depend on our assessment that  the economic conditions are most appropriate for beginning the  third phase. There is no pressure--no timetable.    [Caldas] What do you mean by "appropriate conditions"? Would  that be when inflation in terms of the URV stands at zero?    [Arida] This matter of the URV is being misunderstood. Since  the URV is based on a basket of currencies, we will have a  mixture of three indices. There will be URV inflation when one  such index is higher than the average for the three. But since  the average is equidistant by definition, URV inflation in one  index means that there must be URV deflation in another just by  the nature of things. So the question of so-called URV inflation  is not a concern. As regards the proper economic conditions for  introducing the real, we need to assess the process of forming a  new social pact, changes in the tax situation, and the issue of  constitutional revision--the basic features of the way the  economy is developing.    [Caldas] But aren't you afraid that the speculation of the  past few days will cause URV inflation?    [Arida] I understand the problem. But I would remind you  that  there is always discipline in demand. Why is it that Brazilian  automobiles do not cost $100,000? The reason is not that auto  manufacturers would not like to charge $100,000. The reason is  that no one would buy their product. A real price increase when  the economy is competitive--with unrestricted imports and so  on--is subject to built-in restraint. Certain speculative  bubbles are disciplined by demand itself. As for the decision to  introduce the real, that decision will be made at the proper  time without reference to the electoral timetable. So far we  have not done anything subject to the electoral timetable. They  said we were going to implement the plan in January so that it  would be successful in April. Now the date has been changed to 1  May because that is Workers Day. There are no electoral  considerations in this program. It follows its own logic.    [Caldas] There are certain cases in which the free market  does not function in Brazil. The schools have converted their  monthly fees to URV's without consulting the parents of the  pupils. The parents must either pay what the school wants or  remove their children.    [Arida] There are specific examples of abuses in which  government arbitration is useful. I am not saying that that is  one example. Neither am I being radical or naive. I am stating  the basic philosophy behind the program, which is based on a  free market--on freedom for the economic agents to agree on new  pacts. This program has an educational side. It involves  confidence in the democratic process, prior announcements, and  discussion and confidence in the support of society, in  Congress, and in the market mechanisms.    [Caldas] In what areas could constitutional revision help  the  plan?    [Arida] The timing we were contemplating had constitutional  revision occurring sooner. The stabilization of a country does  not take place in one day, and it will not occur even on the day  when the real replaces the URV. It is a lengthy process from the  standpoint of time. In that process, structural reforms of the  economy are absolutely vital in order to ensure stabilization.  That is where the importance of constitutional revision  increases, because revision can open up opportunities for the  economy to modernize itself and for the government to define its  role and specific functions. It is essential to reform the  welfare and health systems, redefine the issue of legal  monopolies, and simplify and restructure the tax system. Those  are structural reforms which, when you get down to it,  constitute the real foundation of stabilization. Much more so  than the emergency tax issue, the URV, or the real.    [Caldas] All indications are that the assembly on revision  is  going to eliminate the monopoly on telecommunications but that  the petroleum monopoly will remain.    [Arida] Defending the monopolies is completely wrong.  Telecommunications are a dramatic example. From the shareholding  standpoint, the privatization of telecommunications has already  occurred. The government now owns 17.5 percent of Telebras, and  the rest is entirely in private hands. From the standpoint of a  good privatization program, the way in which Telebras shares  were sold over the course of time was tolerable. They were sold  at ridiculously low prices without consulting the Treasury,  which held the controlling interest, at all. The only question  today is the legal obstacle, since ownership is already private.  The important thing to emphasize is that the whole world  provides examples of the advantages of competition in the  telecommunications industry. There is no room for doubt on that  score.    [Caldas] Some economists have been saying that the  government  itself will encourage inflation in real cruzeiros in order to  force prices up, provoke a recession, and allow the new currency  to take off with a safety cushion. Is that so?    [Arida] The program is going to be managed. We have no  intention of deliberately provoking an acceleration of  inflation. It has never been considered. That is Machiavellian  madness.    [Caldas] The expression "economic-financial equilibrium" as  found in Article 7 of the provisional measure is being  interpreted to mean the intention to establish a price schedule  in the move toward the real. In what cases would that be used?    [Arida] There cannot be a price schedule. As regards the  expression you mentioned, there is some concern over the  specific matter of old residential rents, which are covered by a  specific law and certain rules regarding increases every six  months. We will have to think about what to do in that specific  case, which is regulated by law and must be treated differently  than other cases. That is the only thing.</p>

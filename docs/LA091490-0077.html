			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TOWN TRYING TO HELP POLICE DOGS' SENSE OF SMELL DRAWS FINE  </P> <P> Federal officials have fined Johnson City $6,000 for removing catalytic  converters from police cruisers in a bid to protect police dogs' sense of  smell.  </P> <P> The smell of the anti-pollution devices temporarily deadens the dogs' sniffing  power, police dog handlers say. Law-enforcement officials say they may need  those minutes when tracking a suspect.  </P> <P> A city official two years ago authorized removing catalytic converters from  cruisers transporting police dogs. But the Environmental Protection Agency  found out about it and fined the city $6,000.  </P> <P> City Manager John Campbell said Wednesday that the city may appeal. He said the  city otherwise has had a good compliance record with the Clean Air Act.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardas Jarmalavicius: "A Confidential Meeting </F> With the Chechens"]    [Text] As we have learned from reliable sources,  yesterday, Lithuanian Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas and his  Chechen counterpart I. Sheripova signed an agreement on  cooperation between the two offices in investigating criminal  cases.    Chechen Prosecutor General I. Sheripova arrived in Vilnius  on  Tuesday [1 March]. The visit was shrouded in secrecy from the  very beginning. V. Eidukaitis, representative of Chechen  President D. Dudayev in Lithuania, told RESPUBLIKA that Mrs. I.  Sheripova had arrived at his invitation to "settle certain  issues." According to Seimas [parliament] Deputy A.  Endriukaitis, leader of the group for Lithuanian-Chechen  parliamentary relations, employees of the Lithuanian and the  Chechen Prosecutor General's Offices have cooperated constantly.    I. Sheripova also avoided a definitive reply by telling a  RESPUBLIKA correspondent that she, as well as her Lithuanian  colleagues, were concerned with the same problem -- crime.    As one employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told  RESPUBLIKA, by signing the agreement, the Lithuanian Prosecutor  General's Office has found itself in an "awkward" position. The  reason is that the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is worried that  the agreement with the Chechen Republic as an independent state  might harm our relations with Russia, which views this Caucasian  state as its republic. Nor has Lithuania recognized the  independence of this country. It was decided not to publicize  this agreement so as to avoid a diplomatic incident.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> STEROIDS LINKED TO HEART ATTACK  </P> <P> Men who use steroids to pump up their bodies may be increasing their risk of  heart attacks and strokes at an early age, a researcher warned last week. The  potential of the drugs to cause blood clots and blocked arteries may represent  an "underreported and underappreciated" risk, according to a Michigan State  University physician who said steroids have been linked to several heart  attacks and strokes among young men.  </P> <P> In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Gary Ferenchick  described the case of a 22-year-old college athlete in Michigan who died of a  heart attack. An autopsy showed two of his coronary arteries were blocked.  </P> <P> A police investigation revealed that the man -- a weightlifter -- had been  using androgenic steroids, which build up body and muscle mass, Ferenchick  said. He said an examination showed the man's blood had clotted in a manner  that apparently led to the artery blockage and may be linked to the steroids.  </P></p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Bonds: Torpor as investors rethink asset allocation strategies THE international bond market appears to be drifting further into limbo following a period of almost unprecedented new issue activity during February and early March. The flurry of new issues immediately after Easter could not be sustained, making last week perhaps the most frustrating for syndicate managers since before the Gulf war. Added to the usual complaints that arbitrage opportunities in the currency and interest swaps market are not available to borrowers, deeper factors are stifling activity. One explanation for the torpor is that many of the institutional investors which dominate the Eurobond market are currently re-formulating asset allocation strategies for the coming quarter. These reviews include decisions on types of asset (equities, bonds, cash) and on currencies within each category. This strategy-making is important for Japanese institutional investors, after their financial year end on March 31. Moreover, the attitude of Japanese investors this financial year is central to the level of activity in the international bond market. Daiwa, the second largest Japanese securities firm, estimates that Japanese life insurance companies will cut their holdings of foreign securities from 30 per cent of total portfolio to just 17 per cent this year. The figures are based on an annual survey of institutional investors which usually provides an accurate indication of future investment patterns. Moreover, new funds available to these investors for allocation will fall from Y12,000bn in the last financial year to Y10,000bn in fiscal 1991. The investment behaviour of the life insurance companies is a reasonable guide to the asset allocation plans of other Japanese institutions. For example, the larger pension fund investors and City banks might be expected to follow a similar pattern of asset allocation in the coming year. Such figures do not promise a bumper year for the international bond market. More importantly in the near term, the process is taking place against uncertainty over the economic prospects in general, and the direction of interest rates in particular, in many of the big economies. A surprise factor has been the speed with which outright economic gloom has been replaced by budding optimism. The conclusion of the Gulf war with a minimum of economic disruption has added to hopes for higher growth and fuelled fears of higher inflation. Many analysts now expect the US economy to rally in the second half of the year, which may cause the Federal Reserve to put a floor on its recent aggressive easing of monetary conditions. Against this, bond market analysts in Europe remain gloomy about the prospects for the US economy, and are therefore hopeful that rates will come down further. In particular, there is a school of thought that the lowering of US interest rates will benefit the banking system rather than promote growth in the economy as a whole. The difference between the Fed funds rate (at which liquidity is supplied to the commercial banking system) and the prime rate (on which much personal lending is based) currently stands at around 300 basis points, high by historic levels. Although this has restored lending margins in the US banking system, it may not alleviate the 'credit squeeze' for US firms. 'The normal transmission mechanism from lower interest rates into increased economic activity is not expected to work fully in this cycle because of the high level of debt held by the personal and corporate sectors,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. 'The banks remain reluctant to lend despite recent rate cuts.' In European markets it is unclear how far monetary conditions in most economies can ease while inflationary pressures for higher German interest rates remain strong. Despite the gloomy statements by Bundesbank president Mr Karl-Otto Poehl, the German discount rate has not been raised from the 6 1/2 per cent level set on January 31. However, Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council will again be preceded by intense speculation. Against this background, the problem for bond market investors lies in judging how far UK, French and other authorities can relax monetary conditions. The current weakness of the D-Mark within the European exchange-rate mechanism gives them some room for manoeuvre. The UK government's decision to shave interest rates by a further  1/2 percentage point to 12 per cent on Friday proves the point. However, investors are aware that there are limits to how far monetary policies can diverge within the context of exchange-rate co-operation. Overall, the outlook for fixed interest markets vis-a-vis other types of assets looks more clouded than even two months ago. Equally, the foreign exchange markets appear to be at a watershed following the dollar's startling surge during March. 'On a 12-18 month view, bond yields are expect to be lower in all countries except Japan,' said Goldman Sachs in its latest World Investment Strategy. 'However, in the short term we expect bond yields to actually rise. A perception that activity in the US is about to pick up has led to fears that the Federal Reserve will stop easing. Further, the worsening prospects for inflation in Germany might lead to rates rising there.'</p>

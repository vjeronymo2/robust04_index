This is the government's latest move to safeguard the  repayment of bank loans and investment capital while guiding  investment to flow in the desired direction.    China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation (CNIGC),  with a registered capital of 500 million yuan and 18 million  U.S. dollars in its foreign currency fund, is poised to provide  credit guarantees for investments required by new and hi-tech  industry and for technical renovation.    In addition, the corporation will invest directly in  industrial projects and provide feasibility studies and  consulting services.    The guarantee business will be more or less policy-oriented,  said Jiang Lemin, CNIGC's president, as new and hi-tech projects  in any case need strong support from the government.    But the rest of the corporation's business will be conducted  to make profits, to ensure that CNIGC will have greater  guarantee powers.    At present, CNIGC can only provide credit guarantees for a  maximum 5 billion yuan, or ten times the amount of its capital  fund, Jiang noted.    He stressed that CNIGC's potential clients will encompass  all  kinds of enterprises, including foreign-funded and private ones.</p>

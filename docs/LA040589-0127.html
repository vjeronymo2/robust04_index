They  said no one had heard from Tran or the girl since the incident.  </P> <P> A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at the girl's home declined to discuss  the incident.  </P> <P> Two neighbors who would not give their names said Tuesday that they heard two  gunshots, looked outside and saw "a guy dragging a girl to the car."  </P></p>

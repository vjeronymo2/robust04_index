			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] All Israeli newspapers on 22 May carry  commentaries on the 21 May IDF [Israel Defense Forces] operation  in which Believers Resistance leader Mustafa al-Dirani was  abducted. The commentaries applaud the army's operational  capability and analyze the operation's goals, inherent message,  expected upshot, and legitimacy.    A commentary by Ze'ev Schiff on page A1 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ  in Hebrew, entitled "Perfect Intelligence," says the action  "should be evaluated by two criteria: operationally and with  regard to the degree of risk and prospects of success.  Operationally, this was undoubtedly an impressive and very  'clean' operation," "based on impeccable, commendable  operational intelligence work."    Comparing this operation to the abduction of Shaykh Karim  'Ubayd in 1989, Schiff concludes: "It now remains to be seen  whether the premises that led to the operation will prove valid,  and whether the abduction of al-Dirani will be more productive  than that of 'Ubayd."    A commentary in Daniyel Bloch's "Position" column on page 1  of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew, entitled "The IDF Reasserts  Itself," says the operation's significance "goes beyond Ron  Arad's fate. It transmits a clear message to Israel's immediate  neighbors and to distant regions that the IDF has not lost its  capability to initiate and carry out courageously and  efficiently any unorthodox operations needed to safeguard the  security of the state and of Israeli citizens, and to rescue  Israeli soldiers and civilians wherever they are."    Bloch notes that "the importance of this daring and  sophisticated operation is even greater at this time," as it has  proven that the harrowing tasks carried out by the army during  the intifadah have not impaired its operational capability.    Writing under the headline, "Kidnapping Will Undermine  Hizballah Leaders' Sense of Security and Augment Syrian  Involvement" on pages 1 and 4 of the same issue of DAVAR, Dan  Avidan notes: "The significance of the al-Dirani kidnapping and  transfer to Israel goes beyond the practical importance of his  interrogation. This, because we can state even at this early  stage that the kidnapping itself and its excellent execution  have generated a sense of personal insecurity among Hizballah  leaders at various levels." Avidan assumes that as a result,  "Hizballah leaders may now change their stand" on the release of  Ron Arad, although "no immediate positive results should be  expected."    In Avidan's opinion, "the Lebanese and Syrian Governments  have also been affected by the commando operation. Lebanon has  already loudly protested the Israeli assault on its sovereignty,  but it will not do much beyond protesting vociferously. Syria,  whose inability to foil the commando operation was a blow to its  prestige," "will almost certainly encourage Hizballah to launch  anti-IDF operations in the security zone and denounce the  Israeli operation.    "It can be safely assumed, however, that both the Syrians  and  the Lebanese will learn their lessons from the IDF commando  operation; in addition, they too will prefer to end the Arad  affair in order to avoid being humiliated in the future by this  kind of IDF activity. Both countries -- particularly Syria --  will probably take behind- the-scenes action to convince the  Iranians to release the navigator -- if the latter are indeed  holding him."    Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew carries three commentaries  on the subject. A commentary by Aharon Klein on pages 1 and 2,  entitled "Six Years Too Late," asserts that "the operation  constitutes a certain contribution to Israel's deterrent power.  It has refreshed the Hizballah leaders' memory about 'Israel's  long arm' which can reach anywhere. The question is whether it  was carried out in the right place. A second Lebanon operation  of this kind, that can provide information about Ron Arad or  bring him back home, is hardly likely in the coming year.  Al-Dirani was kidnapped only six years too late. What is  certain, however, is that national morale will soar for at least  a few days."    A commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari on page 3 of 'AL HAMISHMAR,  entitled "Signal to Syria," links the operation to the peace  process: "The kidnapping indicates a change in Israeli  doctrine. Besides being an effort to obtain the release of Ron  Arad and the MIA's, it was a signal to Syria." Since Syria  failed to respond to diplomatic attempts to secure a "gesture  toward Israel in a bid to improve the peace process atmosphere,"  "Syria will now have to make a different kind of gesture.    "The political process with Syria is based on the Israeli  willingness to acknowledge the Syrian role in Lebanon in return  for Syrian endorsement of Jordan concluding its talks with  Israel. Yet since Syria continues shackling Jordan, Israel is  now signaling that it may revert to its original demand that  Syrian troops pull out of Lebanon and that Syria resign its role  there."    The page-9 'AL HAMISHMAR editorial, entitled "Lesson for  Terrorist Organizations," asserts: "The successful kidnapping  of terrorist leader Mustafa al-Dirani should teach all the  terror organizations that their hideaways are no guarantee of  impunity." Noting that "the action was launched after all other  options had been exhausted," the editorial says: "We must  therefore congratulate the IDF for the successful operation,  which was carried out without casualties or losses, and applaud  the decisionmakers for taking the risks." The editorial adds  that "unorthodox measures may and should be used against terror  groups resorting to unorthodox methods, because there is no  other way to deal with this kind of underground.    "It is to be hoped that the international community will  view  this action not only with understanding, but also with empathy,  because the object of this successful operation was to defend  international law and to enforce it in these dark jungles, which  are a stain on the face of the earth."    Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay on page 7 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT  AHARONOT in Hebrew, entitled "Why al-Dirani, Why Now," examines  several aspects of the operation. Ben-Yishay argues that  "al-Dirani is not an important Shiite leader," and "his value in  the hostage bazaar may be even slighter than that of Shaykh  'Ubayd." He concludes, nevertheless, that "al-Dirani may be a  valuable political and intelligence asset." Another question he  poses: "Why did it take us so long to get to Mr. al-Dirani?"    Ben-Yishay adds that the operation sought to achieve several  goals, one of which was the need "to remind the dejected people  of Zion of the IDF's prowess." Another "message was to the  Palestinians: Beware! The IDF's arm reaches very far."</p>

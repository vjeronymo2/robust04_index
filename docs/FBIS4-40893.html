			<p>BFN     [Text] Lugansk -- Oleksandr Moroz, candidate for president  and chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, arrived in Lugansk on  17 June. He had his first meeting at the "Tsentralna-Irmine"  mine. Then he went to the joint-stock enterprise "Styl" and met  electors at the diesel locomotive construction workers' palace  of culture. During this meeting he set forth his vision of  getting Ukraine out of the crisis, subjected his rivals'  programs to criticism and replied to numerous questions. He  also introduced the team, which had arrived with him and to  which belong, according to him, "lawyers of world renown" and  employees of ministries.    Oleksandr Moroz stated that to begin with, he would bring  order and discipline to the state. Calling on the future  electors to cast their votes for ideas, in which they believe,  Oleksandr Moroz said: "I am not going to say directly that you  should vote for representatives of leftist forces."    Regarding the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian  parliament Speaker said that the fleet should be a joint one and  should protect the interests of both Russia and Ukraine.    Acknowledging the preservation of the sovereignty of former  Soviet Union republics, Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman  stated that the peoples of these republics should help one  another and then they would manage to remove customs-houses and  borders in the future. "We will restore accord between the two  states and other fraternal peoples, while not conceding  sovereignty," he said.    Oleksandr Moroz promised to conduct checks on the  privatization process in the country. According to him, a  special commission would be set up and an analysis of  privatization would be carried out. Those, who had privatized  enterprises and shops, would be asked where they got the funds  from. "If they cannot account for the sources of finance, they  will have to part from the privatized facilities and even do  time in jail," Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman said.    As far as foreign currency is concerned, the Speaker  promised  to ban the use of both the U.S. dollar and the Deutschmark for  settlements in Ukraine the very next day after his election to  president.    Of all of the candidates for president, whom Oleksandr Moroz  described, Volodymyr Lanovyy got the worst of it. He was called  "an individual with an unbalanced psyche."    A meeting with managers of the oblast's and town's  enterprises took place on the same day.</p>

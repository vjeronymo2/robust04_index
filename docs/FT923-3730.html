			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadians urge united protest at US subsidies CANADA IS examining ways of forming a united front with other grain producers to protest against President George Bush's decision to offer extra subsidies on US wheat exports. Mr Bill McKnight agriculture minister said yesterday that Canada has suggested a meeting with Australian and Argentine government representatives to discuss their response to the US action. The two other countries have already indicated that they plan to challenge the subsidies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr McKnight complained that the Americans 'are spending taxpayers' dollars in areas where it is not beneficial in gaining markets'. He added that 'they are harming the friends and allies that they have'. Mr Charles Mayer, Canada's wheat minister, is due to meet Australia's trade minister Mr John Kerin in Washington on September 21. French President Francois Mitterrand has protested to Mr Bush about the Dollars 1.1bn subsidy package, government spokesman Mr Martin Malvy said, reports Reuter from Paris. He quoted Mr Mitterrand as saying the subsidy 'creates disarray in countries which wish to conclude an international trade accord and will certainly put back the date at which such an accord can be signed'. France and the US have been at loggerheads over a new Gatt pact, with Washington pressing for deep cuts in subsidised European Community cereals exports and Paris saying a recent reform of EC farm policy was as far as it could go.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2230 GMT on 15 January, in its regularly-scheduled  "News 2001" program, carries a 34-minute interview with Yoshiro  Mori, Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] secretary general, and  another 34-minute interview with Keigo Ouchi, health and welfare  minister, on political reform issues.    The live interview with the LDP's Mori begins at 2238 GMT.  When asked about the LDP's attitude toward upper house debates  on the political reform bills, Mori notes the coalition  government should accept the LDP's opinions on three major  points of the reform bills. Mori says: "The first question is  about the quota and allotment of lower house seats. Under the  LDP proposal, seats of the lower house should be reduced to 471  -- 300 for single-seat constituencies and 171 for proportional  representation constituency... [pauses] Second, the size of the  proportional representation constituency should also be  reviewed. If the proportional representation election for the  lower house is conducted under a single nationwide constituency,  there will be no difference in style between the upper and lower  houses. Countries which have the parliamentary cabinet system  and two houses cannot adopt the same election system in both  houses. In this regard, we are insisting that each prefecture  must have a constituency for the proportional representation  election. And finally, we must provide legal control over  individual politicians' fund management organizations, which  have been left untouched. The coalition government says  individual politicians do not have to receive money in the  future, and all political donations must be concentrated to  political parties. That is the ideal situation, and it may be  possible to enforce the rule on Diet members. However, not all  local-level politicians belong to specific parties. For  example, 95 percent of mayors and governors are independent from  any parties. It is impossible to take all funds from them."    In response to a question asking if the LDP will seek a  positive settlement of the political reform issue through the  summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP  President Yohei Kono, Mori says: "I have been saying that, if  the ruling parties really want to enact the bills, they have to  make proposals acceptable to us." Referring to the previous  Hosokawa-Kono talks held immediately before the lower house's  approval of the political reform bills, Mori questions  Hosokawa's leadership in the coalition parties, saying: "During  the previous meeting with the president, he made no compromise  on major points of the bills. It may be very rude to say this,  but it is questionable if he had decisionmaking authority. I  think he had no decision at that time."    The moderator asks Mori about the possibility of another  political regrouping this year, and Mori says he thinks there is  a "fifty-fifty" chance.    Following Mori, Ouchi, Health and Welfare Minister who  concurrently serves as chairman of the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP], begins to speak at 2313 GMT.    Asked if the coalition government is seeking the enactment  of  the political reform bills during the ongoing extraordinary Diet  session without further revision, Ouchi says: "Generally  speaking, that is true. If the bills are revised further in the  upper house, they will again be placed under discussions in the  lower house. Probably, we will not have time to do so. Under  such circumstances, we are planning to enact the bills without  further revision as a stopgap measure, and to discuss necessary  revisions at the next ordinary Diet session. However, I  personally have some questions about the appropriateness of such  a methodology."    In reply to a question on the DSP's future partner when the  political regrouping takes place again, Ouchi says: "We will  join forces with democracy-oriented parties or politicians.  Also, our partners must have the completely same stance as us  toward policies on Japan's fundamental systems." Regarding the  possibilities of another political regrouping, Ouchi says "I am  over 80 percent certain."</p>

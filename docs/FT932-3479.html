			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Water sector The inability of the water companies to make a decent return on unregulated business has been a notable feature of the results season. The companies' response is that investment in areas such as waste disposal and process engineering is a hedge against tougher regulation after next year's review. Whether or not that proves correct, the relationship between the regulated and unregulated sides of the business should be as transparent as possible. On the surface, water companies work under stricter rules on cross-subsidies than other privatised utilities. Licence amendments introduced last year explicitly outlawed any form of subsidy passing across the regulatory divide. But the system of policing so far has been anything but foolproof. By publishing new guidelines on transfer pricing last month, Ofwat recognised as much. The dividends paid by the utility companies to their quoted parents remain a grey area. Northumbrian drew Pounds 21.8m from its utility last year, but paid out rather less to shareholders. Its unregulated business lost money. All credit to Northumbrian for reporting the dividend figures with its preliminary results. Other water companies would do well to follow suit. One can only hope the regulator takes such transfers into account when setting pricing limits for the second half of the decade. If Ofwat gets its sums right this time around, there will be precious little left over to pass up the line.</p>

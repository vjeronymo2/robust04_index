			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Montreal SE president will resign in April MR Bruno Riverin, who took the Montreal Stock Exchange into high technology and derivative products trading, is resigning next April, when he will have completed seven years as president of the exchange, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The stock exchange, Canada's second largest after Toronto, also confirmed the resignation of vice-chairman Mr Michael Harrison, and the departure of executive vice-president Mr Giovanni Giariusso. Mr Riverin helped promote the exchange's successful bond option market. The exchange has rebuilt profitability, but its share of Canadian stock trading by dollar value has slipped below 20 per cent.</p>

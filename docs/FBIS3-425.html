The column consists of more than  2,000 men, 13 tanks, 12 TM bridgelayers, four B-30 guns, two  IL-46 guns, six AG-17 rocket launchers, and 20 logistical and  personnel carriers. Two Mi- 25 helicopters stationed in  Cambamba and several fighter bombers stationed in Luanda are  also part of the column. Gen. Numa said the ongoing offensive  is aimed at the civilian residents of N'Dalatando.    Turning to Bengo Province, Gen. Numa said the Luanda  government is also involved in an offensive in that province.  He said People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FAPLA] units intend to take the District of Quibaxe in order to  establish a support base to mount an attack on Uige.

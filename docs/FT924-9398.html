			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Sterling rates soften HOPES OF cuts in UK and German official interest rates continued to dominate trading in the sterling and D-Mark money markets yesterday, writes James Blitz. In the sterling money market, dealers seemed to assume that Mr John Major would win last night's vote in the House of Commons, calling for the government to embrace European economic and monetary union. The prospect of the UK government losing was simply not priced into trading. Dealers said a government defeat would be followed by a sharp mark-up in short-dated futures this morning. However, according to one discount house dealer, a government victory would almost certainly be followed by a reduction in base rates to accompany next Thursday's Autumn Statement. Dealers were daring to contemplate that the next cut will come on the morning of Friday the 13th. Sharp volatility in the trading of the December short sterling contract yesterday implied that dealers were divided over the scale of the cut. The contract rose to 93.64 in the morning, continuing Tuesday's bull run. But it later fell to 93.46, down 18 basis points on the day. Helped by another very small shortage from the Bank of England, cash rates moved to their lowest levels since base rates were introduced. One-month money closed  1/4 easier, at 7 7/8 per cent on the offered side, while three-month money ended at 7 5/16 per cent offered, down from Tuesday's 7 1/2 per cent. In the German money market, call money eased to rates of between 8.85 and 8.95 per cent after the Bundesbank injected an extra DM3.3bn into the market in the weekly securities repurchase tender. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Greenwell Montagu in London, noted that the Bundesbank accepted only 37 per cent of bids at the lowest allocated rate of 8.75 per cent. In her view, this suggested that the Bundesbank was calling a temporary halt to the recent cycle of reducing money market rates. She thinks the Bundesbank will now wait for several weeks before deciding on where to direct policy. Both the public sector wage round and the budget deficit for 1993 will be decided in the next fortnight, and the Bundesbank will take note of results there.</p>

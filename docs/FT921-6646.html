			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: SEB to fund property unit SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken plans a cash infusion for its real estate credit company Svensk Fastighetskredit, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm. In a first phase, SFK will receive SKr1bn (Dollars 168m) over the first four months of 1992, SEB said. The cash infusion comes on the back of a 47 per cent decline in SFK's operating profit to SKr267m in 1991. The fall reflects a jump in provisions for loan losses, to SKr285m from SKr20m a year earlier, SEB said. SFK's new lending last year amounted to SKr16.6bn, which brought its total lending volume to SKr103.9bn at the year-end. Earlier this week, SEB, Sweden's biggest bank, reported a near 30 per cent fall in operating profits to SKr2.32bn for last year after heavy credit losses.</p>

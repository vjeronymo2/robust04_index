			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / ScotRail launches marketing intiatives ScotRail, which operates most passenger trains in Scotland, yesterday launched a series of marketing initiatives aimed at replacing revenue lost because of the signalworkers' dispute, James Buxton writes. Mr Chris Green, the former managing director of InterCity who became managing director of ScotRail in April, said the company's revenue from fares was down by Pounds 8m. It also lost passengers because of disruption in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh owing to a major signalling fault. To win back lost passengers ScotRail has cancelled its usual autumn fares increase. It has a two-for-one offer until the end of November under which applicants obtain a free voucher for a second person if they pay for one ticket for travel anywhere in Scotland.</p>

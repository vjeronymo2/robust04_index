			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL OUTLOOK;  </P> <P> OUT OF AFRICA: REFUGEE CRISIS IS STILL GROWING;  </P> <P> BUT THE CONTINENT HAS SET WORLD STANDARDS IN CARING FOR ITS FLEEING PEOPLE.  </P> <P> Lual Teng Atia demonstrated his learning by writing his name in the dirt with a  stick. He shyly admitted to being 14 years old -- although he was not quite  sure.  </P> <P> Why did he come to this place, he was asked. With an expression of implacable  gravity heartbreaking in one so young, he uttered a single word: "Riak."  </P> <P> An interpreter spoke up. "That means 'disaster,' " he said.  </P> <P> It had been an evening three years ago. Lual was with his father and mother  near their village in Bahr el Ghazal, a region in southern Sudan where the  government had armed Islamic militias and given them carte blanche to wreak  havoc among the Christian and traditional believers of the area.  </P> <P> Lual saw them come in a cloud of dust, on camel and horseback, guns ready. He  saw some of his six brothers and sisters cut down. "They were shooting at us  all," he said. "So we all ran in different directions."  </P> <P> For weeks he wandered the Sudanese bush, taking up with a growing group of boys  just like himself. It was the dry season and food was scarce, so they ate  leaves. Finally, after at least four months afoot, they came to safety in  Fugnido, over the Ethiopian border.  </P> <P> Fugnido is the place the Sudanese war has turned into the "boys' republic," a  vast display of Sudan's disfranchised future.  </P> <P> To call the 17,000 children now here "unaccompanied minors," in the bloodless  terminology of international relief agencies, is to obscure the tragedy of a  community of boys without mothers and fathers, boys who have seen their sisters  and brothers cut down and burned alive, their very childhoods extinguished and  their tomorrows blighted by the charge of mounted Arab militiamen brandishing  machetes and guns.  </P> <P> Every refugee story is unique and every one tragic. The boys' republic in  Fugnido is only one on a continent of refugees.  </P> <P> With the exception of Afghanistan, whose war has millions of people fleeing, no  place on Earth has sent more of its people across borders in search of food,  political asylum and physical safety. The number of Africans living in refugee  camps is now 5 million.  </P> <P> Africa is the only region in the world where the refugee population continues  to grow. Most of the reason for this can be found in the benighted eastern  corner of the continent known as the Horn, where Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan  are all entangled in long civil wars with no current prospect of settlement.  </P> <P> But no region of the continent is refugee-free: Of sub-Saharan Africa's 44  countries, at least 33 harbor some refugees, according to figures compiled by  the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a Washington-based nonprofit group.  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II, now near the end of his seventh trip to the continent, has  made the refugee problem a principal focus of his visit.  </P> <P> Kenya, Rwanda and Zaire still shelter refugees from Uganda's 20-year civil war,  which ended in 1986. Southern African countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia  shoulder the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees from wars in  Mozambique and Angola. An outbreak of tribal pogroms in Burundi sent nearly  200,000 people to havens in Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania. And the matchless  brutality of Liberia's tribally inspired civil war has sent as many as 400,000  of that tiny country's 2.3 million people fleeing to Ivory Coast, Guinea and  Sierra Leone.  </P> <P> Tragically, no region of the world is as ill-equipped to receive and care for  refugees as Africa. In Asia, people eluding the ruins of Vietnam and Cambodia  make for the thriving economies of Hong Kong and Thailand; but Somalis and  Sudanese escaping their murderous civil wars can land only in Ethiopia, the  poorest country on earth.  </P> <P> In Ethiopia, as elsewhere, these large populations seeking shelter create  problems and raise difficulties for relief organizations that often appear  insoluble. Refugees can destabilize local economies, destroy regional  ecologies, harbor political dissidents and breed violence. Separatist armies do  their recruiting inside the camps, sometimes provoking government troops to  attack them.  </P> <P> But despite all this, Africans have long set a model for the world in caring  for their fleeing brothers and sisters. There have been relatively few  instances of forced repatriation or rejection by African countries.  </P> <P> The world standard of humanitarian behavior must be that set by Malawi, one of  the very poorest countries of Africa, a landlocked and deprived sliver nestled  within the "V" formed by Mozambique's border and governed by the dictatorial  90-year-old President H. Kamuzu Banda.  </P> <P> Malawi has signed none of the international compacts governing the treatment of  refugees, not even a groundbreaking 1969 convention of the Organization of  African Unity. But with graciousness and proficiency it shelters the largest  population of asylum-seekers anywhere on the continent and the largest anywhere  in the world except Pakistan and Iran: 850,000 Mozambican refugees.  </P> <P> Its ratio of refugees to indigenous population, more than 1-to-9, is the  highest in the world. Malawi's gross national product is $160 per capita, but  the refugee camps clustered around Nsanje, at the country's southern tip, are  models of efficiency.  </P> <P> Africans have long recognized that the unique features of their political  landscape and nature of their conflicts required a different standard of care  and definition of refugees. The 1969 OAU convention went far beyond any other  international compact, including those of the United Nations, in the breadth of  its definition of "refugee" and the understanding of international obligations  to protect these people.  </P> <P> Why is Africa such a prolific producer of refugees? It has become something of  a cliche to point a finger at the continent's former colonial powers for every  one of today's failures. But in this case some blame may be due, especially for  the maelstrom of the Horn of Africa.  </P> <P> More than in any other part of the continent, the national boundaries of the  Horn's countries were set by outsiders -- particularly British and Italians.  </P> <P> By contrast, in West Africa, where indigenous leaders had a voice in designing  their fledgling countries, they tended to rely on natural boundaries like  rivers and mountain ranges that had historically separated unfriendly tribes  with incompatible social and cultural habits. Nature may have given these  countries the bizarre shapes of gerrymandered political districts, but with few  exceptions it also granted them lasting political stability.  </P> <P> Not so on the far side of the continent. The national boundaries of the  countries of the Horn were drawn by straightedge at international conferences  in Europe. Dinka and Nuer tribesmen landed on both sides of the Ethiopia-Sudan  border, Somalis were found not only in the Somalilands of Britain and Italy but  deep in Kenya and Ethiopia.  </P> <P> This situation aggravates the natural difficulties of making stable states out  of the destitute lands and mobile populations of Africa.  </P> <P> "African states have rather fluid borders," observes Kingsley Amaning, a  Ghanaian official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). "Locals  question whether they should be in some other state, and central governments  can't pay for services to pacify them. In the Horn, also, people are mostly  nomads, so the idea of settling in any state is an alien one."  </P> <P> In a region of great want, it is almost inevitable that refugees tend to settle  in places of meager resources that challenge the capacity of the outside world  to reach and care for them. Nowhere is this more true than a forsaken stretch  of desert in eastern Ethiopia that has become a battleground between the UNHCR  and its multiplying army of critics, who include diplomatic observers and many  international assistance agencies.  </P> <P> This area, surrounding a tiny village called Hartisheik, was a graceless  wasteland vacant of vegetation and water in 1988 when hundreds of thousands of  Somalis emerged into it, fleeing the government's bombing of the northern  cities of Hargeisa and Berbera.  </P> <P> Unlike most other African refugees, these people were mostly urbanites, civil  servants and businessmen, some of whom arrived briefcases in hand, with their  wives and children trailing behind them. Only 5% of Hartisheik's refugees were  farmers in their old country.  </P> <P> They had held onto their homes until the last moment, as the government of  Mohammed Siad Barre, a member of the Marehan clan, made war on the Issak people  of northern Somalia.  </P> <P> "Siad Barre's people would come at night and put Issak in jails indefinitely,"  recalled Mohammed Esa Mahamoud, a member of Hartisheik's refugee committee.  "There would be no court."  </P> <P> A visit to Hartisheik is a trip through the land God gave to Cain. One reaches  the camp by a 55-mile dirt road from the nearest Ethiopian town, Jijiga,  through an unpopulated landscape blasted dry by the sun, where the only motion  visible comes from an occasional camel and the clouds of rusty dust raised by  water tankers and the off-road vehicles of international aid agencies.  </P> <P> At length you arrive at Hartisheik town, an agglomeration of sorry mud and  wattle structures situated midway between the vast camps of Hartisheik "A" and  "B." There is an astonishing flurry of activity here in the middle of the  inhospitable desert. Vendors hawk fruits and vegetables unavailable in the  rationed diet provided by UNHCR.  </P> <P> In its first year Hartisheik became a model of what can go wrong in a refugee  camp. Its relatively affluent and urbanized refugees had arrived well-fed and  in good health; under the UNHCR's care, malnutrition among the children  skyrocketed to levels nearly matching those of the worst of the infamous  Ethiopian famine of 1984-85. The agency's food-delivery system was so  inadequate that as many as a third of the refugees were placed on half-rations,  and there were riots over the meager water supply. An outbreak of scurvy, a  debilitating vitamin deficiency disease seen almost nowhere else in the world,  occurred.  </P> <P> "Rarely can a population with such considerable initial human and material  resources have been reduced to so pitiful a state while technically under  international protection," a team from Save the Children wrote in a blistering  assessment last year. The team acknowledged that "exceptional political and  logistical difficulties" existed for UNHCR, but concluded that "this tragic  outcome was, in our view, largely avoidable."  </P> <P> UNHCR officials consider themselves trapped with a no-win task; indeed, it is  sometimes hard to see how anyone could have managed in the Ethiopian wilderness  without problems. Agency officials complain that they get little credit for  erecting a camp for 340,000 refugees out of solid dust.  </P> <P> "I don't know what these critics expected to find in a refugee camp in the  middle of the desert," says Kalenga Lutato, the Zambian who is UNHCR camp  coordinator at Hartisheik. "Water in this place is like gold."  </P> <P> Still, in some ways Hartisheik has the slim advantage of being a place where  there is little local competition for resources, however scarce they are. On  the other side of the country, Fugnido's 76,000 refugees and another estimated  240,000 in the giant camp of Itang have fairly overwhelmed the local population  of 137,000 living around the provincial center of Gambela.  </P> <P> Some refugee experts consider a place like Gambela to be a perfect breeding  ground for conflicts between the indigenous population and the refugees --  always a problem in destitute areas. For one thing, the area has been literally  overrun by refugees, who have quadrupled the local population.  </P> <P> "The refugees get some support, but resources for the nationals are slim," says  Kingsley Amaning of UNHCR. "The refugees have better clinics and a better water  supply." Fugnido camp, for instance, has 23 holes (drilled by UNICEF) to supply  clean drinking water; the local population outside the camp must make do with  five.  </P> <P> Aggravating the crisis is the increasing penury of UNHCR. In past years, when  its $400-million budget applied to a worldwide caseload of 5 million refugees,  the agency put a lot of money into projects that would benefit refugees and  their hosts alike. These included improving the local infrastructure of roads  and services. There were also development programs to move people into  "revenue-raising activities," UNHCR-speak for small gardens, weaving, pottery,  and so on, which would make them more self-sufficient and ease the strain on  local resources. To some extent this approach provided a positive incentive to  locals for welcoming refugees, even if their large numbers tended to disturb a  way of life.  </P> <P> But with the same UNHCR budget now spread thinly over a clientele of 15 million  refugees, all of those programs have ceased. "Now we just have enough money for  basic assistance and life-saving programs -- but just for refugees," says  Amaning.  </P> <P> The conflict is intensified by the despoliation of the local ecology.  </P> <P> "Just five years ago, this entire area was so thickly forested you couldn't see  from here to there," remarks Mathias Temesgen, an official of the Ethiopian  Administration for Refugee Affairs, as he waves his hand over an empty, lightly  grassed landscape dotted with dying bushes. The region was so rich in wildlife,  especially elephants, that it attracted affluent foreign hunters as one of  Ethiopia's few tourist attractions.  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of refugees have ranged over the land, cutting down trees  for fuel, denuding the dales and hillocks so thoroughly that Itang has suffered  something no one can remember ever happening before -- extensive flooding  during the rainy season. No one has seen an elephant in several years.  </P> <P> For now, relief agencies and the Ethiopian government do what they can to mold  the refugees, especially the children, into a community. As many children as  can fit through the low doors of the classroom huts are given lessons in  English, Arabic and mathematics, although books and paper are as highly prized  here as water is in Hartisheik. Even with two shifts a day, 3,000 children  still must go without any schooling at all.  </P> <P> In the empty days they wash their clothes in a nearby river, or kick a  makeshift soccer ball around the dry fields between the huts. The adults around  the camp watch them with concern, for these children who escaped the murderous  militias of Sudan are the flimsy repositories of the country's hopes. Many more  were left behind.  </P> <P> "It was escape or die," remembers Elijah Alier, a former telecommunications  engineer from Bahr el Ghazal who recalls his own family's escape to Fugnido  with the dryness of detail that submerges grief. People were being shot on the  street and rounded up by night, he remembers. On the day he left, he collected  his wife and two of his children, ages 2 and 4. His third child was off playing  with friends, and there was no time to find him. He was 6 then, three years  ago. There has been no word of his fate from a land where children were being  captured and killed or enslaved by the thousands.  </P> <P> "He was picked up by another family," Alier says quietly, "if he was lucky."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refugees: Still A Growth Industry in Africa  </P> <P> Number of refugees  </P> <P> Zaire: 50,400  </P> <P> Liberia: 68,000  </P> <P> Western Sahara: 165,000*  </P> <P> Burundi: 186,500*  </P> <P> Rwanda: 233,000*  </P> <P> Somalia: 388,600*  </P> <P> Sudan: 435,100  </P> <P> Angola: 438,000*  </P> <P> Ethiopia: 1,035,900  </P> <P> Mozambique: 1,354,000*  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Committee for Refugees  </P> <P> * Indicates that numbers vary significantly in number reported.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by PRAVDA correspondent Yuriy Razgulyayev: "The </F> Payroll Was Hidden in the Basement: While the Relatives of  President Akayev Blow Away $1 Million in Phony Credit in Vienna,  a Starving Peasant Sells His Infant on the Steps of the  Parliament"]    [Text] Bishkek--The proceedings of a regular session of the  Zhogorku Kenesh, the Kyrgyz parliament, in Bishkek ended in a  row. At the beginning of the session President A. Akayev ran up  to the podium with a red file in his hands. He stated literally  the following:    "I know that some deputies are collecting compromising  evidence against me. This does not scare me. Moreover, I am  asking the prosecutor general to check out the first document  that has ended up in this file--a statement of the control  chamber...."    I will outline the content of this document for our readers.  In the opinion of the control chamber, it has revealed egregious  violations of legislation in the process of the receipt and  disbursement of foreign exchange credit by a certain commercial  company. The brother of the president's wife is the director of  the company. Understandably, throughout the days following this  event the parliament was abuzz and anxious as it discussed this  unconventional conflict. On the last day, the general prosecutor  reported on the results of the investigation.    As many had expected, the prosecutor found all the arguments  of the control chamber to be unsubstantiated. However, the  picture changed abruptly when the deputies began to ask  questions. First, it came out that the brother of the  president's wife had right away transferred $1 million which had  been borrowed at "a ridiculous rate of interest" to Vienna, to  his son-in-law--the chairman of the National Bank. The latter  purchased in Malta "merchandise that was most necessary for  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]"--ladies' coats with fur collars and  underwear--and shipped them to Bishkek. The slow-witted people  were in no hurry to purchase the merchandise, and for this  reason the foreign exchange still has not been recovered,  although all the deadlines have long since passed.    It was precisely these circumstances, rather than the legal  intricacies, that outraged the deputies the most. For example, a  female physician from Bishkek asked reasonably:    "Do we really have no other way to spend foreign exchange?  Give it to our hospital or buy medicines.... We do not have what  we need to treat patients...."    D. Tentiyev, general director of the Ilbirs Knitwear  Association:    "Had we purchased raw materials for this $1 million, the  entire republic could have been buried under cheap underwear and  clothing for children."    Rural residents were outraged in particular. All their  requests to help with purchasing gasoline for the planting  campaign or fertilizer have invariably drawn the same response:  There is no money. It turns out that Minister of Industry and  Commerce A. Iordan offered this to the director of the  commercial company even without a request: Take $1 million!    Deputy from Dzhalal-Abad O. Tekibayev said: "The  prosecutor's  office may not be interested in the moral, ethical aspect of the  issue. However, we cannot remain silent about the fact that  since as early as the year before last earthquake victims have  not had a roof over their heads. Hundreds of families who have  lost their houses to landslides have now been added to the  victims. And at such a time the president defends his relatives  who are churning state dollars for their own benefit...."    Incidentally, a blood-curdling episode occurred during the  same days. Right on the steps of the White House (Bishkek also  has one), a peasant was selling his child so that his other  children might survive. It turned out that he had sold his  tobacco and cotton to the state but was unable to get the money.  Fervent monetarists were saying that a lot of cash cannot be  issued, or there will be inflation.    Such was the unexpected outcome of the president's attempt  to  whitewash his relatives and take in hand the "loudmouths and  provocateurs," although, to tell you the truth, this entire  session was given to such scandals and score-settling. Precisely  while the session was in progress, the press reported that chief  of the Issyk-Kul Oblast Administration Zh. Saadanbekov had  repaired a two-story residence at the expense of the state and  had privatized it free of charge right away. A huge downtown  restaurant was sold at the price of a passenger car. The plague  of corruption has reached even into the Ministry of Defense. Its  employees have given hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to  commercial structures "on interest." Meanwhile, soldiers  frequently faint of hunger and flee their units.    The accusation of pouring it on too thick can be leveled  against me. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the unseemly facts  that were talked about at the session have been mentioned here.  It was no accident that the deputies themselves established a  special commission to "verify the purity and integrity" of their  ranks, that is, those who, taking advantage of their positions,  "grab-it-ized" houses, shops, hotels, and cars, and those who  "churn" loans which the rural residents lack so badly.    However, I am afraid that all these commissions,  score-settling, and even dismissals and resignations will hardly  change the situation radically. President A. Akayev responds to  all sharply worded questions in the same manner: "they will give  us credit," "they will help us, they will pay for us."  Unfortunately, many problems are now solved in Kirghizia at this  level. The Kazakhs will come to build the Naryn Hydropower  Stations; the Russians will come to restore defense enterprises;  and the Turks will come to build hotels. A. Akayev promised this  to even the blind and the deaf who assembled in front of the  parliament after the deputies had canceled all preferences for  them: We will set up a foundation, and international  organizations will help you.    "We will get it, we will split it up, we will grow rich"--it  appears that this formula is becoming increasingly dominant in  the minds of present-day reformers. At any rate, almost nobody  is talking about production. Prime Minister A. Dzumagulov makes  some attempts to have society face real, specific endeavors.  However, this policy does not enjoy any support from the  president or his team.    On the other hand, the reformers themselves are beginning to  look askance at A. Akayev. An alarm signal sounded at this  session. Three ambassador designates nominated by the president  were not confirmed. For the second time they sent packing E.  Karabayev, Akayev's closest comrade-in-arms, who headed his  staff for a long time. First, they failed to confirm him as  minister of foreign affairs, and this time--as ambassador to the  United States.    T. Chyngyshev, former prime minister, who did not resign of  his own volition, also failed to become ambassador to the FRG.  Just like E. Karabayev, he is "deeply privy" to the still  smoldering "gold scandal."    In deputy smoking rooms it was said: "They know too much."  Therefore, on one hand, they needed to be bought off, while on  the other--"sent far away." All the more so because T.  Chyngyshev himself said directly in an interview to the  newspaper POLITIKA that he was suffering "for someone else's  fault" in the "gold affair." For whose fault can the number two  person in the state suffer in silence?    There is a reason they say in the Orient that all  reassignments at the top are prepared "behind the scenes." I  think that the "foreign exchange" and "gold" scandals mentioned  here and mistakes in personnel selection are nothing other than  reverberations of the skirmishes in the back rooms. Akayev's  rating, which is declining more and more, points to the same.  Recent surveys ranked him as low as seventh.    The last meetings of the session indicated that the attitude  toward the policy of the president and the government is  undergoing a major change. People are losing hope that their  lives will finally improve. At present city bazaars are piled  high with relatively cheap meat. Rural residents are  slaughtering cattle in order to survive. They have not been paid  for a long time; the money is being kept in the basement of the  national bank, thus preventing inflation. For the fourth year  now almost no fertilizer has been applied on irrigated lands in  the Chu Valley.    This is what concerns people more than anything else. There  is already a shortage of food for children, while the old,  solidly designed economy has not ultimately fallen apart. Alas,  the president prefers to talk about credit and the image of  Kirghizia in the international arena. He is leaving for Paris  again....</p>

With the goal of finding out any trends in auto wheel  weight in the marketplace and providing basic resource data for  future wheel manufacturing, the Light Metal Wheel Committee of  the Japan Light Metal Association conducted a study in June and  July of this year. The committee conducted a survey on steel  wheels and the light metal alloy wheels (solid and fabricated)  manufactured by the companies comprising the committee, and they  looked at the narrowest, widest, and greatest quantity (the  average value for the product made and sold in the greatest  quantity) for each rim size.    The results show that although the survey makes no  distinction between wheels used on passenger cars and those used  on trucks and busses, there is a large difference in weight  between light metal alloy wheels and steel wheels when they are  used on trucks and busses.    Among light metal alloy solid wheels, those with the  narrowest rims seek lighter weight, whereas attractive design is  most valued in those with the widest rims. In the 17 inch  wheels, the study found weight differences as large as 6.8 kg.  In the case of light metal fabricated wheels, however, the  change in the weight difference at each rim size was not as  clear cut.       Because there is no clear distinction between steel wheels  used on passenger cars and trucks, a simple comparison is  difficult, but the variation in weight difference for each rim  size of the narrowest wheels represented only the difference in  volume, and there was almost no variation due to design.    As a result, the committee learned that the change in the  weight difference at each rim size varies similarly for both  steel wheels and light metal alloy solid wheels. There was  almost no difference in weight between solid and fabricated  light metal alloy wheels, and when there was a difference it was  less than one kilogram. However, the difference between light  metal alloy wheels and steel wheels grows larger over 15, 16,  and 18 inches, with the difference being 5-6 kg at 16 inches,  and about 18 kg at 18 inches.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-08A>           Graph </FIG></p>

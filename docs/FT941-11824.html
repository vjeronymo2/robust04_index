			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / FT-SE 100 index reaches a 'real' all-time high: Confidence on inflation and interest rates helps overhaul 1987 record The FT-SE 100 index reached an all-time inflation-adjusted peak of 2,136.91 on Monday. As the chart points out, the previous high point for the index was reached on July 13 1987, writes Steve Thompson. The stock market crash, which saw the FT-SE 100 plunge 500 points, or around 20 per cent, in two trading days, took place in October 1987. Market strategists, while pointing out that current markets are looking stretched, yesterday highlighted the contrasting outlook for interest rates and inflation between 1987 and now. Retail investment is focusing on higher returns from the stock market than are available from building societies. 'Although the comparative price/earnings ratios and yields look similar to that of 1987 there is a much greater degree of confidence in the current interest-rate structure in the UK,' said Mr Richard Kersley, UK equity market strategist at BZW.

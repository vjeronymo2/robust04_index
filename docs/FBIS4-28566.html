			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 11 (AFP) -- Two new inspectors from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported Saturday  that they were in Pyongyang despite North Korean threats to  expel them, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said.    "Everything is normal and there is no indication that they  will [be] obliged to leave North Korea," they told the IAEA's  Vienna headquarters by telephone, Kyd said.    Yun Ho Jin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said  Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures"  following an earlier IAEA vote to suspend technical aid to North  Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to allow  adequate inspection of its nuclear facilities.    Earlier it was reported that an IAEA inspector had been  expelled from North Korea and arrived in Beijing.    The inspector, Vladimir Rukhlo, was in fact returning to  Vienna after completing a tour of duty and had been replaced.  The other team member, Jamaluddin Omar, returned to Vienna  Tuesday following a death in the family.    Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could  include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban  on all verification procedures and a possible withdrawal of  North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty.    However, no official message had reached the IAEA  headquarters midday Saturday and the atomic agency did not  expect any official reaction from North Korea before early next  week, Kyd said.    Any retaliation by Pyongyang could harden the position of  the  UN Security Council which is expected to vote in the next few  days on whether or not to invoke sanctions against North Korea.    The IAEA's two new inspectors arrived in North Korea at the  start of last week to replace their colleagues who had been  there since mid-May, observing the downloading of the 5-megawatt  Yongbyon experimental nuclear reactor but without being allowed  to take samples.    Fewer than 10 of some 8,000 used nuclear fuel rods remained  to be downloaded Friday, the outgoing inspector reported, Kyd  said.    The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has  restricted  the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal the diversion  of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme.    IAEA director general Hans Blix last week told the UN  Security Council that with 68 percent of the rods downloaded,  the agency was unable to verify whether or not nuclear material  had been diverted.</p>

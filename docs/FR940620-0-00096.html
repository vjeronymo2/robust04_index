			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments received confirm that incised characters are not generally readable and therefore do not provide an acceptable level of accessibility. Additionally, sign manufacturers indicated that they incurred little financial hardship in retrofitting equipment to produce raised rather than incised character signs. Although certain custom signs may cost more, the cost of most signs with raised characters is sufficiently comparable to the cost of signs with incised characters. No change to the technical provisions for tactile signage have been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department of Justice issued technical assistance letters stating that the only signs subject to the tactile sign requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(16)(a) are room numbers, exit signs, and signs designating men's and women's rooms and locker rooms containing men's and women's rooms. In light of this interpretation, the NPRM asked whether State and local government facilities should be required to provide tactile signs when signs are provided which give information about the function or use of a room or space. A few commenters suggested that all building signs should be tactile to ensure unassisted access to buildings and facilities. Many commenters requested that a sign such as ``Courtroom'' also be required to be tactile even when it does not include a room number. The Awards and Recognition Association, which represents members of the engraving industry, commented that a tactile room number, alone, is of little use unless one has prior knowledge of the room's function. A number of commenters stated that they interpreted ADAAG 4.1.3(16)(a) to require that signs be tactile even if only a name or single character, such as ``A'', is the designation of a permanent room or space. In their view, permanent rooms and spaces often are designated by names, in which case, these signs are required to be tactile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters urged that the scope of the tactile provisions not be expanded to cover signs, or portions of signs, which provide information about a room's function. They responded that information about room function is ancillary to room designation, and therefore should not be required to be tactile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments from design professionals, trade associations, sign manufacturers, and organizations representing persons with vision impairments strongly urged that the signage requirements covering title II and title III entities be the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters interpreted ADAAG to require tactile signs even where permanent signs use only characters (names or letters) to designate a permanent room or space. The current scoping language in ADAAG 4.1.2(7) and 4.1.3(16)(a) require that those permanent rooms or spaces that are designated by permanent signs comply with the technical provisions in ADAAG 4.30.1 and 4.30.4 through 4.30.6 for raised and Brailled characters, finish and contrast, and mounting height and location. No changes have been made to the scoping requirements in this section of ADAAG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the comments received in this rulemaking, the Department of Justice has reconsidered its policy regarding tactile signs, particularly whether to include room names in addition to room numbers, exit signs, and signs designating men's and women's rooms and locker rooms containing men's and women's rooms. Because the NPRM addressed entities covered by title II, the Department of Justice plans to include room names for title II facilities. The Department of Justice will consider amending its title III policy to apply the broader interpretation to title III facilities in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3(17)(c)&blank;TTYs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c) (ii) requires that in stadiums, arenas and convention centers subject to title II of the ADA, at least one public TTY shall be provided on each floor level having a public pay telephone. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iv) provides that if an interior public pay telephone is provided in a public use area of a facility covered by title II of the ADA, then at least one interior public TTY shall be provided in at least one public use area. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(v) requires that if an interior public pay telephone is provided in a secured area of a detention or correctional facility, then at least one public TTY shall be provided in at least one secured area. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(d) provides that where a bank of telephones in the interior of a building consists of three or more public pay telephones, at least one public pay telephone in each such bank shall be equipped with a shelf and outlet in compliance with ADAAG 4.31.9(2). This provision contains an exception for the secured areas of detention or correctional facilities where outlets are prohibited for purposes of security or safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed that at least one interior public TTY be provided in the public areas of judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities, and in detention and correctional facilities, if one interior public pay telephone is available. The NPRM asked whether these provisions were adequate to address the need for public TTYs in these facilities. Information on the cost impact of these requirements was also requested. A large number of commenters supported the proposed provisions for TTYs in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities and in detention and correctional facilities. Several commenters requested that each level of security in correctional and detention facilities having a pay telephone, be equipped with a TTY. A few commenters regarded the proposed provisions as too restrictive and inflexible, citing high costs and problems such as TTY equipment being used as weapons in secured areas. Numerous commenters stated that portable TTYs should be permitted. Commenters noted that permanent pay TTYs are now accessible, secure, and vandal resistant. Commenters reported that the cost for portable and permanently installed pay TTYs ranges from $239 to $995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments were received regarding ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(d) which was referenced in the NPRM. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(d) requires that interior phone banks with three or more public pay telephones must have at least one phone that is equipped with a shelf and outlet for use of a portable TTY. The NPRM proposed to exempt secured areas in detention and correctional facilities from the requirement for outlets and shelves due to security reasons. A few commenters asked that the exemption be limited to outlets but not to shelves, and two other commenters requested that both an outlet and shelf be required to accommodate portable TTYs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iv) requires that at least one public TTY be provided in facilities subject to title II of the ADA where a public pay telephone is provided in a public use area. The requirement that at least one public TTY be provided in at least one secured area in a detention or correctional facility has been retained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

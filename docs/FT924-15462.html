			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / French banks seeking base rate rise PRESSURE is growing from French banks for a rise in base lending rates, to stave off the losses they will soon incur as a result of the recent sharp increase in their own cost of capital. The banks are squeezed because the interest rate on a big source of funding, the overnight money markets, more than doubled 10 days ago, in the wake of the currency crisis. But commercial banks have kept base rates unchanged, thanks to an unspoken agreement with the government to do their best to insulate the domestic economy from the worst of the crisis. Yesterday, French banks were paying 12.5-14 per cent for call money in the market, well down on the more than 25 per cent at which rates peaked earlier this week. The fall is due to the Bank of France's decision to inject more liquidity into the markets, to relieve pressure on commercial banks. Even so, call money rates were well over the three-month rate at which commercial banks lend on to big business customers and compares with the 10 per cent they were paying for overnight money before the crisis hit. The spread over base rates of 9.85 per cent is even more ruinous. 'We think the crisis will be limited in duration, and we want to limit the damage to companies, so we are prepared to hold base rates,' said Mr Jean-Pierre Bordereau, director of state-owned Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet department. But he added that if the crisis lasted for more than two more weeks, 'we will need a rapid and large rise in base rates.' Other observers fear it take only a week. 'For the past week or so, the banks have been financing the French economy at a loss. We cannot last like that for a very long time,' said the Association Francaise des Banques. How long the French banks can survive without a rise in base rates depends partly on whether money market rates continue down and partly on banks' ability to find cheap sources of funds off the money markets, mainly from their own reserves and deposits. Here French banks are more vulnerable than some of their international competitors, because they have all seen their deposits eroded in recent years by the success of their own money market funds, similar to unit trusts, which with the help of favourable tax treatment have attracted fortunes away from customers' current accounts. At present FFr1,203bn (Pounds 141bn) is invested in these funds - Sicav monetaires - by individuals as well as by small companies seeking a good return on their cash balances. Anecdotal evidence says the largest banks have responded to the crisis by withholding or delaying loans, because they are so closely monitored by the government that they are afraid to lift lending rates. Smaller, less closely monitored banks have discreetly lifted rates for individual customers. Some corporate borrowers have reacted by cashing in their Sicav units with the banks, so adding to the banks' own requirements for capital, which they may have to seek on the money markets. Any bank with a wide retail network and heavy customer deposits will be relatively well placed to ride out the crisis. This includes co-operative banks, like Credit Agricole with its more than 8,400 branches, and to a lesser extent the leading retail banks like Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris - which says it has managed to keep going by lending from its own cash - and Societe Generale. Banks with small retail networks are likely to be more reliant on borrowings for capital needs, and therefore more sensitive to money market rate rises. A prime example is the Banque Francaise de Commerce Exterieur, as well as pillars of the French banking industry like Suez and Paribas. All this presents the government with a difficult choice. It can either lower the Bank of France's official intervention rate, which influences market rates, at the risk of provoking another run on the franc. Or it can leave rates as they are, at the risk of further throttling the economy, just six months before a general election. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, a centrist former cabinet minister, made a comeback in France's Socialist-led government yesterday, taking the sensitive Agriculture Ministry in a minor cabinet shakeup triggered by the departure of two ministers for the Senate, Reuter reports from Paris. President Francois Mitterrand appointed Mr Martin Malvy, the government spokesman, as budget minister. Outgoing agriculture minister Louis Mermaz replaced Mr Malvy as minister for relations with parliament and government spokesman.</p>

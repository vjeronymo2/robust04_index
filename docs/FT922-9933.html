			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / German strikers force talks: Government to make improved offer tomorrow to public sector unions ESCALATING action by Germany's public sector unions yesterday forced the government back to the pay negotiating table. Talks will restart tomorrow evening in Stuttgart, when unions will be presented with a 'new, improved offer', the interior ministry said last night. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV public sector union leading the action, welcomed the government initiative. She said it was 'the first signal that the employers are prepared to reduce the temperature in the conflict they have provoked'. About 270,000 workers were striking yesterday. They affected airports for the first time in the eight-day wave of national stoppages. The strikes have brought most transport and rubbish collection to a standstill and yesterday forced the closure of Hanover and Berlin's Tegel airports. The oTV union said they would be stepped up and continue today at that level 'until the end of negotiations'. The union also threatened to step up action at the main international hub airport at Frankfurt, as well as Hamburg and Stuttgart. Union officials said Frankfurt, continental Europe's busiest airport, would be hit from today. 'I anticipate broad-ranging action, for example in luggage handling or safety control,' an oTV spokesman said. Strikes were due to start at midnight local time (2200 GMT) and the airport would be closed initially for 24 hours, he said. The prospect of a break in the deadlock arose as leading political parties showed signs of preparing to co-operate over the country's financial problems. A meeting between the coalition parties and the Social Democrat opposition, proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl last month, has been booked for May 27. The date was announced as Bonn buzzed with talk of a grand coalition or parliamentary elections as the best hopes for resolving pressing financial, political and constitutional difficulties. Agendas for both the pay and cross-party co-operation talks are not yet fixed. The oTV, however, said it was assuming that the employers' new proposals would include an advance on the 4.8 per cent 'final offer' which led to strike action. Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and chief negotiator for federal, state and local employers, is expected to put forward an increased overall offer weighted to give low-income public servants a higher increase than top earners. He may also seek an agreement extending beyond the normal 12 months. Ms Wulf-Mathies had earlier hinted that a compromise with limited increases for higher earners would be acceptable. Much will depend, however, on the total value of Mr Seiters' package. The unions, which had earlier accepted a 5.4 per cent rise recommended by arbitrators, have since said they want more. The oTV alone, the biggest union among the half-dozen taking action, yesterday called out 220,000 workers. A further 20,000 will join them this morning. The cumulative impact of the stoppages, which started last Monday in local transport and post offices, hit hard yesterday as people returned from the May Day holiday weekend. Most towns and cities had kerbside rubbish dumps and intractable traffic jams. Lufthansa, the state-controlled airline, said it had to cancel 200 flights yesterday, some 20 per cent of its daily traffic, and expected worse today. Although only two airports were closed, delays built up rapidly at other centres as baggage handlers, cleaners and engineering workers stayed away. About 120 long-distance trains were cancelled. Postal deliveries dried up as sorting office strikes took effect and civil servants drafted in to help proved unable to cope. Operations were postponed at dozens of hospitals and children were turned away from closed kindergartens and schools where caretakers had turned off water and power. Meanwhile, pressure built up in the private sector. The IG Metall union, which last week staged its first wave of warning strikes in the engineering industry, said that unless an improvement on the employers' 3.4 per cent offer came within days it would call an official strike ballot. Some 30,000 members have been called out on token stoppages today as employers resume pay talks this morning in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg. Printing industry unions, offered 3.3 per cent, also threatened to call out their 220,000 members.

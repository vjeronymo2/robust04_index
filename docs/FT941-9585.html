			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Why yield has become the main attraction - Glaxo Glaxo's half-year figures on Thursday kick off the UK's pharmaceuticals sector results season. With SmithKline Beecham the following week, and Wellcome and Zeneca in March, analysts will be examining the sector's fortunes in an unfamiliar light: that of the yield. Through the 1980s and early 1990s, the drugs sector was the darling of the capital growth investors. But in the last year or two, the threat of cost-cutting in government healthcare budgets around the world has stopped capital growth in its tracks. And as world interest rates began to slide, the yield on drug sector stocks turned from virtually irrelevant to the raison d'investissement. In Glaxo's case, this means that all eyes will turn first to the proposed dividend and only second to pre-tax profits. The range of City forecasts for the dividend is from 8p a share to well over 9p, compared with last year's 7p interim. Even a rise at the lower end of the scale would be a powerful reminder that a yield of almost 5 per cent from a cash-generative high-tech world leader compares favourably with a FT-SE 100 yielding less than 3.5 per cent. With pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 970m, against Pounds 819m, the slower growth follows falling interest returns from the company's cash pile and gradually tightening profit margins as healthcare reforms have begun to bite. Among individual products, sales growth of the ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, is likely to have slowed. But the performance may seem better five days later when SmithKline Beecham should reveal 1993 sales of rival drug Tagamet virtually unchanged, depending on exchange rate factors. Tagamet loses its US patent in May. Both are suffering from the strong performance of a newer drug Losec, from Astra of Sweden.</p>

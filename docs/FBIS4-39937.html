			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's State Duma (lower chamber of parliament)  has adopted the draft law on oil and gas (by one vote  difference), removing from it a provision on the exclusive right  of the central authorities to "dictate the terms" for  prospecting, exploration and the actual production of oil and  gas, their transportation and storage.    Interfax was informed by the Russian Fuel and Energy  Ministry  that some of the department's functions would now be transferred  to local authorities.    Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told Interfax that  the removal of those articles from the draft had been another  necessary compromise. He said that during a year and a half of  revision, much had been lost from its content in the search for  compromises.    However, he said he was happy that the draft law had been  adopted at its first reading. Without such a document, he said,  the government would find it very difficult to exercise control  over the holders of licenses for oil and gas production.    The president, government and constituent members of the  Russian Federation, parliamentary committees and fractions must,  by 24 June, submit their comments to prepare for the draft law's  second reading before 1 July.</p>

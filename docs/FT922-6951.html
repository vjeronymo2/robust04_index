			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ferguson International declines to Pounds 6.63m ADVERSELY affected by trading conditions world-wide, but particularly in the UK, Ferguson International Holdings saw pre-tax profits shrink by 43 per cent from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 6.63m in the year to Feb-ruary 29. However, Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said he had detec-ted 'some encouraging stirrings' in trading since January and especially in March and April. Trading profits were eroded in all of Ferguson's four legs. Mr Cassidy singled out the recessionary impact on UK retailers for the falls in the labels and hangers divisions - down 20 per cent to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5.88m) and 15 per cent to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 3.08m) respectively. The chairman cited the tightened advertising expenditure for the decline in printing and publishing, which suffered the deepest fall - 44 per cent to Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 1.45m). Trading profits of the communications components side, supplying cable TV parts in the US, slipped to Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.7m), but showed a 47 per cent return on capital employed and was, said Mr Cassidy, a strong cash generator. Group trading profits on continuing activities were down 20 per cent to Pounds 9.7m, an improvement on the 28 per cent reduction at the halfway stage. Boosted by two acquisitions - Interstate Cable Enterprises of the US and Globus Druck of Germany - turnover on continuing activities rose 6 per cent to Pounds 114.9m. Interest payable was cut by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 2.54m) and there were exceptional costs of Pounds 1.6m relating mainly to the closure of Harkwell Labels &amp; Tags. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.14m derived from the disposal of non-core businesses. Earnings emerged at 13.5p (22.7p) per share and the directors have proposed holding the final dividend at 8.25p for a maintained 12.5p total.</p>

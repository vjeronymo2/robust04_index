			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No IP/93/1043: "TACIS Finances Major </F> Conversion Project"]    [Text] TACIS, the European Community's technical assistance  programme to the newly independent states (NIS), aims to set up  a conversion plan in four regions of the former Soviet Union  where the economy has in the past been largely based on military  production. This ECU 4.5 million project will cover the regions  of St. Petersburg and Samara (Russia), Kharkov (Ukraine), and  Minsk (Belarus).    The objective of the conversion programme is to transform  industrial capabilities from the production of weapons to  civilian goods and, in so doing, maintain employment and  technical capability levels.    The project will last 30 months and will be implemented by a  consortium composed of British aerospace and the French  consulting company softrade Intergroupe.    The military industrial complex of the former Soviet Union  is  a huge conglomerate of industries. It employs some 12 million  people, 5 million of whom work on the production of weapons. It  is administered by 9 ministers. These industries are  concentrated in Russia, where they contribute to approximately  half of the country's total industrial output. Other areas of  concentration are Belarus and Ukraine where, in general,  unrelated weapon components are produced for their final  assembly in Russia. Together, these three republics employ a  workforce of 7.3 million. Russia alone has 1,100 military  enterprises employing 5.5 million staff, and 700 military  research institutes (excluding nuclear) which employ a further  1.3 million. The scale of Russia's defence-related industry,  contributing to up to 50% of its total industrial output,  indicates that the success of economic reform though less  important than for Russia, the size of the industry in Ukraine  and Belarus is also significant [sentence as received].    Following the sharp drop in military orders in the last 4  years (estimated at 70%), military companies started  immediately to produce civilian goods. However, the lack of a  coherent conversion plan resulted in a number of former military  companies producing the same goods. Further obstacles to a  successful conversion result from the vertically integrated  structure and the lack of market culture within the management  of the firms. Companies are structured to handle production  from raw materials to product components through to the final  products themselves. In most cases, they also produce the  housing, clothing, food and other basic needs of employees.  Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the  management has a poor awareness of cost control methods, quality  assurance, accounting, marketing services, distribution networks  and after sale service.  <H5>  What the EC Project Involves </H5>   TACIS aims to prepare a conversion plan for the four regions  following an assessment of the existing industrial assets, the  identification of the potential and the scale of the  corresponding investment. Conversion potential will be  evaluated by selecting three categories of company: those that  can be rapidly adapted to civilian production without  substantial restructuring, those that require fundamental  restructuring over a 5 to 10 year period and finally, those that  do not lend themselves to conversion or where the cost would be  prohibitive and their future viability doubtful. A limited  number of companies from the first and second category will be  selected for a full-scale feasibility study.    In a number of companies, it is expected that the results  from such studies will be so promising that external investment  will quickly follow. In other instances, the business case will  need to be further investigated through a detailed financial  analysis of the prospect of conversion and the corresponding  costs, from organisational restructuring to the introduction of  new processes, management methods and technology. As a result,  the selected company will be provided with marketing plans and  strategies, leading then to financing plans and/or joint venture  prospectus.    Finally, the managers of the selected companies will undergo  training by working closely with European experts who will be  providing advice on the day-to-day functioning of these  companies. The main objective of such training programmes is to  have re-trained managers running restructured enterprises.    Conversion of Aviation Industries in Moscow [subhead]    In addition, the European Commission is making an important  contribution to the development of a coherent military  conversion strategy in Moscow itself. Its assistance to the  aeronautical design bureau MIG [Mikoyan and Gurevich] and the  aviation manufacturer Lukhovitsky will be carried out by a  consortium led by Dassault aviation and composed of Arthur D.  Little and the Ares group. The 2 million ECU project will last  for two years.    From its establishment in Moscow in 1939 up to 1989, MIG,  which currently employs some 5000 people, concentrated solely on  the design of military aeroplanes. However, it now has to  convert its activities to the design of civilian aircraft as  orders from the military sector have been reduced by two thirds  over the last four years. This process of conversion is slowed  down by limited access to Western markets as a result of the  lack of certification from Western authorities of the MIG  quality assurance system.    Lukhovitsky, a manufacturing company established in 1962 and  currently employing some 7500 people, specialises in the  construction of military aircraft, including MIG fighters. It  has recently had to face a similar decline in military orders to  the Mig aeronautical design bureau and, despite its efforts to  convert to the production of civilian goods, a coherent overall  strategy is still lacking.    TACIS assistance is urgently needed to enable MIG and  Lukhovitsky to develop domestic markets and gain greater access  to foreign markets. Major tasks to be undertaken by TACIS  include upgrading the MIG quality assurance system to Western  standards and surveying its production of aluminium alloy parts.  Furthermore, the existing means of production of Lukhovitsky  will be assessed and, following an analysis of both Russian and  foreign markets for an initial list of 100 potential  opportunities, around fifteen products with the most potential  will be selected.    The implementation of new business plans will be greatly  aided by this assistance. By the end of the project, it is  expected that MIG will be able to manufacture a structural unit  for a civil aircraft in compliance with Western standards,  representing a major step forward in the conversion of aviation  industries.</p>

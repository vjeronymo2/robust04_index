			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 12: First glimpses of a property market - Hungary / Developers and agents are getting more practised at buying property from the state HUNGARY'S property market is slowly and awkwardly taking shape out of the confusion left after 40 years of communist state control of commercial real estate. But talk of a market in the western meaning still has a premature ring to it, even if Hungary is the farthest down the road of all the east European countries. The price of office space in Budapest, the capital, has finally levelled off at west European levels after three years during which it headed frantically and, seemingly, inexorably upwards. Central modern office space now rents at about DM50-55 a square metre, about the same level as last summer. More particularly, the distribution of rents in Budapest conforms more closely to the norm for a western city. Rents still vary wildly for similar properties for no apparent reason and fail to fall as one would expect as distance from the city centre increases. Nevertheless, there is more of a pattern than before, and rents on the fringes of the business district have dropped from their peaks of last summer. The gradual advent of conditions that a westerner can recognise has come with the easing of the extreme shortage of modern office space that had characterised the market. The East-West Trade Centre, a development led by Skanska, the Swedish construction firm, was completed last year and is fully let. But it took Skanska four years to put together the project. 'The secret is persistence, and not what you know but who you know,' says Mr Anthony Sutcliffe, of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis. Nevertheless, another 10 or so projects are under construction or likely to go ahead in the near future, according to analysts. For example, European Serviced Offices, a part of Mel Simon &amp; Associates, the US developer, is refurbishing a 19th century building, on the edge of the central business district, to make 3,400 sq m of serviced office space. That could be a niche suitable for eastern Europe, with its transient business visitors. NCC Fastigheter, the Swedish developer, has begun a project on the Buda side of the river Danube for 6,750 sq m of offices, banking and retail premises. That promises to appeal to professionals, who generally live in residential Buda districts and want to avoid commuting across the city's increasingly clogged bridges. At the same time, demand has been weaker than expected, moving towards equilibrium with supply. It is more that western firms require less space than forecast, rather than that there are fewer of them, according to Mr Sutcliffe. In particular, the end of general scarcity has encouraged tenants to insist on discounts on mediocre property. People can afford to be a bit more choosy than nine months ago when tenants would almost cut one another's throat to try to get any old property, says Mr Stuart Durrant, property adviser at DTZ Hungary. So the country has been treated to its first glimpses of the workings of a market in property. It is certainly an improvement on the wild early days of property development in Hungary. 'There were people sitting there selling things they did not own to people who could not afford to buy them,' says Mr Neil Gillon, European property director at Mel Simon &amp; Associates. But it is taking time to fill the gaps. It is difficult to spot a market in the hotel or industrial sector. Transactions for retail space have taken place in a shadow market. About half of Vaci Street, the prime shopping strip, is now occupied by foreign retailers - but usually after they have taken over the company, not the property. Even the office market, the most advanced, remains flawed at every point in its operation - from the basic supply of sites, the establishment of ownership, the behaviour of sellers and agents, to the shape of the investment market. 'The market is still very immature and very imperfect,' says Mr Christopher Bennett, adviser at the Budapest office of Price Waterhouse, the accountants. First, privatisation of real estate needs to be speeded up before prime office space, which is almost entirely lacking, can be developed. The key is the release of sites in the Fifth district, the central business district, which has seen little recent construction. 'There is still a quest for the Holy Grail, which is an empty site in the Fifth district,' says Mr Durrant. As time passes, developers and agents are getting more practised at buying property from the state - or rather from the hydra of the state-owned company which rents the site, the local authority which in effect has the handling rights to it, and the State Property Agency which has the title. It is this that is the problem rather than claims by former owners, which many investors worry about. Transactions are also gradually becoming smoother as Hungarians become more accustomed to the workings of a market. Deals have often faltered in the past because of sellers' rigid ideas of the value of their property. So rigid in an extreme case that a seller put up the asking price for a property to make up for list rent after it failed to sell and stood empty. The matching of supply and demand is also improving as the community of agents and property advisers becomes more coherent. Property experts recently began monthly meetings to reduce mutual suspicions of poaching which had hampered co-operation. But many transactions still stay out of sight of the open market, done principal to principal and relying on personal connections. Or they just do not get done. The development of financing and an investment market are also essential if the market is to take off. Even when a developer has cleared the way to start work, financing can present insuperable obstacles. Most is short-term if it is available and an investment market to provide developers with an easy exit option is in its infancy. With all these pitfalls, it is not surprising that many deals fall through. Beacon Companies, the US property developer, found a site with clear title, put together a Dollars 150m office and hotel project, but appears to have withdrawn. And analysts are sceptical about the future of Olympia &amp; York's large office project on a prime site next to the Hungarian central bank. 'Out of 100 projects you hear about, only about five ever start and fewer get completed,' says Mr Sutcliffe of Richard Ellis. Unfortunately, in Budapest seeing is believing. That gives particular resonance in Hungary to jokes about the value of property developers' promises.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 15 per cent-20 per cent of of a building               first year's rent legal fees: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: 15 per cent-20 per cent of of a building               first year's rent.

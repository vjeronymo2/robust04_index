			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Council must be more open Sir, I sympathise with David Gardener's frustration in his attempt to gain selected voting records of the 12 member states of the European Union ('EU unable to provide ministers' voting record', June 22). The Council's new code on public access to information does not address the issue it was established to deal with; public alienation from the process of European Union. The public are rightly disenchanted with such a secret and elitist body. When Maastricht brought in the new 'co-decision procedure' whereby the Commission proposals require the approval both of the Council and of the European parliament to become law, the European parliament was happy to debate and vote on these issues in public. Not so the Council. Whereas no one is expecting that all executive discussion should take place in public, I believe that one of the new measures brought forward at the review of the Treaties in 1996 should be for the Council to meet in public when adopting European legislation. The Council should also publish the results of all its votes. The 340m people in whose name these laws are being made deserve nothing less. David Martin, 4 Lothian Street, Dalkeith, Midlothian HE22 1DS</p>

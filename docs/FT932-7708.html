			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Italian interest rate cut to 10.5% THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 10.5 per cent, the lowest level since 1978. The move followed the positive outcome of the second Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty and is in response to calls from recession-hit industries to ease the still high cost of borrowing. The rate cut is the third this year. Commercial banks immediately began to bring their prime rates into line. On average the commercial banks looked set to cut their prime rates by half a percentage point to 11.75 per cent. The fall in interest rates, reflected in the reduced cost of financing the budget deficit, brought some relief to the Ciampi government as the economic team finalised measures for a mini-budget. This could be announced today with a mix of new taxes and spending cuts which are aimed at producing an extra L13,000bn (Dollars 8.8bn). The bulk is expected to come from higher taxes, specially on petrol. The mini-budget is also being planned in conjunction with the 1994 budget which for the first time will be ready before the summer recess of parliament. Austerity is expected to continue with the need to hold down the public sector deficit which remains over 10.5 per cent of GDP. This week the government received another harsh reminder of the continued demands on the Treasury. A constitutional court sentence has declared that some 3.6m civil servants and members of the military are eligible to have their severance pay on retirement topped up to accommodate inflation. The court allowed parliament a reasonable period to implement legislation but this will add at least L9,000bn in public spending.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> WRONGFUL DISMISSAL CASES WILL STILL HAVE THEIR DAYS IN COURT;  </P> <P> RECENT RULING ASIDE, WORKERS CAN WIN AT TRIAL IF THEY'VE BEEN FIRED UNFAIRLY.  </P> <P> Many pundits declared that employers won a big victory last month when the  California Supreme Court limited the damages that workers in most circumstances  can claim in wrongful dismissal cases. Don't believe it.  </P> <P> True, the court ruled that someone who is fired without good cause in violation  of a company promise cannot sue for emotional distress or punitive damages --  the ways by which some California employees have won jury verdicts of $10  million and more. That, in turn, will mean that there is less big money for  lawyers to make in wrongful dismissal suits and thus less incentive to pursue  weak cases.  </P> <P> But don't count wrongful dismissal cases out in California -- they will clog  the court system and give employers headaches for a long time to come. For  everyone involved -- employers, employees and lawyers alike -- the impact of  the ruling probably will be limited.  </P> <P> Even if the curbing of emotional distress and punitive damages drastically  reduces the number of multimillion-dollar jury verdicts, these remain  big-dollar cases. Damage awards for out-of-pocket losses -- the kind of losses  that plaintiffs still can sue for under any circumstances -- run into the  hundreds of thousands, and at times millions, of dollars. That's because these  cases often involve well-paid executives who sue to recover salaries, bonuses,  stock options, pensions and other benefits.  </P> <P> What if lower-paid workers want to sue? Their rights are well protected. Fired  employees have long contended that they should be able to recover all of their  out-of-pocket losses from the date of their discharge until the date they would  have retired -- normally age 65. On that basis, a terminated employee in his or  her mid-40s earning $25,000 per year could ask the jury for a damages award  exceeding $500,000.  </P> <P> In short, the stakes in wrongful discharge lawsuits will stay high enough to  motivate discharged employees to bring them -- even in cases when emotional  distress and punitive damages aren't available. And those with good cases  should have no problem getting capable lawyers.  </P> <P> The odds of an employee winning a case remain high. Previous studies have  suggested that employees in California win up to 80% of wrongful discharge  trials. The major reason: Juries tend to identify with the discharged employee  because nearly everyone works for a living or depends on someone who does.  </P> <P> Jurors look at the employee and think "there but for the grace of God go I."  The state Supreme Court's ruling, in the case of Los Angeles executive Daniel  D. Foley against Interactive Data Corp., did nothing to change this.  </P> <P> Another bit of encouragement for plaintiffs and their lawyers comes right from  the Supreme Court's ruling itself. For the first time, the court stated that  many California employees have the right to sue their employers for wrongful  discharge for violating an oral or implied contract calling for someone to be  terminated only for "good cause" or "just cause." Before, this right was  assumed by plaintiffs' lawyers but was by no means beyond challenge.  </P> <P> All this means that employers should be as careful as ever in terminating  employees. Not only is the risk of losing a significant verdict high, but an  employer's cost of defending these lawsuits is virtually unchanged.  </P> <P> Wrongful discharge lawsuits are, by their nature, hard to develop. Everyone has  his or her own version of the truth. Each lawsuit can require an employer to  spend hundreds of thousands in attorneys' fees and even more in the lost  productive work time of supervisors and managers who have to help the lawyers  and take the time to testify in depositions and at trial. The cost of a legal  defense alone should make any employer who is tempted to fire an employee  capriciously think twice about it.  </P> <P> We need only look to the track record of other states to know that wrongful  discharge will not only survive but thrive. Before the Foley decision, only one  state -- Montana -- ever permitted the recovery of emotional distress and  punitive damages in wrongful discharge lawsuits outside of cases involving  breaches of public policy. The absence of emotional distress and punitive  damages in other states has never stopped these suits; thousands of new ones  are filed each year.  </P> <P> Perhaps what is most overlooked in the aftermath of the Foley case is that  emotional distress and punitive damages will continue to be available in many  lawsuits where employees sue their employers.  </P> <P> Although the issue hasn't been definitively resolved in California, some courts  have held that such damages are in order for fired workers who are  discriminated against on the basis of, among other things, age, gender and  race. And in the Foley decision itself, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that  employees who are discharged in violation of a "substantial public policy" (for  example, someone who is fired for blowing the whistle on an employer that sells  adulterated food or engages in illegal price fixing) can win emotional distress  and punitive damages.  </P> <P> On top of that, in many wrongful discharge lawsuits, the wrongful termination  itself is not the only issue. For example, what about the employee who is not  only fired but who is also lied to by the employer about the reasons for the  firing? Or consider the case of a manager who misrepresents why an employee was  fired when someone calls for a reference check. Employees who are the victims  of flagrant employer misconduct will try to sue not only for wrongful discharge  but also for fraud, defamation or even intentional or negligent infliction of  emotional distress. If the courts permit this, it means plaintiffs still can  win emotional distress and punitive damages.  </P> <P> Consequently, the practical impact of the Foley decision on the California  workplace should be slim. As Mark Twain might have put it, predictions about  the demise of wrongful discharge are greatly exaggerated.  </P></p>

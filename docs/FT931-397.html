			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM's share price continues to slide THE SHARE price of BM Group, the construction equipment group, fell another 5p to 42p yesterday after news emerged of mounting debts and losses. The group is set to announce a survival plan, involving disposals to cut debt, alongside its half-year results. Its market value has fallen to about a tenth of last year's peak of nearly Pounds 460m. Some editions of Saturday's Financial Times carried details of the group's worse-than-expected financial state. It is set to breach banking covenants on interest cover and gearing. By June 30, net debt is expected to have doubled to more than Pounds 120m, resulting in gearing of more than 100 per cent. Part of the equation is the slide in shareholders' funds from Pounds 171m last June to an estimated Pounds 120m. This would follow 1992-93 pre-tax losses of about Pounds 30m, compared with last year's record Pounds 34.6m profit on sales of Pounds 519.5m. The main component is forecast to be exceptional costs of Pounds 40m to cover such things as restructuring and the disposal of loss-making businesses. The balance sheet will also take in a write-down in the value of the pension fund, which had been subjected to some aggressive accounting. The survival plan includes slimming down the group to leave turnover at less than Pounds 400m. Among the planned disposals to reduce debt is a 75 per cent stake in British Building and Engineering Appliances. The dividend is certain to be cut. The share price collapsed last June after the resignation through ill health of Mr Roger Shute, its founding chairman. A root-and-branch review of the formerly acquisitive group's operations has been carried out under Mr Moger Woolley, the new chairman, against the background of declining sales.</p>

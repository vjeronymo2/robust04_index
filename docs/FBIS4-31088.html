			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslava Ciznerova for the Czech Statistical </F> Office: "Better Use for Our Products--1993 Results Seen in the  Light of the Newly Introduced Selective Index of Import and  Export Prices--The Index Includes 1,795 Items"]    [Text] The first results of Czech foreign trade last year  showed a decline in average prices (values) of imported types of  goods and, on the other hand, showed growing prices of exports  involving domestic production. These findings regarding the  development of average prices are based on data contained in  customs statistics and capture not only price developments, but  also changes in the quality structure of the assortment of goods  involved.    The Czech Statistical Office, therefore, introduced a  selective price index for foreign trade, on the basis of  standard selection methods of price statistics, in which the  influences of these changes are excluded to the maximum possible  extent.  <H5>  Simpler Conditions </H5>   The price indexes for imports and exports make it possible  to  monitor pure price movements, the development of exchange  relationships, and the impact of price developments upon the  development of imports, exports, and the balance of trade. Price  indexes of this type are available only in some countries and  the Czech Statistical Office is thus similar to indexes that  were worked out during the 1970's and 1980's, but under totally  different -- essentially simpler -- conditions resulting from  the monopolization of foreign trade.    The schematic of the selective index for import and export  prices was designed during 1993 in accordance with the  standardized system (of the customs duty rate table). In so  doing, use was made of exhaustive data provided by customs  statistics and a one-time unique selective investigation, which  was carried out involving enterprises, joint-stock corporations,  and corporations with limited liability which were of importance  to Czech Republic foreign trade. Some 998 export items and 797  import items, including products, raw materials, and materials  which occupy a significant share in the overall volume of  foreign trade and regarding which it is anticipated that they  will be long-term objects of foreign trade activities, were  included in the index. The selection is expected to undergo  minimum changes in order to be able to show actual price  developments in foreign trade.  <H5>  Quarterly Determinations </H5>   Prices are determined on a quarterly basis and reflect  commercial parities and prices quoted as "all charges prepaid to  border" of the Czech Republic for imports and prices quoted as  "all charges prepaid to border" for Czech Republic exports. They  are recomputed in terms of appropriate monetary exchange rates  and do not contain value-added tax, nor consumer tax. But the  price indexes do include the influence of changes in foreign  exchange rates and the influence of changes in the composition  of foreign markets.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992 = 100                                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Selective Index for 1993 |Index of Average Values  |  |                         |                         |for 1993                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total imports            |99.7                     |98.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total exports            |104.0                    |102.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Real exchange relations  |104.3                    |103.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Those who did the indexes are aware of the fact that a  selective index monitors net price movements only based on a  limited representative quantity of selective products, whereas  the index of average values captures the broader region of  commercial commodities; however, the index fully meets the  monitored goals. As can be seen from the data in the table,  there are no significant differences between the index results  for 1993.  <H5>  Results of the Investigation </H5>   From the indexes acquired, it is clear that price  developments in 1993 were moving toward lower prices for  imports; compared with 1992, prices declined by 0.3 percent; and  there were mainly opposite trends in terms of exports, where  prices rose by 4 percent, which is proof of the better assertion  of Czech exports in foreign markets.    The investigation showed that, in 1993 imports, prices of  mineral fuels specifically declined by 10.3 percent. This was  mostly accounted for by oil, which is one of the most important  raw materials in this group. The surplus in the amount of oil  offered on world markets signaled a decline in petroleum prices  last year. Also, prices of animal and plant oils declined by  11.5 percent; the price decline in chemicals was more modest at  4.4 percent; foodstuffs and live animal prices declined by 3.3  percent. On the other hand, the prices of various industrial  products rose by 8.7 percent; those of raw materials, with the  exception of fuels, rose by 4.7 percent, and prices of machinery  and transportation devices rose by 3.5 percent.    On the other hand, in exports, the prices of various  industrial products rose by 16.1 percent, those of foodstuffs by  10.9 percent, and those of machinery and transportation devices  by 8 percent. But even here there was a decline--raw materials  prices declined by 12.3 percent, prices of chemical industry  products declined by 7.2 percent, and prices of mineral fuels  declined by 4.8 percent.    In terms of current prices, the balance of trade ended up  with a surplus of approximately 5 billion korunas [Kc]. Given an  unchanged price level, in other words, in comparable prices for  1992, last year's foreign trade activities ended up on the down  side with a deficit of approximately Kc9 billion. The interyear  development of price relationships thus resulted in 1993  revenues of virtually Kc15 billion.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON: 'UNDERACHIEVER AND PROUD OF IT'  </P> <P> Where I Live  </P> <P> The story I'm about to tell takes place in Compton. Where I live the grass  don't grow in the neighbors don't come out there house.  </P> <P>  From a gangster point of view this is home sweet home, from my point of view  it's hard to escape.  </P> <P>  Every day is a new nightmare, every nite is the same routine. In order to walk  in my shoes you have to have a strong heart, if not than less than a week you  have a heart attack.  </P> <P>  I take my chances so I walk to the liquor store hoping and praying that no one  will drive by and kill me.  </P> <P>  I commend you on your response to the ban Bart Simpson campaign. This issue  has been carried entirely too far. It seems to me that forbidding the wearing  of T-shirts with "Underachiever and proud of it" is far less of a concern than  some of the other problems facing schools.  </P> <P> While Bart expresses ideas and attitudes that are not particularly  complimentary of parents, teachers and nuclear weapons, he also allows the  public a way to vent some frustrations. Bart is not meant to be an ideal for  kids; he is only a cartoon character who is outspoken sometimes.  </P> <P> If there is such a problem with Bart in the minds of some parents and teachers,  why not think about some of the other role models that are out there? Role  models such as athletic superstars who swear continually, abuse drugs and  alcohol and gamble. Or rock stars who use lewd lyrics and gestures. When you  think of the alternatives, Bart sounds pretty good.  </P> <P> TIMI WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

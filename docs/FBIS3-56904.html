			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The central leadership of the Ukrainian People's  Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh] has described the latest  government moves -- the cancellation of credit arrangements,  immediate repayment to the National Bank of loans, withdrawal of  state subsidies for food, another round of administrative price  rises, and procrastination in index-linking wages and delay in  paying them -- as none other than the continuation of the war  waged by nomenklatura in power against the Ukrainian people.  Rukh demands the removal of these faults and warns that the  continuation by state power of anti-popular measures will  trigger spontaneous actions of protest which for their part will  violate civic peace and impede a possible change in political  tack by way of free elections.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES OK REPORT ON 7TH HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Trustees of the Oxnard Union High School District have approved an  environmental impact report on the district's seventh high school, a step  toward buying a 50-acre site in northeast Oxnard.  </P> <P> The site, south of Gonzales Road between Oxnard Boulevard and Rose Avenue, is  prime agricultural land.  </P> <P> The report notes that there will be "unavoidable environmental impacts" in  turning such land into a school site, but because of high enrollment forecasts  for three of the district's high schools, the board voted unanimously Wednesday  to approve the project.  </P> <P> By the 1993-94 school year, the district projects that Oxnard High School will  have a 174% jump in enrollment. Channel Islands High School will have an  increase of 201% and Hueneme High School 163%. The newest district high school  was built 25 years ago.  </P> <P> The land, in an unincorporated area next to the city limits, is inside the  city's sphere of influence. It must be annexed to the city before development,  said Robert A. Brown, district business manager. "We will attempt to purchase  the land as soon as possible. If not, then we will take it by eminent domain."  </P> <P> According to the report, the property owners have submitted a development plan  for 2,471 residential units and 66 acres of commercial use to the city.  However, all recent city plans for the property have shown it as a school site,  Brown said.  </P> <P> The proposed high school is planned to be operational by 1993. GERRY BRAILO  SPENCER  </P></p>

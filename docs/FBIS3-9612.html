			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Regular forces  of the Croatian Army, units of the Croatian Defense Council  [HVO], and formations of the so-called Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have begun an all-out offensive against  Serbian settlements and Serbian defense lines in Posavina,  TANJUG's correspondent has learned from Serbian military sources  in the Srpska republic. The VRS [Army of the Srpska republic]  sources say that in practice this is not just a continuation of  the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that the war is  spreading. The VRS warns that it will resolutely oppose all  attacks and defend the territory of the Srpska republic, as well  as the historic interests and rights of the Serbian people. The  Serbian side has recently obtained information that preparations  for the Muslim offensive -- the aim of which is to break through  to the left bank of the Drina -- have entered their final stage.  The VRS earlier obtained Muslim plans which in essence envisage  the idea of a frontal attack on Podrinje from several  directions. Particularly important in these offensives is the  attempt by Muslim units to link up with the Raska district and  further with Kosovo and Metohija. At the same time, the Serbian  military sources say, the Muslims are planning to link together  the Muslim enclaves in Podrinje and join them by land with the  Tuzla area. Continuous efforts on the part of the Serbian side  to achieve peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina by political and  not by military means give the best explanation and also shows  for whom the only option is war, VRS sources say.</p>

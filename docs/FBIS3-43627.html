Mr. Robaina, who is leading an eight-member government  delegation, told newsmen that the international community is  ignorant about the difficulties the United States blockade of  Cuba has imposed on the people during the past 35 years. That  is why the government has launched a worldwide diplomatic  offensive to let the world know the truth about the embargo. He  said the blockade has denied Cuba her rightful place on the  international market because it has virtually been impossible to  open the country up for foreign investment.    Mr. Robaina said in the face of all these atrocities, Cubans  believe that they have been able to survive the worst of tests.  He said no other form of pressure, apart from respect for the  dignity of Cubans can resolve the island's impasse with the  United States.    The foreign minister repeated that Cuba is ready for  dialogue. However, she will negotiate under one condition only,  and that is mutual respect for each other's dignity and  sovereignty. He added that his visit to Africa will afford him  the opportunity to update his knowledge about the region and  consolidate the bonds of friendship and cooperation between Cuba  and Africa. Mr. Robaina will also visit Namibia, Angola, and  Zimbabwe.</p>

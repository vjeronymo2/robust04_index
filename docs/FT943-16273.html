			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Divestment of Air Jamaica postponed The divestment of Air Jamaica has been delayed by three months following changes in the the consortium purchasing the airline from the island's government. The disposal was to have been completed last week. The Air Jamaica Acquisition Group, which is purchasing a 70 per cent stake in the troubled airline for USDollars 26.25m, asked for more time to study the company's operations and plan its development, said Mr Horace Clarke, Jamaica's transport minister. The government would operate the airline until September 30, and the new owners would take over on October 1, he said. The delay followed the departure from the consortium of Cochrane Investments of Toronto, which was to have taken about a quarter of the consortium's stake. Two local investors, who were to have bought a 5 per cent interest, have also pulled out. Their combined 30 per cent stake has been taken up by Mr Gordon Stewart, a leading hotelier in the Caribbean.</p>

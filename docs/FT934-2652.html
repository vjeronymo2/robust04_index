			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (1): Building on success not an easy task - While the development of Telford has attracted overseas investment and brought new high-tech industries into the county, the worry is that the pace of indigenous growth is too slow to create enough jobs for an expanding population Mitac, the Taiwanese computer company, will today open its Pounds 3.8m new plant in Telford. At the same time, the US group, Augat, which already makes telecommunications equipment in the town, will announce a factory expansion  -so that it can make automotive components - and the establishment locally of its European headquarters. Telford would perhaps have preferred larger investments than these with which to celebrate the anniversary of its creation 25 years ago as one of Britain's new towns, with a brief to provide new homes and jobs for overspill population from the industrial West Midlands. Modern factories and office blocks stand as testimony to its achievements but recession at home and overseas has slowed the inward movement of companies. Since 1968, more than 130 companies from 18 different countries have settled in Telford. Most came from elsewhere in the West Midlands but US groups were also among the early arrivals, and in the 1980s the pace of Japanese investment quickened. About 35 per cent of all Japanese companies investing in the UK have come to Telford, including NEC, Ricoh, Maxell, and Epson. The hope now is that Telford will draw companies from the growing economies of the Pacific Rim. Telford's attractiveness owes much to the availability of land, the ease of movement around the area, and the local workforce's willingness to adapt. It has been able to meet the needs of high-tech industries requiring open space, in a way which the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation cannot. But the town has not escaped the effects of recession and, as the UK economy tentatively resumes growth, the immediate prospects for Telford and Shropshire are mixed. Expansion in the short term is likely to depend more on indigenous growth than on injections of capital from outside the region, yet the pace of such growth seems certain to be slower than needed to make an impact on unemployment, or to cope with the demands of an increasing population. Employment growth has recently been weak. The latest West Midlands business survey carried out by Wolverhampton Business School concluded that growth had taken place everywhere in the West Midlands except Shropshire. However, the same report showed that the proportion of companies in the county reporting increased sales was the highest in the region. 'You would not expect everything to be smooth coming out of recession,' Professor David Walker, head of the centre for business research at Wolverhampton University, argues. 'Until now, Shropshire has fared reasonably well. It does not have heavy industry winding down. It has shown growth on the level of Coventry, but it is not so dependent on the motor industry.' Indeed, heavy industry wound down decades ago, leaving a legacy of disused mine shafts and derelict land. Clearance of that land as part of the development of Telford made it possible to attract a new generation of light, high technology industries and confirmed Telford's position as the industrial centre of the county. It has been a costly process. About Pounds 1bn of public funding has gone to Telford, drawing in a further Pounds 800m in private sector investment but the town must now fend for itself without subsidy. The main incentives which Telford was once able to offer potential investors have been removed: its intermediate status as an assisted area disappeared this year, its enterprise zone with the associated capital allowances and rate rebates is not only expiring, but is nearly full. The development corporation which guided Telford's development has been wound up. 'It was an engine fuelled by vast sums of money. Taking it away leaves a hole,' says Stephen Jury, chief executive of the Shropshire Training and Enterprise Council. Responsibility for promoting the area has passed to the Telford Development Agency, established by the Commission for New Towns, Wrekin district council, the local authority for the area, and Shropshire county council. It is continuing to target existing sources of inward investment and new potential investors. A scheme designed to appeal to internationally mobile executives and their companies is 'Sky Park'. The plan, currently with the Environment Secretary, envisages a development of 63 homes with hangars at the bottom of each garden linked to a central runway which executives could use to commute to business destinations. More generally, however, the town must now rely on its basic advantages to attract newcomers: the availability of greenfield sites and labour, and easy access to new office accommodation. At county level, too, concern is focused on establishing factory space and communications for new corporate residents. 'Once the infrastructure is there, people will come,' says Bruce Crawcour, economic development officer at the county council. The challenge of providing enough jobs for a growing population is, however, a big one. A study carried out by Warwick University for the Tec predicts population growth in the county of 34,200 during the decade to 2001. 'A substantial number of jobs will have to be created. It is difficult to see how this can be achieved without inward investment,' warns Mr Jury. If employment growth does not resume, according to the Warwick study, 'the projected pattern of population change implies that the Tec area will contain substantial numbers of unemployed people aged over 35 by 2001, (particularly in) areas such as Telford which have attracted migrants who will be in this age group by 2001.' Telford can be expected to grow, but the greater number of jobs will not be in manufacturing, where higher productivity is leading to less rather than more employment, but in the services sector. Thus, the growth of tourism and leisure, allied to the expansion of the retail sector, is vital. So far, in the county as a whole adjustment to a slowly rising population and the recession has been relatively smooth. Unemployment rates have generally been below the national average. The highest rates of unemployment have been in The Wrekin, and in Oswestry, both dependent on manufacturing. Both have pockets of structural unemployment, with rates at about 20 per cent. Indeed, concern in Telford about deprivation was such that the Wrekin Council made a bid - unsuccessfully - for City Challenge funding from the government. Some farms in the hill areas have been running at a loss and as wealth has diminished, services have been run down and some communities have found themselves locked into a spiral of decline. 'The most important thing for strengthening the rural economy is to have a first class telecommunications network. This is the way of removing rural inaccessibility,' says Mr Crawcour. The search, therefore, is for economic diversification, and, if it could be achieved, stronger local control over important economic decisions affecting the county. In a county where companies employing more than 200 workers make up just 1 per cent of all companies, Telford is the centre for the larger manufacturing groups, and from the New Town's earliest days the growing diversity of their ownership has been a source of strength and of innovation in product development. But, it is also a source of weakness in that local managers often have only immediate operational control. The decision to move the work of Venture Pressings to Halewood was taken, for example at Ford headquarters, and not in Telford where the factory is based. Mingled with the satisfaction that companies have set up operations in Shropshire is the fear of instability that comes from being largely a branch economy as far as bigger companies are concerned. 'We suffer from the lack of large companies owned and managed in the county,' Mr Crawcour says. To create a stronger economic infrastructure for growth in the south and west of Shropshire, the county council is applying to the European Commission for Pounds 20m of funds. It is a modest sum compared with that which helped to create - in the development of Telford - a focal point for growth in the Midlands. The hope, however is that it will generate conditions in which further growth can take place.</p>

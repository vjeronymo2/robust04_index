			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Katsman: "The Banks Have Tried to </F> Influence the Municipal Council at the Last Minute"]    [Text] The squabble around the decision of the Moscow  municipal council to introduce a duty on exchange currency  operations reached a culmination by the date of its proposed  coming into force--1 March. Yesterday the managers of 108  leading Russian banks which are shareholders and members of the  Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange signed an open letter to the  mayor of Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov. In this appeal the bankers have  again pointed out the negative consequences of the duty's  introduction.    Almost a month has passed since the decision to introduce a  duty on foreign currency operations was reached. During this  time the criticisms addressed to the Moscow municipal council  have become louder and louder. The leadership of the exchange  itself spoke out repeatedly with verbal statements which  foretold all but the crash of the Exchange. Yuriy Luzhkov also  received a diplomatically irate letter from the chairman of the  Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. The appearance of the bankers'  letter to the mayor on the eve of the municipal council's decree  entering into force has been the culmination of events.    The gist of the letter comes down to four basic points.  First: the lion's share of the country's exchange currency  turnover goes through the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange  and the introduction of a duty means the imposition of an  additional tax on Russian importers and exporters. The former  will be forced in this case to shift their additional costs to  the consumers and a stimulus to conduct the obligatory sale of  foreign currency earnings on other Russian exchanges will appear  for the latter. This will appreciably reduce the Exchange's  turnover. Second: it is precisely on the Moscow exchange that  the Central Bank conducts operations to regulate the exchange  rate of the national currency. With a reduction in the  operations of the Moscow exchange it can lose the role of the  "exchange rate forming" (kursoobrazuyushchiy) center of Russia.  Third: the introduction of an additional duty worsens the  already far from favorable tax climate in the capital and Moscow  can altogether lose the status of the financial center of Russia.    And, finally, fourth. The bankers think that the financial  problems of Moscow will not be solved by the introduction of  additional duties and that the use of more civilized methods,  for example the issuance of municipal bonds (similar to the GKO  [not further identified]) is far more effective for increasing  the revenues of the city's budget.    I didn't succeed in getting commentaries on the bank  managers' letter from officials of the Moscow municipal council.  They alluded to the fact that this document had not yet been  officially received. However, it became obvious from the  conversation with the bureaucrats that they are troubled not so  much by the letter as by the problems of implementing the  municipal council's decision. Considering the strong opposition  to this decision on the part of the banks and the exchange  itself and also that the mechanism for levying this tax has so  far not been developed (in particular, even the payers of the  duty have not been determined), one can infer that the decision  of the capital's authorities will not enter into force in its  original version in the near future and, most likely, will be  transformed.  <H3>  From the letter of the Russian Banks to the Mayor of Moscow,  Luzhkov, Yu. M. </H3>   In the name of the leading Russian banks which are  shareholders and members of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency  Exchange, we would like to express to you our concern in  connection with the decision recently adopted by the Moscow  municipal Duma to introduce, as of 1 March 1994, a duty on  transactions involving the buying and selling of foreign  currency completed on the exchanges of the city of Moscow...    Being one of six Russian currency exchanges, the Moscow  Inter-Bank Currency Exchange has concentrated more than 80  percent of the country's currency exchange turnover. Some $12.6  billion were sold last year at the auctions of the Moscow  Inter-Bank Currency Exchange, which constituted approximately a  third of Russian export currency earnings. Introduction of the  new duty means that most Russian exporters will be subject to  the additional tax..., which will stimulate their urge to  conduct the obligatory sale... on regional currency exchanges.  Importers also will suffer, since their expenditures for  acquiring foreign currency on the Moscow exchange market will be  significantly increased. It is natural that they will shift  these costs to the consumers, having included them in the prices  for imported goods...    It needs to be noted... that the Central Bank carries out  currency interventions in support of the exchange rate of the  national Russian currency most actively precisely on the Moscow  Inter-Bank Currency Exchange and establishes the official ruble  exchange rate... on the basis of the results of its exchange  sessions. In the event that the decision adopted by the Duma is  implemented... the Central Bank will be compelled to carry out  policy regarding the regulation of the exchange rate on another  currency exchange. The volumes of operations on the Moscow  Inter-Bank Currency Exchange will drastically decline and it...  will lose the role of the exchange rate forming center of  Russia...    With the introduction of the duty the banks' costs with  respect to exchange currency operations will double  approximately, which will force the leading Russian banks to  leave the Moscow market and to begin more active work in the  regional centers, primarily in Saint Petersburg... From the  curtailing of exchange currency operations in Moscow alone the  municipal treasury can lose revenues received in the form of the  35-percent tax on the profit of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency  Exchange, and in the process not receive the anticipated  revenues from the duty being introduced.    According to its principles the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency  Exchange is a non-commercial organization. Last year the bank's  shareholders... directed the basic portion of the profit to the  acquisition of modern technologies... for the further  development of the Russian financial market, mainly the state  securities market. At the present time, on the order of 100  billion rubles is received into the state treasury every month  from the floating of bond loans. Such an approach is a far more  effective method of replenishing the municipal budget as  compared to the introduction of a duty on currency operations  (the receipts from which will shrink drastically together with  the fall in the volume of exchange auctions)... The preparation  of the Government of Moscow for the issuance of a municipal bond  loan could become the model of a civilized approach to the  financing of the municipal budget and the city's commercial  banks are ready to assist the Government of Moscow in organizing  the issuance and circulation of municipal bonds using the  technical base of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange.    We apply to You with a proposal about a joint search for  well-considered and professionally grounded approaches... which  can ensure not a reduction but an increase in the role of Moscow  as the most important and most dynamically developing financial  center of Russia.</p>

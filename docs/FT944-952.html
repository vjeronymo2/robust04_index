			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Halifax move hits insurers An announcement that the UK's largest building society, Halifax, would be cutting its household insurance premiums hit its main underwriter Sun Alliance and knocked the whole sector as the market appreciated that a fat earner was coming to an end. Building societies have been able to charge high rates for their household cover, which is usually provided at the same time as the mortgage. However, increasing competition from outside - particularly the arrival of Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS) subsidiary, and reorganisation within the industry - has meant that margins are under pressure. Sun Alliance takes around 70 per cent of the Halifax household cover, and some analysts estimate that the building society provides around 4 per cent of the company's premium income. SA fell 13 to 300p. Some analysts argued that the news was an own goal for Sun Alliance, which had initiated the move. They felt that the group was attempting to show it was the most competitive in order to maintain its grip on the business ahead of the Halifax merger with the Leeds Building Society. General Accident, which is the second underwriter for the Halifax, fell 11 to 519p, while Royal Insurance, the main underwriter for the Leeds, shed 9 to 279p. The Leeds and Halifax received merger clearance from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday. RBoS declined 8 to 407p. Property stocks moved sharply ahead as the sector reacted to a press report suggesting that the Kuwaiti government had been offered Pounds 1.5bn by an investment consortium for its St Martins Property group. St Martins owns some of London's most valuable properties. Hammerson climbed 16 to 343p, while British Land gained 16 at 376p, with Goldman Sachs reported to have been a particularly keen bidder for the stock for most of the session. Land Securities added a more modest 2 at 588p. Volume for most property stocks remained light and dealers said the day's advance may have been overdone. One analyst commented: 'There is relief in some quarters that someone is willing to put money into the property sector, but today's moves are clearly overdone.' Elsewhere in the sector, Stanhope improved 2 to 7p on hopes that the group's bankers will announce a financial rescue plan today. The market continues to believe that British Land will bid for Stanhope. Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo led the sector higher as the market absorbed news that the patent for Zantac, its key anti-ulcer treatment, was being extended. Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court argued that the extra 19 months grace gave time for Glaxo's new key products - particularly its hepatitis B and influenza treatments - to kick in. The news has added to the sector enthusiasm drifting in from the US and helped to harden the bid premiums that have attached to some components. It ensured that Glaxo jumped 22 1/2 to 685p, the Footsie's biggest percentage rise, on turnover of 14m shares. Wellcome was lifted 10 to 706p, SmithKline Beecham 8 1/2 to 472 1/2 p and Zeneca 12 to a record 899p. Bid speculation generated buying of the regional electricity companies. The latest talk saw South Western move to the top of the list of bid candidates. No particular company was named as the most likely suitor, but one market watcher suggested it was unlikely to be another electricity company. The shares rose 10 to 867p. Northern, already under siege from conglomerate Trafalgar House which last week announced a Pounds 1.2bn bid, gave up 2 to 1000p as dealers decided that the planned takeover was likely to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There were strong hints late in the day that Swiss Bank, acting for Trafalgar, would launch a market raid on Northern today to buy up to 10 per cent of Northern's shares. Trafalgar hardened a penny to 75p. However, James Capel urged investors to sell, saying: 'A profits recovery from the group's existing activities is already well discounted at the current share price.' Profit-taking left London Electricity 15 down at 747p. Among water stocks, the bid talk settled on Welsh Water, where the shares moved 15 ahead to 638p. Food and drinks giant Allied Domecq slipped 10 1/2 to 553 1/2 p in response to a 15 per cent devaluation of the Peso. Allied earns around 6 per cent of total trading profits from Mexico. Greenalls Group relinquished 8 at 434p, with traders switching from the ordinary shares and into the convertible stock. Invesco was the most heavily traded stock in London after Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) sold most of its 24.75m shares in the company. The placing was carried out by Lehman Brothers. The shares eased a penny to 163p. Telegraph jumped 33 to 390p as Hollinger, the parent group, said it intended to buy back 7m shares at 450p a share. Specialty chemicals group Hickson International plunged after the group warned that profits would be hit because of the loss of a soap powder contract for next year. The shares closed 12 lower at 114p. Cable television group TeleWest Communications wilted 3 to 176 1/2 p. Recently floated at 182p, they have been hit by flow-back from the US tranche of the issue. Mobile phones group Vodafone rose 4 1/2 to 211p ahead of subscriber figures for the key Christmas quarter. Hoare Govett estimates 20 per cent growth over the September quarter. Vickers declined for the second day running in spite of the way most analysts found clear favour with the engines collaboration deal between the group's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary and BMW, of Germany. The shares softened 2 1/2 to 176p. A reduce note from NatWest which set a target price of 134p helped to clip British Steel, but after a steady two-way business the shares ended unchanged at 157p on 4.4m turnover. Alfred McAlpine and aggregates group Bardon stood out among construction shares. McAlpine advanced 8 to 171p while Bardon, heavily dealt in turnover of 10m, was a penny better at 31p. Several agency crosses at 30 1/2 p accounted for the bulk of the Bardon trading as the shares came in for a buy recommendation from UBS. Textiles group Coats Viyella ng any obvious cheer to a sector under pressure from raw material prices and soft sales. Other statistics, Page 33</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: OECD highlights risk to corporate issuers CORPORATE borrowers could be crowded out of the international and foreign bond markets by the heavy borrowing requirements of public sector entities, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warns in its latest report on financial market trends. However, even if the financing demands of the public sector remain heavy for a prolonged period, favourable market conditions may induce large corporate borrowers to lock in borrowing terms in those markets that are perceived to be near the bottom of the interest rate cycle. 'Even if this strategy may imply the acceptance of somewhat larger spreads relative to treasuries, its pursuit may prove profitable in a longer-term perspective,' the Paris-based OECD says. It adds that all available indicators support the view that the size of capital demand for 1993 will be much larger than in recent years. According to the OECD, offerings by governments in the international and foreign bond markets rose to Dollars 64bn in 1992 from Dollars 43bn one year earlier, and accounted for 19 per cent of overall new issues of Dollars 334bn last year. This compared with a share of 14 per cent and 11 per cent in 1991 and 1990 respectively.</p>

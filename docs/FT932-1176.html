			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (5): So far the omens are not ideal / Review of the privatisation programme If a new French government were to choose an ideal moment to sell off a score of France's biggest public sector companies, this would certainly not be that moment. A sluggish stock market, an uncertain economic outlook and a stream of gloomy company results do not add up to the ideal climate for share issues. Yet within the next few months Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government will embark on one of the most sweeping privatisation programmes that Europe has ever seen. The privatisations - which could involve the sale of up to 21 state-controlled companies including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris in banking, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, Elf-Aquitaine in oil, Pechiney in packaging and the Air France airline - are scheduled to start from September. The Balladur administration now faces the challenge of implementing its radical privatisation proposals despite the unreceptive state of the French economy and the Paris stock market. It must then get to grips with the longer term task of assessing how the sales will affect the relationship between the state and industry in France, which still owns, after Italy, Europe's second largest public sector. To some extent the present programme marks a continuation of the policy pursued by the last conservative French government, the Chirac administration, between 1986 and 1988. The right then raised FFr120bn by selling off 29 companies - including the Societe Generale bank, Alcatel Alsthom, the electronics concern, and the Havas media group - until the stock market crash in October 1987 brought its issues to an abrupt halt. The new list of privatisation candidates includes the 12 companies originally slated for sale in 1986, and 10 new candidates, most of which - notably the Renault motor company, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern - had previously been regarded as unsellable, whether on financial or strategic grounds. The Balladur government's zest for asset sales is partly the product of ideology. Both the RPR and UDF, the two centre-right parties that make up the current coalition, are politically committed to the concept of reducing the role of the state in industry. Privatisation forms an important part of the new laissez faire approach to industrial policy championed by Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister. He recently warned that the new administration would be far stingier about subsidising ailing state concerns than its predecessors, and much more welcoming towards the prospect of foreign investors taking stakes in the French public sector. However, the government is also motivated by financial considerations. The inflow of cash from privatisation sales will be absolutely essential if it is to succeed in its plans to restrain public borrowing (the budget deficit is expected to reach FFr317bn this year) and to invest in economic regeneration. The prime minister has already announced proposals for a FFr40bn 'Balladur bond' - he hopes to raise capital for public works and housing programmes this summer by issuing special bonds which will convert into shares in newly privatised companies. The critical question is whether the stock market will be able to absorb the proposed privatisations. The old socialist government was forced repeatedly to postpone plans for its smaller partial privatisations because of the sluggish state of the market. It is instructive that Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new monetarist economy minister, has reserved the right to scale down the new issues, by selling off small tranches of shares, if the market is too weak to take full-scale sales. So far the omens are far from encouraging. The Paris stock market was almost static last year and has shown no sign of improvement in 1993. However, the market traditionally rallies in the fourth quarter, which means that if it follows its usual seasonal pattern, it should be starting to pick up in time for the first round of sales in September. James Capel in Paris expects the CAC 40 Index to reach about 2,200 by the end of this year. Mr Alphandery also has plans to encourage individual investors to participate in the sales, through tax breaks and phased-payment schemes which will also be open to employee share-owners. Moreover, the recent reductions in French interest rates should help the government's efforts to persuade the public to withdraw their savings from SICAV money market funds and to reinvest them in equities. Finally Mr Alphandery is counting on a high level of interest from international investors. He has abolished the old 'ceiling' rule under which foreigners could not own more than 20 per cent of former state companies. He has also invited foreigners to become noyaux durs, the 'hard core' investors encouraged to take long term stakes in newly privatised French companies to smooth transition to the private sector. But the strong franc might deter some international investors, particularly those in weaker currency countries such as the UK. The new government's fondness for noyaux durs and 'golden shares' (that enable the state to block indefinitely the takeover of strategic concerns) could also dampen international interest, particularly among US and UK investors who tend to dismiss such measures as protectionist and anachronistic. The other serious impediment to the government's plans is the fragile state of some of the privatisation candidates. The French economy came under strain last year; this year it has slipped into recession. A number of companies on the Alphandery list are simply not suitable for sale, at least not for a reasonable price in the short term. Bull made a loss last year, as did Air France. Mr Longuet has already warned that both groups face severe financial difficulties this year. Credit Lyonnais fell into the red. Union des Assurances de Paris and GAN Group, the insurers, suffered sharp falls in profits. Renault is now bracing itself for a bruising year in the intensely competitive motor market. Some of these groups may be sellable towards the end of the present government, if the economy improved, but others will probably be postponed for several years. The consensus among analysts is that the government will begin with the more robust candidates. Elf, Rhone-Poulenc and Pechiney are the prime industrial targets. Banque Nationale de Paris and Assurances Generales de France are the favourites in finance, even though both saw profits decline last year. These issues should start to come on stream in the autumn, but the first serious test of the stock market's appetite for government asset sales is this month's partial privatisation of Credit Local de France, the banking group which specialises in local authority loans, in the sale of a 30 per cent stake for FFr4bn to FFr5bn. Credit Local is a small issue which, given that the legislation was already in place, does not really belong to the mainstream privatisation programme. But the response to the sale could be critical in influencing the timing and scale of the larger issues. It will also provide a useful slug of shares for Mr Balladur's bonds.  ---------------------------------------------------       COMPANIES ON THE 1986 PRIVATISATION LIST  --------------------------------------------------- Bull Thomson Pechiney Rhone-Poulenc Elf-Aquitaine Assurances Generales de France GAN Group Union des Assurances de Paris Credit Lyonnais Banque Nationale de Paris Banque Hervet Societe Marseillaise de Credit  --------------------------------------------------- 1993 additions to 1986 list:  --------------------------------------------------- Aerospatiale Air France Caisse Centrale de Reassurance Renault SEITA Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Assurances SNECMA Usinor-Sacilor Compagnie Generale Maritime Renault  --------------------------------------------------- Source: Economy Ministry  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

The official, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, arrived here  Wednesday [2 February] on the eve of the summit, highlighting  the importance of military issues in the meeting between the two  heads of state, independent Georgian sources said.    The defence minister said Russia would be willing to keep  troops in Georgia, where they have been instrumental in putting  down an insurgency against Shevardnadze, as long as three bases  are set up for them after an interim agreement expires in 1995.    Russia is also planning to station forces at two other bases  in the troubled Caucasus region -- Georgia, Armenia and  Azerbaijan -- where it currently has 23,000 men under arms.    Moscow has said it plans to remain involved in the security  of many of the former Soviet states and will station troops in  the area that it now calls "the near-abroad."    But while the talks in Tbilisi will focus on bilateral  relations, the bloody Abkhaz rebellion in western Georgia is  likely to preoccupy both sides.    Yeltsin bodyguards have warned they fear possible incidents  sparked by anger in Georgia over perceived Russian support for  the Abkhaz separatists who wrested control of the Black Sea  region from Tbilisi in September.    The summit, which comes after two years of frosty relations,  could reverse perceived alliances with the Abkhaz fearing Russia  is about to offer a military alliance to Georgia, at the expense  of their separatist republic.    Already, the Abkhaz government leader, Sokrat Dzhindzholia,  has protested at the proposed signing in Tbilisi on Thursday of  a "friendship and cooperation" treaty between Russia and  Georgia, which he claims would "open the Russian arsenal to  Tbilisi." [passage omitted]    More than 100 Russian officials have arrived in Tbilisi  ahead  of the summit, notably to ensure Yeltsin's safety.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin, Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Washington June 23 TASS -- The World Bank will  provide Russia four credits totalling 820 million U.S. dollars.  This is the main outcome of the talks held between Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and World Bank President  Lewis Preston on Wednesday evening. The agreements on providing  these credits were signed by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr  Shokhin and World Bank Vice-President Wilfried Thalwitz.    Two of these credits are meant for assisting the development  of Russia's agriculture sector. These are credits to support  reforms in agriculture (240 million dollars) and to support land  reform (80 million dollars). The third credit will be provided  by the bank for restoring roads (300 million dollars), and the  fourth for the development of financial institutions (200  million dollars).    After the signing ceremony of the agreements, Viktor  Chernomyrdin said that Russia plans to create a special federal  organization which will work with international financial  institutions. "We requested the World Bank to put pressure on  countries who are Russia's debtors," he said. "Finally, one  more important result of the talks was that the World Bank  president will pay a visit to Moscow," the Russian prime  minister said.</p>

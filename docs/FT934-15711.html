			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: What happened after Manderley - JDF Jones finds Susan Hill has made a good job of following up Du Maurier's best-seller MRS DE WINTER by Susan Hill Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 12.99, 374 pages TRY THIS for a plot summary: 'A young woman, orphaned, poor, shy, plain, meets a mysterious and charming man - rich, strangely tormented, old enough to be her father - and falls in love with him. To her astonishment, he wants to marry her and install her as the mistress of his great house. But she discovers that he was married before and that the marriage has been a nightmare, yet he is trapped by it and haunted by the monstrous first wife. Under this challenge the girl grows up - becomes a woman, his equal, his mate - and then the wife is avenged in a fire and the house is burned to the ground. The consequence is that the couple can truly be together at last . . . ' That, of course, is the story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece of 1847. It is also the story of Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier's best-seller of 1938. The parallels between the two novels have always been obvious, as have the differences in profundity, inspiration, genius. Still, Rebecca is Du Maurier's best book, the ultra middle-brow, middle-class English popular novel of this century, a wonderfully good read. It still sells, in millions. How clever of Mr Sinclair-Stevenson to commission Rebecca II in order to tell us what happened to the un-named narrator and her husband, Maxim de Winter, when they fled from their gutted mansion, the unforgettable Manderley, to take up exile somewhere Abroad. In Mrs de Winter Susan Hill has made a good stab at a fascinating assignment. She knows that she has to bring the De Winters home, so she opts for the funeral of Maxim's jolly sister Beatrice; she has to revive the evil housekeeper Mrs Danvers, the villainous Jack Flavell, the decent farm manager Frank Crawley, even the magistrate Colonel Julyan and the awful Mrs van Hopper. But her best achievement is that she evidently understands that she has to tackle the fundamental evasion of the original tale - that, when all is told and done, Maxim murdered Rebecca: that is why they are located in the prison of lifelong exile. Step aside from the persuasions of Daphne du Maurier's beguiling style and you begin to have your doubts about the chap. Why is he so weak? Fair enough, Rebecca is a prize bitch, but he could have divorced her, or thrown her out, or left her even for the loss of the house, he does not have to kill her. (Mr Rochester, you recall, specifically rejected using 'cruelty' on his Creole lunatic wife and instead considered killing himself]) On the journey back to England for the first time in ten years, Ms Hill has her (still un-named) narrator suffer a long-delayed insight into her husband: 'That man is a murderer. He shot Rebecca. That is the man who killed his wife.' From that moment on the plot is not really any better or more complex than most of us could embroider after a good supper, but it will do. After the funeral the De Winters are tempted to stay on in England; she sets Manderley behind her and discovers a beautiful house in the Cotswolds, which Maxim eventually buys for her. But they are both still haunted by the dead Rebecca. The no-longer-so-young wife wants a baby. In a deeply implausible plot device she bumps into Jack Flavell ('he was repellent, much older, seedy. And mad, I thought . . .'); equally absurd is the discovery that Mrs Danvers is living nearby. Mrs Danvers, the great witch of modern popular fiction, still terrifies the narrator; she knows that her beloved Rebecca was murdered and she has been biding her time, waiting to take her revenge. So far, so good, however thin, but because the story-line is so simple the narrative has to be heavily padded, most obviously in a long digression in Italy. Ms Hill is not just a competent novelist but is also a country writer of true distinction (her The Magic Apple Tree is a delightful book), and she sensibly uses her skills to flood the story with even more description of English landscape than Du Maurier would have risked. But shekeeps her pastiche short of parody. She provides various references back to the original but this time the images are often reversed. There is another big party to provide a dramatic crisis, but it is an informal, happy affair in the garden; the wife visits a doctor in London, to discuss conception, not cancer; she serves afternoon tea, clumsily, to the chauffeur-driven Mrs Danvers; she is tempted again to jump to her death. But there is shown to be a maturing in her character and a development of symbol: she cannot have a child, for example, because the old life is still too potent. One achievement of this exercise, paradoxically, is to remind us of the weaknesses in the original: the sentimentalisation of Maxim de Winter, for instance; the unexplained mystery of their long exile; the irritating wimpishness of the narrator; the under characterisation of Maxim and of his two marriages. This need not matter in a routine, popular novel except that this one demands comparison with Brontes model. Consider only, in contrast, the spunkiness of Jane, the vitality of Mr Rochester (who has to go through repentance, renewal, transformation - and literal blinding - before he is rescued by Jane's offering of a glass of water and they can achieve their true and lasting marriage). My compliment to Susan Hill is that I believe that she understands this and has tried to correct the imbalance in the original. She wants to add the missing moral dimension.</p>

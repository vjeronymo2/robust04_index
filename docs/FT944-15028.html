			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Clash of two metals - How the world's steel industry is fighting back against aluminium and other rivals Tucked away in a luxury Colorado Springs hotel in October, some 350 executives from the world's big steelmakers had the chance to view some interesting slides brought along by colleague Jeff Edington. These were no holiday snaps. Edington, British Steel's executive director for technology, was showing delegates at the annual International Iron and Steel Institute conference the wings from a Hawker Harrier jumpjet fighter and the tailfin of an Airbus 330. In both cases, carbon fibre (a composite material challenging both steel and aluminium) had replaced aluminium as the material used. Edington's point was that steel, the world's most versatile structural material, has no automatic right to its position in the market place. 'Our product is a low cost, highly sophisticated material with a lot of development potential left in it. The market is ours to lose. If we lose it, we can only blame ourselves for lack of technical and business creativity and innovation,' he says. The upbeat outlook of Edington and other steel industry executives about the future of their product might seem to be misplaced. The public perception of steel is of an industry in decline, twisted by subsidies, wracked by controversy over job cuts, and tarnished with an old-fashioned image. Some in the industry admit they have let producers of rival materials, notably aluminium, gain too much ground in recent years, and may have been distracted by their own industrial problems from promoting their products more effectively, and developing new markets. Now, with steel demand rising, they have a chance to prove the public perception of the industry wrong. Lenhard Holschuh, the institute's secretary general, predicts world consumption of steel will rise by 2.3 per cent and 3.4 per cent this year and next, and by an average 2.8 per cent a year to reach an unprecedented 750m tonnes in 2000. Some observers believe this may be too optimistic, although there is general agreement that much of the increased demand will come from developing countries. Nearly half of the steel consumed in 2000 will be used in Asia, says Holschuh. Apart from the geographical factors, achieving these growth predictions will depend critically on the success of some of the product development and marketing initiatives, involving both steelmakers and users, currently under way. The initiatives highlighted at Colorado Springs show how steel-makers are working to defend their patch in the three key industrial battlegrounds: In the automotive sector, an international industry consortium of about 30 steel producers is designing an ultra-lightweight steel car body. In packaging, European steel-makers are co-operating to develop an all-steel beverage can made from a special, lightweight high-strength steel (see accompanying article). In construction, some steelmakers are trying with considerable success to convince architects to use steel frames rather than concrete in office and industrial buildings. Others are battling with steel-producing rivals to supply the reinforcing bar or welded mesh on which the concrete depends. In the US, one of the biggest recent success stories for steel-makers has come in the residential housing market, says John Ewing, US Steel's managing director for business development. In 1991 just a few hundred steel-framed homes were built in North America. But a task force formed by the American Iron and Steel Institute identified an opportunity because of problems with materials, such as the rising cost and falling quality of lumber, and environmental issues raised by forestry and scrap. Steel, in contrast, can boast that it is fully recyclable. Last year, about 13,000 new homes in North America used all-steel frames, and another 80,000 used steel in interior walls, so steel's penetration is still tiny compared with the 1.3m housing starts in the US alone last year. Ewing's target is for 25 per cent of all new homes to use steel framing in 1997 and 6 per cent to use steel roofing. The lesson is that to achieve business success the steel industry does not always have to develop new grades of steel - such as the modern types of steel wire that allow suspension bridge spans now to be increased to nearly 2km, or the many new grades of coated steels used in car bodies. Edington believes a 'system solution' will become increasingly important. Steelmakers must think of their products as part of an engineered system consisting of various materials that together give customers value, he says. The system would have to cope with recycling. Two other important driving forces for the steel industry, he says, are environmental pollution arising from using the end-product, most notably in the car industry, and process automation aimed at reducing costs and improving the quality of the final product. In can-making, for example, production rates are increasing and decoration in up to six colours is added at 1,800 cans a minute, so dimensional accuracy and surface finish are paramount. In many markets, says Edington, accuracy and surface quality will have to continue to be improved. Outside the big three industrial markets, steel has recently had mixed fortunes. In white goods, the development of pre-painted and laminated steels, and repeated quality improvements are hailed by steelmakers as factors enabling them to win the battle with materials such as plastics. The challenge for the steel industry will be to cope with customers' demands for increasingly diversified and functionally sophisticated steel, but still generate a profit, says Minoru Tanaka, executive vice-president at Nippon Steel. This has led the Japanese steel industry to reassess its approach to quality and performance standards, producing reasonably-priced products that perform adequately rather than ex-ceed the minimum required quality. In railway rolling stock, aluminium has become the standard material for mainline carriages such as Germany's ICE high-speed trains. 'It's lighter, and the image of the material seems to be more modern,' says Rolf Schraut, head of research and development at Duewag, the Siemens rolling-stock subsidiary. However, stainless steel producers are fighting back. One, Germany's Krupp Nirosta, has developed a stainless steel for the side wall of a high-speed train, working in co-operation with Duewag and Deutsche Bahn. It says it has the same rigidity and weight as a wall made of aluminium.  -----------------------------------------------------             THE INDUSTRIES' MAIN BUYERS  ----------------------------------------------------- Steel                       JAPAN      UK        US  -----------------------------------------------------                            Percent   Percent   Percent  ----------------------------------------------------- Automotive &amp; transport        26       15       24 Cars &amp; containers              3        7        6 Building &amp; construction       47       21       34 Engineering                   14       22       21 Other                         10       35       15  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: European Aluminium Association  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

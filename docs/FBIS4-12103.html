			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- The Islamic Jihad Movement yesterday  criticized the recent Cairo agreement signed between the PLO and  Israel. Noting the continuing daily massacres being perpetrated  against the Palestinian people's sons, it stressed that this  agreement cannot protect even its supporters.    In its monthly statement, distributed yesterday in the Gaza  Strip, Islamic Jihad said that the entry of the Palestinian  police into the Gaza Strip and Jericho is no more than a failed  attempt "to deceive the people."    The statement pointed out that in view of the Gaza-Jericho  accord, the international police and forces will not be able to  provide real protection to the Palestinian people.    The statement criticized the spread of large numbers of  weapons among residents and said that honorable persons should  not use weapons against the people.    The statement called on all political forces to impose on  their cadres rules of ethics in order to confront this problem  so that it would not turn into a muscle-flexing phenomenon and a  means for intimidating and coercing people.    The statement referred to the phenomenon of killing  individuals accused of collaborating with the Israeli security  agencies and said that this issue is now causing great anxiety  among the people and is raising questions and doubt about  whether justice and truth were pursued when those executions  were carried out.    The statement also noted the recent increase in strikes. It  considered strikes to be a means for expressing rejection of the  occupation, which should not turn into a means for proving one's  self and factional muscle-flexing.    The statement called on all Palestinian factions and  political forces to ease the burden of the masses and to refrain  from exhausting them with more competing and repetitious strikes.</p>

Some factory trawlers are likely to participate under any of the alternatives. It appears likely that the number of factory trawlers purchasing permits and participating in the whiting fishery will be considerably less than the number that have participated in the fishery under open access during the past 3 years. The availability of whiting markets for coastal catcher vessels will depend, to some degree, on the number of at-sea processors that offer markets and on the level of operation of shoreside processing plants in 1994. As a result of limited entry and the regulations that allocate the Pacific whiting harvest between the at-sea and shoreside sectors of the industry, whiting markets should support a larger number of catcher vessels in 1994 than at any time during the past 3 years. Whether fishing effort will increase for traditional non-whiting groundfish species is uncertain. It should be noted that much of the capacity represented by permits being purchased by factory trawlers for use in the whiting fishery, if not utilized for that purpose, is available for transfer and use to fish for other groundfish species. Any increase in harvest capacity in the whiting fishery is counterbalanced by decreasing capacity available to harvest other groundfish species. NMFS has no data to indicate whether the potential capacity that leaves the other groundfish sector will be any greater or less than the capacity that leaves the whiting fishery due to lack of markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Twenty-two commenters stated that NMFS, as a matter of policy, should defer to the expertise and judgment of the Council and implement Initial Alternative II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During the development and adoption of Amendment 6 (limited entry) to the Pacific Groundfish FMP, the Council decided to leave the task of developing a measure of harvest capacity and method for combining limited entry permits to NMFS, based on the standard set out in the FMP. NMFS was to develop and implement the system for combining permits in consultation with the Council and with the advice of a marine architect. None of the development documentation or analysis was undertaken by the Council. While the Council has made a recommendation to NMFS for a different method from that proposed by NMFS, it has not presented an analysis or administrative record supporting the recommendation. Although NMFS gives great weight to Council recommendations, they must be supported by an administrative record demonstrating they are based on the best available scientific information and are consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable Federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 15: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that the NMFS preferred approach ignores the goals and objectives of the Pacific groundfish FMP. These commenters believed only Initial Alternative II is consistent with the Council's goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment 6 to the FMP very narrowly defined the objectives for NMFS in developing a permit combination system. Regulations at 50 CFR 663.33(g) require the Regional Director, with advice of marine architects and other qualified individuals, and after consultation with the Council, to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller size endorsements. Amendment 6 bases the system for combining limited entry permits in the Pacific Coast groundfish limited entry fishery on the overall length of the fishing vessel. The standard set by Amendment 6 requires that the harvest capacity represented by the appropriate length endorsement for the combined permit not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being combined. As provided by Amendment 6, the standard applies regardless of the target species being fished or the size of the vessels involved, and is equally applicable to trawl, longline, and fish trap (pot) vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 6 did not authorize NMFS to modify parameters of the system to meet goals and objectives other than ensuring that the harvest capacity of a combined permit does not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being combined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 16: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that NMFS has ignored the recommendations of the marine architect who provided professional advice to the Council's Groundfish Advisory Panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The report of the Groundfish Advisory Subpanel provided at the Council's April 1993 meeting indicated that a marine architect, David Green, President of Jensen Maritime, advised the subpanel that any of the formulas initially proposed by NMFS will reduce fleet size over time, and that length cubed potentially reduced fleet size the most. All of these formulas included flattening the curve for vessels above about 120 ft (36.6 m) in length. Mr. Green stated that the length cubed function matches vessel fishing power relatively well, but the choice is primarily one of economics and social considerations. Although each formula will permanently reduce fleet size, Mr. Green believed none would prevent increased fishing capacity in the form of deeper, ``beamier'' vessels to be built in the future. The Council's Groundfish Advisory Subpanel recommended the 2.5 exponential factor, stating that it better matches the west coast fleet, and recommended that the curve be flattened at about 150 ft (45.7 m) in vessel length instead of the 120 feet shown in the formulas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A letter from Mr. Green elaborated on his prior comments. Although Mr. Green states that exponents of 2.5 or less favor a fishery with increasing catch capability, he also comments that there is a reasonable correlation between hold capacity and length either to the 2.5 or 3.0 exponent, and that this correlation holds up reasonably well to about 150 ft (45.7 m) in length. These remarks tend to confirm that a 2.5 exponent is at least very close to the optimal value to prevent any increase in capacity and that the exponential relationship breaks down for vessels larger than 150 ft (45.7 m). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Green's only comments on the formula proposed for large vessels is that the flattened section favors the processor type vessel as a substitute for smaller catchers and would accelerate transition from today's fleet of individual owners to the corporate fleets of processors. His comments regarding fleet structure may be accurate if the standard for comparison is the structure of the fleet during the 1984&hyph;88 qualifying period for limited entry permits. They may not be as accurate, at least initially, if the standard of comparison is the 1991&hyph;93 fleet, which included as many as 20 large factory trawlers, and fewer than that number purchase permits to enter the fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The make-up of the fishery, however, is not a relevant consideration in the formulation of these regulations. The relevant issue is a reasonable estimate of harvesting capacity. If the purpose of the limited entry program was to freeze the structure of the fleet as it was in 1984&hyph;87, the Council would not have provided for the entry of new and larger vessels. The FMP recognized the need to provide flexibility for the fleet to change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

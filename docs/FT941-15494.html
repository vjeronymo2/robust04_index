			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Campari expects Pounds 7.75m loss Campari International, the leisurewear group, said yesterday that continuing difficult trading conditions meant that initial indications were for a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 7.75m for 1993. The new management team had taken action to reduce costs, strengthen product design and rationalise the supplier base, but these changes were unlikely to significantly improve results until the second half of 1994.</p>

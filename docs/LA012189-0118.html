			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE;  </P> <P> MATER DEI FINISHES OFF SERVITE;  </P> <P> RIGDON LEADS THIRD-QUARTER RUN FOR 79-56 VICTORY  </P> <P> Servite High School started something it couldn't finish against Mater Dei  Friday night.  </P> <P> The Friars kept close to Mater Dei, the second-ranked team in Orange County,  through the first quarter and into the second.  </P> <P> But Mater Dei took control late in the first half, and then Dylan Rigdon scored  17 third-quarter points to lead the Monarchs past Servite, 79-56, in front of  1,500 at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (20-2, 4-0) remained in first place in the Angelus League. Servite  dropped to 11-7, 2-2.  </P> <P> "We didn't have any letdowns," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. "We  struggled a bit early but then we got things going."  </P> <P> Rigdon, a 6-foot 4-inch senior guard, had 31 points to lead all scorers.  </P> <P> Mike Morris, who had 15 points, opened the game for Mater Dei with a 3-pointer.  </P> <P> Chris Johnson, who led the Friars with 15 points, answered with a 15-footer,  prompting the Servite fans to litter the court with streams of toilet paper.  </P> <P> A technical foul was called on Servite. Rigdon made both shots and Mater Dei  was on its way to an early lead.  </P> <P> Servite rallied to get within 2 points twice, late in the first quarter and  early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But Mater Dei took control of the boards in the second quarter and went on a  late run, including a free throw by Rigdon and stolen pass and basket by Dan  O'Neil at the buzzer, for a 37-22 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Rigdon then started his assault with about 6 minutes left, hitting a 10-foot  jump shot. He ended the quarter scoring 5 points within the closing seconds.  </P></p>

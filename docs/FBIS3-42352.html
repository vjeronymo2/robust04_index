			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] The Office of Attorney General convicted over  1,000 terrorists in cases it handled this year, Daniel Espichan  Tumay announced yesterday. The official also appealed to  authorities not to let down their guard facing the subversive  enemy so as to prevent such terrorists from once again sowing  unrest among the people.    Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was  achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and  military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists  had cooperated with the courts.    While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that  positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his  appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest  on their laurels.    "We must understand that terrorism will continue its  onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be  achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work  and while paying respect to human rights," he said. [passage  omitted on human rights]</p>

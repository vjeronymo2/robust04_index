			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dirk van Zyl] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 22 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP]  has predicted a voter turn-out of 80 per cent in the Western  Cape in next week's elections and that, as of Friday, 30 per  cent of voters are still undecided on party preference. The  party's Western Cape premiership candidate Mr Hennie Bester  released the projections, based on his and his team's  campaigning in the province over the past months, at a press  briefing on Friday morning.    They had found that up to 40 per cent of voters could be  affected by intimidation, either on party choice or on whether  to vote, and that parties had not had free access to up to 30  per cent of the electorate. Seventy per cent of voters, they  found, were in a sufficient state of election readiness in terms  of documentation and knowledge of the electoral process. Forty  per cent of the province's voters had a general understanding of  parliamentary democracy and the political system generally, and  the same percentage was sufficiently informed about manifestos,  candidates and culture of political parties. The large number  not sufficiently informed about the latter aspect could lead to  a significant percentage of misplaced votes, Mr Bester said.  Insufficient knowlege about voting procedures and systems could  result in 15 per cent of ballots being spoilt.</p>

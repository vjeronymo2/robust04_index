			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / CyberCouple to tie the knot virtually The bride will be distinctively dressed in a futuristic silver gown, studded with metal and gems. Her groom will cut a dashing figure in Star Trek-style vest and leggings. And, as Monika Liston and Hugh Jo exchange vows today at the world's first 'CyberWedding', both will be wearing matching virtual reality headsets. In reality, the ceremony will take place in San Francisco. In virtual reality, the happy couple will tie the knot in a romantic dream world, brought to life by heavy duty computer equipment. Floating through Atlantis in a chariot drawn by carousel horses, they are to arrive at the gates of a mythical palace. Entering, they will find the minister awaiting them at the altar. When they kiss in virtual reality, hearts, flowers and white doves will circle above their heads. Each will view this fantasy from his or her own perspective, through their 'vision immersion module' headsets. Their guests will watch the same images and a panorama of the enchantment on carefully positioned video screens and a video wall. This is a real wedding, and would have been a really expensive wedding were it not being sponsored by Cybermind - where Ms Liston is an executive assistant - and several high-tech companies whose products were used to create the 'virtual experience'. 'It's going to be a blast,' Ms Liston said as she put the final touches on the wedding arrangements. 'We had planned to elope, but this is the ultimate elopement. Virtual reality lets us get married wherever we want.' Atlantis might not be the choice of every couple, and perhaps the floating hearts and flowers are a bit too Hollywood for some. But if you happen to be in San Francisco and want to get married in St Paul's cathedral or on a tropical island, there are alternatives to hopping on a plane. And if yours is a marriage that must be made in heaven, that too can be arranged. Virtual reality weddings could become all the rage, says Ms Aimee Rosewall, Cybermind's director of sales and marketing and wedding co-ordinator. 'We will be open on Monday and ready to create your fantasies.' Be warned, however, that the technology does impose a few restrictions. The bride and groom, for example, must stay 12 feet apart throughout the 'virtual experience' so that signals do not interfere. It is safe to predict that virtual honeymoons are not going to be a big seller. There is also the little matter of cost. A replay of today's ceremony could be arranged for a moderate fee, Ms Rosewall said. But producing an original virtual wedding in your own fantasy setting would require several weeks of software development work - and might cost Dollars 50,000-Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 32,250-Pounds 64,500). Digital Equipment provided high-performance workstations for the CyberWedding and San Francisco software designers at Visions of Reality, built the virtual reality environment of Atlantis.</p>

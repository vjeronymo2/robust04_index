			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Britain and Ireland signal new deal on Ulster's future THE widest-ranging talks for 70 years on Northern Ireland's political future opened in London yesterday with the UK and Irish governments expressing a willingness to rework the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the UK and Irish prime ministers, sought to give the talks their fullest support with a joint statement offering Unionists, in particular, the prize of a 'more broadly based agreement or structure, if this can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation'. They said 'an opportunity now exists for open, constructive and far-reaching dialogue both on the issues which divide the two main traditions in Ireland and on those which unite them. All of us share a common commitment to the values of constitutional politics and a total rejection of violence as a means of achieving political progress'. Neither man was present at the talks. The UK delegation was headed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and the Irish team by Mr John Wilson, deputy prime minister. The talks, which will resume today, lasted three hours and were held amid tight security at Lancaster House under the independent chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia. They brought all shades of Unionist parties face to face with Irish ministers for the first time since partition in the 1920s. The Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the two Unionist leaders, are anxious for a replacement of the 1985 Agreement, which they believe gives too great a role to Dublin in the affairs of Northern Ireland. They also want an end to Ireland's constitutional claim on the north. The Irish and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party put more emphasis on greater co-operation between Northern Ireland and the south. Dublin argues that if Ireland's constitution is up for negotiation, so too should the UK legislation which led to partition. Irish ministers say their country's constitution has to reflect a strong 'aspiration' to unification. The meeting formed the start of the second 'strand' of a talks process which began in April. Unionists only agreed to the transition following assurances from Sir Patrick that it would be on the basis of a sketchy agreement reached in 'strand one' on devolution in the province. Some Unionist MPs hope that Sir Patrick will legislate for a devolved assembly even if the talks collapse, in spite of an agreement by the participants that 'nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed'.</p>

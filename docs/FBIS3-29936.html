The Algerian paper HEBOLO LIBERE said:    Despite a stockpile of its nuclear weapons in South Korea,  the United States spread a rumor that North Korea intends to  make nuclear weapons, and is trying to internationalize it.    The United States is the first criminal in human history  that  massacred guiltless people by using atomic bombs during the  Pacific War. The nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula does  not come from North Korea but from the U.S. nuclear weapons  deployed in South Korea.    The Indian paper DELHI SAMACHAR said:    The United States, taking South Korea as a bridgehead and  nuclear forward base to gain supremacy in Asia and the world,  shipped a large number of nuclear weapons there. Therefore,  South Korea has been turned into a store house of nuclear  weapons, largest in the world.    The JANA News Agency of Libya said: The United States,  hiding  its nuclear weapons in secret underground store houses of South  Korea, cried for "nuclear development by the North." It is  nothing but a pretext to keep nuclear weapons in South Korea.    The Peruvian paper LA REPUBLICA said that the U.S.  imperialists declared the Korean peninsula the "forefront of the  U.S. strategy" and intends to unleash a nuclear war there.    The Nepalese paper SUNDAY DISPATCH said that in view of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula caused by the U.S. side,  the United States is to blame for this issue and, accordingly,  it is clear that the issue should be solved by means of talks on  the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement.    The solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  depends on the U.S. side, it said.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA VALLEY, CORONA SETTLE FOR TIE  </P> <P> After a half of big plays and another of botched plays, Santa Ana Valley and  Corona high schools fought to a 14-14 tie Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> All of the scoring came in the first half, when Corona took a 14-0 lead  courtesy of a pair of touchdown receptions by Doug McDaniel.  </P> <P> McDaniel's second score came on a 68-yard pass play from quarterback Steve  Bernier with 4 minutes 13 seconds remaining in the half.  </P> <P> On the ensuing kickoff, Santa Ana Valley's James Barclay fumbled, picked up the  ball at the eight-yard line and bolted 92 yards for the Falcons' first score.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley tied the score on a one-yard quarterback sneak by Gary Graves,  following a 46-yard pass to Mike Castleberry.  </P> <P> In the second half, both teams fumbled once inside their opponent's 10-yard  line.  </P> <P> "We had this game, but we made a couple of key mistakes, like that fumble,"  Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said.  </P> <P> Corona Coach Stu Horn echoed Castanon's feelings, adding, "Valley is so  explosive, they can hit you with a big play any time."  </P> <P> Corona could have attempted a 52-yard field goal with five seconds remaining in  the game, but the Panthers went for a touchdown. Castleberry sacked Bernier at  the 40-yard line.  </P> <P> "The reason we didn't go for the field goal was that I didn't want to give  Valley the ball for even one second," Horn said.  </P></p>

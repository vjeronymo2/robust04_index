			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Rise in rates now seen as almost certain - New York November is shaping up to be a cruel month for the US stock market, if the first few days are anything to go by. Last week, the Dow ran up a loss of 123 points, or more than 3 per cent. The fall was prompted primarily by a jump in bond yields to 8.16 per cent, their highest levels since August, 1991, and by renewed concerns about inflation. This week, those two themes - rising bond yields and fears of inflation - are likely to continue to haunt the stock market which, with the third-quarter reporting season now over, no longer has the crutch of encouraging corporate earnings to rely upon. All investors have to look forward to over the coming weeks are higher interest rates. Short-term rates are almost certainly going to go up within the next week and a half because the Federal Reserve appears poised to tighten monetary policy for the sixth time this year. There is near-unanimity among analysts that the move will come on November 15, when the Fed's policy-making open market committee next meets. Recent data have done nothing to dispel the notion that the economy is growing at such a rate that the central bank must tighten the screws soon to ensure inflation does not get out of hand in 1995. The only disagreement among Wall Street's sages is over how big the rate increase will be; 50 basis points (which would take the target on the Fed funds rate up to 5 1/4 per cent) or 100 basis points. A 50bp rise is already priced into both stocks and bonds. If the Fed were to raise rates by a full percentage point, then the markets would probably suffer a nasty, if short, sell-off. As for long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield on the 30-year bond), they continue to test the record highs of recent years. Money continues to flow into stocks, but at some stage the steady climb in bond yields could cause investors to reverse those flows. Recent figures show that money market funds have been attracting a considerable amount of cash as investors move funds out of an increasingly sickly-looking stock market. It may not be long before longer-term bond funds enjoy a similar renaissance. That moment could come soon. Analysts at NatWest Securities point out that when bonds have yielded three times more than stocks, the equity market has run aground. With bonds yielding 8.2 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 about 2.8 per cent, this particular alarm bell could sound at any moment. The only good news this week is that there will be no trading in government bonds on Friday because US banks will be shut for the Veteran's Day holiday, which means the stock market will be able to stop worrying about rising bond yields, if only for a single day.</p>

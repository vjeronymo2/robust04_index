			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: So many could owe so much to so few - Certain marginal seats will determine who leaves the battlefield as victor For the past year the politicians have been exchanging fire from trenches dug at Westminster. Now the fight will move to the electoral battlefields which will decide whether Mr John Major or Mr Neil Kinnock enters Downing Street on April 10. The focus of media coverage may remain on the daily Westminster press conferences, on the set-piece television interviews and on the inevitable 'gaffes' which will be made by leading figures on all sides. But the final result is in the hands of a few hundred thousands voters in London and the south-east, in the north-west, the Midlands and in a few dozen other constituencies dotted around the rest of Britain. By the time we reach polling day, it may be that it is the last-minute preferences of 30,000 or 40,000 people in a couple of dozen constituencies - out of the 33m or so who are expected to vote - which put Mr Major or Mr Kinnock into Number 10. It will be the collective voice of places such as Hornsey and Wood Green, Bolton North West, Birmingham Selly Oak and Southampton Test that counts. The Liberal Democrats will have an impact, even if the party's recent rise in the opinion polls to 16 or 17 per cent still leaves them well short of the 23 per cent that the Liberal/SDP Alliance secured at the last election. A further rise in the third-party vote towards the 1987 figure could help the Conservatives, by splitting the opposition in many seats that would otherwise be vulnerable to Labour. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, expects to profit at Mr Major's expense from the impact of the recession in southern constituencies, where his party starts more often than Labour as the main challenger to the Conservative incumbent. Much of the party's effort will be focused on constituencies in the south-west and Scotland, but it will also be seeking to hold on to its by-election prizes of Eastbourne and Ribble Valley. Realistically, Mr Ashdown's best hope is to match the 19 seats that the Alliance won in 1987. This time that might be enough to give him the balance of power in a hung parliament. Scotland is another election altogether. The result may be critical in mapping out that nation's future within the United Kingdom. The Conservatives won only 10 of the 72 Scottish seats in 1987 and have since lost one of those in a by-election. Their only hope of maintaining or improving on that figure is that the recent rise in support for the Scottish National party draws support from Labour. But shifts in support north of the border are unlikely to be pivotal in deciding who governs at Westminster. The broader arithmetic is straightforward. Taking the results in 1987 as the base, Mr Major starts with a seemingly impregnable majority of 102 seats over all the other parties combined. The Conservatives won 376 seats at the last election, 50 more than the 326 that any party will need to command a majority of one in the House of Commons. To be sure of forming a government, Mr Kinnock has to add another 97 seats to the 229 that Labour won in 1987. If he is less ambitious (and many members of the shadow cabinet doubt whether Labour can secure an overall majority in a single election), he will need an extra 65 to 70 seats to have a credible chance of forming a minority government or an additional 75 to be sure of becoming the largest party. Either way, well over half of Labour's target seats are clustered in three main battlegrounds - London and the south-east, the north-west, and the East and West Midlands. For all his confident predictions, Mr Kinnock has a mountain to climb. To secure an overall majority, he must do better - securing an 8 per cent swing  -than any opposition leader since Mr Clement Attlee defeated Mr Winston Churchill in 1945. If the average swing of 5 to 6 per cent seen in recent opinion polls were replicated on April 9, Mr Kinnock would deny Mr Major his majority, yet still emerge with fewer supporters at Westminster. Labour must do well in places where the prosperous working classes deserted in droves to Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the first half of the 1980s - and have been less persuaded than many others by Mr Kinnock's success in dragging his party towards the political centre ground. The 1987 election was a tale of two nations, with the Tories sweeping to victory in the prosperous south and Labour piling up votes that it did not need in its safest territories in the north. Labour took only one - Oxford East - of the 111 seats in the south-east outside London. There are some things on Labour's side. Rising unemployment and the surge in housing repossessions have been particularly damaging for the Conservatives in London and the south-east. The poll tax has hit hardest in the working-class areas of the north-west which Mrs Thatcher carved out as her own during the 1980s. But the Conservatives have their own cards. Labour's tax plans - in particular the abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions  -most threaten voters in the south. Tory candidates in the south-east will campaign on three themes: tax, tax and tax. In many of the seats that Labour is targeting, the Conservative candidate has had nine years to build a local reputation. Some estimates suggest the 'incumbency' factor could be worth 1,000 votes, enough to deny Mr Kinnock a dozen or more seats he might otherwise win. London will provide the most important test. The capital city is a parable of Labour's decline. Its local parties were a moving force behind the lurch to the left during the late 1970s. They have been the hardest for Mr Kinnock to tame, and Labour has not won a seat from the Conservatives since 1974. Now it needs to grab 20 in a single election. Some, like Battersea, it cannot hope for. But Dulwich, Hampstead and Highgate, Walthamstow, Streatham, the two Lewisham seats, Croydon North West and Hornsey and Wood Green are among those Mr Kinnock must win this time. Outside the capital, he needs victories in Basildon and Thurrock in Essex, in the two Southampton constituencies, in Dr David Owen's former seat at Plymouth Devonport, in Slough and Swindon and in Luton South. The roll call then moves on to a further 20 target seats in the north-west - Bolton North West, Bury South, Wallasey, Pendle and Hyndburn among them. To the west, York, the most marginal seat in the country with a Conservative majority of 147, should fall easily to Mr Kinnock. But he must also win in the Midlands, taking among others Wolverhampton North East, Birmingham Selly Oak, Birmingham Northfield, the two Conservative-held Nottingham seats and Derby North. For Mr Kinnock it is a list that it is as daunting as it is long. It is one he must have learnt by heart since 1983. But Mr Major will know it, too.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The defeat by nearly 10 percentage points and the  loss of five seats has surprised the PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] leaders who were expecting a less resounding  electoral beating. Despite the fact that these were European  elections, the Socialists admit that they have received a  serious warning from the electorate, and that its consequences  for domestic policy are inevitable.    [Correspondent Alicia Montano] Twelve years after taking  power the PSOE is facing its first election defeat on a national  scale. Since 1982 the party has been the one to receive the most  votes and on three occasions has had an absolute majority. Now  it knows that the 12 June results are a serious warning from the  electorate from which they are prepared to draw conclusions.  This is what the party's leaders admitted no sooner than the  first results were known and this position was ratified this  morning by the party's Executive Committee. In its first  analysis, the PSOE leadership admitted that the corruption cases  and the economic crisis have taken part of the PSOE vote to  United Left or abstention. The Socialists trust that once these  two problems have been tackled the hopes of its electorate will  be rekindled. The PSOE believes that this is not the time to  bring forward elections but to support the government and its  stability.    [Begin recording, Cipria Ciscar, PSOE secretary for  organization] The Socialist Party leadership, during its meeting  today, is completely united around the leadership of Secretary  General Felipe Gonzalez, and in its support for the government  that we, the Socialists, are obliged to continue with, maintain,  in fulfillment of the will of the people expressed in the 1993  general elections. [end recording]    [Montano] Some leaders, such as Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra  [prime minister of the Extremadura regional government], said  that the Socialist defeat was as logical as it was painful  because things were done so badly. They recalled the damage  that cases such as that of Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan have  done. There are those who believe that the disaffection of part  of the electorate has its roots in those who call for the party  to shift left and, therefore, believe that it is necessary to  improve relations with the trade unions. What remains to be  seen now is if yesterday's results will serve to bind together  the different factions within the Socialist Party or whether, on  the contrary, it will heighten their differences. What they all  agree on is that the electorate has again sent a clear message.</p>

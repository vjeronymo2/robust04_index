			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Tec warning on links with government THE SENIOR representative of Training and Enterprise Councils unexpectedly warned yesterday that the relationship between Tecs and the government must be addressed as a matter of urgency after the election if Britain is to achieve its skills revolution. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen, said that funding levels and the degree of flexibility in government contracts with them to deliver programmes including Youth Training had to be examined. Mr Roberts said: 'We still believe implicitly in the Tec idea and we are progressing towards the goals. But, as with any business, we must be sure the strategy is right and the delivery is possible. We are concerned that we may not be able to achieve all the things we want to do. There is a gap between the vision of a skills revolution and the practicality.' There was a need, for example, for government pump-priming of the new Investors in People scheme, which seeks to improve the train-ing of people in work. At present Tecs have no funds specifically designated to drive the scheme. Some Tecs, he said, were also concerned that they might not be able to maintain the quality of training programmes for young people and the unemployed. Tecs generally have been concerned about reductions in government funding for their programmes this year. Sixteen Tecs have yet to finalise their contracts with the government for delivering schemes. The debate over Tecs funding has been joined by the Confederation of British Industry. Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, writing in a report by the Policy Studies Institute, said Tecs may face 'death by a thousand cuts' if they are not given sufficient funds. He said: 'Tecs must be given sufficient resources by government to do the job.' Labour will today seek to lift the issue of training up the political agenda. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the cuts proposed this year were a scandal. Policy Studies Volume 14 No 1, PSI, 100 Park Village East, London NW1 3SR. Pounds 9.95.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY;  </P> <P> MILITARY BASES SEEN AS FUTURE AIRPORTS  </P> <P> Southland congressmen want two San Bernardino County military bases slated for  closure to be considered as sites for new airports intended to relieve crowding  at Orange County's John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> At a meeting in Washington convened by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), an  opponent of proposals to locate a new airport in Orange or San Diego counties,  there was general agreement that any new airports should be developed in  less-populated and less-mountainous areas of Southern California. Packard said  George Air Force Base near Victorville was discussed as a strong candidate. The  congressmen also discussed moving all air cargo and overnight mail service from  John Wayne to Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino.  </P></p>

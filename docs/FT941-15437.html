			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous pressure on oils Leading oil issues came under growing selling pressure as institutions fretted about persistent weakness in crude oil prices and the forthcoming privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group. Oil specialists said there were ominous signs of US selling in the 'majors' in recent sessions, partly because of pressure on crude oil prices but, more importantly, as some of the big US energy funds begin to reshape their non-US oil portfolios to accommodate Elf's flotation. The French government intends to sell some 70m Elf shares to raise around Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 5bn, according to market specialists. 'What is undeniable is that the Elf stock will be priced to go,' said one oil analyst. He said BP and Shell would be the non-US oil stocks most vulnerable to US selling. BP lost 3 to 359 1/2 p and Shell 15 to 710p.</p>

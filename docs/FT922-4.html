			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic trading in a nervous market A STRONG opening in the stock index futures market failed to shield UK share prices yesterday from adverse trends in currencies and the wave of dividend worries prompted by last week's developments at British Petroleum. Trading could only be described as moderate, reflecting the winding down of investment portfolios ahead of the close today of the second quarter of the year. Equities reversed early gains to fall sharply towards the close, contrasting with a rise of 17 Dow points as Wall Street opened its new session. The stock market made a gloomy start as its worries about corporate earnings and dividends were joined by new fears about sterling. Weakness in the pound was ascribed to growing political pressures in the UK over the Maastricht treaty, including the opposition expressed by Mrs Thatcher, former British prime minister. The initial strength of the September futures contract on the FT-SE Index caught the stock market by surprise, and the Footsie moved up by 14 points in the wake of the contract, but trading volume was unimpressive. The market was encouraged by its first reading of the results from British Steel, which disclosed a loss and dividend cut well within forecasts. Nevertheless analysts returned discouraged from the meeting with the British Steel board, and turned their attentions to the dangers facing the next prospective payout from the steel company. By midsession, equities were wilting in the face of renewed and heavy selling of British Petroleum, and when stock index futures also lost their early shine, share prices moved down rapidly. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,515.8, down 18.3. Seaq volume, at 382.7m shares, compared with 638.9m on Friday, was low; but daily Seaq totals have proved a poor guide to underlying equity market business in the past week. Traders said the equity market remained extremely nervous. Some houses believe that British Petrolem shares could come under further pressure, now that 'US investors are having second thoughts', as the head dealer of one leading marketmaking firm put it. Analysts have drawn up lists of companies where the dividend payout could be at risk, with the banks, the composite insurance companies and the building and construction groups all figuring prominently. Wellcome continued to give ground ahead of the planned Pounds 3bn sale of shares, although the group's merchant bankers firmly rejected suggestions that the offer was under pressure. There was no lack of special features in the market in spite of the generally cautious mood. A number of bid favourites were revived, with the possibility of a bid from France for Lasmo, the oil exploration company, finding a ready response. Also favoured by some speculators was the hope that ICI might show interest in Fisons. But traders stressed that many institutions had already closed their trading books on the second quarter.</p>

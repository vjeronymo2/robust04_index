			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> ISRAELI CARD: White House officials are girding for the possibility of  increased tensions with Israel as Iraq's Saddam Hussein escalates his military  threats to Jordan and neighboring countries.  </P> <P> Washington wants the Israelis to sit tight and not unleash their own attack  against Iraq if Saddam sends troops to Jordan, as he has threatened to do.  Israel has warned before that it would retaliate against Baghdad if the Iraqis  attacked Jordan, which is on Israel's border. But Bush Administration  strategists fear that any such sortie would reunite the Arab bloc and upset the  balance that is supporting U.S. forces in the area.  </P> <P> "Attacking Jordan is Saddam's wild card," one senior American official said.  "He wants to pull in the Israelis and re-establish Arab unity. It's the last  thing we can afford."  </P> <P> BAKER'S DISSENT?: Secretary of State James A. Baker III's low profile during  the past week of the Iraqi crisis has spawned new speculation that he may not  fully support what President Bush is doing in the gulf.  </P> <P> Baker was conspicuously absent from some of Bush's most important strategy  sessions at Kennebunkport, Me., earlier this month, letting National Security  Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney take the lead.  </P> <P> Baker aides insist that the secretary's absence stemmed more from his vacation  plans. And State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, seeking to blunt  speculation about his boss's misgivings, took pains to tell reporters that  Baker has been busy telephoning foreign ministers of U.S. allies, and had  spoken to the President twice on Friday alone. The denials were supported by  top Bush aides. "If you look at how (Baker) has been working, he's a key  component of our policy," a Baker loyalist asserted.  </P> <P> Even so, one low-level official complained that the secretary's main --  virtually his only -- interest, these days, is the Soviet Union. "He seems to  talk to (Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze and no one else," he  said.  </P> <P> DRUG RELIEF: Bush's decision to send troops to the Middle East is being greeted  with enthusiasm -- and perhaps with relief -- by one group: the kingpins of the  Latin American drug cartels.  </P> <P> Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the military had been paying increased attention to  drug interdiction, partly as a way of employing American forces following the  end of the Cold War with the Soviet bloc.  </P> <P> Now, intelligence analysts say, with AWACS planes and other surveillance  aircraft redeployed to the Persian Gulf, drug kingpins have begun spreading the  word that it may be time to reintensify smuggling efforts.  </P> <P> BUDGET ACCORD: President Bush finally may have found a fitting incentive to  prod White House and congressional budget negotiators into hammering out an  agreement to reduce the federal budget deficit: He's planning to lock them in a  room until they do.  </P> <P> Administration officials say the lawmakers have accepted an invitation to hold  the next round of budget talks -- scheduled for Sept. 6 and Sept. 7 -- locked  in a hangar or barracks at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside Washington.  </P> <P> It wasn't immediately clear whether White House officials would allow the  negotiators to leave if they fail to reach a deficit-reduction agreement this  time.

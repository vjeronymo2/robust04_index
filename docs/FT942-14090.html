			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Details of Air India sell-off expected soon Some details of the Indian government's plan to sell up to 40 per cent of Air India, the state-run international airline, and its plan to tap global markets for part of the Dollars 2bn needed to expand the carrier's fleet are expected to be announced soon, Reuter reports from Bombay. Mr Durga Mathur, the airline's new managing director, said: 'We are keenly awaiting the government's decision on the percentage of disinvestment. I think it will be around 35 to 40 per cent.' He expected the partial privatisation to be carried out over four to five years. Mr Mathur said Air India would opt for both a Euroissue and domestic issue for the cash, to be raised to fund the Dollars 2bn expansion and modernisation of its fleet.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Israeli bank hit by debt write-offs LEGISLATION forcing Israel's banks to write off large chunks of agricultural debt slashed 1991 profits at United Mizrahi Bank, the country's fourth largest banking group. The group is for sale under the government's programme to sell its majority bank shareholdings. Net profits of Shk32.7m (Dollars 13.7m) were up by more than three times compared with Shk7.2m in 1990, in large part due to strong performance at the group's mortgage bank, Bank Tefahot. Return on capital recovered to 5 per cent, compared with 1.1 per cent. However the core Bank Mizrahi slipped to a Shk8.1m net loss from a Shk2.1m profit under the burden of bad debt provisions. The group was forced to set aside Shk98m for the agricultural sector out of total provisions of Shk195m, including Shk57m to take account of write-offs recently dictated by parliament to ease the debt burden on the country's Moshavim collective farms. The Bank of Israel, which has strongly criticised the law, has warned that the legislation will all but wipe out 1991 profits at the big banks, which are all reporting this week. The central bank and Treasury are particularly incensed as they are involved in trying to sell the government bank holdings, acquired for Dollars 7bn following a share collapse in 1983. Bids close for a 25-to-51 per cent share in United Mizrahi, currently controlled by the United Mizrahi religious organisation, on April 30.</p>

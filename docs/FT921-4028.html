			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Bad start to week for the greens - Environment THE CHANGES in motoring taxation appear to reflect a sad fact of life for the environmental lobby: that, when it comes to a choice between vote-winning and green policies, it is usually the vote-winning that triumphs. For several years it has been government policy to pursue a cautious shift in the balance of motoring taxation from car ownership to car use, on the sensible grounds that those who pollute most should pay most. Hence, vehicle excise duty - a tax on car ownership - has been frozen at Pounds 100 since 1985, while the excise duty on petrol - a tax on car use - has been increased at a rate above inflation. 'This Common Inheritance', the white paper on environmental strategy published in September 1990, stated that further measures would be considered to encourage people to burn less fuel in their motoring. Environmental and public transport lobby groups had hoped to see that happen this year. The expected cut in car tax offered an unmissable opportunity to transfer the tax burden to petrol, so cutting the cost of buying cars but making people think more about how they used them. Instead, the policy has gone into reverse. The car tax is being cut, but not at the cost of higher petrol prices. Instead, the six-year freeze on vehicle excise duty has ended, while in real terms, unleaded and diesel fuel prices remain unchanged. That, the green lobby was observed, was hardly likely to lead to less motoring. Meanwhile, there was gloom on the freight side, too. For nearly a year, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has been talking about his desire to see more freight switch from road to rail. The decision to freeze excise duties on heavy goods vehicles seemed to fly in the face of that commitment. 'A juggernaut of a budget,' Friends of the Earth was calling it last night. What with Monday's announcements of a huge roadbuilding programme, it has been a bad start to the week for the greens.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: JLI slips to Pounds 1.3m midway Restructuring costs left pre-tax profits at JLI, the snacks and ingredients maker, down from Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.32m in the six months ended September 30. Sales advanced to Pounds 52.5m, against Pounds 50.9m. As a measure of confidence the interim dividend is being lifted from 1.55p to 1.6p. Earnings per share fell to 2.1p (3.2p). Operating profits were Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.35m) but the company spent Pounds 695,000 on reorganising the snacks division, its most profitable business. During the period the division's operating profits fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.29m) on sales ahead at Pounds 15m (Pounds 14.7m). 'We were held back basically by the inability to get price increases from our customers to compensate for the sharp increase in the raw material input prices,' said Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive. Interest payments declined to Pounds 232,000 (Pounds 511,000) as UK rates fell. Gearing was unchanged at 42 per cent at the period end but was likely to fall to about 30 per cent by the year end, in line with seasonal fluctuations.</p>

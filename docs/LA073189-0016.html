"His language was music," said a footnote of the  program to explain the lack of official tributes. Karajan, who dominated the  Salzburg musical scene for nearly four decades, died of heart failure July 16.  He was 81. The ceremony at Great Festival Hall was broadcast on Austrian  television and transmitted to several other countries. The Vienna Philharmonic  Orchestra, under the baton of Seiji Ozawa, George Solti and James Levine,  played selections by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart. The ceremony was  attended by Karajan's widow, Eliette, President Kurt Waldheim, Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky and hundreds of other guests. A church ceremony was held in Salzburg  Cathedral on July 23. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]  has been relatively peaceful during the past few days. The  Armenian Defense Army headquarters has revealed that the  disputing sides have refrained from intensive combat operations.  But the Armenian defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon were  fired on from military bases in Egerli and Kemerli in Agdamskiy  Rayon with large-caliber machine guns in the morning of 31  March. Firing resumed at about 1500 on the same day. Ashagy  Akhmedli in Fizulinskiy Rayon and Matavis and Magavus in  Mardakertskiy Rayon were also fired on on 31 March. No one was  hurt.    NKR military experts have linked the lessening tension in  NKR's front line with recent defeats suffered by the Azerbaijani  Armed Forces in several areas.    The NKR Defense Army headquarters has refuted a disclosure  by  the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that the Azerbaijani military  forces have placed new positions under their control in  Agdamskiy Rayon. A high-ranking NKR military official has  described the disclosure as an effort to divert attention from  the failure of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces' large-scale  onslaught in the eastern front line and the large number of  casualties they have suffered. That is quite true. The  Azerbaijani military forces have lost many men and a large  quantity of military equipment from December 1993 to April 1994.  Dozens of enemy officers and men have been captured, over  10,000 Azerbaijani troops have been killed, and some 30,000 men  have been wounded.    The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Center has  reported  that the situation on Armenia's border was relatively peaceful  on the night of 30 March and on 31 March.</p>

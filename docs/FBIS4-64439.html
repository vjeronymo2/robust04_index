			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Go-Ahead for Fininvest Arrest, </F> Berlusconi Comments"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 2 -- After a Milan court ruled that  Marcello Dell'Utri, managing director of Fininvest's Publitalia  advertising company, and two other top Fininvest executives can  be arrested, prime minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi roused  the ire of the magistrate's association when he appeared to take  sides in that case.    Dell'Utri and two others, say Milan prosecutors, doctored  accounts to conceal a line for slush funds paid to politicians.    Berlusconi, commenting on former assistant Dell'Utri's  arrest  order, called it "a colossal mistake." The leader of the Forza  Italia movement said the decision did not affect him personally  as the arrests "pertain only to Fininvest, which is in fact the  injured party in this case."    He said he was "sure the Cassation Court will set things  right." The Cassation Court, Italy's supreme court of appeals,  must now decide on the case.    Elena Paciotti, president of the National Association of  Magistrates, called the Forza Italia leader's comments  "worrying," in a statement issued this afternoon with the vice  president of that association Ciro Riviezzo and secretary  Marcello Maddalena.    "It is worrying that a prime minister-designate should  pronounce himself on a decision in a penal case to go before the  Cassation Court," the magistrates said. "His statement, which  is very strong considering the office of the person making it  takes on the worrying flavor of a message aimed to influence the  independent justices of the supreme court, and demonstrates a  singular lack of respect for the rules of due process."    Today's ruling overturns an earlier one by a preliminary  investigations judge in which a request from public prosecutors  to arrest Dell'Utri and the others was rejected. The court said  the three can be arrested on charges of falsifying accounts to  set aside slush funds.    Milan Chief Public Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli,  whose office had requested a warrant for Dell'Utri, said he was  "very satisfied" by today's ruling.    According to the sentence, Dell'Utri, the director general  of  Fininvest's Telepiu' pay-TV station, and Romano Luzi, another  former top executive in the group owned by Premier-designate  Silvio Berlusconi, can be arrested because there is a danger  that they may tamper with the evidence.    Luzi left Fininvest to set up the Conaia company, which is  believed to have falsified its bills to help Publitalia to set  up its slush funds.    The three will not be taken into custody immediately, as  they  have the right to contest today's ruling at the Cassation Court.  But the ruling forbids them from going abroad without permission  from a judge.    In a communique today, Fininvest management expressed its  backing for Dell'Utri, saying that the advertising company had  "strong business skills" and functioned with "great  professionality."    "I know the truth of the matter and the truth cannot be  changed, given what it is," said prime minister-designate Silvio  Berlusconi this evening, confirming his view that the arrest  orders for three Fininvest managers were "a colossal mistake."    "I don't believe there are any negative aspects to what I  know. I said the judges had made a big mistake and I confirm  that," the Forza Italia leader told reporters.</p>

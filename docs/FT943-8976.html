			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Scenes of infinite variety - Karen Fricker watches the controversial director Robert Lepage at work on his new theatre piece A samurai sword, a guidebook to the Jewish museums of Prague, a folding wooden measuring stick, the Maria Callas recording of Madama Butterfly, an electric guitar, videotapes of The Seventh Seal and Hiroshima Mon Amour, a script of Yukio Mishima's Madame de Sade, a six-pointed star made of yellow cloth. Scattered on a table in a Quebec City rehearsal room, these objects are the physical resources for Robert Lepage's new theatre piece, The Seven Streams of the River Ota; some are background materials, others props. As their variety indicates, the cultural reference of The Seven Streams spans wide - from the Nazi concentration camps in Czechoslovakia, to 1960s Paris, to '70s New York, to post-war and contemporary Japan. The company is in its final weeks of rehearsals before it takes the show to the Edinburgh Festival. You would think, this late in the game, that there would be tension in the room, but the atmosphere is remarkably low-key; Lepage has clearly learned to keep the pressure at the door. And the pressure has been on: over the past five years he has become one of the theatre's most in-demand artists, directing at major venues including London's National Theatre where his Midsummer Night's Dream, set in a mud pit, raised hackles and filled houses; creating and touring a one-man show, Needles and Opium; running, for two years, the French-language wing of the Canadian National Arts Centre; directing pop star Peter Gabriel's world tour concert; and attracting the attention of, among others, Al Pacino and Gerard Depardieu, both of whom have approached the 37-year-old director about working with him. But the jet setting took Lepage away from Quebec, the embattled province that gives him his artistic and cultural identity, and now he is making a conscious effort to redirect his focus homeward. He is negotiating a long-term lease on an abandoned fire station in Quebec City's port district, which he plans to convert into a multi-media arts centre. This summer he directed his first feature film, Le Confessional, in Quebec City and Montreal. And, with The Seven Streams, he has returned to the creative method that first brought him fame: epic-scale collaborations created with a troupe of from Quebec called the Ex Machina Project that is a regrouped version of his first ensemble, Theatre Repere. The genesis of The Seven Streams came during a visit to Japan last year. 'An old Japanese scholar and his wife were giving me a car tour of Hiroshima,' he says, 'and we drove across a set of two bridges across the River Ota called the Yin and the Yang, which are very consciously constructed to represent the male and female sexual organs. The old man explained to me that after the bomb, the first thing that was reconstructed in the city were these bridges - that since there was death all around they wanted life to start up again, and to create life you need sex. 'I was stunned to see that in this area where the sense of death is so present that suddenly there is this literal and figurative representation of life and sexuality. I decided I wanted to do a piece about that - about sex and death, sex and Hiroshima.' In January, eight actors began work on the project. Several plot lines began to take shape: an American navy photographer comes to Japan in 1946 to photograph the aftermath of the bombing, and meets a Japanese woman disfigured by radiation. A young Quebec man arrives in present-day Hiroshima to study calligraphy, and takes a room with an older Czech woman, whose life is replayed in picaresque flashback. Their lives become entangled with a Quebec diplomat stationed in Japan and his bored, shrewish wife. By June, the show's structure is set: seven sections, called boites (boxes), played against a wall of seven sliding panels, designed by Lepage. No script, per se, exists at this point - structure always precedes dialogue in Lepage's process - but sheets of paper on the walls, constantly being amended, diagram the order of scenes. Each actor plays multiple roles, and casting is, to say the least, flexible: after one actor dropped from the show late in the rehearsal process, some of his roles were farmed out and others taken by the stage manager. At each rehearsal session the company runs through a boite. Some go smoothly; others are still raw, the actors improvising their way through scenes, slowed at times by Francophone cast members who have difficulty extemporising in English. At the end of each session, the company sits down to talk. What worked? What didn't? Is the section finished, or do they have to work through it again? Most importantly, what did they learn about the characters and situations that they did not know before? This notion, that they are discovering truth, not inventing fiction, is at the heart of Lepage's aesthetic. 'Before we even start to write or explore a show, it exists,' he says. 'It has a subconscious of its own, a content of its own. The actors, in their improvisations, are digging in the piece, and they uncover things  - objects, relationships, coincidences, facts. Then we have discussions to figure out how we can connect these things we have discovered with the things we already know.' For the observer, despite the sometimes grinding pace, rehearsals are studded with the intense moments of discovery and connection that typify Lepage's work: the repetition of a prop, gesture, or line of dialogue reveals a previously hidden relationship; with a lighting change, a set piece takes on a new identity. Lepage has particular fun with the set's opaque door panels, playing out scenes in silhouette against them, then turning them into video screens; after this show audiences are unlikely to look at train station photo booths the same way again. After its initial British tour, The Seven Streams is booked at festivals and venues throughout Western Europe and Quebec for the next three years; several bookings in Japan are set to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. As the piece moves, it will grow from three to seven hours long, not through the addition of new sections but through the expansion of the segments already in place. Will it ever be finished? That, for Lepage, is not the point: 'There is no recipe, no series of rules, no theory behind what we do. You cannot put a Shakespeare play and a Tennessee Williams play in the same microwave oven and expect them to be 'done.' How is this meal is going to be cooked? We'll have to discover that as we go along.' The Seven Streams of the River Ota plays at the Meadowbank Sports Centre in Edinburgh from August 13-21; at the Tramway Theatre, Glasgow from October 6-8; at Manchester City of Drama from October 13-15; and at the Riverside Studios in London from October 20 to November 5.</p>

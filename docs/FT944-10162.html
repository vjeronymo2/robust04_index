			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (4): Main goal is to join the EU - Foreign policy The overriding foreign policy objective of Hungary's new Socialist-led government differs little from its conservative predecessor: to integrate the country into western European structures through membership of the European Union and Nato by the end of the century. Mr Gyula Horn, the prime minister, says EU membership is the main goal of his government. 'This is a duty, a task of the utmost importance for us . . . Becoming a member means we will have been able to establish a social market economy and to comply with European Union standards and regulations. The other crucial factor is the security we think we can find in the EU.' The government is building on the work of its predecessor which, together with Poland and Czechoslovakia, signed an association agreement with the EU in December 1991 and formally applied for membership earlier this year. Hungary, in common with other eastern European states, believes it is now up to the EU to reveal its timetable and conditions for membership. Mr Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, state-secretary at the foreign ministry, says: 'The European Union does not have a clear policy towards central Europe. We hope this can be resolved at the Essen summit in December. Now, we hear different points of view, from party to party and country to country. This makes preparatory work very difficult for us.' The government acknowledges that Hungary and other countries in the region must reform their economies before joining the EU. But Mr Szent-Ivanyi says the EU should apply the same political rationale to eastern European enlargement as it did to members who joined in the 1980s and set its economic conditions accordingly. He says: 'The economic requirements for our membership should be formulated so that the most advanced central European countries have a chance to comply with them . . . Portugal, Greece and Spain were admitted due to a strong political will to give a hand to the new-born democracies in those countries and to help consolidate them. This was a courageous and clever step.' Where the new government differs from its conservative-nationalist predecessor is in its policy towards neighbouring countries, in particular Romania and Slovakia. In his first speech to parliament as prime minister, Mr Horn said Hungary's most urgent foreign policy task was to eliminate tensions with its neighbours and negotiate basic friendship treaties with the two countries. Improving relations was the best way to promote the interests of the 2.3m ethnic Hungarians living in Romania and Slovakia, he said. In a departure from previous policy, Mr Horn said his government would guarantee the inviolability of borders in the basic treaties - a guarantee upon which both Romania and Slovakia have conditioned bilateral agreements. Despite Hungary's overtures, the chances of a rapid agreement have been lessened by political events in Romania and Slovakia since the new government took office. In August, a nationalist anti-Hungarian party formally joined Romania's ruling coalition for the first time. In September, nationalists led by Mr Vladimir Meciar won Slovakia's general elections and are expected to form the next government. Foreign ministry officials concede these events mean it is less likely that Bucharest and Bratislava will agree to Hungary's demands for improved treatment of ethnic minorities. But faced with stalemate at the political level, Hungary aims to improve economic and trade links with the two countries. Officials say the effect may spill over in other fields such as minority and human rights. In the meantime, Hungary will continue to press the Council of Europe and the European Union to provide greater legal guarantees to protect minority and human rights. Mr Szent-Ivanyi says: 'This is not just a Hungarian problem. We believe it is a hard-core issue for all central Europe, from the former Yugoslavia to the Baltic states.' Countries in the region need western European support to help build confidence and overcome the 'tremendous suspicion' which exists between many of them, he says. One way to achieve this might be to link applicant states' minority and human rights record to EU membership.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PROVERBIAL PLUM  </P> <P> Sources tell us that Bruce Willis will play the mercurial waiter-con man when  playwright Lanford Wilson's volatile play, "Burn This," is transformed into a  film this summer. A hit locally and on Broadway, Willis' part was originated by  John Malkovich (who earned rave reviews), with Scott Glenn and Eric Roberts  earning praise when they replaced Malkovich in the showy role.  </P> <P> Producer Ray Stark and director Herbert Ross -- who collaborated on another  Broadway-success-turned-movie, "Steel Magnolias," due out in September --  reteam on the Tri-Star release.  </P> <P> Wilson will adapt his drama for the screen. From Leonard Klady  </P></p>

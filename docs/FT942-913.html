			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Kohl's CDU edges ahead in German state poll German chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party and the opposition Social Democratic party were last night running neck and neck in the first east German state election since 1990. The SPD's attempt to become the largest party in Saxony-Anhalt was hindered by strong gains made by its leftwing rival, the Party of Democratic Socialism, which is the successor to the former East German Communist party. According to unofficial results, the PDS share of the vote rose from 12 per cent in 1990 to 19.7, making it the third largest party. The CDU was edging into the lead with 34.7 per cent, down five percentage points from 1990, and the SPD, led by Mr Rudolf Scharping, had polled 34.1 per cent, an increase of 5 percentage points. The outcome raises the strong possibility that the CDU and SPD will be forced into a grand coalition in the state. Two other German states have such coalitions - Berlin and Baden-Wurttemburg in the west. The election is seen as a pointer to the remaining state elections and to the federal election on October 16, particularly because the left-wing vote was split. If the left vote is split on the federal level, the CDU and SPD could be forced to form a grand coalition in Bonn. Mr Gregor Gysi, the driving force behind the PDS, said: 'What is important is that we have not been pushed off the agenda.' The CDU had steadily moved up in the state opinion polls over the past few weeks and had been hoping to form a coalition government with the Free Democrats, which had gained 13.5 per cent in 1990. But the FDP was trailing with 3.5 per cent, too low to enter the state parliament. The question for Mr Kohl's CDU, which still governs three of the other eastern states, is whether the FDP, its junior coalition partner, can recover from yesterday's debacle to retain its national representation in October. 'There is only one negotiating partner, and that is the Social Democrats,' said Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU incumbent prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt. The SPD remains reluctant to form a coalition with the PDS, and is not in a position to rule with the Bundis 90/Greens, the environmental party. The Greens' provisional share of the vote dropped to 5.0 per cent from 5.3 per cent in 1990, not enough to form an SPD/Green coalition. The SPD's Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the opposition leader in parliament, said: 'If we opt for a grand coalition, the talks will be very difficult. But we did very well unlike the CDU which lost much support.'</p>

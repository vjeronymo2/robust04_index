			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / The FT Interview: Profit is music to his ears - Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, speaks to Michael Skapinker For a journalist reared on Janis Joplin and Simon and Garfunkel, contact with the music industry can be dispiriting. If the head of a chemical or electronics company mentions an utterly unfamiliar product, you can ask what it is or look it up. But when Alain Levy, French-born chief executive of the music giant PolyGram, announces that his most promising acts are such mysterious names as PM Dawn, Black Sheep, Ce Ce Peniston and Ugly Kid Joe, you have to accept that you are getting old. Some of Levy's sober-suited music industry colleagues look as if they could be running chemical or electronics companies, which makes their pronouncements on the latest US rap act seem all the more incongruous. Levy at least looks as if he belongs in a creative business. Although his expansive office in London's Berkeley Square befits his status as one of the most powerful figures in the music industry, his tousled hair and anarchic grin give him a passing resemblance to Harpo Marx. But even Levy, who is 45, says some of his company's new albums are lost on him. 'It's a bit distressing. More and more I'm saying, 'I don't understand it'. Some of it I really don't. I don't get the magic of the album, which is a bit sad.' Levy does spend time with the company's artists. 'You have to make sure they know they're important to you. The pitfall is that once they have access to the president, they don't want to talk to anybody else in the company.' Record industry executives, he says, should not get too wrapped up in the music. 'The position I'm in can be pretty tempting. Artists call you up, say 'come to the studio', and soon you think you're an expert in mixing records, when you're an expert at nothing.' Levy's job is to make profits for PolyGram, one of the few thriving subsidiaries of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. In March, in the midst of recession in important markets such as the US and Britain, PolyGram's net profits were up 24.8 per cent to Fl446m (Pounds 135m). Levy also announced that PolyGram was the biggest music company in the world, along with Time Warner of the US. The two companies have since been joined at the top by Thorn EMI of the UK which recently bought Richard Branson's Virgin Music, the last of the large independent labels. The three companies have a worldwide market share of about 18 per cent each. PolyGram itself expanded its market share by buying Island Records in 1989 and A&amp;M Records in 1990. The reason the large groups have snapped up the smaller labels, Levy says, is that music is now a worldwide business. In the old days, record companies could make most of their money in the US. Today, the US typically accounts for no more than 30-35 per cent of sales of an album. Modern music companies need their large size to ensure international distribution of their releases. Does this mean people the world over now have the same musical tastes? No, says Levy. The stars with a global following account for about 60 per cent of the international music market. But companies cannot afford to ignore the rest of the market, which is made up of indigenous musical acts. 'Basically the Japanese market is very Japanese. The international repertoire there is the luxury of college kids. In Europe, I strongly believe that the more you talk about European integration, the more, culturally, people need to go back to their roots. Everybody was saying German repertoire was dead; now German repertoire is taking an increasing share in Germany. 'There are some key words which don't sound the same in English as they do in local languages and that won't change - 'love' is one. Plus, don't forget a lot of people don't understand English.' The absorption of small record labels by big music companies is only one example of consolidation in the industry. The other is the acquisition of the music companies themselves by large consumer electronics groups. Sony of Japan bought CBS, the US record company, in 1988. Matsushita of Japan bought MCA of the US in 1990. PolyGram, whose connection with Philips goes back decades, is the oldest example of this link between manufacturers of consumer electronic 'hardware' and the producers of music or 'software'. There are strong management ties between the two companies. Levy sits on the Philips executive board. Jan Timmer, Philips' president, is a former head of PolyGram. It was Timmer who in 1984 recruited Levy, then with CBS, to run PolyGram's French operation. Philips and PolyGram have the advantage of both being European companies. Co-operation between Japanese electronics companies and US music groups is proving more difficult. Apart from the differences in corporate culture between electronics and music businesses, there are national differences. 'It's a double cultural whammy,' Levy says. 'For the Japanese, the individual is not important, it's the team. In a creative business, it's exactly the opposite. Megalomania is almost elevated to a virtue in our business.' Although the Japanese electronics groups have had difficulty realising the supposed 'synergies' between electronic hardware and software, Levy insists the benefits exist. For the hardware companies, the margins available in the software business are a considerable attraction, Levy says. It is difficult for the manufacturers of compact disc players and cassette recorders to realise large profits. The expense of developing a new technology, such as the compact disc, is huge, and the selling price of CD players has plummeted since their launch in the mid-1980s. By contrast, the price of discs has remained high. 'For the software companies, the benefit is an intangible but very important one, which is to think about your business in strategic terms, about how our music is going to be distributed in the next five to 10 years,' Levy says. From this autumn, some of PolyGram's music will be played on a new type of machine called the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC). The DCC player, invented by Philips, plays conventional cassette tapes. It also plays digitally recorded tapes which have a sound similar to that of compact discs. Philips and PolyGram collaborated on the development of DCC, although Philips was careful to line up other music companies behind the technology as well. But, Levy says, if PolyGram had advised against the launch of DCC, Philips would probably have abandoned the project. The music company serves as a market research organisation for the hardware manufacturer, telling it what will and will not be acceptable to the record industry. Had Sony owned CBS at the time, Levy believes, it would have known that the music companies were not prepared to co-operate in the introduction of Digital Audio Tape (Dat), an earlier CD-quality cassette player which failed to take off as a consumer product. Sony is about to launch a new product - a miniaturised CD which is capable of recording as well. The appearance of full-sized blank, recordable CDs is likely within the next few years. The progress of digital recording worries many in the music industry. They are not simply concerned about people making home copies of friends' CDs. They fear that consumers will have no need for pre-recorded CDs at all. With the parallel progress of digital broadcasting technology, they worry that people will record their music directly on to blank CDs from subscription satellite and cable channels  - an 'international juke box'. Levy is not concerned about younger music fans who will still, he says, want to browse through record shops. The international juke box might, however, be more attractive to members of the rock 'n' roll generation who are now in their 40s. 'We're starting to see, especially in the US, people going to concerts who do not buy the record - which is a fairly new phenomenon. The concert hall will be packed but it doesn't affect new record sales. Obviously, we don't know how to offer the records to these people; if they could spend Dollars 25 on the ticket they could spend Dollars 12 on the record. They don't do it.' Levy says the music industry has nothing to fear from this group recording their music from subscription services. 'It might be a plus for us. It might reduce private copying and make it less cumbersome if, for Dollars 2 or Dollars 3, you can get a perfect copy at home, legally.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1946 Born Metz, France.

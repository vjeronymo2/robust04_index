			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sun Hsiu-hui (1327 4423 5610), Professor of </F> Advertising at Chengchih University: "Dispelling Our Delusions  on Television News Reporting"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On 8 November, the Legislative  Yuan voted to pass a key clause on funding for public television  stipulating that each of the three television stations submit  ten percent of their gross revenue each year as one source of  funding for public television. The result of the vote by the  Joint Committee Session not only demonstrated the ardent hopes  of the people for television reform but also reflected the  abhorrence felt by many people during the elections when all  three television stations were reduced to mouthpieces of the  Kuomintang and not only favored the candidates of the ruling  party but also went to extremes in every way to discredit the  abilities of the opposition parties. The subtle aspect of this  was that although the ruling party was constantly expressing  views on the mass media (such as the need to scrupulously adhere  to neutrality, and avoid exaggeration and incitation), the three  stations did not change their ways. Instead, they pontificated  instead at length on their demands that critics "not let  political power interfere with reporting" as if vicious  manipulators who interfered with television news reporting had  never before existed.    Most who criticize television fall into a morass of news  reporting principles such as subjectivity and objectivity,  neutrality and balance, which appear clear but are actually  vague. I am listing here two commonly seen criticisms with  analysis of the "delusions" behind them.    Criticism one: As soon as elections come around, the  television news takes on a distorted approach to discredit the  abilities of the opposition powers.    Wrong! Television news is always quite distorted. Whenever a  sensitive topic arises which is of great controversy or which  has created conflict between two political parties (such as the  vote on the No. 4 Nuclear plant case or the Gu-Wang talks), the  three television stations' willing role as mouthpieces for the  government becomes especially obvious. The most disastrous  example of this was during the Gu-Wang talks when the reporting  style of some television journalists caused some people to worry  about the lack of distinction between the enemy and ourselves.  It is not only during election time that the voices of the  opposition powers are neglected. They have always been merely an  optional "news source" in television news.    Criticism two: Excessive publicity for Kuomintang  candidates in the television news during the elections can only  have an opposite effect.    Voters who actively participate in political affairs and are  concerned about the elections will find excessively slanted  reporting offensive. However, don't forget, in this society  there are still a large number of "politically indifferent  groups" who have no interest in politics. They see voting as a  periodic ritual and lack independent political decision-making  ability and adequate political knowledge. These people also tend  to be loyal television viewers, relying on the "reality"  described on television to construct their external world. The  images carved by the television news of the opposition parties  long ago became deeply engraved in their minds. To these people,  so-called excessive exaggeration merely enhances already  existing impressions. [passage omitted]</p>

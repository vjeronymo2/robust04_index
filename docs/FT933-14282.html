			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rightwing Tories urge spending cuts RIGHTWING Tory MPs last night presented proposals for 'vigorous' cuts in public spending to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and warned that income tax increases would 'betray all that the party stood for'. Further curbs on public spending should also take priority over another extension of indirect taxes such as value added tax, the steering committee of the 92 Group of Conservative MPs said in a report given to Mr Clarke. Its proposals include a moratorium on recruitment to the Civil Service and government agencies, and cuts in spending on defence procurement and the M25 link-road programme. Some 92 Group members went further, suggesting an immediate 5 per cent cut in the public-sector workforce, excluding doctors, nurses, teachers and the police. Although many of the steering group's proposals would prove controversial even among the Tory right wing, the list of demands highlights the political difficulties facing Mr Clarke if taxes were increased to control public borrowing. Mr Clarke met the 92 group, which is supported by about 100 Conservative MPs and is chaired by Sir George Gardiner, Tory MP for Reigate, as part of extensive consultations he is holding within the party ahead of the autumn Budget. Ministers' claims that the targets set for public spending in the next financial year are tight were dismissed by the group. It said there is no need for the 4 per cent increase in cash terms envisaged. Other targets for a fresh review of spending include the overseas aid budget. 'It is ridiculous to be borrowing from one set of foreigners to give to another set of foreigners,' the submission said.</p>

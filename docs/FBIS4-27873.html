			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Sung-hyon] </F>   [Text] The ROK Government has decided to ensure that the  resolution the UN Security Council would adopt urges North Korea  to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA]  inspection of the two unreported facilities.    The government also reportedly decided that North Korea's  acceptance of this special inspection be made a precondition for  the end of the possible sanctions.    Toward this end, the government has decided to make  diplomatic efforts to ensure that at least two provisions --  restrictions on the remittance of money from Japan to North  Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea -- are  included in the resolution on sanctions.    Still, the government plans to pursue phased sanctions to  ensure that the possibility of resolving the nuclear issue  through dialogue is left open. It also plans to ensure that the  resolution specifies the deadline for the resumption of dialogue  between North Korea and the IAEA.    Prior to this, the ROK, the United States, and Japan had  emergency tripartite talks in Washington and New York on 4 June.  At the talks, the ROK Government reportedly presented this plan  and got an affirmative response from the two countries.    An ROK Government official said on 5 June: "Special  inspections are the only means to verify North Korea's past  nuclear activities because North Korea continued to replace fuel  rods."    He also said: "The government's policy is to ensure that  special inspections be a precondition for an end to sanctions."    This official also said that "the ROK, the United States,  and  Japan have reached agreement on this matter."    He also said that "the government believes that if sanctions  are to produce effects, they must be ones painful to North  Korea," adding that "the government plans to make every effort  to include in the resolution restrictions on remittance of money  to North Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea,  which would deal a direct blow to North Korea."    He also said that "the most important thing is not the  content of the resolution but China's support for sanctions."  He predicted that the toughness and level of the resolution on  sanctions would be decided depending on China's attitude."</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Murray Enterprise asset values increase sharply SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC listings of two of its investments helped Murray Enterprise increase net asset value by 45.6 per cent over the six months to March 31 and by 84.4 per cent over the year. Net asset value of this investment trust stood at 129.6p per share on March 31 1992 against 89p on September 28 1991 and 70.3p on March 31 1991. Two investments in the US, Fleet Call, a mobile communications company, and Envoy, an electronic transaction processing company, together accounted for more than 50 per cent of the net assets in March and their listings were largely responsible for the rise in net asset value. A final and exceptional dividend amounting to Pounds 235,000, payable as a result of the receipt of non-repeatable dividends, was approved after publication of the results to September 30 1991. However the actual amount of dividend per share cannot be calculated until it is known how much loan stock will be converted to shares on June 30. Earnings per share came out at 0.46p (4.36p).</p>

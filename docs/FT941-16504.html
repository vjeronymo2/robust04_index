			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Boonstra bows out of Sara Lee The onset of Chicago's winter may have been too much for Cornelis Boonstra, Sara Lee's president and chief operating officer who retired abruptly on December 31 after only six months in the job, writes Laurie Morse. The 56-year-old Dutchman cited personal reasons for his departure, which led local pundits to speculate that his wife may have preferred to stay at home in the Bahamas rather than circulate in Chicago's frigid climate and midwestern social set. Through a spokeswoman, Boonstra said his departure was not based on differences with company management, and was not linked to health considerations. His exit shocked analysts, who said Boonstra had just reorganised Sara Lee's lagging apparel business. Sara Lee, which had Dollars 14.6bn in sales in 1993, is best known for its bakery, coffee and grocery lines, but is also a global marketer of personal care products and clothing brands like Hanes, L'eggs, Bali, Playtex and Champion. Boonstra, a 20-year Sara Lee veteran, was heir-apparent to company chairman and ceo John Bryan. Before being appointed president in July, Boonstra had served as chief of Sara Lee's European operations. He had been an executive vice president and director at Sara Lee since 1988. Boonstra also resigned his seat on Sara Lee's board, although he will be elected as a member of the supervisory board of Sara Lee/DE, a Dutch entity which oversees most of the company's international business. Bryan, 58, is in no hurry to retire, but now that Boonstra has bowed out his succession is left to a troika of executives. Though Boonstra's duties have been split between Steven McMillan, executive vice president, and Donald Franceschini, senior vice president, Michael Murphy, the chief financial officer since August, has also been suggested as a successor.</p>

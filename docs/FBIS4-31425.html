			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 8 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic said Wednesday he was pessimistic about the chances of  a scaled-down UN ceasefire proposal. "This is a mere ceasefire.  We have had many many ceasefires that did not work," Karadzic  said about the latest proposal submitted at talks in the Swiss  city to end fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina between a  Moslem-Croat alliance and the Serbs.    "We are here to sign a cessation of hostilities agreement.  Ceasefires can be signed at the Sarajevo Airport," he said. He  said he had "not too many hopes" because the international  community was "very permissive towards the Moslems."    UN envoy Yasushi Akashi said he would offer Bosnia's warring  parties a scaled-down ceasefire proposal Wednesday in a  concession to Bosnia's Moslem government. Akashi confirmed that  the length of the truce remained the main obstacle in  negotiations between Bosnia's Moslem-Croat alliance and Serb  forces. Aides said his offer involved a two-month truce,  compared to the initial proposal of four months which the  Bosnian Government has rejected.    The head of the Bosnian delegation, Bosnian Vice President  Ejup Ganic, said before talks resumed Wednesday that Akashi had  proposed a four-week renewable truce -- the length sought by the  country's Moslem-Croat Federation. Ganic said Akashi was  proposing that at the end of the four-week ceasefire a further  extension could be decided if there was progress in separate  political and territorial discussions among the warring parties.  He called the offer "very constructive" and a "very promising"  proposal.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Loan for Mexico: The World Bank will lend Mexico, the developing world's  second-largest debtor, nearly $2 billion to fund two hydroelectric projects and  help reduce its interest payments, the government has announced. The  announcement by Finance Minister Pedro Aspe came the same day Mexico resumed  negotiations in New York with a 15-member committee representing creditor banks  and two days after the government liberalized its foreign investment rules. The  new loan package "will support structural changes undertaken by the federal  government in the financial, industrial, commercial and state-run sectors,"  Aspe said.  </P></p>

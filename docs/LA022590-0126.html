			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WETLANDS ZONING 1ST STEP  </P> <P> It's not the boldest action it could have taken, but the Huntington Beach City  Council at least moved in the right direction with the approval last week of a  "conservation zone" on 142 acres of degraded wetlands along Pacific Coast  Highway. While the new zoning does not preclude development, it puts strict  limits on it.  </P> <P> It also advances negotiations that finally could put the acreage in public  hands, as has been done in other wetlands areas through the use of state  conservation bonds. State Coastal Conservancy and other monies then may help  begin to undo some of the damage done over several generations to an ecological  system that evolved over millions of years.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach City Council pulled its punch on the wetlands area in this  way: The conservation zone, which stretches along Pacific Coast Highway from  Beach Boulevard to the Santa Ana River mouth, takes precedence over the  original zoning, but does not do away with it.  </P> <P> That leaves the door slightly open for the property owners to partially develop  the area.  </P> <P> The city could have made a stronger statement simply by removing the original  zoning, but it was fearful of legal challenges from the property owners. With  the conservation zone now in place, the city is hoping that a coalition of  property owners, environmentalists and government officials can come up with an  agreement similar to one fashioned for the nearby Bolsa Chica wetlands. Reached  after years of bitter dispute, that agreement allows development in return for  restoration of large portions of degraded wetlands.  </P> <P> Restoration is, of course, an agonizingly slow process. But it is possible, as  shown in the 25-acre Talbert Marsh near the Huntington Beach wetlands. A year  after tidal waters were rechanneled into shallow pools and estuaries there,  many more birds, including the endangered California least tern, are using the  area as a breeding ground and resting place. Vegetation is returning.  </P> <P> This renewal has quieted arguments by Huntington Beach wetlands property owners  that their land is degraded beyond redemption. That leaves only the questions  of fair compensation and whether there are some portions of their property that  could be developed within the constraints of the city's zoning and the state  Coastal Act of 1976.  </P> <P> The City Council's vote for the conservation zone was given a standing ovation  by an overflow crowd. Some of those who jumped to their feet were newly  awakened to the importance of coastal preservation by the recent oil spill,  which took its heaviest toll on Huntington Beach's shoreline.  </P> <P> But many die-hard environmental activists dedicated to wetlands protection also  were on hand. The conservation zoning is a personal victory for them, and a  first step for the city.  </P></p>

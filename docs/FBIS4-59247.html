			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, a member of Fatah's  supreme authority, has stressed that the Palestinian police  force will collect weapons in accordance with a national  agreement between all Palestinian factions and forces.    Widespread chaos in the security realm has been witnessed in  recent days. The possession of weapons and their use against  people, with or without reason, have become a phenomenon of  concern to the Palestinian residents in the Gaza Strip. Last  week's shootings led to the death of more than six residents,  including children.    'Abd-al-Raziq emphasized that for some time now, the  Palestinian national forces have been conducting a national  dialogue on the issue of disarming all forces.    'Abd-al-Raziq added: We are facing a great challenge and a  greater test. As Palestinians, we can flourish and succeed.  The national interest will govern relations on this and other  issues.</p>

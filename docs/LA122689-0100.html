			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DANCE FEVER: The American Ballet Theatre's cancellation of a summer date at the  Los Angeles Music Center doesn't mean that ballet companies should worry that  they'll be locked out of L.A. if they also plan to stop in Orange County,  officials say. . . . A Music Center official suggested that ABT reneged on its  Los Angeles dates partly because of "direct competition" with its own 1990  engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, but Arts Center  President Thomas R. Kendrick disagreed. . . . "It's been well documented that  there are discrete audiences for the two centers." Dana Parsons and Mark I.  Pinsky  </P></p>

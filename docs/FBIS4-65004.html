			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Olli Rehn: Finland Must Consider </F> NATO Membership"]    [Text] Center Party Deputy Chairman Olli Rehn believes  Finland should seriously consider joining NATO, the Western  military alliance, because of the trend in Russia toward  instability.    "I don't want to frighten or threaten, nor do I believe  there  is [imminent] danger of military conflict, but the mounting  hard-line Great Russia ambitions may bring risk of political  pressure." Rehn presented his views on NATO in an interview with  ILTA SANOMAT. He suspects that such political pressure could  also be accompanied with a military threat.    Rehn last week hosted a seminar organized in Helsinki by the  Finnish delegation to the European Union [EU], in which Russian  extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy participated.    Rehn thought that Zhirinovskiy reflects the feelings of the  Russian people, as well as the injured pride of a great power.  It appears to Rehn that support for hard-line nationalism is  growing.    In his view, Finland must strengthen its own security while  at the same time support building democracy in Russia. Living in  the shadow of an unstable Russia, it is necessary for Finland to  prepare also against the most negative eventualities.    Along with having prepared itself for EU membership, Finland  is getting into position to become an observer in the Western  European Union (WEU). Observer status does not bring security  guarantees; those require joining as a full member.    Rehn stated that full membership in WEU is not a realistic  alternative without membership in NATO, since the WEU's military  strength rests with NATO.    Foreign troops, bases, and nuclear weapons are elements Rehn  would not permit on Finnish territory if Finland were to become  a NATO member.    Within the foreign policy leadership, a Finnish membership  in  NATO has been considered impossible as long as Russia is not  organizationally tied with NATO.</p>

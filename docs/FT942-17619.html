			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: NHS draft governance codes not adequate on internal auditors Sir, Alan Pike reports Mr Alan Langlands, the new chief executive of the National Health Service, as stating that the draft codes on corporate governance, published by the NHS executive, have received positive comments from professional bodies ('Health pay put first in line for treatment', March 30). I would like to point out that the Institute of Internal Auditors-UK was disappointed with certain elements of the drafts. While the IIA-UK applauds the move for stronger internal control, it believes that Mr Gordon Greenshields, head of the NHS finance executive, was misguided in recommending that internal auditors be CCAB (Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies) qualified. CCAB qualifications do not place sufficient emphasis on how to ensure good internal control. By focusing on the financial reporting objective of internal control, they fail to address the other objectives of internal control which fall within the much broader approach covered by internal auditing. The IIA-UK firmly believes that NHS internal auditors who hold the Institute's MIIA and QiCA qualifications are better equipped to fulfil their role. These qualifications provide the holder with the knowledge required to report on the whole system of internal control and not solely on its financial aspects. The NHS is responsible for 15 per cent of public spending - mismanagement of these funds, or unacceptable risk-taking, is a cause for public concern. Properly qualified internal auditors play a vital role in ensuring that these risks are minimised.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Japanese money supply grows JAPAN'S money supply grew in June for the third consecutive month, in spite of continued sluggish economic activity in the private sector. The Bank of Japan said yesterday the 1.4 per cent year-on-year growth of M2, plus certificates of deposit, the key money supply aggregate, reflected continuing payments for public works. Economists expect further steady growth of money supply to support the economy in the coming months. During the campaigning for Sunday's general election most parties, including the Liberal Democratic party, tried to arouse public support by calling for income tax cuts, suggesting that there may be more fiscal measures to stimulate money supply growth after a new government is formed. The Bank of Japan said the June increase in money supply was marginally lower than May's 1.5 per cent, as funds were shifted to investment instruments not included in the key aggregate. M1 grew by 2.9 per cent last month, while M3, or broad liquidity, grew by 3.1 per cent, slightly higher than May's 2.9 per cent.</p>

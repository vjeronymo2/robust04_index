			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- On 1 July, President  Rafael Caldera will unveil in Caracas new economic measures with  which he seeks to overcome the country's economic and financial  crisis, an official source said today. Pompeyo Marquez, special  minister and presidential adviser, said in Maracay, an  industrial city 80 km west of Caracas, that the plan will focus  in particular on social programs and reactivating production.    To that effect, Marquez said the measures will cover three  major areas: stockpiles--to prevent hoarding; employment; and  training. The measures are intended to raise Venezuelans'  standard of living, although most problems will not be totally  resolved, Marquez noted.    Venezuelans are anxious following the collapse of seven  banks  and last week's 8.65 percent devaluation of the bolivar to the  level of 210 bolivares to the dollar. Local economists have said  that Caldera is leaning toward exchange rate controls, a measure  the economy minister opposes. Marquez said he supports controls  on prices and imports because those measures will stamp out  speculation and capital flight.</p>

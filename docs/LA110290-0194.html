			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPANESE TEAM WINS SERIES OPENER  </P> <P> Five pitchers combined on a two-hitter and Takahiro Ikeyama of the Yakult  Swallows hit a two-run double in the third inning today as a Japanese all-star  team beat a major-league all-star team, 4-1, in the opener of an eight-game  goodwill series.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a bases-loaded single in the first  off Hideo Nomo of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, the Japanese rookie of the year.  </P> <P> Nomo had walked the bases loaded.  </P> <P> The Japanese went ahead with a three-run third against Montreal's Oil Can Boyd.  With runners on second and third and one out, Ikeyama doubled to left-center  and scored on Tatsunori Hara's single.  </P> <P> Akinobu Okada of the Hanshin Tigers added a sacrifice fly in the seventh off  Seattle's Randy Johnson.  </P> <P> Hiromi Makihara, the second of five pitchers, was the winner. He pitched two  hitless innings. Masao Kida pitched the ninth for the save.  </P> <P> Boyd, Johnson and Rob Dibble of Cincinnati combined on a four-hitter. Boyd  struck out six and allowed three hits in five innings, while Johnson struck out  four in two innings and Dibble struck out two in the eighth.  </P> <P> Cecil Fielder, who returned to Japan as a hero after becoming the first major  leaguer in 13 years to hit 50 homers, went 0 for 3, including two strikeouts.  Fielder played for Hanshin in 1989.  </P> <P> Sandy Alomar Jr. of Cleveland was the only major-leaguer besides Bonds to get a  hit.  </P> <P> The second game of the series will be played Saturday, also at the Tokyo Dome.

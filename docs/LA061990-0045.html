			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> 10 SOVIET YOUTHS GET WORKING VACATION  </P> <P> Ten young Soviets will arrive July 1 to help the California Conservation Corps  in Camarillo to build a trail across the Santa Monica Mountains and to restore  an old Santa Barbara fort, the state youth organization has announced.  </P> <P> During their monthlong stay, the Soviet youths hope to make the rounds of  Southern California tourist spots, such as Disneyland.  </P> <P> Because they will arrive with little money, the corps is seeking donations,  said Terri Kirby, the Camarillo operations officer.  </P> <P> The California Conservation Corps was established in 1976 to provide young  people 18 to 23 with job experience in return for work on public projects,  often outdoor physical labor.  </P> <P> The Camarillo camp competed with its 16 sister camps to host the Soviets, Kirby  said.  </P> <P> The Soviet youths primarily will help California crews work on the Backbone  Trail over the Santa Monica Mountains and the restoration of the Santa Barbara  Presidio.  </P> <P> In exchange for the Soviet youths' California visit, 30 young people from other  corps camps will fly to the Soviet Union in August, Kirby said. They are  scheduled to spend a month near Moscow working on historic restorations and  parks projects.  </P> <P> None of the corps members from Camarillo are scheduled for the Moscow trip,  Kirby said. But Paul Magie, assistant director of the Camarillo corps, will  accompany the group as a staff member.  </P> <P> Those interested in offering donations may call 484-4345. JOANNA MILLER  </P></p>

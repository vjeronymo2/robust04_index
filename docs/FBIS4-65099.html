			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jutta Falke: "Lead among Nonvoters--Internal </F> Strategy Papers: How the Social Democrats Intend to Win Points  Against Gysi's Party in the Bundestag Election Campaign"]    [Text] At the dinner table in Bonn's parliamentary society  Wolfgang Thierse was telling tales out of school. He would not  have a face-to-face debate with his opposite number, PDS [Party  of Democratic Socialism] candidate Stefan Heym, in September, he  said. Was he throwing in the towel? Polling results appear to  indicate that more than 50 percent of the voters in the  Berlin-Mitte district plan to vote for Heym, the PDS' direct  candidate.    The respectable showing by the SED [Socialist Unity Party]  successor party in the Brandenburg local elections has the SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] worried--and not just the  SPD. After those elections [Guenter] Verheugen, the SPD national  executive director, was quick to say that there will be no  cooperation with the PDS. But what good does that do? However  honorable such statements might be they do not necessarily help  obtain the votes of potential PDS supporters.    That suits Gysi's party fine; it continues to move ahead. At  least that is what the polls say. According to Infratest Burke  Berlin, 55 percent of the eastern Germans polled would like to  see the PDS represented in the Bundestag again; 24 percent said  they might vote for the PDS in the next Bundestag election. And  according to Infas, 62 percent of the eastern Germans consider  the PDS to be a party "committed to social issues."    In that regard it competes with the SPD, of course. Under  the  circumstances, SPD headquarters would just as soon leave well  enough alone. The debate has not yet come to a close, it is  said. A plan on how to deal with the issue only exists in  "Guenter Verheugen's head."    That is not entirely correct because a lot of thought is  already being given to the matter behind the scenes. These  deliberations include a reexamination of the SPD's own role--and  how it is perceived among the voters. It was not until 1990 that  the newly founded eastern German SPD which initially went by the  name of SDP decided not to accept former members of the SED.  That decision held for a year to start with. These days, the  local party organizations decide on a case-by-case basis, but  they are very restrictive.    Are they too restrictive? At this point party headquarters  no  longer want the SPD in eastern Germany to act as a new party  unhampered by the SED past, but as an activist political force  involved in current issues. Wolfgang Thierse, it is said, is  inclined to adopt such a position. Given the unclear majority  situation, who can afford to drive potential voters into the  arms of the PDS by asking them: "what did you do the day before  yesterday?"    Certainly not the SPD. The membership figures alone send a  loud and clear message. The SPD has 30,000 members in eastern  Germany while the PDS has about 130,000. The only recourse is to  go on the offensive. On orders from the party executive  committee Rudolf Hartung, the executive director of the Berlin  SPD and a former functionary at party headquarters, worked up a  set of theses.    The revised version of the "33 Theses for Self-Confident  Dealings with the PDS" will be completed within the next few  days. It will then be presented to the executive committee. A  shorter version will subsequently be published.    The document calls for focusing more on SPD successes in  national politics. It contains quotations from statements by  Gysi and analyses of the PDS membership structure and comments  such as "everyday political life in the PDS is joyless and has  little to do with Gregor Gysi talk shows." The document also  includes optimistic, albeit helpless statements such as: "among  nonvoters there is a distinctly greater potential for confidence  in the SPD than in the PDS." Or: "about 20 percent of the PDS  voters admit that the SPD is more effective and can be more  successful on major social policy issues than the PDS which is  by and large a regional political party limited to the former  GDR."    Hartung is not the only one to prepare such a strategy paper  on the PDS issue. Uwe Kuester and Rolf Schwanitz, two deputies  from eastern Germany, have also drawn up an analysis. Kuester,  the SPD parliamentary group's executive director, would not like  to see an "election campaign that focuses on party platforms,"  nor does he want the SPD to concentrate on the SED past. "In the  final analysis," he says, "one cannot exclude 2.3 million former  SED members for life." His study goes into the PDS membership  structure and election strategy as well as into the consequences  for the SPD election campaign. "It would be counterproductive to  stigmatize the PDS members as individuals who are forever  looking backward," Kuester writes. As an example he cites PDS  politician Kutzmutz in Potsdam who met with a lot of  understanding when he noted that "my biography does not start in  1989." The market economy is another issue to be raised, he  recommends. The PDS which casts doubt on it in its platform is  "totally unrealistic and ideologically overburdened" on that  score.    In his view, the PDS is trying to blame the SPD along with  the government for the negative consequences of Bonn's  decisions. This attempt must be countered. The election campaign  should therefore be based on SPD achievements, including those  in the Bundesrat. In essence, Kuester's paper says, "by  attacking the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], our principal  adversary, in this manner we will simultaneously be dealing in  the most elegant way with the PDS, our principal competitor."    In his paper entitled "The PDS--Antidemocratic, Divisive,  Separatist" Rolf Schwanitz, who made a name for himself in the  SPD as head of the working group on German unity, places  particular emphasis on the PDS's past and its programmatic  goals. He feels nonetheless that "attitudes toward the GDR past  have changed, particularly among those who sympathize with the  PDS." Schwanitz would not only like to confront the PDS with  "soft issues" in the election campaign but rather to "expose its  core." The PDS is merely interested in "focusing on problems and  not on their solutions," he says. "The PDS primarily represents  the interests of the former nomenklatura."    In his paper Schwanitz analyzes the role played by the PDS  in  reports prepared by the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, examines its draft statutes and its dealings with  SED assets. "In united Germany," he writes, "the PDS tries to  secure freedoms for left-wing extremist forces and agitates  against a well-fortified democratic system of government."  Schwanitz then turns against "a response adapted to the public  mood in which the issues already preempted by the PDS, e.g.  Stasi activity, its role in the past and present, are respected  and ignored."    Can the PDS "campaign of conquest" still be stopped? If it  did return to the Bundestag, it could thwart some options and  force others to be adopted. "The consequence could be a grand  coalition," Hartung speculates. Do others share this fear? At  any rate, CDU headquarters is also busy working on strategies  directed against the PDS. Campaign materials directed against  the Gysi party are to be distributed following the summer recess.</p>

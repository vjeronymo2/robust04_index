			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Makung, Penghu, March 29 (CNA) -- Six Taiwan Coast  Guard Police were forced to jump off a mainland Chinese boat  they had boarded after spotting its crew trying to unload  smuggled foreign cigarettes Monday [28 March] night near the  Penghu Islands off Taiwan's west coast.    The policemen had boarded the iron-hulled ship while it was  trying to escape from their two Makung-based police cutters, but  discovered the crew barricaded behind a locked cabin door, which  they tried without success to break down.    After a two-hour stand-off, they were forced to jump into  the  sea when the mainland vessel made a drastic turn to the west and  sped up to enter the territorial waters of Mainland China.    All six were immediately picked up by the trailing police  boats.    By jumping off the smuggling boat, the policemen prevented a  rerun of a similar incident two years ago in which a mainland  iron- hulled vessel kidnapped a Taiwan patrol guard when the  guard boarded the mainland vessel to arrest the crew for  smuggling.    The guard was repatriated to Taiwan a couple of weeks later  after bargaining between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the two semi-official  organizations edicated to the promotion of civilian exchanges  between Taiwan and the mainland.</p>

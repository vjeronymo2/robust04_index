			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach gathers pace with 47% rise to Pounds 8.8m Stagecoach, the acquisitive bus company that came to market last April, yesterday announced a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.8m in the six months to October 16. Turnover rose from Pounds 68.7m to Pounds 80.7m, excluding discontinued operations. However, the latest figure included the contribution of several acquisitions as well as new business generated by introducing modern coaches  -shortly to be equipped with lap seat-belts - on some medium-distance routes. Mr Brian Souter, chairman, said Stagecoach was interested in the prospect of acquiring one or more of the London bus companies when they were privatised and believed the company could make acquisitions without calling on shareholders for additional capital. Stagecoach, which has 6 per cent of the UK bus market, believed that more modern buses and better services could reverse the decline in bus travel. Some cities in the south-east were introducing transport policies favouring buses which had boosted demand. The company was also a potential bidder for British Rail franchises though it did not expect the shape of the future rail market to become much clearer before the spring. It would be the end of 1994 before it took a final decision on whether to bid, said Mr Brian Cox, a director. Earnings per share for the opening half rose to 4.4p (3.3p). The company is paying a 1.5p interim dividend and forecast a final of 2.5p. Operating profit, excluding new acquisitions, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 10.5m reflecting increases in efficiency. It invested Pounds 22m in 256 new buses. Interest charges on new buses are far lower than the cost of maintaining old buses which can run to Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 6,000 a year. When the company's five-year replacement programme is completed the average age of the fleet will have fallen from 10 years to six years. The group's gearing is currently standing at nearly 140 per cent because of its recent acquisitions. However, it took comfort from the fact that its interest cover was five times earnings, Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BA wanted First quarter results from British Airways (BA) saw the shares accelerate as transport analysts, picking through the wealth of statistics issued by the company, declared themselves highly positive. Most focused on the passenger yield - the key industry measure of average fare income per kilometre travelled - which rose by 2.3 per cent to 6.17p. The figure benefited from favourable currency movements. Despite a fall in pre-tax profits, analysts were excited by the potential for a pick-up in trading in 1994. 'Against a background of low inflation and economic recovery, the operational gearing and low prospective multiple makes BA one of the most attractive cyclical plays in the market,' said Mr Mark Laurence at Smith New Court, who yesterday turned buyer of the stock. Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull said: 'These figures show BA's ability to make reasonable money in the most appalling market conditions. If the trading and competitive environments improve then it is capable of being very profitable indeed.' He added that for the long-term, the stock was 'substantially undervalued'. Analysts' full-year profit forecasts varied widely. Smith New Court cut its current year forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 225m, with a smaller cut to Pounds 375m for 1994-95. Strauss is looking for Pounds 345m and Pounds 450m respectively. Spurred on by good US support, the shares ended the day 14 1/2 up at 350p in hefty turnover of 15m.</p>

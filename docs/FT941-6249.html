			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola looks to the Grape Beyond It sounded more like a fringe meeting at a New Age rave than a product launch. Against a background of weird, throbbing music, the man at the podium talked of yin and yang, body and soul, life, the universe, and everything. However, to nobody's great surprise, it quickly emerged that Coca-Cola had not decided to give up the business of money-making for a life of philanthropy and consciousness-raising. Rather, it was signalling plans to grab a slice of the market for so-called New Age beverages, the fastest-growing sector of the US soft-drinks market. Coca-Cola's weapon in the New Age drinks war is a product called Fruitopia, a vaguely psychedelic-looking range of bottled drinks that turns out to consist of nothing but water, sugar, fruit juice and natural colouring. However, if the contents of the bottles are prosaic, the labels are not. They carry pictures dotted with the words 'mind', 'body' and 'spirit', and the drinks have names like Raspberry Psychic Lemonade, Strawberry Passion Awareness, Total Fruit Integration and Citrus Consciousness. The bottles also carry mind-expanding epigrams. On the bottle of Grape Beyond, for example, the slogan says: 'Things that are still right in the cosmos: the perfection of a circle, Beethoven's 9th, Grape Beyond.' The launch of its Fruitopia is seen as a clear attempt by Coca-Cola to replicate the phenomenal success of a range of similar fruit drinks made by the New York-based Snapple Beverages, a stock-market flyer since it went public a year ago. By coincidence, Snapple yesterday reported net profits soaring to Dollars 67.6m in the year to December, from a pro-forma Dollars 18.3m last time. Its shares, however, sank Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 as news of the Fruitopia launch emerged. The total market for New Age beverages - loosely defined as 'natural' drinks like iced teas, fruit juices, bottled water and sports drinks - is estimated to be worth Dollars 6bn, and Coca-Cola has only 8 per cent of it. The company expects the Fruitopia launch to take that share to 15 per cent initially, and to 30 per cent within three years. Mr Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola's senior vice-president and chief marketing officer, said the product would be available in US stores in four weeks, and in three or four other countries soon after. Its launch would be backed by a Dollars 30m marketing campaign. Snapple seemed unconcerned by the move. All that extra advertising would simply accelerate the market's growth, it said. And, asked why so many people were suddenly buying New Age beverages, it suggested: 'Maybe they're sick of Coke.'</p>

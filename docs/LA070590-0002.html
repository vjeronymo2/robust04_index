			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Boycott Against Lang Beefs Up: More radio stations in the farm states of  Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa are joining the boycott of Grammy-winning singer  k.d. lang because of her appearance in a "Meat Stinks" advertising campaign.  </P> <P> Radio station KRVN in Lexington, Neb., had previously banned the singer because  of the commercials. Patrick John, program director of KSUM-AM in Fairmont,  Minn., said that his station won't play lang's music until she disavows People  for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which put together the campaign. KSRB-AM  in Sioux Falls, S.D., tried a different approach -- it gave away filet mignon  to callers each time it played one of lang's songs Tuesday. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

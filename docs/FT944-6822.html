			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Suddenly we have a world upsurge Suddenly the world upturn has moved so far into its stride that boom may be a more appropriate word than mere recovery. Indeed commentators from the financial sector are already worrying whether the boom might not become too much of a good thing. These international developments have important implications both for tomorrow's UK Budget and even more for the meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England eight days later on December 7. For in the present world environment the last thing the UK economy needs is a domestic stimulus or even unnecessary red ink in the Budget. The improved fiscal outlook should be enjoyed entirely in the form of a more rapid move towards eliminating the budget deficit. Even the CBI accepts that UK base rates will need to rise by about 1 3/4 percentage points. The first move should be made in days. It is fruitless to seek the causes of the pronounced world recovery. There are inherent tendencies for world demand to rise in line with world productive capacity; and it is the slumps and booms that require explanation. The US economy was being actively stimulated by cheap money until last spring and the subsequent tightening has been well short of draconian. In West Germany there was not so much a recession as a move from the excess demand resulting from unification spending. Unfortunately the interest rates required to remove this excess demand were too high for the rest of Europe where a genuine recession was produced. But with German short interest rates now back to normal and a very sharp recovery in that country's eastern Lander, the special depressing forces have ended. Least noticed of all, Japan has at long last snapped into a recovery in spite of continued deflation in domestic producer prices. What seems to have happened is that Japanese producers have again adjusted to an excessively high exchange rate and an over-cautious monetary policy by levering costs and prices downwards. The US investment firm of JP Morgan contends that capacity utilisation in industry is already above its long-run average - not just in the US, but in the OECD as a whole. One reason for this is the shallowness of the recession of the early 1990s. That recession was greeted with cries of pain because it struck more than previous downturns at the more articulate financial and white-collar sectors. The last business cycle was also unusually unsynchronised; the US was already recovering while Europe was entering recession. Morgan economists argue that one or more year of spritely outward growth will result in operating rates akin to the late 1980s when economies were very strained. This applies especially to countries such as the US, Canada, Australia and those 'on the periphery of Europe' that have given their economies a kick-start from devaluation. The above analysis is disputed by the rival investment bank of Goldman Sachs, which argues that companies tend to be too gloomy about their capacity at this stage of the business cycle; that new types of electronic equipment can be run more nearly flat out; that some of the inflationary strains can be taken by importing more from the developing countries; and that employing more workers, for instance in shift work, can make existing capacity go further. But the Goldman Sachs economists do not dispute either the existence of a pronounced world upturn or the need at least for the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to tighten policy again (in spite of the latter's recent tightening). My own view is that macroeconomists and financial analysts do not have a special insight into the technicalities of productive capacity. They would do much better to analyse world growth in terms of nominal demand, measured by nominal gross domestic product or one of its derivatives, and whether that needs to be restrained, stimulated or (most often) left alone.</p>

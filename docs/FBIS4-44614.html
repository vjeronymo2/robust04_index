It meets IEC (International  Electrotechnical Commission) recommended standards for testing a  large number of ratios and parameters: optical power vs current,  voltage vs current, differential quantum efficiency, threshold  current, optical spectrum half-width, peak wavelength, side-mode  suppression ratio (SMSR), far-field pattern (FFP), temperature  characteristics, etc. For interested manufacturers, investment  for a 50-100-square-meter production line is about 1-1.5 million  yuan, and annual sales revenue and annual profit are estimated  to be about 1.5-2 million yuan and 500,000-600,000 yuan,  respectively.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200  GMT on 21 April reports that "the latest round of Israeli-PLO  talks ended in Cairo a short while ago. The talks are slated to  resume at the beginning of next week." Dr. Nabil Sha'th told  correspondent Moti Amir that "several important understandings  in the security and civil spheres were achieved this week," and  that he expects that an agreement on the autonomy's legal powers  will be achieved next week.    "Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs  Committee in the Cairo talks, estimated that the Civil  Administration would be able to transfer powers in Gaza to the  Palestinians a few days after the agreement is signed."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 21 April,  reporting on "progress" in the Cairo talks, says that "both  sides were optimistic that an agreement could be wrapped up by  next week's end. Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the  Israeli delegation to the talks, said Israel could not meet the  PLO's demand for a timetable for the release of all Palestinian  prisoners before an agreement is signed. He described the  week's negotiations as extremely fruitful."    PLO chief delegate, Nabil Sha'th, was also optimistic, and  spoke to Qol Yisra'el's Moti Amir about the progress made in  this week's talks, and his expectations for next week. He said  the negotiations this week concluded "all the elements of the  transfer of authority. So, all civilian authorities, or what's  called civil authorities, including water, zoning, air  transport, telecommunications, electricity, fuel and gas -- all  of these issues were concluded during this week. We have been  able to conclude also several remaining items of the security  protocol or the security annex, but we remain with few of these  issues, such as the modalities of joint patrols and crossing  points, and the passage between Gaza and Jericho, and some  elements that remain in the issue of visas and the renewal of  visas. All of these will be, I hope, finished during next week.  We have decided that next Monday we will be more ready to  announce the exact date of the signing. We, in all  probabilities and barring major disagreement or major events, we  should be concluding everything during next week." Sha'th  added: "We are going to do our best to conclude next week and  sign the week after."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 21 April  cites a report by Moti Amir who points to the assessment that "a  date will be set next week for the signing ceremony on the  Gaza-Jericho accord which will take place in Cairo and will be  attended by the prime minister, the PLO head, and President  Mubarak, the main sponsor of the accord." Amir notes that "the  conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho accord also  depends on the negotiations on economic issues taking place in  Paris." Also, besides the remaining dispute on the legal powers  of the autonomy's authority, "the two sides are still divided on  the Gaza Strip's fishing zones, the construction of a port  there, and the stationing of Palestinian policemen at the border  crossings in Jericho and Rafah. Handling of some of these  questions will continue after the agreement is signed.    "Brig. Gen. Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs Committee,  emphasized that upon signing the agreement with the  Palestinians, a body will be established to coordinate matters  between the Palestinian authority and the Israeli authorities."  Amir adds that "the final draft of the agreement on civilian  issues will be formulated in Cairo next week, except those few  issues both sides decided to pass on to the two leaders who will  sign the Gaza-Jericho accord."    In an earlier talk with Moti Amir Maj. Gen. Shahaq stressed  that about 5,000 prisoners would be released in stages, in  accordance with criteria agreed upon by the sides. Still, "the  release will not include Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  members, terrorists who murdered Jews, or terrorists who  operated after the signing of the Declaration of Principles."  Understandings will have to be achieved also regarding  "Palestinians who are persecuted by their brethren for  collaboration with Israel."</p>

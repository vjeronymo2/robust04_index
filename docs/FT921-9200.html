			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians deny responsibility for aluminium market slide RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES have been defending themselves against charges that they are damaging the West European aluminium market with cheap exports and expect counter-proposals from the European Commission tomorrow. Mr Ruben Petrosian, deputy chairman of Raznoimport (the state organisation that handles exports of non-ferrous metals) claimed that 'the USSR was not the main factor in price changes at the London Metal Exchange'. Blaming recession in the West for the recent slump in prices, he said prices were firming again as western economies picked up. He claimed that Soviet exports had remained largely unchanged, at 700,000 tonnes a year between 1989 and 1991. Mr Petrosian added that his organisation, which is now restricted to Russia, had proposed to the commission a review of the Russian licensing system to restrict exports, even though it had no control over exports by other republics such as Tajikistan and Ukraine. But Mr Lev Lubensky, who heads the export department of Concernaluminium, a conglomerate that represents all Russia's aluminium smelters, painted a more likely picture of the situation. He said that a new licensing regime coupled with stiff new export tariffs introduced in January had already curbed exports. Russian exports, however, would rise again this month as a result of the recent relaxation of certain export tariffs, but not to last year's level because the strict new licensing system would remain in place. But he also admitted that until domestic Russian labour, energy, and other production costs approached world levels, it would still remain profitable for Russian producers to sell aluminium at weakened world prices on the LME. Possibly attempting to cheer up western producers, he said the domestic Russian price of aluminium was rapidly rising. After the removal of all price controls on aluminium as part of Russia's January 2 price liberalisation, he said that the domestic prices of aluminium had leapt from Rb1,800-4,000 to Rb30,000-50,000 a tonne. At the market rate, the latter converts to Dollars 300-500 a tonne. He also denied Mr Petrosian's suggestion that other republics had a significant presence on export markets, since Tajikistan accounted for only 15 per cent of former Soviet exports while Ukrainian exports were negligible. He said Russian exports to the West had increased over the past two years because of two factors. Firstly, because of the collapse in exports to former Comecon countries, which had previously accounted for 70 per cent of Soviet sales abroad. Secondly, he blamed a proliferation of independent exports by joint ventures and enterprises, over which central authorities had no control. The European Commission, which is now considering some sort of compromise to help western producers without closing the door to Soviet imports, stepped into the dispute after western European producers complained they were having to close down capacity as a result of the cheap imports. The irony is that up-to-date western smelters with advanced environmental standards are threatened with closure by the output of badly outdated Russian smelters. Mr Lubensky noted, however, that western investors were showing no enthusiasm for helping to re-equip Soviet plants.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ramiz Rizayev, plenipotentiary </F> representative in Russia, by Ilgar Gurbanov; place and date not  given: "We Will Strengthen Relations with Russia"]    [Text] [Gurbanov] Ramiz Gasanovich, how do you rate the  present sociopolitical situation in Azerbaijan?    [Rizayev] It is considerably more calm and stable in our  republic today than it was a year ago, let us say. Naturally,  the war which Armenia has now been waging against Azerbaijan for  approximately six years has been and still is the chief  barometer here. It must be emphasized that it is precisely  Armenia that is fighting, not the mythical "Nagorno-Karabakh  self-defense forces." Where has Karabakh's present tiny Armenian  community gotten this tremendous military might, these tanks,  missiles, and aircraft? Where has it gotten the fuel that powers  the death-dealing war machines? The economic damage to the  republic resulting from this war exceeds U.S.$4 billion. Today  there are 1,000,200 [figure as published] refugees in  Azerbaijan; the lot of these people who have been forced to  leave their homes in order to escape annihilation is terrible.  Old men, women, and children perish and die every day from  cold, hunger, and disease. Ravaged by war, Azerbaijan cannot  cope with this disaster, and the humanitarian aid, for which we  are grateful to everyone who gives it, provides only poor  support.    [Gurbanov] What can you say about the role of intermediaries  in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict? For example, about  Russia's mediation mission....    [Rizayev] We are grateful for any peacemaking efforts which  might help to end the bloodshed, which neither the Azeris nor, I  am sure, the Armenian people want. As for Russia's role in a  peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, it  must proceed from the premise that Russia's geopolitical and  economic interests require stability on its southern borders.  Approximately half a million Russians live in Azerbaijan, and  they regard our republic as their homeland and share the burdens  of the war equally with everyone. We therefore consider  Russia's active participation and that country's objective  position as very important factors in resolving this complex  problem. Russia is taking peacemaking steps, and the activity  of Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's  special ambassador in the conflict zone, deserves particular  mention.    We joined the CIS and signed the Collective Security Treaty,  and we believe that this treaty must produce a considerably  greater return than hitherto, because it is absurd when one CIS  member, Armenia, wages an aggressive war against another,  Azerbaijan. We also want more active participation by the  United Nations, the CSCE, the Security Council, and, of course,  Russia and other countries in resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan  conflict.    [Gurbanov] After everything that has happened, do we have  any chance of hope in the "all-Caucasian home"...?    [Rizayev] This idea has arisen before in history. It still  sounds only a fine metaphor, a dream. What question can there  be of a common home when, alas, there is still no peace and  accord in it? Let us first stop the bloodshed.    [Gurbanov] Mr. Ambassador, how does Azerbaijan perceive the  cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government?    [Rizayev] We do not interfere in Russia's internal affairs.  Naturally, we welcome the policy of democratic transformations  in Russia. Russians are pinning their hopes on it, and we  sincerely sympathize with them at this difficult time. One of  the most important elements is the fact that the internal  political situation in Russia largely determines the overall  political and economic climate in the Commonwealth.    [Gurbanov] Is the need felt in the republic to adopt a  statute on dual citizenship? Please tell me about the position  of Russians and the Russian-speaking population in Azerbaijan,  and also about the position of Azeris in Russia....    [Rizayev] In Azerbaijan, as in other republics of the former  USSR, the problem of dual citizenship is being discussed and  constructive ideas about it are being accumulated. As regards  Russian-speakers, here I would like to emphasize the following.  The first Russian settlement in Azerbaijan appeared back in the  time of Patriarch Nikon of Rus, at the end of the 17th century.  Azerbaijan is their motherland. The good relations between  Russians and Azeris have stood the test of time. The Slavs'  Culture Center and the "Sodruzhestvo," "Azerbaijan-Russia," and  "Russkaya Obshchina" societies are now operating in Baku.  Newspapers and television and radio programs are put out in  Russian, Russian schools and theaters are functioning....    The war brings suffering not only to Azeris. Baku is gasping  for breath and is unable to accommodate refugees from the  territories occupied by the Armenian armed forces. There have  been instances of unauthorized takeovers of both Azeris' and  Russians' apartments, but the situation is being strictly  monitored and obstacles are being placed in the way of  lawlessness. I would like to speak about one other thing here.  During very difficult times for Azerbaijan, particularly after  the January 1990 bloodshed in Baku, part of the Russian-speaking  population left the republic. But we are very glad that the  majority of them have come back.    As regards the second part of your question, there are  fellow  countrymen of ours who have been living in Russia for long years  and who have made a tremendous contribution to Russia's culture  and economy. It is possible to name Aydyn Imamaliyev, Russia's  chief trauma expert, and the artist Tair Salakhov. USSR  People's Artiste Muslim Magomayev lives in Moscow; General K.  Kerimov, who stood at the cradle of Soviet cosmonautics and was  involved in the development of some highly interesting space  projects, recently retired on pension. The list of such  examples could be long.    But there is, unfortunately, something else. It so happens  that Azeris are also involved in so-called mafia altercations.  There is a lot of talk about the presence of Azeris at markets,  about their behavior.... Here it is necessary to be able to  separate the wheat from the chaff. When, for example, a Russian  guy from Ryazan stands and sells meat at an exorbitant price,  this seems not to be noticed. When "persons of Caucasian  nationality" sell tomatoes, let us assume, for 1,000 rubles too  much, from the Russians' viewpoint, indignation at once erupts.  And yet the struggle must be waged not along ethnic lines, so  to speak, but against the phenomenon of speculation, corruption,  etc. Take the campaign mounted against Caucasians after the  October events in Moscow -- very many offenses occurred. At any  rate, we proceed from the premise that Azeris have no right,  while living on Russian territory, to show disrespect for  Russian laws, customs, and traditions or to forget about their  national responsibility, because we represent our people far  from our motherland. As regards criminal elements, all the  severity of the law must be applied to them.    [Gurbanov] What do you think about the prospects for  Azerbaijan's relations with Russia?    [Rizayev] Here we cannot manage without talking about the  problems of the CIS. As is known, the Commonwealth emerged from  the ruins of the Union, which was destroyed at a speed and with  consequences which were disastrous for the peoples who populated  it. Ties -- above all, economic ties which had just about  "worked" for 70 years -- were severed overnight. All the  burdens of such ultraradical, supposedly democratic "renewal"  were also felt in full by the people of Azerbaijan. Let us take  just one sector -- petroleum machine building. During the  thousand-times cursed "era of stagnation" Azerbaijan produced  approximately 80 percent of all the Union's oil-field and  drilling equipment. After its breakup this indicator fell  sharply -- which hit hard at oil extraction in Russia and, in  the final analysis, also at the prosperity of Russians and the  population of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijan's normal contacts  with Russia are hampered by customs barriers and robbery on the  railroads. This cannot be tolerated.    The policy pursued by the republic's former leaders  virtually  brought Azerbaijan to self-isolation -- isolation from many  other countries, including Russia. We are now endeavoring to  rectify this situation and have already largely done so. We are  pursuing a policy of strengthening and expanding ties with  Russia.    I am sure that both the Russian people and the Azeri people  need this.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has addressed a letter to Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin stressing the need to resolve the problem of  default payments and to enact bankruptcy procedures for  loss-making enterprises, ITAR-TASS was told today by Aleksandr  Livshits, head of a team of experts under the presidency.    Speaking about the need for bankruptcy procedures, Livshits  stressed that if this measure was not adopted "the inflation is  apt to reach 40-50 per cent at the first stage, by May 1944, and  the next spiral of default payments will lead to the  Ukrainisation of the Russian economy".    The expert believes that it is just as difficult to legalise  bankruptcies as it was to liberalise prices in January 1992.  But if that was the first step towards the Russian economy's  switchover to market rails, today it is most necessary to make  the second step.    Explaining the bankruptcy mechanism, Livshits, who is doctor  of economic sciences, noted that a loss-making enterprise should  be immediately privatised, turned into an open-type joint-stock  society, and temporarily managed by a commission, made up of  creditors and representatives of the State Property Committee.  The commission will check the accounts of the bankrupt  enterprise, will analyse its system of management, and will  decide on the commodities it is to manufacture. Only then the  enterprise will get the money it needs to restore its  efficiency. "Moreover," Livshits stressed, "it will not be  necessary to lay off the workers of an enterprise which  voluntarily declares itself bankrupt or to lock up its gates.    The president's 4-page message to the prime minister  envisages some long-term measures (circulation of bills and  reform of banks), as well as some short-term steps. Thereby,  Yeltsin assumes full responsibility for the second step of the  reform, including the riddance of the Russian economy of  inefficient enterprises.</p>

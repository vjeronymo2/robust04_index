The National Police  report the explosion inflicted damage at the Guatemala-Norte  station, east of Guatemala City, which distributes electricity  from the Chixoy hydroelectric plant.    The terrorist act caused traffic jams in various parts of  the  city with traffic lights going out. Meanwhile, authorities from  the National Electric Institute are working to restore power.  The incident occurred 72 hours prior to the vote on a referendum  to approve or reject 37 constitutional reforms.    In addition, military sources reported that Guatemalan Army  troops sustained five casualties when they clashed with a column  of the Revolutionary Organization of the Peoples in Arms (ORPA)  at La Igualdad farm in La Reforma.    Soldier Julio Lopez Chavez told NOTIMEX that at 1300 the 1st  and 3d Companies of the San Marcos Detachment searched La  Igualdad farm, 280 km to the west of Guatemala City, where the  guerrillas mined the field. The two Army companies detected the  presence of the 15 ORPA rebels, who retreated to a very deep and  rocky area when they noticed they had been discovered.    The soldiers proceeded to comb the area in search of the  rebels. Two soldiers, Mauricio Hernandez Chun and Jose Pacual  Merlo, died when they activated a claymore mine. Three soldiers  were also injured by shrapnel from the mines. The soldiers'  bodies and the injured soldiers were transferred to Coatepeque  on the San Marcos Department border.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with "South Yemen Defense Minister" </F> Staff Major General Haytham Qasim Tahir in Aden by Salih Qallab  in Amman "last night"]    [Excerpts] [Qallab] Northern forces have made successes  on all axes, while your forces are still in a defensive  position. What are the real causes of that?    [Tahir] The other side, that is the ruling military regime  in Sanaa, prepared for the war a long time ago. And the  treacherous attacks on our units in the north were real  "rehearsals" for the war. Besides, the regime in Sanaa has  pushed all its army and tens of thousands of armed tribes loyal  to it and 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar [leader of the Yemeni  Reform Grouping], and all the state's human and material  resources into this war.    As for us, we have confronted this all-out war with modest  human and material resources. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation in  the fighting against you, but you have failed to prove it  through POW's, equipment, or anything else...?    [Tahir] There is no doubt at all about the participation of  Iraq, Sudan, and other states in the war alongside the ruling  military regime in Sanaa. There are Iraqi military personnel  and soldiers fighting alongside northern forces. A number of  them were arrested on the Shabwah axis, and the media covered  this issue then, with both sound and picture.    I can confirm to you that the war launched against us is run  from A to Z by Iraqi experts. Sudan too is participating in the  war directly or indirectly, proceeding from the alliance  declared between the two regimes in Sanaa and Khartoum -- the  alliance in which extremists are playing the major and crucial  part.    The "Afghan Arabs" group is also participating in this war  alongside northern forces. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Is it true that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih wanted to  capture Aden, or did he put pressure on this front to keep your  forces there in order to seize the oil area in Shabwah?    [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to capture  Aden or occupy the oil area in Shabwah. All he has done is  inflict further destruction and ruin on Yemen, killing more  innocent women, children, and elderly and destroying the  northern and southern armies. And the days have proved since  the fighting broke out on 27 April that this war is a losing war  in which there is no victor, and certainly it will backfire on  those who ignited it.    [Qallab] The northerners accuse you of receiving military  aid from some neighboring states. What truth is there in these  accusations?    [Tahir] These accusations are designed for the media and to  divert attention from the aid the other side is receiving from a  number of states. Media and diplomatic sources abroad have on  several occasions revealed the names of these states. [passage  omitted]    [Qallab] As is known, you are using Soviet and eastern  weapons in general. How you have been able to sort matters out  during the war, especially with regard to spare parts?    [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend  ourselves and the sovereignty of our state.    [Qallab] If a cease-fire is announced, how will the issue of  the land seized from the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY]  during the war be tackled?    [Tahir] The cease-fire issue is no longer a Yemeni affair.  It is now an international affair in accordance with Security  Council Resolution 924, which was adopted only after 'Ali  'Abdallah's refusal to respond to the voice of reason and logic  and all Arab initiatives and appeals to halt this war, whose  only aim is to kill and destroy.    We presented an initiative to form a team of international  observers to watch and implement the cease-fire and withdraw  northern forces to their previous positions before the fighting  broke out. I would like here to stress that we will not abandon  a single inch of the DRY's territory. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] As defense minister of the Republic of Yemen who  knows a great deal, which is really the quarter planning and  leading northern operations?    [Tahir] I was defense minister of the Republic of Yemen. I  am now defense minister of the DRY. And I know that the  military regime in Sanaa planned a long time ago for this  criminal all-out war against our people in the DRY. I also know  that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers and Iraqi military experts  planned and led the military operations against our people. But  their plans have failed or at least have not been implemented  according to plan. That is with the exception of inflicting  further human losses and destroying the economic structure of  both parts of Yemen, south and north. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you to  declare a state in Hadhramaut, make Aden a free zone, and annex  the governorates seized by northern forces to the north?    [Tahir] There is no doubt about that. And when the regime  in Sanaa talks about legitimacy and unity, it does so for overt  media and political consumption. But I stress to you that our  people will fight bravely and valiantly to defend every inch of  the DRY's territory.    [Qallab] What unity formula would you accept after the  failure of the previous formula, which led to this devastating  war?    [Tahir] It is difficult to talk about any form of unity with  the Sanaa military regime, which slaughtered unity and wanted to  annihilate our people, occupy their land, attack their honor,  and plunder their money and resources.

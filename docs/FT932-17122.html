			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Check urged on low audit fees AUDITORS who undercut their competitors' prices will have to prove that they have complied with professional standards under new draft ethical rules. Those indulging in 'predatory pricing' or 'lowballing' - quoting fees substantially lower than those of other firms - must ensure that the client has a full description of the services to be covered and the basis on which the fee will be determined for current and future years. The details come in draft guidelines from the chartered accountants' joint ethics committee, which covers the professional bodies in the UK and Ireland. A consultation process started last summer after concern about a number of high-profile cases in which auditors had won tenders at substantially lower rates than the existing audit fee. These included Price Waterhouse's successful bid for the Prudential audit, which appeared to reduce the audit fee by more than Pounds 900,000, although it later emerged that three other large audit firms had tendered similar bids. The joint ethics committee stopped short of introducing restrictions on the levels of audit fees charged. 'We decided not to muck about with the market,' said Mr Jock Worsley, its chairman. The consultation prior to the draft paper showed little evidence that undercutting led to lower standards, nor that reduced fees discouraged firms from conducting research and technical development. It did highlight the fact that low fee quotations might result from more efficient use of staff or other management actions.</p>

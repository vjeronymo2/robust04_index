			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 NORTHRIDGE TEENS ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF PACOIMA PASTOR  </P> <P> Two teen-agers were in jail this morning after their arrests in the shooting  death of a Pacoima pastor who police said was gunned down in his Chatsworth  home during a dispute over a minor traffic accident.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said Dana L. Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, both of  Northridge, were arrested on suspicion of murder Tuesday afternoon, two days  after the body of Carl White, 54, was found on the floor of his home in the  20100 block of Citronia Avenue.  </P> <P> White was pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, a storefront church on Van  Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima with a handful of members. White was also a house  painter and a driver for the handicapped.  </P> <P> Detective Michael Brandt said investigators found recent damage to the rear of  White's car and learned from other evidence that he had been in a minor  accident Friday night. Further investigation of the accident led to the  suspects.  </P> <P> "It's all based on a minor traffic accident," Brandt said. "There is absolutely  no rhyme or reason to it."  </P></p>

The collection of public comments began immediately after President Clinton formally called for the 1995 WHCoA in February 1994. Special emphasis has been placed on soliciting suggestions and ideas from a wide range of sources_especially from the grassroots. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Input received from a variety of local, state, regional and national events conducted on behalf of the WHCoA over the past several months points toward an agenda which goes beyond traditional boundaries and paints a broader picture of aging_an agenda that looks at the present and the future. This Conference should examine a wide range of issues, including the needs and contributions of today's and tomorrow's older citizens. This far-reaching examination is evident in the broad support which has emerged for a theme and issues which incorporate the generational aspects of aging. Congress also included the generational issue in the statute by mandating that the Conference look at the interdependence of generations, the contributions of older individuals to societal well-being and the commonality of problems facing both older and younger individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial suggestions from the grassroots for Conference themes and agenda issues have been used by the Policy Committee to develop the proposed agenda for the 1995 WHCoA. Over 400 pre-conference events have been held around the country to develop policy recommendations for building the agenda for the Conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part I.

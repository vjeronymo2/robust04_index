			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Italy faces Pounds 13.3bn extra pension bill The Berlusconi government is studying ways to respond to a constitutional court decision that would add L30,000bn (Pounds 13.4bn)to this year's spending on pensions. The estimate by Mr Clementi Mastella, the Labour Minister, follows a decision to repay some arrears back to 1983. The announcement led to an immediate fall in Italian government bond prices. If the amount has to be paid in full, it would have a serious effect on public finances and undermine calculations both about the need for a pre-summer mini-budget and for the preparation of the 1995 budget. Last Friday the constitutional court ruled on a long-standing case brought by pensioners who claimed to have been denied proper state pensions dating back to 1983. In that year, the government sought to reduce the benefits available to people who had been able to obtain full pensions, even though they had not made the necessary financial contributions. The court ruling obliges the government to make good the difference between the reduced benefits and the full pension entitlement denied as of 1983. As many as 600,000 people could be involved. Initially it was thought the one-off cost of funding arrears would be L6,000bn. But over the weekend the estimates were revised sharply upwards. It is also thought the additional annual burden after the payment of arrears would be more than L600bn. The court's decision is a further example of how over recent years the courts have given favourable interpretations to actions brought in defence of pensions, so helping to make Italy's state-run system the most costly and deficit-ridden in Europe. The government will find it difficult to circumvent the ruling. The decision comes as economy ministers are weighing the need for a mini-budget before the summer recess to hold the public sector deficit to about L154,000bn. This compares with the original estimate of L145,000bn, equivalent to 8.7 percent of GDP. The previous Ciampi government had indicated a mini-budget was needed to find some L7,000bn to L10,000bn in a combination of spending cuts and extra revenues. However, Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, said yesterday he believed the mini-budget need raise no more than L5,000bn. But there are those within the cabinet who want to avoid a mini-budget altogether, to encourage the timid recovery and concentrate efforts on the 1995 budget. If the government has to pay the pension arrears, then a mini-budget would be inevitable. Given prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's aversion to raising taxes, he would rely mainly on spending cuts. The court ruling has highlighted once again the need for Italy to curb the mounting deficit in its generous state pensions scheme and to shift the burden on to pension funds.</p>

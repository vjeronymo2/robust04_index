			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Mexican candidate injured in crash The main leftist opposition party in Mexico has demanded a meticulous investigation of a road accident that left its candidate for governor in the southern state of Chiapas seriously injured, and three of his colleagues dead. Mr Amando Avendano, of the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), was reported to be in a serious condition after his car had collided with a lorry on Monday morning. He has a punctured lung, broken ribs and facial and neck injuries, but was reported to be conscious. Mr Avendano's wife said that she believed the crash had been planned and was part of a campaign against the movement for peace in Chiapas. Mr Avendano, an editor of a local newspaper in the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, has been attacked by local ranchers and other landlords for his good relations with the Zapatista rebels who began an insurrection in Chiapas on January 1. The PRD candidate was on his way to the state capital for a breakfast with candidates from other parties. The lorry that hit his car was driven on the wrong side of the road and had no number plate. Its driver fled soon afterwards, apparently unharmed. The state attorney-general, believing that the accident was caused by the lorry being driven too fast around a corner, insisted that there was no indication of the crash having been planned. However, he promised an 'honest, clear and transparent' investigation. The lorry driver has been identified. The crash has raised fears of further instability in the state of Chiapas, before the Mexican presidential election and the state election on August 21. Zapatista rebels control a small part of the state and are planning to hold a 'convention for democracy' early next month. The PRD has agreed to send observers.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CRISIS  </P> <P> I refer to your editorial "Answering a Distress Call," March 2.  </P> <P> I go to a county mental health clinic in San Diego County. I see a psychiatrist  for 15 minutes every six weeks. I take medicine. I believe that the homeless  mentally ill should be placed in state hospitals until they can be placed on  SSI and in a board-and-care home, or by themselves, or with their families.  </P> <P> As a former mentally ill person, I was glad to get the shelter, food and  medicine at a state hospital. It costs about $4,000 a month per person to be in  a state hospital. It costs about $1,000 a month per person to be on SSI,  Medi-Cal and live in the community.  </P> <P> I am a pen pal with mental patients all over the country. Most of them are  doing well. Many of them work full-time. I'm sure the police do take many  mentally ill people to local hospitals which then ship them to the state  hospitals until they can be placed. This happened to me in 1984. Please lobby  for the hospitalization of the homeless mentally ill. The state should build  new state hospitals.  </P> <P> TERRY CORDOBA  </P> <P> San Marcos  </P></p>

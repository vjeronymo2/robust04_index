			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Korea concedes over telecoms THE CLINTON administration this week demonstrated the tough stance officials have been threatening when US trading partners fail to keep trade agreements. In reviewing a 1992 agreement with Korea over telecommunications, they discovered that Korea had failed to institute, as promised, 'a completely transparent and non-discriminatory procurement system' for Korea Telecom, the monopoly telephone company, and that it only made public regulations which were no longer applicable. Furthermore, US telecommunications companies, having been promised a fair opportunity to bid on government contracts, were facing a complete exclusion from the market for network switching. During two days of talks from Tuesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, backed by the entire administration, threatened to cite Korea for violating a trade agreement and to announce sanctions. 'Korea said it would rectify the situation,' he said in a press briefing. 'It will make public all relevant regulations, and it guaranteed there will be no delay in publishing regulations in future.' Promising again not to discriminate, Korea has now put AT&amp;T of the US on the list of companies qualified to bid for a contract worth at least Dollars 30m. He said the US also would insist that Japan honour agreements made last year to increase the purchase of US motor vehicle parts and raise the domestic content of vehicles produced by Japanese companies in the US to 70 per cent. Japanese officials are portraying the agreements as between US and Japanese companies, and therefore not binding on the respective governments.</p>

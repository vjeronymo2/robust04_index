			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Exports to lead modest upturn, CBI says BRITAIN CAN expect a modest recovery from recession, led by manufacturing output and exports, the Confederation of British Industry says. The CBI predicts in its latest forecast for the UK economy that gross domestic product will increase by a real 1.4 per cent this year. This compares with the 0.7 per cent growth forecast in November and the 1.25 per cent growth forecast by the Treasury in last week's Budget. Output is expected to rise by 2.4 per cent next year - broadly in line with the CBI's earlier forecast of 2.3 per cent growth. The recovery will be insufficient, however, to prevent seasonally adjusted unemployment rising to more than 3m at the end of this quarter. The CBI expects unemployment to reach 3.1m, or 11.2 per cent of the working population, by the end of this year and rise more slowly to 3.15m, or 11.3 per cent, by the end of next year. Mr Sudhir Junankar, the head of the CBI's forecasting team, said that there were encouraging signs in the UK economy although it was not yet time 'to crack open the champagne'. Consumer spending and investment held up better than expected in the final quarter of last year, while the latest evidence pointed to a strengthening of retail sales volumes and higher export demand following sterling's depreciation. Mr Junankar said that North Sea oil production was also expected to be higher this year, adding about 0.3 points to economic growth. The CBI forecast that manufacturing output will rise faster than the economy as a whole over the next two years, with growth of 1.6 per cent in 1993 and 2.8 per cent in 1994. The tax increases announced in Budget are expected to hold back growth in consumer spending when most of them take effect next year. Exports of goods and services are forecast to increase at above-average rates of 4.7 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in next year. Imports are expected to grow more slowly than exports but the growth of import volumes is expected to outpace domestic demand. The CBI says the UK current account will continue to deteriorate, with the deficit widening to Pounds 18.6bn in 1994 from Pounds 17.5bn this year and Pounds 11.9bn in 1992. The CBI estimates the growth of world trade in manufactured goods at 1.6 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year after 2.1 per cent last year. Last week's Treasury Red Book projects trade growth of 4.25 per cent this year and 5.75 per cent at an annual rate in the first half of next year, after 4.5 per cent last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE CBI VIEWS ECONOMIC PROSPECTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % change on previous year outturns                                    CSO data             CBI forecasts                                      1992            1993          1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total GDP (output measure)           -0.5             1.4           2.4 of which: manufacturing              -0.8             1.6           2.8 Consumers' expenditure                0.2             1.2           1.9 Fixed investment                     -0.6            -0.4           2.4 of which:   general government (1)             12.0             4.6           2.9   manufacturing (2)                  -3.2             4.4           1.5   private dwellings                  -1.9            -1.9           1.4   other (mainly private services)    -2.9            -2.7          -2.6 General government consumption       -0.2             0.2           0.5 Exports (goods and services)          1.9             4.7           5.5 Imports (goods and services)          5.1             2.8           3.9 Current account (Pounds bn) (3)     -11.9           -17.5         -18.6 Stockbuilding (Pounds bn)            -1.3            -0.4           0.3 Inflation (retail prices index) (4)   3.0             1.6           4.0 Inflation (manufacturer's output   prices) (4)                         3.3             3.5           3.4 Unemployment (millions) (5,6)         2.8             3.1           3.1 Company profits (7)                  -4.0            -0.1           2.9 PSBR (Pounds bn) (3)         1992-93 34.8    1993-94 48.2  1994-95 43.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Footnotes (1) excluding purchases less sales of land and existing buildings (2) including leased assets (3) at current prices (4) quarter four (5) UK, excluding school leavers, seasonally adjusted (6) annual average (7) gross pre-tax trading profits of industrial and commercial     companies, net of stock appreciation and excluding North Sea oil,     and adjusted for inflation as measured by the GDP deflator  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

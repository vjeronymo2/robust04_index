At the session, attended by Grand Prince Roland-Hovsep I, an  appeal was issued to all Armenian political parties, religious,  political, cultural and public organizations and businessmen.  The participants also endorsed the bylaws of the Court of  Ancient Armenian Princes. The bylaws will soon be submitted to  Armenia's Ministry of Justice, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and  the Kingdom of Western Armenia [as published] for registration.

The members of the Court pledge to trust, to be  loyal and to be subject to His Excellency and elect him, on an  inheritance basis, as the head of the Court of the Ancient  Armenian Princes."

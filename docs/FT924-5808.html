			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Shell to cut 500 jobs at refinery SHELL UK is to shed 500 of the 1,850 jobs at its Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the fifth-largest of Shell's 53 oil refineries worldwide. The company said an efficiency study had found overstaffing and inefficient working patterns. The cuts were necessary to secure a viable future for the plant, which was built in 1922. Shell said the financial and trading climate for its refinery operations was 'extremely difficult'. Stanlow was making only a 2 per cent return on capital invested. Europe is suffering widespread overcapacity in oil refining and petrochemicals production and the recession has damped demand. The Stanlow management is looking to improve efficiency by broadening skills in key jobs and giving more responsibility to individuals. Shell is meeting union representatives today to explain the job cuts and the plans for new working patterns. The company said it would offer substantial redundancy packages, but some compulsory redundancies would be inevitable. The jobs will be cut by the middle of next year from all sections of employees. In addition to job cuts, Stanlow faces the high cost of modernising some of its older plant. The refinery has recently announced spending of Pounds 35m on environmental equipment. Shell is conducting a strategic review of its downstream operations as the market remains severely depressed.</p>

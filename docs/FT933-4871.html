			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): UK loan scheme basks in popularity - In A Nutshell Changes to the UK government's loan guarantee scheme have led to a sharp increase in the number of loans granted and a strong demand for loans at the highest permitted level of Pounds 250,000. There was a near three-fold increase in the value of loans granted to Pounds 21.7m in July and August compared with the same period of 1992, while the number of loans rose by 18 per cent to 430. Nine of the loans were for the maximum amount of Pounds 250,000 (the new top rate for established businesses) while a further 37 were for loans of between Pounds 100,000 (the previous maximum) and Pounds 250,000. Apart from increasing the amount that can be lent under the scheme from July 1, the guarantee cover for established businesses was raised from 70 to 85 per cent. The guarantee premiums were also cut.</p>

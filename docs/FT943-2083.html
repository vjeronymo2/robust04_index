			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Jane Austen adapted for the stage - 'Emma' Dickens translates well to the stage, Jane Austen does not. One jostles us with a teeming kaleidoscope of places, people and events of almost grotesque vividness, the other, as Charlotte Bronte disdainfully observed in a brilliantly wrong-headed piece of criticism, is a Chinese miniaturist. The narrator's ironic tone is all. Present the plot of an Austen novel as a series of happenings, even with the help of the author's dialogue, and an element is missing. Mike Alfreds' production of Emma for the Cambridge Theatre Company recognises the danger. As director-adaptor Alfreds seeks to remedy this not so much through the occasional sound-track narration as with ironic devices all the stage's own. Paul Dart's light set is paved with a Greek-revival pattern inscribed with such Austenesque concepts as 'genteel address', 'principle', 'conversation', 'manners' - as well as such vices as 'folly'. Inscriptions appear, too, as a sort of surtitle, on the back wall, setting the scene or commenting: 'Marriage - a Grim Era', 'The Countryside - No City Dust Here' and 'Night Waned - the Dawning'. Crossword addicts will detect the anagrams. Ultimately the play skims the novel's surface. This is in part due to Anne-Marie Duff in the title-role, as yet lacking the ability to chart Emma's sublime self-confidence and final chagrin, painfully achieving self-knowledge as she meddles with other people's lives for their own good and gets it all wrong. Emma should be stripped bare, as Walter Allen put it in The English Novel, but this slightly monotonous young woman has little to strip away. Like Juliet, the character needs to express youth, indeed callowness, leading to transfigured maturity. The actress ably suggests the bossy pushfulness that might have characterised the older Emma without her emotional come-uppance and own good sense; beyond that an all-purpose cheerfulness does not quite suggest the depth of Emma's involvement with others or her own ripening feelings. The production reflects the ripples on the pool of Jane Austen's society but fails to suggests the currents beneath. The appreciative Richmond audience laughed gently at the jokes, and there is much to enjoy in the fluid transformation of crate-like chests into furniture, carriages and even a grassy bank. At the moment not all the cast (including Emma) is audible or sufficiently pointed, though Carolyn Jones is funny and touching as humble, grateful, garrulous Miss Bates. Emma's father is reduced to a running gag about hypochondria which Michael Elwyn pleases the groundlings with mightily. Peter Hamilton Dyer's Mr Elton, the fortune-seeking curate, is a rounded individual, not a set of mannerisms which emphasise the Quality Street trap that Austen sets for actors. And everyone could do with lessons in voice projection from Celia Bannerman who brightened your critic's youth with a huge-eyed, heavy-lidded Bennett girl in a television Pride and Prejudice. Her Mrs Weston is still radiant and good-humoured, which is more than can be said for her admirer after all these years.</p>

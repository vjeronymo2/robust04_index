Dimitri Kljuev keeps calm.  He stands by the red phone, his eyes glued to the control  panel, which shows a leak in the first circuit -- in the reactor  area. As Kola reactor block IV shift supervisor, he gives brief  instructions. In a short time the 440-megawatt plant is back  under control. Kljuev and his six colleagues take a break.  "Tomorrow we really get down to business," says the Russian  nuclear engineer.    Peter Reibert, who is in charge of the Greifswald nuclear  power station training center's 25 computers, will be giving  Kljuev and his colleagues something to sweat about. In an  inconspicuous- looking building, CAG, an offshoot of the former  Greifswald nuclear power station, simulates the nightmare of  many an environment policymaker: "Our program embraces  everything, from a measuring instrument breakdown right up to  the worst emergency scenarios."    The team from the Russian island of Kola will spend three  weeks in front of the operating panel, where they feel quite at  home: The control room is identical to their Russian model, and  all the reactor reactions are simulated in real time. The  crucial difference is that Greifswald stores almost 150 standard  accidents to which WWER-213 reactors have succumbed, whether  they have occurred in the Ukraine, Bulgaria, or Hungary. "We  train for emergencies here," says Reibert. Every move that the  operating personnel makes is recorded on camera and discussed.  When necessary, critical situations can be repeated and  analyzed.    The simulator in Greifswald was originally intended for  in-house use, training personnel for the local nuclear power  station in GDR days. When the reactor was shut down for safety  reasons after unification, the simulator was retained, and the  Federal Environment Ministry has been financing additional  training for eastern European nuclear engineers there to the  tune of about 2 million German marks a year since 1992. More  than 20 reactor crews have taken the three- week crash course to  date.    There are over 40 plants in the WWER class -- not to be  confused with the Chernobyl type -- in eastern Europe; the low  level of training, in the former Soviet Union in particular, is  scandalous. Moscow had all the know-how for handling atomic  plants, but the collapse of the USSR brought a split in  responsibility for atomic piles as well. "New states, such as  the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Lithuania are now cut off from the  brains of the nuclear industry and left on their own with their  reactors," says Bernd Mueller, head of CAG.    This notwithstanding, none of these states is keen to forego  the use of nuclear power. The reactors -- none of which meets  western safety standards -- are still running. "A further drop  in standards is only to be expected," says Reibert. Skilled  staff are emigrating as well. In the Ukraine, for instance,  some plants can only run five shifts instead of the normal  seven, while the Russians have withdrawn all their technicians  from some reactors in Kazakhstan. There are hardly any  facilities for training reinforcements. Training takes place on  the job, and knowledge is often handed down by word of mouth,  the "elders" passing their experience on to the younger  generation. When they arrive in Greifswald and confront the  entire accident potential inherent in the plants where they  work, it is a nerve-racking experience. "After four or five  hours' constant stress, we give them the afternoon off,  otherwise it's too much for them," says trainer Reibert.</p>

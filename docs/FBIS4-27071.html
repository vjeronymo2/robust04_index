			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial labor department, industrial and  commercial administration, tax bureau, and trade union council  recently drew up a regulation to call for application of the  old-age insurance system extensively to the staff members and  workers of the urban collective enterprises below the county  level, those of private enterprises, and self-employed laborers  within a year.    The regulation states: The old-age insurance system should  be applied to all the staff members and workers of the urban  collective enterprises below the county level, those of private  enterprises, and self-employed laborers. These staff members  and workers and self-employed laborers, aged 60 or over in the  case of males and aged 50 or over in the case of females, who  have paid the basic old-age insurance premiums for five years or  more will be able to enjoy the basic old-age pension, subsidies  for medical expenses and funerals, and pension or relief funds  for supporting dependents. The basic old-age pension is made up  of two parts. One is a fixed percentage of the average monthly  wage of the province in the year before the staff members and  workers are retired. Those who have paid the insurance premiums  for 15 years or more will be paid 25 percent of the average  monthly wage; those who have paid the insurance premiums for 10  to 14 years will be paid 20 percent; and those who have paid the  insurance premium for 5 to 9 years will be paid 15 percent. The  other is 1.4 percent of the average monthly wage based on which  the premium is paid for every year of the period when the  insurance premiums are paid. The basic retirement pension will  be appropriately adjusted according to the average wage increase  of society in the preceding year so that the staff members and  workers can share the social development achievements.    Regarding the collection and management of the old-age  insurance funds, the regulation demands: The basic insurance  premiums paid by units should be no less than 18 percent of the  total payroll, and individuals should pay 2 percent of their  actual monthly income every month. The old-age insurance funds  should be deposited in the special bank accounts and used as  insurance funds only. No tax, fee, or funds should be charged  from them. The basic old-age insurance premiums paid by units  and individuals are recorded in the unified "workers' old-age  insurance booklets" of the country, which will be transferred  when staff members and workers are transferred, and the length  of payment before and after the transfer will be calculated  together.</p>

Reports were made by the chief secretaries of the provincial  and municipal committees of the Workers' Party of Korea who are  concurrently chairmen of the people's committees, to be followed  by speeches.    The reporters and speakers stressed that the historic letter  of President Kim Il-song to the national agricultural conference  is a programmatic guideline clearly indicating the road of  consolidating Korean-style socialism, powerfully demonstrating  its force and finally solving the socialist rural question.    They said all the agricultural working people should be  prepared more firmly in ideology and morality and in technique  and culture as required by socialism through the development of  the ideological and cultural revolutions in depth.    They stressed the need to steadily raise the level of the  industrialization and modernization of agriculture by expanding  the achievements in the rural technical revolution and  successfully carry out the work of converting cooperative  property into all-people property.

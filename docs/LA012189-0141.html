			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTNUCLEAR GETS OK TO SELL BEER BUT FACES APPEAL  </P> <P> Club Postnuclear has cleared one government hurdle in its effort to win  permission to sell beer. But it will have to answer further objections from  Laguna Beach officials who question whether the new rock nightclub should be  allowed to abandon its no-alcohol policy.  </P> <P> By a 3-2 vote Thursday night, the city Board of Adjustment gave club owner  William (Max) Nee the OK to sell beer at Postnuclear, which opened in July at  775 Laguna Canyon Road. But Councilman Dan Kenney said Friday that he will  appeal the board's decision -- which means, under city law, that the City  Council will have the final say.  </P> <P> "When Postnuclear was originally approved, the council was given assurances  that alcoholic beverages would not be served ever," Kenney said. "I have strong  reservations about a place that allows 18-year-olds inside and is serving  alcohol. If he wants to serve alcohol, (admission) should be 21 and over as far  as I'm concerned."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Board of Adjustment set new conditions for the club's  operations, conditions Nee considers "very severe."  </P> <P> Concerned that people are drinking beer outside the club and littering the  area, the board ruled that Postnuclear's management must post a security guard  in the club parking lot to monitor any drinking and be responsible for cleaning  the lot every night.  </P> <P> The board ordered a hearing in 6 months to determine whether Postnuclear has  abided by those conditions.  </P> <P> These restrictions, said Nee, don't "leave us any margin for error. My feeling  is that we're (being held) responsible not only for our patrons after they  leave the premises, but for anyone who decided they would like to drink beer in  their car" outside the club. "My concern is that if (city officials) come down  and see a problem, they can close my place down."  </P> <P> Under the permit approved by the board, the club can operate 7 days a week from  7 a.m. to 2 a.m., and can sell beer from 6 p.m. until closing. Only those 18 or  older may be admitted, and patrons who want to drink beer would have to produce  two forms of identification. (Beer-drinkers would be given a hospital-type  wristband.)  </P> <P> Board members Cynthia Love, Salvatore Maddi and Ann McDonald voted in favor of  the permit, while board chairman Jeffrey Powers and Barbara Metzger were  opposed. Nee said that the only public comment on his proposal at a hearing  earlier this month had been favorable: Robert Bartlett, owner of an adjacent  shopping center, had told the board that allowing Postnuclear to sell beer  could curtail littering outside the club.  </P> <P> Nee, who argued his own case before the Board of Adjustment, said he will  probably hire a lawyer to represent him in the as-yet unscheduled appeal  hearing before the City Council.  </P></p>

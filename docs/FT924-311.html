			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / MMI agrees deal with Zurich Insurance ZURICH Insurance yesterday announced that it had agreed in priciple to take over a large part of the business of Municipal Mutual Insurance, the troubled specialist in policies for local authorities, after months of talks. Under the deal, Zurich Insurance will acquire MMI's local authority liability business, personal insurance policies and a range of commercial insurance business. Zurich is also likely to employ about 1,800 of MMI's 2,000 staff. The agreement follows prolonged negotiations between the two companies, starting in October. Zurich was reluctant to assume liabilities on policies already underwritten by MMI, which used to insure 90 per cent of local authorities. Zurich is not thought to be taking financial responsibility for MMI's past liabilities but is taking on the administration of past liabilities with current business, using the staff and assets that will transfer from MMI. Zurich said that MMI policyholders would be offered renewal terms. It said it would employ all MMI staff directly involved in the business being transferred, as well as all relevant systems such as computers and working assets. Zurich said that the companies anticipated finalising contracts in January subject to final board and regulatory approval. MMI said that employees of both companies had already been briefed on the agreement, and said it was pleased that the central administrative core of the company had not had to be broken up. An agreement had been widely expected after Zurich offered new facilities in November to 300 local authorities whose policies were coming up for renewal. It also offered fresh cover to about 31,000 individual MMI policyholders. The deal will be an important step for Zurich Insurance towards its target of expanding significantly in Britain. In 1990 its share of the British non-life insurance market was 1.1 per cent and it ranked 20th by size, but it was the third biggest life insurer in Europe last year. MMI withdrew from the insurance market in September, leaving a number of local authorities without cover. This followed the breakdown of earlier rescue talks with La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires, the French insurer. The company first encountered trouble last year when it had losses of more than Pounds 250m on its liability business. It was affected by claims over fires in schools, as well as potential claims from former occupants of children's homes, which led to it breaching the DTI's solvency guidelines.</p>

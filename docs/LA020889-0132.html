			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> ALL 144 FEARED DEAD IN AZORES CRASH OF U.S. JET  </P> <P> An American charter jet filled with Italian tourists slammed into a fog-covered  mountain in the Azores today and exploded, and all 144 people on board were  believed dead, officials and news reports said.  </P> <P> Maria Della Versesi, a spokeswoman at the Italian Embassy in Lisbon, said all  137 passengers were Italian and the seven crew members American. She did not  release any names.  </P> <P> The aircraft belonged to the U.S. airline Independent Air Corp., based in  Smyrna, Tenn. The flight originated in Bergamo, Italy, and was to have  proceeded to Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica  after a refueling stop in the Azores.  </P> <P> The Portuguese news agency LUSA quoted an official from the Azores Civil  Protection Service as saying that about 50 bodies had been recovered and that  it appeared all on board died.  </P> <P> Afonso Pimentel, a LUSA reporter based in the Azores, said the Boeing 707 was  preparing to land at Santa Maria airport when it crashed into Pico Alto, a  fog-covered, 1,794-foot-high mountain, and burst into flames.  </P> <P> The civil protection official told LUSA that the pilot had asked the airport to  clear a runway for an emergency landing.  </P> <P> Asked if there were any other radio messages or warnings before the plane went  down, Gualder Cordero, the Santa Maria Airport dispatcher, replied, "No, no, no  no."  </P> <P> A. L. Pittman, president of Independent Air Corp., said the 15-year-old company  makes 400 to 500 charter flights a year, mostly in the Caribbean and Europe.  Pittman, who declined to identify the seven American crew members, said the  20-year-old jetliner that crashed had a relatively low number of flight hours  and no history of trouble.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Denmark There will be a lot of red faces in financial markets, and probably some red ink as well, if Danish voters reject the Maastricht treaty in today's referendum. In theory a Yes vote would be a tonic for bond markets on the edges of Europe's inner monetary core. With the Maastricht treaty back on the rails there should be nothing to stop their yields converging with those in Germany. With the exception of the Danish market itself, though, much of this has already been anticipated. Ten-year French yields, for example, are only around 35 basis points higher than those in Germany. Since a Yes vote would allow Denmark to reduce its artificially high short-term interest rates, there should be room for strong gains in short Danish bonds, which currently yield around a full point more than their German equivalent. The more awkward question concerns the impact on the German bond market. A Yes vote in Denmark would finally deprive the D-Mark of pretension to safe haven status. The German bond market would thus, once again, have to be judged on its fundamentals. These include a relatively high inflation rate, a large budget deficit which has resisted control, as well as a deepening recession accompanied by cuts in short-term rates and a weaker currency. That is no recipe for falling long-term yields.</p>

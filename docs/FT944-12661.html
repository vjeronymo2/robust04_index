			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / India aims to curb currency inflows India has ordered companies raising funds on international capital markets to keep the money abroad until it is needed for specific projects, in a move designed to curb a huge foreign currency flow into the country. Groups will also be banned from issuing warrants, instruments which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price at a future date, to increase the authorities' control over Euro-issues. The policy announced at the weekend comes after an unprecedented surge in India's foreign exchange reserves from about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 617m) at the time of the 1991 balance of payments crisis to Dollars 19bn. The inflow has been primarily caused by foreign fund managers investing funds in the Indian stock market and in the overseas stock and bond issues of Indian companies. While the reserves, covering the cost of nine months' imports, have given India a valuable cushion against shocks in oil and other international markets, the rush of money into India has fuelled domestic inflation. The annual rate of increases in wholesale prices has fallen from a high of about 11 per cent earlier this year to 9 per cent, but the finance ministry wants it below 7 per cent. Indian companies, which raised Dollars 1.4bn in the year to March from international equity offerings, have collected a further Dollars 1.1bn in the first six months of the 1994-95 financial year. Applications for issues worth another Dollars 5bn are waiting for government approval. A finance ministry official said the new rules would enable India to manage its balance of payments more easily. A senior official said the country was importing inflation through the sustained inflow of foreign exchange from Euromarket issues. In future a sudden rush of issues would no longer affect the foreign exchange accounts. The ministry, which approves issues under guidelines established in May, said companies would be required to submit quarterly audited statements on their Euro-issues and the uses to which the funds were being put. This is to prevent money being diverted for unauthorised purposes such as financial market investment. As for the ban on warrants, officials said the restriction was being imposed because tight rules had recently been established on the domestic issue of warrants to prevent business families, which control many Indian companies, issuing warrants to themselves at low prices. The ban on overseas warrant issues would prevent companies circumventing the domestic rules, said the officials. In a separate measure, the ministry relaxed a ban on financial institutions tapping the international markets, giving long-term development banks the right to make issues. India plans further to ease foreign currency dealing rules and cut more of the red tape that has deterred some foreign investors, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'We may introduce new products for dealers to manage their foreign exchange risk,' Mr OP Sodhani, executive director of the Reserve Bank of India, said, mentioning cross-currency options as the broad area in which changes were desirable. India switched to market-based foreign exchange dealings in 1992 by making the rupee fully convertible on the trade account under a three-year-old economic reform programme. See capital markets</p>

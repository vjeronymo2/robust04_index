			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS WOMAN, 90, HOLDS BURGLAR AT GUNPOINT UNTIL POLICE ARRIVE  </P> <P> Ninety-year-old Gena Scarbrough said she learned how to shoot when growing up  on a farm but had never pointed a weapon at anyone until this week, when she  stopped a burglar with a borrowed pistol.  </P> <P> Police say Scarbrough stood in her carport Tuesday night waiting for an  intruder to leave the house.  </P> <P> When the burglar climbed out a window carrying a stereo and speakers,  Scarbrough aimed the .22-caliber pistol at him.  </P> <P> "I told him: 'Put it down right there and don't move. Don't move or I'll  shoot,' " she said.  </P> <P> Scarbrough said she was not flustered and would have shot the burglar if he had  not cooperated. She held the intruder at gunpoint until policemen arrived  several minutes later.  </P> <P> "I'd determined he wasn't going to get away," she said. "He'd broken into my  property."  </P> <P> A tenant at the duplex owned by Scarbrough had called her to say that someone  was breaking into the other apartment.  </P> <P> After calling the police, Scarbrough hurried to the property. In her haste,  however, she forgot her shotgun.  </P> <P> But Tommie Barnes, 72, who notified her of the break-in, handed her the handgun  and was by her side when Scarbrough confronted the burglar.  </P> <P> Police officers arrested Manfredo Barrios, 33, in connection with the break-in.  </P> <P> A Dallas police spokesman criticized Scarbrough's action. "This is what we get  paid to do," Cpl. Ray Bilbrey said.  </P> <P> But Scarbrough, who sometimes listens to police scanners for entertainment,  said she thinks homeowners should know how to defend their property with a  firearm.  </P> <P> "I think everybody ought to have one," she said. "You can't always get the  police when you need them."  </P></p>

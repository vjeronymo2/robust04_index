			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Bronte country can go with the wind - Nigel Spivey suggests an unorthodox solution to the Haworth moors controversy A decade ago, the correct position for the liberal intellectual of London NW3 was clear enough. Support the Yorkshire coal miners; rally behind the time-honoured extraction of fossil fuels; defy the Thatcherite logic of pit closures. It was a cause both brave and easy to espouse. To the literary mind, it called up comfortingly noble images of gaunt men in hob-nailed boots gathering under great iron wheels, or women in shawls mashing tea by blackened cottage hearths. Futile, of course: if coal is not wanted, coal miners must pass away, whether Hampstead cherishes them or not. So the North gets the message. No-one wants fossil fuels, and in any case they cause holes in the atmosphere. Robbed of their collieries, the district councils of Lancashire and Yorkshire hit upon new schemes for lighting their streets and boiling their kettles. This is wind power. Hitherto the stuff of New Age dreamers in far-off parts of west Wales and Jutland, or schemes which got no further than the blueprints of crank utopians, wind power must have blown into the practical North on the wings of divine inspiration. What could be better? No shortage of breezes up on the moors; no shortage of under-subsidised hill farmers, ready to turn wind into brass; best of all, no shortage of right-on one-upmanship, as the grimy North shows the pure South what energy can be generated without a smidgin of uranium or mess. But what the councillors of Bradford and Calderdale reckoned without is the alternative map of England. This enjoys only minority acknowledgement, but that minority is articulate, noisy and influential. According to its preferred nomenclature, England is divided along the proprietorial lines of distinguished writers. So you could travel from Daphne du Maurier's Cornwall, progress to Hardy's Wessex; perhaps head up to Housman's Shropshire, and across to Bennett's Midlands; thence up through Lawrence's Nottingham and onwards to Wordsworth's Lakes. In the course of this journey, naturally, you would have to negotiate the Brontes' Yorkshire. The Brontes' Yorkshire. The passport for entry is to have read Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights; the objective of travelling there is to see the old family parsonage, home to the Bronte Society since 1927; perhaps seek out the site of Thrushcross Grange, or Lowood School, or the Haworth graveyard. But, above all, to cast your gaze across the same tussocked wilderness as met the eyes of Cathy and Heathcliff; watch the same plovers dip into the ling; inhale the same heady west wind. It is still a fair impetuous wind. And the crime of the local councils is to have tamed it into boiling kettles. Leafy Hampstead sprang into alliance with the Brontes' Yorkshire last week with a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, signed by 60 names. Admittedly, they are not homogeneously Hampstead: Iris Murdoch sits oddly with Cliff Richard, who (odder still) plans to be Heathcliff in a new London musical, and the coalition of Ted Hughes with Auberon Waugh is provoking. But these signatories are bound by the insistence that wind turbines shall not be erected within a 20-mile radius of Haworth (sorry, the Brontes' Haworth), because they constitute 'an assault upon our artistic and our literary heritage.' When utopian dreams of putting wind to work are turned into blasphemies against nature, one has to question the pieties behind this protest. It is an unusual conflict, in which the conservationists of the earth's atmosphere find themselves opposed by conservationists of a literary ambience. The reason is that in the secular society of modern intellectuals, the houses of great writers have supplanted saintly shrines as places of pilgrimage. Relics must be preserved, the landscape of worship maintained. Seeing is believing. We will not understand Wuthering Heights if we cannot roll our eyes across Emily's own moors. That must be the ultimate ground on which the protestors stand. Thus exposed, it reduces to a naive view of the human imagination. And it imposes a strictly Romantic definition upon beauty, whereby wilderness alone is chief of the muses. It would be interesting to learn how many of the protestors would consider retrospectively demolishing all the windmills of Suffolk - Constable's Suffolk - or indeed that unsightly water mill at Flatford. Or are such man-made intrusions acceptable once touched by the brush or pen of a genius? Here lies the only solution to this issue. Bradford council, which is hospitable to the creative spirit, must commission a work of art. It may be a poem, a novel or a grand painting; it may be a film, even a soap opera. An everyday tale of wind-farming folk: their trials, passions, couplings and bereavements. If it is done, and done well, I dare say we will look kindly upon the turbines of the West Riding.</p>

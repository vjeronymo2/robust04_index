			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Based upon FY 1991 data, the PRS for the P&hyph;DP showed that the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh for firm power, a transmission rate of $8.20/kW/year, a nonfirm transmission service rate of 1.50 mills/kWh, and a firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP of $4.10/kW/season would not provide sufficient revenues to pay the project costs within the prescribed time periods. The Ratesetting PRS indicates that a substantial rate adjustment for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service is required to meet revenue requirements for FY 1994 through the end of the study. Because the firm transmission service rate adjustments are substantial increases over the existing P&hyph;DP rates, and in response to customer requests and comments, Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisional P&hyph;DP rates filed with FERC have been updated from the rates originally proposed in the customer brochure and Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice dated May 8, 1992. The changes to the Ratesetting PRS are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Multiproject costs were updated through September 30, 1991. The PAO is heavily involved in the process of total quality improvement and has a Process Improvement Team (PIT) evaluating the multiproject cost process. This PIT is made up of representatives from Engineering, Operations, Budget, Finance, and Rates. Recommendations concerning an improved process are expected to be published and implemented (if approved) early in 1994. To the extent implemented recommendations make a change in multiproject cost allocations and in rates, changes will be reflected in subsequent rate processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Replacement and addition projections in the cost evaluation period were changed to incorporate ``The Engineering Ten-Year Construction and Replacement Plan'' dated July 1992 for the cost evaluation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Extraordinary costs were excluded from out years (FY 1998&hyph;2047) resulting in minor reductions in estimates of O&amp;M costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Future-year replacements in FY 1998&hyph;2047 are projected at the most current interest rate of 7.875 percent as compared to the FY 1991 interest rate of 8.50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Projections used in FY 1992 for O&amp;M, interest expense, and operating revenues were updated to FY 1992 actuals as stated in Western's and Reclamation's FY 1992 financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The proposed P-DP rates for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service were initially proposed as a single-step rate increase effective for a 5-year period beginning October 1, 1993. However, in response to customer comments, Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process. Step one of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates will become effective February 1, 1994. Step two of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates will become effective October 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The FY 1993 purchased power expense has been updated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

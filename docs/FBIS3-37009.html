Yuriy Dubinin, head of the Russian delegation to  negotiations with Ukraine, told Interfax: "It is still difficult  to make out what kind of decision on the START-I treaty the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine took on February 4, 1994, and why it  preferred not to immediately join the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons."    On Monday, Dubinin said in an interview with Interfax that  there were several moot points in the Ukrainian legislature's  resolution ratifying START-I. It is unclear, for example, what  proportion of the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine are to be  destroyed. "There hasn't been any more clarity since Monday,"  Dubinin said.    He said Russian-Ukrainian talks which took place in Kiev and  ended on Thursday had been held "in a good atmosphere and  produced positive results." In particular, agreement was  reached on a package of documents to provide for measures to  implement the Moscow January 14 accord between the presidents of  Russia, the United States and Ukraine, under which America is to  provide funds for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine  and their dismantling, while Ukraine is to receive compensation.    Dubinin declined to go into details about the results of the  Kiev negotiations, which, he said, had to be reported to  President Boris Yeltsin before being made public. "We hope the  drafts will be approved by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk and will help to find a final solution to the problem  of the nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory," he  said.    The Ukrainian delegation to the Kiev talks included Deputy  Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister Boris  Tarasyuk.</p>

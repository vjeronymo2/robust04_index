			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / EFA defence chiefs set for Madrid talks THE DEFENCE ministers of the four partner countries in the ailing Eurofighter consortium are expected to meet in Madrid on August 4, in an effort to persuade Germany not to pull out of the project, according to industry officials. Proposals for going ahead with a substantially cheaper version of the aircraft - at least as far as Germany is concerned - are likely to be discussed. Britain, Italy and Spain remain committed to the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, although all three defence ministers, who met in London last week, agreed they would also like to see significant savings. Spain in particular is understood to be sympathetic to the German position. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, says he wants to see an entirely different aircraft developed, more appropriate to the post-cold war security threat in the year 2000, if possible using the development funds committed to the EFA. Germany has so far spent some DM3bn (Pounds 1bn) out of total development funds allocated by Bonn of nearly DM6bn. Industry and defence ministry experts in the management agency with overall responsibility for the Eurofighter met in Munich last Thursday to discuss the state of the aircraft development programme, in the light of Germany's decision not to go ahead with full-scale production from 1993. According to a report in the Welt am Sonntag Sunday newspaper in Germany, they agreed that it would be possible to reduce the 'lifetime cost' of the aircraft by 25 per cent - from the current estimate of DM133.4m per aircraft, to just DM99.8m. This would be managed primarily by not installing some of the more sophisticated items and software. Although the details of the newspaper report could not be confirmed, the German defence ministry said a regular meeting of the Eurofighter management agency had taken place. However, it was a routine meeting without any special items on the agenda. He confirmed that Mr Ruhe was going to Madrid on August 4, but the purpose of the visit was to meet his Spanish counterpart, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, for a first bilateral exchange since he (Mr Ruhe) took office. It would be a brief visit but, if the other defence ministers were invited, he was happy to meet them.</p>

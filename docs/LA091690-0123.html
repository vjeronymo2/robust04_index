			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARINE'S SCORING TOSSES COMPLETE MOORPARK ROMP  </P> <P> The only problem with Del Marine's debut as Moorpark College quarterback is  that it does not leave Marine much room for improvement.  </P> <P> Marine, who didn't enter the game against East Los Angeles College on Saturday  night until the fourth quarter, could have played more, but how could he have  played better? He threw only two passes, both for touchdowns -- including a  54-yard strike to his brother Pete on his first pass as a Raider -- and  finished with 77 yards passing.  </P> <P> The two scoring passes provided the final touches to Moorpark's 38-3  nonconference victory at East L.A.  </P> <P> Moorpark led only 10-3 at halftime but scored four touchdowns in a little more  than 10 minutes at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth  to turn the game into a blowout.  </P> <P> "We sputtered in the first half,' Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said. 'We could  have got stung. I was getting a little bit worried."  </P> <P> Moorpark running backs Freddie Bradley and Jamal Anderson finished with 123 and  90 yards, respectively.  </P> <P> They didn't go through the East L.A. defense like a hot knife through butter --  more like a sledgehammer through butter.  </P> <P> "I thought they both played very well," Bittner said. "I thought all our backs  played well."  </P> <P> Moorpark finished with 260 yards on the ground and 151 through the air.  </P> <P> Bradley scored Moorpark's first touchdown of the second half when he shrugged  off the East L.A. defensive line on a three-yard run.  </P> <P> Moorpark scored late in the third quarter when John Corcoran picked off a  Santiago Alvarez pass in the right flat, returned it inside the East L.A.  20-yard line then tossed a lateral to James Jolicoeur, who ran for the  touchdown.  </P> <P> Marine's touchdown passes capped the scoring. Early in the fourth quarter,  Marine hit Pete on an out-and-up with a tight spiral for a 54-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> "The best thing about it was that I hit my brother," Marine said.  </P> <P> On Moorpark's next series, he threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Matt Young.  </P> <P> Alvarez completed 23 of 46 passes for 154 yards but had a pass intercepted by  Corcoran in the end zone in the first half.  </P> <P> Moorpark scored its first touchdown on its second possession of the game.  </P> <P> Starting quarterback Kris Dutra rifled a high pass into the end zone, and wide  receiver Curtis Marsh tipped it before cradling it for a 13-yard touchdown  reception.  </P> <P> Andrew Petroski added a 25-yard field goal on Moorpark's next possession, but  Moorpark was held scoreless for the remainder of the half.  </P></p>

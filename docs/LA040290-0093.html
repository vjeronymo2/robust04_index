			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROSS TOMPKINS ENHANCES COLE QUARTET AT VINE ST.  </P> <P> Jam session performances -- those instant, unrehearsed jazz get-togethers --  can be very good or very bad. Alto saxophonist Richie Cole's opening-night  program Thursday of a four-night run at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill fell  somewhere in between.  </P> <P> On the plus side, the presence of pianist Ross Tompkins, bassist Chuck  Berghofer and drummer John Guerin in the rhythm section brought some coherence  and structure to Cole's spontaneously chosen program of songs.  </P> <P> Tompkins' ability to create instant orchestrations in virtually everything he  plays was particularly helpful. Cole's peculiar decision, for example, to do "I  Can't Get Started" as a samba was successful largely because of the pianist's  structured approach to his accompaniment patterns. On "These Foolish Things,"  Tompkins made the rare choice -- in this era of multi-note improvising -- of  actually performing a ballad without instantly doubling the tempo.  </P> <P> Cole's playing was more problematic. In the opening few tunes, there was the  suggestion of an animated interaction between his saxophone and Tompkins' piano  that boded well for the set. But Cole soon abandoned the more subtle musical  linkages for detached, up-front, straight-ahead blowing.  </P> <P> His devil-take-the-hindmost technique was his most engaging quality, in part  because -- on this set, at least -- Cole's usually powerful emotional energy  seemed to be on slow burn. A high speed romp through "The White Cliffs of  Dover" best displayed his rapid articulation, and a set of variations on  Charlie Parker's "My Little Suede Shoes" hinted at the whimsy that can be one  of Cole's more appealing qualities.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

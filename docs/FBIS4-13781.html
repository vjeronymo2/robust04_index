He reiterated  Morocco's support for the Iraqi Government and people.    The Moroccan monarch asserted that Iraq has done all it is  required to do on both the Arab and international scenes, and  that there is no longer any justification for maintaining the  current state of affairs.    King Hassan II of Morocco asked Barzan al-Tikriti to relay  his greetings to His Excellency President Saddam Husayn.    The meeting was attended by Abdellatif Filali, Moroccan  minister of state for foreign affairs and cooperation; Abdelhadi  Boutaleb [name as received], adviser to King Hassan II; and the  Iraqi ambassador in Rabat.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 6 Apr (TANJUG)-- Joint forces of the army  of the Srpska republic this morning continued offensive actions  from the direction of Cajnice and Foca towards Drina in an  attempt to liberate Serb villages in the area of Podkozara, the  command of the Srpska army in Cajnice has announced.    The turnabout in fighting in the Gorazde, Foca, and Cajnice  triangle took place yesterday afternoon when the Serb fighters  smashed the eight-day offensive of the Muslim army, which is in  a panicked retreat towards the River Drina.    Without suffering any losses, the Serb fighters liberated  the  village of Biljin, half a km away from Vitkovici, in an  unstoppable attack from the direction of Paljika and Trebinjaca  yesterday evening, the command says.    Military police are deployed on the bridge in Vitkovici and  are preventing the retreating Muslim soldiers from crossing to  the left bank of the Drina River.    The command of the joint forces of the Srpska army says that  the Muslim army yesterday suffered huge losses in manpower, thus  denying reports by Muslim media about civilian casualties.</p>

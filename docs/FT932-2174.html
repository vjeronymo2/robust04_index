			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: Playing to a noisy New York gallery - Golf EXPECTING New Yorkers to spend a sporting day in silence stretches credulity to unreasonable bounds. Bobby Bonilla, for example, was just five games into a new career with the New York Mets baseball team when he saw the home-made-sign in the crowd. It said: 'Do Better, Ya Bum.' Clearly then, worlds collide when the US Open Golf championship makes a periodic visit to one of several designated sites that encompass the outskirts of the city. This year, the venue is Baltusrol, which is in New Jersey, just a 30 minute ride from the centre of Manhattan. So who is winning in this contest between the brash New Yorker and the sober Royal and Ancient game? Not surprisingly the former is. It is not necessarily a bad thing. Of course, golf would quickly become extinct if crowd noise became excessive. Silence is not just desirable while a golfer is playing his shots, it is absolutely essential. The game depends on strict obeyance of this code of conduct. But enforced silence can weaken interest. Many golf tournaments become boring through lack of atmosphere. The sport is at its most fascinating when the crowd is totally involved. At the Ryder Cup, for example, or the final holes of any Open championship. And also, a US Open in New York. The great players respond, too, when they have a crowd in thrall. Baltusrol has already played host to two of the great US Opens. In 1967, a rather plump young man called Jack Nicklaus finally cast off his image of outlaw to Arnold Palmer's John Wayne, by shooting a record 72-hole total. Nicklaus was back for more in 1980. This time, he was a washed-up icon. But at 40 he rediscovered his best form, and the New Yorkers responded and the final green was bathed in emotion. Nicklaus has no doubt that the reaction of the crowd made this the most memorable of his 18 major championship victories. Already, this year's tournament has produced some lovely cameos. In Wednesday's final practice round, John Daly, Fuzzy Zoeller and Robert Gamez were paired together. At the short par three fourth, Zoeller's tee shots finished in the water that fronts the green. He played a second ball, which finished towards the back of the putting surface. 'That's where the pin will be on Sunday,' he said loudly. 'Always presuming you'll still be here on Sunday,' said a voice in the crowd. Daly shouted: 'Well, let's see if you can do any better, wiseguy.' Daly has probably said this at tens of venues to tens of fans and they have all gone red and mumbled something into the palm of their hand. Not now. Not in New York. The spectator stepped out of the crowd and into his dream. Zoeller gave him a five iron. 'I need a four wood,' the man said. 'Don't be nervous, now,' said Zoeller. The spectator hit a horrible shot that never came close to making the green. 'Not as easy as it looks, is it?' said Zoeller, as they both shook hands, laughing. In this tournament where 155 men set out with hopes and ambitions on Thursday there walks also one boy. His name is Ted Oh. He is a 16-year-old, from California, of Korean extraction, who came through the long and arduous qualifying process. He is the youngest US Open competitor for 42 years. In the changing room, the players' lockers are in alphabetical order, and Oh was delighted to find his next to Nicklaus' or 'Mr Nicklaus' as he calls him. On Wednesday, Oh put himself down to play with Severiano Ballesteros. For a few holes Ballesteros was totally absorbed in his own troubled world. But he heard the roars of the crowd, forgot himself for a moment, and saw the play of his young partner. All at once his features softened, he put his arm around Oh's shoulders and told him about trying to keep the ball low under the cross winds and how to play from the collar of rough that protects each green. Then Ballesteros acknowledged the raucous cheers from behind the ropes. Of course, it can get out of hand. When one fan at the US Open at Shinnecock Hills on Long Island, shouted the word 'Choker' at Greg Norman in 1986, he was swiftly invited by the Australian to rendezvous behind the 18th green at the end of his round. Fortunately, the invitation was refused. But Norman has joined in the applause this week, because he knows that New Yorkers discriminate most of all in favour of the kind of colourful, adventurous golf that he specialises in playing. In those circumstances, the sport can more than stand a little whoopin' and hollering.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Within a few days, the priorities of Jordan's  policies have turned upside down. The Jordanian-Israeli track  of the negotiations has moved quickly in both the political and  economic directions and Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, head of the  Jordanian delegation, and Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the  Israeli delegation, have voiced their full satisfaction with  achievements made during the first hours of the negotiations.  Throughout last week, the Israeli and international media were  preoccupied with disseminating reports that high-level  Jordanian-Israeli meetings took place in London prior to the  Washington negotiations and cleared the way for rapid progress  and movement of the talks to al-'Aqabah and Elat. As a result,  Jordanian-Syrian relations were strained after they were  prepared only two weeks ago to reach a high level of  coordination and after the Husayn-al-Asad summit decided in  Damascus last month to revive the joint Syrian-Jordanian  committee that was suspended for a long time due to the two  countries' differences over the Gulf war.    For the first time in three years, the Jordanian and Syrian  press exchanged polemics in public. The Syrian newspaper  TISHRIN commented on an article published in the Jordanian  newspaper AL-RA'Y calling for the revival of the  Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations without waiting for the  other Arab parties.    The Syrian press also implicitly replied to statements that  the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper attributed to the Jordanian  prime minister, who quickly denied these statements, which  included Jordan's reservation on a Syrian proposal for unity  between the two countries.    The major phenomenon of the deteriorating Jordanian-Syrian  relations is Syria's decision to cancel the visit, which Syrian  Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi was to pay to Amman at the head  of a high-level political and economic delegation, including  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.    The Syrians explained that Jordan, which is currently  holding  economic negotiations with Israel and the United States within  the framework of the tripartite development committee, may turn  into a bridge for normalizing relations between Syria and Israel  when it concludes economic agreements with Syria. Moreover, any  dealing with Israel will prevent integration with Syria,  especially since its negotiations with Israel have not yet  resulted in peace.    Therefore, Jordan's relations, which are deteriorating with  Saudi Arabia and most Gulf states, which are weakening with  Iraq, and which are fluctuating with the PLO, have also  deteriorated with Syria and Lebanon due to Jordan's openness  toward Israel.</p>

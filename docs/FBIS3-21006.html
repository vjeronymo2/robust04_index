			<p>Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adrian Morant: "From Janet to Super-Janet"] </F>   [Text] For a decade the local area networks (LANs) at  approximately 200 universities, polytechnic colleges and  research institutions in Great Britain have been connected to  one another through Janet (Joint Academic Network). Janet was  installed in the early 1980s, currently serves about 50,000  terminals and offers access to electronic mail services around  the world.    This system is now being improved by means of the most  modern  optical waveguide technology so that in addition to its existing  function as a news transmission medium it will also function as  a future-oriented communications structure for the academic  community. The new improved network by the name of Super-Janet  is needed to support certain teaching and research activities.  In addition to language transmission, they also require rapid  data, image and video transmission. Super-Janet will not replace  the existing network but expand it.  <H5>  Powerful Overlay Network </H5>   The new network will not radically change the type and way  in  which scientists access decentralized data bases and routinely  communicate by E-mail with their colleagues all over the world.  But it will create a significantly more powerful overlay  network, to which gradually more and more facilities all over  the country will be connected. After the development of similar  networks in other countries, new perspectives will open up on  this level as well.    Dr. Robert Cooper, who heads the project for the Science and  Engineering Research Council/Universities Funding Council Joint  Network Team, regards Super-Janet as "singular in Europe." In  explaining the pioneering role of the new network, he adds that  it involves a test system for the demanding academic community.    The British Universities Funding Council (UFC) awarded the  contract, worth 18 million pounds over a period of four years,  to British Telecom (BT). In the first phase data centers at the  Universities of Cambridge and Manchester, Rutherford Appleton  Laboratory, University College London (UCL), at Imperial College  London and the University of Edinburgh will be interconnected.  In the course of 1993/94 about 50 locations will be connected to  the network. Additional ones will follow, according to the  availability of the necessary funds.    The network concept will be realized by means of the latest  broadband technology. Most communications opportunities are  based on the Switched Multimegambit Data Service Definition  (SMDS) by BT. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is to be  used as a central network technology, which together with new  broadband transmission methods (Distributed Queue Dual Bus,  DQDB, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode, ATM) will offer a maximum  of transmission opportunities.    Dr. Alan Rudge, head of BT's research and procurement  division, who is responsible for all the company's technical  research work, stresses that the broadband transmission platform  used to interconnect the locations is just as important for the  industry as for government offices and academics: "The  Super-Janet order enables BT, together with the universities, to  develop new applications which sooner or later will bring the  companies a competitive advantage."    Dr. Rudge further refers to the necessity of promoting the  image of "broadband as the standard." According to his  information, BT is proposing to the industry that it should  participate in joint projects with the suppliers in order to  offer these facilities. A critical mass is needed in order to  stimulate confidence. BT therefore expects that the availability  of the network will have a decisive "trigger function."  <H5>  Broad Application Range </H5>   Transmission of visual output data from extensive,  fluid-dynamic calculations executed at the Rutherford Appleton  Laboratory near London on a Cray YMP supercomputer to Imperial  College in London is one potential technical application. Since  the enormous amounts of data produced can only be processed by  the user if they are present in image form--often with color and  animation--Super-Janet offers the advantage that the researchers  no longer personally have to go to the Rutherford laboratory.    The Cyclotron Unit of the MRC (Medical Research Council) at  Hammersmith Hospital in London also have several facilities for  producing pictures of the brain, which are of interest to  researchers in other places. In the pilot project these pictures  are transmitted for analysis from Hammersmith Hospital to the  psychiatric departments of the University of Edinburgh and the  University College London as well as for processing by the  supercomputer center at the University of Edinburgh.    University College London has the equipment for teaching  surgery by means of interactive video. For that reason a  proposal was made to carry out a series of surgical  demonstrations between the UCL and the other centers which are  able to support interactive activities. These can be for example  surgical demonstrations from the operating room, clinical  demonstrations in the lecture room, discussions between surgical  specialists, joint preparation of video-teaching material and  investigation of possibilities to use existing teaching  materials for self-study in a decentralized teaching environment.    Among the applications in the field of information services  are preparation of archival documents and a test project for an  electronic magazine, as well as a series of applications which  require rapid transfer of voluminous data from one place to  another. The former application is to demonstrate inquiry for  and preparation of documents with the network. At least seven  universities will participate in order ultimately to establish a  regular service between the locations. This method is more  economical than the existing slow and personnel-intensive  borrowing agreements between the libraries.    Super-Janet will enable a multitude of projects--in the most  varied disciplines--which are being postponed at this time for  lack of a suitable fast network. Furthermore, with every  successful application the advantages of Super-Janet are  becoming noticed by an increasingly larger circle of users.</p>

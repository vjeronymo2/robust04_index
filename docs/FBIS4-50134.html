			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 14 (XINHUA) -- The Curbo Monastery near  Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, issued a  statement today, denouncing the activities of making abroad a  puppet reincarnated child of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba by  two fugitive Tibetans.    The statement said that the puppet reincarnated child  granted  by fugitive living Buddha Shamarba and manager Doga against the  will of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba will never be recognized  by the Curbo Monastery and religious people in Tibet.    It noted that Okying Chilai, the reincarnate soul of the  16th  living Buddha Garmaba or the leader of Kagyudpa which is also  called the White Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, ascended the holy  throne in the Curbo Monastery at a solemn ceremony on September  27, 1992 with the approval of the Religious Affairs Bureau of  the State Council of the People's Republic of China. He has  then become the lawful and universally acknowledged 17th living  Buddha Garmaba.    The making of a puppet reincarnated child was a farce in  violation of the Buddhist dharma and canon of Kagyudpa, the  statement said, noting that the farce was directed by living  Buddha Shamarba, disciple and relative of the 16th living Buddha  Garmaba, and his follower Doga.    According to historical records, the statement said, 164  years ago, Diarqen Ogyainxoi Jiudeqinlinba, the personification  of great master Padma Sambhava, left prophecy saying clearly  that the respected name of the 17th Garmaba should be "Okying  Chilai" who would be confirmed and supported by the 12th living  Buddha Situ. The 16th garmaba also left a stamped posthumous  paper, indicating that his reincarnated personification would be  born in an area north of Sikkim called Qamdo. The paper also  indicated the names of the reincarnated child's parents and the  year of his birth.    On March 10, 1992, four leading disciples of the 16th living  Buddha Garmaba, namely Situ, Jiecao, Shamarba and Gongzhu,  opened the sealed will of their teacher together in the Rongding  Monastery, where they decided that living Buddha Gongzhu would  take up the search of the reincarnated child, the statement said.    The mission was continued by living Buddhas Situ and Jiecao,  upon the unfortunate death of the living Buddha Gongzhu in a  traffic accident.    With their assistance, the Curbo Monastery set up a team for  the mission. Strictly following the instruction of the will in  their secret searching work, the team came to the Paggor tribe  near Qamdo, as they were told by the will, and found the  reincarnated child, it said.    On April 15, 1992 of the Tibetan calendar, the living  Buddhas  Situ and Jiecao held a tonsure ceremony for the reincarnated  child before the image of Sakyamouni, the Buddha, at the Johkang  Temple in Lhasa.    On Tibetan calendar August 1 of the same year, the  reincarnated child ascended the holy throne to become the 17th  living Buddha Garmaba, in the Curbo Monastery at a ceremony  attended by noted religious figures in Tibet and nearly 50,000  Buddhists from home and abroad.    However, Shamarba on September 5, 1990 claimed that the  reincarnated child would be born "in a village by the Baimaco  Lake, at the northwest of the Curbo Monastery. [no closing  quotation mark as received] His saying proved to be sheer  fiction by two searches by the Curbo Monastery, the statement  said.    Later, Shamarba fabricated documents and privately  designated  a Tibetan child to be the reincarnated boy, and smuggled him  abroad.    The statement of the Curbo Monastery said the living Buddha  Shamarba and manager Doga have committed a tragic mistake in  their deep trap of sin. It also urged them to stop timely  before the abyss of their sin.</p>

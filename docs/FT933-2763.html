			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Fed may heed fears over 'lax' US monetary policy THE charge that US monetary policy is too lax is likely to be taken seriously at next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, but the Fed may not yet be ready to raise short-term interest rates. In an interview in the New York Times, Mr David Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman, referred to concerns that excessive growth of narrow measures of the money supply was creating a bubble in share and bond prices. 'That's one reason to be wary of being more accommodative,' he said. Mr Mullins appeared to be responding to a recent report by the shadow open market committee - a group of monetarist-leaning economists - arguing that double-digit growth of the monetary base was artificially boosting prices of financial assets and, if not checked, would lead to a resurgence of inflation. The federal funds rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s and has been close to zero in inflation-adjusted terms for at least a year. 'Bank reserves have grown at a 12.5 per cent average rate in the past two years,' says Mr Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBank in New York and a member of the shadow open market committee. This has 'fuelled the demand for financial assets, bidding up their prices.' There has been some evidence of a divergence in the performance of the financial and real economies. While share and bond prices have soared this year, real gross domestic product grew only 1.3 per cent at an annual rate in the first half. Figures yesterday appeared consistent with a modest acceleration of growth in the second half to an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent. The Commerce Department said industrial production rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 4.2 per cent in the year to August. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed in July to Dollars 10.3bn, against Dollars 12.1bn in June, reflecting a bigger fall in imports than of exports. Many Wall Street economists are sceptical of the reasoning of the shadow open market committee, saying the link between growth of the monetary base (currency and bank reserves) and nominal income has been weak in the past. Mr Will Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan the New York bank, said the rise in prices of financial assets was merely a sign that a deliberatively stimulative monetary policy was working. Talk of a bubble made little sense because the valuation of assets was not yet out of line with economic fundamentals. Mr Brown and others conceded the shadow open market committee conclusions were probably right. Monetary policy had been correct but it was now time to consider raising rates. He predicted the Fed probably would raise short-term rates from 3 to 3.5 per cent in the not too distant future.</p>

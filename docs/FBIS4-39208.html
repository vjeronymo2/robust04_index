According to  the service's chairman, Igor Giorgadze, brigade personnel have  been trained at Russian special services training centers. The  "special-purpose forces" include motorized rifle and combat  engineer subunits and an antiterrorist squad. The "special  forces" will cost the taxpayer around 5 billion Russian rubles a  year. But, according to independent experts, the brigade will be  capable of more than covering the expenditure on its upkeep.

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED SALE OF FRIENDLY FORD DELAYED  </P> <P> The proposed sale of troubled Friendly Ford was delayed Friday amid objections  in federal bankruptcy court here that the $1.2-million price is too low and  that thousands of car buyers who purchased extended warranties might be left  unprotected.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan scheduled a new hearing for Thursday to take  additional testimony and to consider any new bids that might materialize for  the high-volume Huntington Beach dealership.  </P> <P> Friendly, which operated as Wilson Ford until last August, filed in April for  protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The  filing was made three days after the state attorney general's office filed a  $3-million civil fraud suit against the dealership and several of its current  and former principals and executives.  </P> <P> Attorneys for several of the Huntington Beach dealership's major creditors  objected Friday to the purchase of Friendly's major assets by Encino luxury car  dealer Terry York because they fear there would not be enough proceeds to repay  what they claim they are owed.  </P> <P> York had originally agreed to pay almost $1.8 million, but the price has been  slashed, largely because of the negative impact the fraud suit has had on  Friendly's reputation and sales.  </P> <P> A new issue that surfaced Friday is the situation of about 6,000 customers who  purchased extended warranties from Friendly.  </P> <P> The dealership is refusing, because of its bankruptcy status, to provide  service under the warranties, many of which require that the repair work be  done only at Friendly.  </P> <P> The purchase agreement with York absolves him of any responsibility to honor  the warranties should he take over the dealership.  </P> <P> Ironically, many of the warranties sold by what was then Wilson Ford were  marketed by First Extended Service Corp. in Dallas -- a company owned by Texas  auto dealer Carl Wescott, a former major shareholder of Wilson.  </P> <P> An attorney for First Extended said the only current recourse for extended  warranty holders is to submit a claim to First Extended or its insurer.  </P> <P> Wescott is one of several defendants named in the state's consumer fraud suit.  </P> <P> Among other things, the suit alleges that Friendly, under that name and as  Wilson Ford, used fraudulent sales techniques to pressure customers into buying  the extended warranties at inflated prices, often for several thousand dollars.  Even at an average of $1,000 each, the 6,000 warranties would have brought in a  gross income of $6 million.  </P></p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Canadians warned on regional divide A STRONG performance by Canada's two fast-growing regional parties in the October 25 general election could polarise the country and hasten its eventual fragementation, voters are being warned. With two weeks to polling day, the popularity of the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the Reform party in western Canada has become the main talking point of the election. Mr Patrick Monahan, constitutional lawyer at Toronto's York University, wrote in a commentary in yesterday's Globe and Mail: 'The election is shaping up as a fundamental watershed for the country, the domestic equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall in Europe.' According to the latest opinion polls, the BQ has the support of over 40 per cent of voters in Quebec, while Reform has pulled ahead of all other parties in the western province of British Columbia. It also enjoys substantial support in the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Backing for the BQ and Reform has come largely at the expense of the Conservatives, under Prime Minister Kim Campbell, who are now given only the longest odds to win a third successive term in office. The Liberals are favoured to win the largest number of seats, but the regional parties' performance will largely determine whether the Liberals have enough seats to form a majority government. The bulk of Liberals MPs are likely to be from Ontario, heightening regional differences. The left-leaning New Democratic party, which currently has 43 out of 295 seats in the House of Commons, is facing obliteration in the election. Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader, sounded a dire warning about the impact of strong BQ and Reform representation in the House of Commons: 'If you have an English Canada on one side and a completely French Quebec on the other side, you end up with two nations and eventually two countries,' he said. The popularity of both groups largely reflects voters' disillusionment with the traditional parties. An unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent, the strains caused by a more competitive trading environment, and periodic reports of politicians' misdeeds in Ottawa have all contributed to a desire for radical change. The BQ favours eventual sovereignty for Quebec, but it has drawn support even from non-separatists with its promise to put the interests of the francophone province first. The Reform party has a populist, right-wing platform which includes drastic cuts in government spending, an end to national bilingualism, and stricter immigration curbs.</p>

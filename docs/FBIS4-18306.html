			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Businessmen Want Berlusconi Premier </F> But With Controls Over Conflict of Interest"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The majority of Italian  businessmen believe that Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi  should be given a mandate by Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  to form a new government, but also want guarantees set down to  separate his political, performance from his business  activities, according to a poll to be published by the economic  weekly IL MONDO.    The poll, which interviewed 202 executives and businessmen,  found that 38.7 percent wanted President Scalfaro to give a  mandate to Berlusconi, while 30.4 preferred someone close to the  winning alliance forged by the owner of Fininvest but more  independent. The choice of National Alliance head Giancarlo  Fini as premier was the choice of 10.1 percent of those  interviewed, while 3.6 percent indicated Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi.    Berlusconi was preferred more by businessmen, while company  executives indicated other solutions.    A total of 34.5 percent of those interviewed saw as "very  realistic" Forza Italia's program, which included lowering  taxes, more jobs and the privatization social services. Another  13.7 percent saw it as "realistic enough." This opposed to  33.9 percent, almost all executives, who saw it as "not very  realistic," and 14.9 did not think it was at all realistic.    Those in favor of specific guarantees to separate  Berlusconi's business and political interests, such as the  institution of a blind trust, accounted for 64.9 percent of  those interviewed.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE BLOCKS ROSE HEARING FOR TWO WEEKS  </P> <P> An Ohio judge has blocked baseball's commissioner from holding a hearing that  could have resulted in Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose's being banned from  the game for his alleged gambling activities.  </P> <P> Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel, deciding that Commissioner  Bart Giamatti had "prejudged" Rose, Sunday granted Rose a temporary restraining  order that delayed today's scheduled hearing until at least July 6.  </P> <P> "Giamatti could not be impartial," the judge said.  </P> <P> Nadel said no action may be taken against Rose for two weeks. The judge said  that on July 6 he will  </P> <P> consider a motion for a preliminary injunction that would put the case on hold  while he decides whether he or Giamatti should decide Rose's fate.  </P> <P> Over the years, Charles O. Finley, Ted Turner and other team owners have gone  to court to challenge the broad powers given to baseball's commissioners, but  none have succeeded.  </P> <P> The constitutional guarantees of due process do not always apply to private  organizations such as organized sports. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed  that principle in supporting the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanctions  against Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, for rules  violations.  </P> <P> Nadel acknowledged Friday that allowing a court to intervene would be going  into "previously uncharted waters."  </P> <P> Rose was not in the packed courtroom for the decision. He was at nearby  Riverfront Stadium for Sunday's game against the Dodgers.  </P> <P> In a pregame interview with radio station WLW, Rose said he was pleased with  the ruling.  </P> <P> "I think they proved (Giamatti) already made up his mind," Rose said.  </P> <P> "It just wasn't going to be a fair hearing, in my eyes. It was obvious he  believed my accusers."  </P> <P> "I think we got justice," said Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz.  </P> <P> Giamatti, the former president of Yale University, issued a statement saying:  "I regret the judge's decision. I have absolutely no prejudgment or prejudice  regarding Pete Rose. We will contest this matter tooth and nail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Investigator  </P> <P> The unprecedented decision came two days after a hearing in which baseball's  special investigator, John Dowd, revealed that he has evidence that Rose bet on  major league baseball, including Reds games, in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Nadel, after reading a letter that Giamatti signed on behalf of  Rose's chief accuser, Ronald Peters, said: "It appears to this court that the  commissioner has prejudged Peter Edward Rose."  </P> <P> The letter, dated April 18, 1989, was drafted by Dowd and signed by Giamatti.  It was sent to Judge Carl B. Rubin of the Southern District of Ohio, where  Peters was about to be sentenced on charges of cocaine trafficking and tax  evasion, and said in part: "It is my purpose to bring to your attention the  significant and truthful cooperation Mr. Peters has provided to my special  counsel. I am satisfied Mr. Peters has been candid, forthright and truthful  with my special counsel."  </P> <P> Nadel also said he thought Rose's career would be irreparably harmed if today's  scheduled hearing were held.  </P> <P> Rose could be suspended for a year if it is determined that he bet on major  league games. He could be banned for life if he is found to have wagered on  Reds' games.  </P> <P> The judge got the case after Rose's lawyers sued on June 19, asserting that  Rose had been denied a fair investigation by Dowd.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES AND PHOTO: Sports, Pages 1,6,7,8  </P></p>

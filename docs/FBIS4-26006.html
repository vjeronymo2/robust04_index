			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F> Service in Chinese at 1607 GMT on 15 June transmits a service  message replacing the following item]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Meeting with his  visitors from Hong Kong today, Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said that much work  remains to be done in implementing the "one country, two  systems" principle and in maintaining Hong Kong's smooth  transition and its stability and prosperity after 1997.    He said: "Just like accomplishing all other projects, we  must strategically despise them but tactically take them  seriously. So not only must we have the determination and  confidence, but we must also have the capabilities and methods  for accomplishing them."    Li Ruihuan made the statement this morning while meeting at  the Great Hall of the People with the delegation of the Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong headed by its president  Herbert Liang.    Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle  was Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the  interests of all Chinese people, including our countrymen in  Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance.  We will unswervingly implement this principle.    Li Ruihuan urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely  as possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the  goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens  themselves."    When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on its 60th founding  anniversary and welcomed the association's friends on their  visit to Beijing. He said: The Chinese Manufacturers'  Association of Hong Kong is a business group with extensive  influence. Over the years you have accomplished a great deal of  work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development, as  well as in supporting China's reform, opening up, and  modernization. Li Ruihuan urged the association's friends to  continue to work hard to make new contributions to Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity.    During the meeting, Li Ruihuan also answered the visitors'  questions on how to maintain Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity during the transitional period.    Also present at the meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman  of the CPPCC National Committee and head of the CPC Central  Committee United Front Department; Jing Shuping, chairman of the  All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Chen Ziying,  vice chairman of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office.</p>

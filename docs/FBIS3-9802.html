			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred  Serreqi and his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov held a  joint news conference today. Here is Sokol Balla:    [Balla] Both the Albanian and Bulgarian foreign ministers  held a joint news conference today in a hall in the Palace of  Congresses in Tirana. Albanian Minister Serreqi first spoke  about the main questions that were the focus of bilateral talks,  such as the crisis in former Yugoslavia, the situation in the  region, the reciprocal information of both governments on  reform, the process of European integration of both  post-communist states, etc.    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov stressed that  we have once again rebuilt our present vision of relations and  how to expand them by first defining their juridical basis so as  to open the way to further economic cooperation.    At this conference they stressed that there are presently no  outstanding problems between the two countries. Nevertheless,  more frequent political contact is expected. Daskalov said that  wonderful prospects lie ahead of us.    Asked about whether or not the Balkan countries will  intervene in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia if it spreads  to the south of the peninsula, the Bulgarian foreign minister  gave a negative response; this, according to him and the  position maintained by the Bulgarian Government, would  complicate the situation. He also answered a question on the  presence of Turkish or Greek soldiers in the UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. [not further specified]    Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi answered the same question  by stressing that we should overcome several prejudices related  to the presence of Turkish or Russian [as heard] soldiers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serreqi said that what is left is the hope  that Blue Helmets of every nationality will play a peacekeeping  role, always within the UN framework and under its flag.    Asked about the international peacekeeping presence in  Kosova, the Bulgarian foreign minister answered that Bulgaria  supports all peacekeeping initiatives that attempt to prevent  the spread of the conflict to the south. However, Daskalov  declared that, as far as an international presence in Kosova is  concerned, we should first ask the Serbian party.    The Bulgarian foreign minister did not pronounce himself on  the problem of Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] because, as he presented the  argument, this is an internal affair of the Macedonian state.  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov left our country today.</p>

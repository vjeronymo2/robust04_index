			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: European alliance of four banks disbanded EUROPARTNERS, the alliance formed more than 20 years ago between four leading European banks, has agreed to disband, marking a further erosion of the once-popular banking partnerships of the 1970s. At a meeting in Rome this week, the heads of Banca di Roma, Commerzbank, Credit Lyonnais and Banco Central Hispano-Americano decided their loose union - whose ambitions once included operating joint branches in third countries - no longer fitted in with the liberalised European market. Almost the only remaining tangible sign of the alliance, one of a number of loose partnerships between European banks, is the cross-equity stakes between Commerzbank and Banco Hispano-Americano. Attempts between the partners, notably Commerzbank, to develop closer ties foundered on a mixture of growing competition between the members and confused national banking policies. Matters were not helped by the fact that two of the Europartners were from the private sector and the other pair state-owned. However, it was the steady integration of European finance which hammered the final nail into Europartners' coffin. Though originally formed on the understanding that no member would do business independently on another's territory, that principle was eventually watered down to cover only retail banking. In the end, even that proved too much in an increasingly competitive European banking market as national borders crumbled and Credit Lyonnais, in particular, pursued an aggressive policy to build up an acquisition-based retail banking presence in Italy and now Germany.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Botnar car group wins franchises in restructuring move AFG, the car-retailing group controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has gained dealer franchises from five leading European carmakers in its effort to restructure in the wake of losing the Nissan franchise at the end of last year. The company received franchises for 29 of its dealerships from Peugeot, Citroen and Renault, the French carmakers, from Rover of the UK and from Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US. Agreement has been reached with some of these groups for the refranchising of a further 13 sites. It is understood that negotiations are also at an advanced stage between AFG and the Fiat group, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia, for the Italian carmaker to franchise up to 45 more AFG dealerships. Fiat, which is concerned about its poor performance in the UK, where it captured only 1.9 per cent of new-car sales in the first quarter of this year, is committed separately to investing around Pounds 100m over the next three years to strengthen its ailing UK dealer network. The potential deal with AFG would be an addition to its current plans and could boost its annual UK sales by between 15,000 and 18,000 cars a year. Last year the Fiat group sold 39,621 new cars in the UK and reached a combined market share for the Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo marques of only 2.5 per cent. AFG, whose network of 160 new-car dealerships was previously accounting for more than half of all the new Nissan vehicles sold in the UK, has been forced to drastically restructure. Its operation, still the largest motor-retailing network in the UK, has been reduced from 160 dealership to 127 through the sale or lease of some sites, but AFG aims to retain more than 100 dealerships, as it seeks to become the country's largest multi-franchise dealer group. In the early months of this year most of its sites were surviving from the sale of used cars and the sale of the depleting stock of close to 20,000 new Nissan vehicles it retained at the end of last year. AFG, which was based exclusively on the Nissan franchise, had its future jeopardised when Nissan UK, its sister company, lost the Nissan franchise after the legal conflict between Mr Botnar and Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker. The exclusive Nissan UK importer/distributor contract was terminated by the Japanese carmaker with effect from the end of December, when Nissan Motor took direct control of the sales and marketing of its vehicles in the UK. The AFG network is still controlled by Mr Botnar, who faces arrest in connection with an alleged corporation-tax fraud. A warrant was issued for his arrest in January when he was abroad, and Mr Botnar has yet to return to the UK.</p>

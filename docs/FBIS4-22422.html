			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olafs Zvejnieks and Maris Kirsons: "Finance </F> Ministry Anticipates Instituting Cost Cutting Measures"]    [Text] The Finance Ministry is anticipating a cost-cutting  regime since government expenditures exceeded receipts by 8  million Ls already in January, 1994.    Janis Platais, Finance Ministry Secretary for the Budget,  announced in a press conference that the government will be  unable to finance investment projects in the winter period which  will be delayed to a later period. Similarly, steps are being  taken to limit specific expenditures by government agencies.  These include the acquisition of equipment and major repairs, if  there is no extraordinary need at this time. The Budget  Secretary also indicated that social welfare payments to  families with children are also under review with the  expectation that such payments will in the future be limited to  deprived classes only.  <H5>  Financial Stability for Local Government </H5>   J. Platais indicated that the Budget is very tight due to  the  social needs and necessary financing required of government  organizations. The Budget authorizes receipts of 556.7 Ls and  expenditures of 593.4 million Ls. Each month the Budget must  receive 46.4 million Ls. The Government views that the work  payment system will have to be reformed for the so-called force  structures: police, army, militia and security forces. The  Government is also reviewing, jointly with the trade unions, the  potential to increase the minimum wage to 25 or perhaps 28 Ls  per month. Also under review is the possibility of enabling  savings made by government agencies against budget  authorizations to be spent in the following year.    Uldis Osis, Finance Minister, announced that the Ministry is  actively working on legislative proposals in the following  areas: the Budget, the management of government finances,  regulation of State and Local government relations to ensure  necessary financial stability and oversight several years in the  future. Already starting with this year macroeconomic forecast  and clearly defined budgetary objectives were taken into account  to develop the overall contours of the budget for the next 3-4  years. Uldis Osis characterized this whole process as a "radical  reform of the budgeting system."  <H5>  Last Year's Deficit -- 2 Million Ls </H5>   According to the Finance Ministry information provided by J.  Platais, the actual budget deficit of about 2 million Ls was  less than the forecast budget deficit of 30.2 million Ls. It  will be possible to tell the precise State budget deficit by the  end of February based upon more precise figures for receipts and  disbursements. According to the operating information government  receipts last year were approximately 410,354 Ls and  disbursements were approximately 412.5 million Ls.  <H5>  Social Welfare Taxes Were the Largest Category of Receipts </H5>   The largest category of receipts in the previous year were  from social welfare taxes -- about 144 million Lats, although  less was received than earlier forecast. Income taxes also made  a significant contribution to government receipts accounting for  about 87 million Ls. The value-added tax was also a significant  factor. Income tax receipts exceeded the forecast amount by  11%. Although the budget deficit was reduced from the  forecast  level of 30.2 million Ls to about 2 million Ls by reducing  expenditures from the plan, but also by less internal government  borrowing and by repayment of loans, and also by the formation  of the Department of Revenue which has helped to increase tax  and fee receipts.</p>

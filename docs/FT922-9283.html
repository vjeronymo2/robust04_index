			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: US food group buys Canadian flour miller ARCHER DANIELS Midland, the US agri-business group, has taken another step towards integration of North America's food processing industry by agreeing to buy Canada's biggest flour miller. ADM, which has made several acquisitions in Canada over the past year, will pay an undisclosed sum for Ogilvie Mills of Montreal. The seller is John Labatt, the Canadian food processing group. Ogilvie has annual revenues of about CDollars 275m (USDollars 231m) with mills in Quebec, Alberta and Ontario. The company is also one of the world's largest producers of wheat starch and gluten. Canada's bureau for competition policy turned down a proposal last year to merge Ogilvie with the milling interests of Maple Leaf Foods, controlled by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK. The two Canadian companies had argued that the merger was necessary to compete against the big US millers. But the government was concerned about the stranglehold which the combined company would have on the domestic market. Maple Leaf subsequently turned to a leading US miller to protect its flour-milling business. It recently formed a joint milling venture with ConAgra of Nebraska.</p>

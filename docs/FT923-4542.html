			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: A farewell to Soderstrom ONLY on the day did the news emerge that Elisabeth Soderstrom's late-night cabaret performance, at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, would also be her farewell. She entered dramatically. A wall rose to reveal her; she at once launched into the opening phrases of 'Dich, teure Halle' from Tannhauser. Then she cut to the aria's closing phrases and - just as she was due to hit a high note now surely beyond her - she cut into 'Hello, Dolly', here reworded as 'Hello, darlings'. The medley continued with 'Tea For Two' ('tea for you and cakes for me') and 'Black eyes' (in Russian). To love Soderstrom has been to love life itself, for her range was so wide. The evening stirred memories of all the ways she has enchanted us over the years - in opera, in recital, on record, in the printed page, on TV, in chat-shows, talking on the radio; in numerous languages; in music by umpteen composers. She loves apparent self-contradiction: as in an interview in Opera when, having just said 'I hate modern opera,' she then said her favourite role was the Governess in The Turn of the Screw. She has been the most spontaneous of singers, the most hilarious and endearing, and she has been among the most musical and moving. She gave, in The Makropoulos Case, the greatest physical performance in opera I have seen - conveying sensuousness, coldness, wit, urgency and all the weight of a 300-year life in her stance and her every step. Perhaps my favourite memory is of her third encore at a Covent Garden recital, when, just as she was singing the echo in a Scandinavian echo song, a police siren outside the opera house sounded so like yet another echo that she began laughing and refused to sing another note. She is 65, and sang her last opera - Poulenc's La Voix humaine - early last week. So, on this occasion, dressed in black tights and loose shirt a la Judy Garland, she sang 'Nobody loves a fairy when she's forty', pointing the lines 'They want a bit of magic from a younger bit of stuff,' and 'I'd rather be a has-been than a never-was' without malice, and earning her biggest laugh with 'You stand there crying 'What-ho]' - but they all pass by your grotto.' She also sang 'Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs Worthington' memorably. Amazing to find that she could give new meaning to something as familiar as Cole Porter's 'Night and day' or as thin as Sondheim's 'Send in the clowns'. The fact that the evening also included the Swedish folk song that Ambroise Thomas incorporated into the mad scene in Hamlet, a Piaf song, and Clara Schumann's setting of a Heine poem about love is typical of her extraordinary diversity. To talk of her art in the past tense is hard. True, her prime passed more than 10 years ago. True, her voice has become increasingly threadbare. It is also true that she has always continued to enrich our lives, because she remained so musical. Her encore, by the way, was 'Bed? Bed? I couldn't go to bed. . . I could have danced all night.' As so often, we believed her.</p>

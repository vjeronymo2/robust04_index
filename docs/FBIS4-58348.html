			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli helicopters raked the outskirts of Zibqin  and nearby valleys this morning. The outskirts of Habbush came  under Israeli 82-mm artillery bombardment from Israeli positions  in Tallat al-Suwayda' at 0500 today. Shells also landed in  Jabal al-Raf'i and the Nab' al-Tasah basin. Contrary to other  reports, no shells landed in Yatar but two shells fell 150  meters away from the village.    At 0445 today the resistance men detonated two explosive  charges on the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Jarmaq Road as an Israeli 12-man  foot patrol was passing, killing or injuring the entire patrol.  Two Israeli helicopters immediately evacuated the casualties to  the occupied land.    A joint Israeli-Lahdist foot patrol last night advanced to  the valleys adjacent to the villages of Kafra and Yatar and  raked them with machine-gun fire.    Between 2100 and 0100 today the Israeli artillery in Tallat  al- Bayyadah pounded the outskirts of Majdal Zun, Zibqin, Kafra,  and Yatar. At 2330 the outskirts of Sribbin, Haddatha, and Ayta  al-Jabal came under an 155-mm artillery barrage from the Israeli  positions in Tallat Yarin. Shortly after midnight, enemy boats  fired flares over Majdal Zun and al-Mansuri.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Employers back talks on works councils The European employers confederation, UNICE, looks set to recommend to its members that they negotiate EU-wide works council agreements with trade unions to avoid the threat of a directive on workers' consultation being imposed by Brussels. The move, which has to be confirmed by a UNICE meeting on March 9, follows talks in Brussels yesterday between the European employers and the European Trade Union Confederation. One ETUC official described the UNICE move as a U-turn, impelled by a change of tactics by the European Commission earlier this month. The original Commission proposal for mandatory works councils in pan-European companies has been blocked by UK opposition for three years. But after the entry into force in November of the Maastricht Treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out on social policy, the way was open for the UK's partners to go ahead on their own. On February 8, Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commisioner, persuaded the Commission to approve a revamped plan, intended to be more palatable to employers. Instead of a blueprint for mandatory consultation with workers representatives, the new draft directive seeks voluntary agreements, with unions and employers deciding their own arrangements. There are already 30 such agreements in force across Europe. But if the two sides failed to agree, a reduced set of minimum requirements for consultation would be imposed if workers demanded them. This was dismissed as unacceptable by UNICE. But they and ETUC were given until March 22 to decide whether they could agree on a framework for voluntary agreements which would obviate the need for the new directive. 'That is obviously now a possibility,' a UNICE spokeswoman said. Although no formal decision has been taken, the European employers are understood already to have opted for this course. According to ETUC, this would accelerate the setting up of works councils in the 1,500 or so trans-European enterprises identified in the original directive. There would be less pressure for their introduction in the UK than if there were a directive. But the ETUC is confident that UK companies on the continent will be part of the scheme, and still anticipates a spillover which will gradually involve companies in the UK itself.</p>

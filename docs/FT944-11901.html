			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (7): A superficial culture - The stock market has halved in dollar terms this year Istanbul has everything an emerging-market investor could want: exotic location, loose regulation and boom-bust price shifts. It is not unusual for average prices to move by 4-5 per cent in a day. It also has all the usual disadvantages: sharp practices, poor disclosure and shaky accounting rules. Liquidity is also a problem with daily turnover of only Dollars 125-160m. Just 10 companies account for over half of turnover. What goes up also come down with a bang: the market index has halved in dollar terms this year, after crashing heavily in April. Turkey's great attraction is the earnings potential of some companies. Migros, the supermarket chain owned by the Koc conglomerate, had a net 3 per cent margin on sales last year - roughly six times more than a comparable company in a mature market. Ciment As, a cement company, had a 1993 net margin of 29 per cent. Last year, big private banks lifted earnings by an average 40 per cent, although profits will fall sharply this year. The stock market is just nine years old, so it is understandable that Turkey should have a superficial equity culture. Mr Albert Nekimken, head of research at brokerage Global Securities, says: 'Even listed companies resist giving information to analysts. They don't care what the price of their shares is. Companies need education. We are doing missionary work.' Although more companies are using the market to raise capital, Istanbul still cannot handle big flotations. Large companies prefer ADR listings in the US, both for prestige reasons and because the local market is too narrow. Brokers hope privatisation will change this, as big state companies come to the market. Istanbul should also become more mature as international investors increase their presence. According to Mr Serhat Gurleyen, head of research at the broking arm of TEB, an Istanbul bank, foreigners hold about 20-25 per cent of the market's free float. Only about 17 per cent of the Dollars 21.28bn market capitalisation is traded, giving foreign participants a mere Dollars 904.4m exposure to Turkey. The Istanbul Stock Exchange is modernising its operations. Electronic trading, currently used only for the most liquid companies, will cover all shares. Settlement and custody will become fully electronic. It is thinking of introducing a wholesale market. It also wants to link up with the even newer markets of the former Soviet central Asian republics. It has applied to the government for offshore status to become a regional financial centre. Commissions are deregulated, varying between 0.3-0.7 per cent. There is no restriction on holdings by foreigners, although they do not have voting rights. Foreigners pay no tax. Although highly unstable, the lira is fully convertible. There are no exchange controls.</p>

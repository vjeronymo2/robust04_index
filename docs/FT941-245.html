			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profit declines at Bobst for second year in a row Bobst, the Swiss packaging machinery group, suffered a second successive profit decline last year, with consolidated net income down 31 per cent to SFr44.9m (Dollars 31.6m). However, the directors have decided to maintain the dividends, and are forecasting an improvement in both turnover and profit in the current year. The group, which specialises in machines for forming and decorating cardboard, has been hit by reduced business in Europe and Japan. But order inflow has improved since last autumn. Consolidated sales fell 7.9 per cent last year to SFr932.7m and cash flow sank 21.5 per cent to SFr90.8m. Lindt und Sprungli, the Swiss fine chocolate group, said its 1993 net profit rose 4.2 per cent to SFr39.8m on sales up 11.2 per cent to SFr1.2bn. Dividends are to be raised 2 per cent. Mr Rudolph Sprungli, chairman, said he was confident of further growth in the current year.</p>

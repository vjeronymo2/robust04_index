			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOURCES OF FIBER  </P> <P> Question: I've been told that if a person tends to be constipated, it would be  a good idea to increase the amount of fiber in the diet.  </P> <P> I've also been told that fiber can be found in fruits and vegetables as well as  in cereals. My question is: Which foods would it be better to have to prevent  constipation?  </P> <P> Answer: In general, cereal grains are more effective in alleviating  constipation than are fruits and vegetables. If you increase the amount of  fiber in your diet, you should be certain to maintain an adequate intake of  liquids, since fiber absorbs water in the intestine.  </P></p>

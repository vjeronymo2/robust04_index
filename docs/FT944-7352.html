			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Beirut blames Paris on air deal A Lebanese parliamentary committee said yesterday the French government was responsible for Beirut's loss of millions of dollars in a 1983 helicopter deal, and demanded Paris investigate the case. The committee investigating the deal said it wanted Beirut 'officially to ask the French government, which bears responsibility for breaching the contract, to uncover the identity of French accomplices with Lebanese officials'. Under the agreement Lebanon paid for six French Puma helicopters but received much cheaper Romanian-assembled ones from Paris. The committee said it wanted the Lebanese government to hold Paris responsible for the loss resulting from the deal - put by one committee source at about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m). It said it was holding General Ibrahim Tannous, former head of the Lebanese army, 'responsible for negligence' resulting from the deal, known locally as the Puma Scandal.</p>

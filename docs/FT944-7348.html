			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Shipowners see threat to US oil supply The threat of a US oil shortage this winter has increased in recent weeks despite urgent efforts by shipowners and the insurance industry to find a solution to tough new financial liability rules on tankers. With just over one month before the December 28 deadline for tanker owners to prove that they could meet the financial consequences of an oil spill, pressure is increasing on both the shipping industry and the US administration. The US Coastguard has approved the financial liability arrangements made by the owners of nearly 300 tankers but this is only one third of the number needed to maintain oil shipments to the US, shipowners said yesterday. Intertanko, an organisation representing many of the world's independent tanker owners, has written to Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, calling for urgent action to prevent 'profound economic disruption' to the international tanker community and the US economy. Attempts to persuade the coastguard to delay implementation of the deadline have been unsuccessful. Mr Miles Kulukundis, chairman of Intertanko, called upon Mr Pena in a letter released yesterday to allow 'a reasonable extension' to the deadline. 'The danger to the US is immediate,' Mr Kulukundis warned. 'The maritime supply lines that provide the US with petroleum extend thousands of miles. . . Voyage times run close to 40 days. The markets are already showing signs of dislocation.' Two insurance schemes to provide additional cover to oil tanker owners have been accepted by the US authorities, but shipowners remain concerned that these are insufficient to cover the costs which could arise from an oil spill. The problems arose following a tightening of rules governing financial liability in the wake of the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster off Alaska in 1989. The US Coastguard has set higher limits on the 'certificates of financial responsibility' for shipowners from December 28. The limits have been increased to Dollars 1,500 per gross registered ton per year, but if a court finds a shipowner or tanker captain has committed gross negligence, the liability could be unlimited. Intertanko fears that a minor act of negligence leading to an oil spill could be treated as 'gross negligence' by the US courts. The US Coastguard National Pollution Funds Centre said it had issued a further 195 certificates of financial responsibility, bringing the total available to tanker owners to 296. Companies which have now obtained certificates include Shell International Shipping for 44 vessels, Bergesen for 40 vessels and Union Carbide Corporation for one vessel. But Intertanko calculates that the US needs about 1,000 tankers to meet its oil requirements. The insurance schemes which have obtained approval are First Line, arranged by Stockton Reinsurance of Bermuda, which will provide cover of up to Dollars 150m though a higher limit is being sought, and OPAClub, a mutual liability arrangement created by brokers Willis Corroon and Sedgwick Marine, which plans to provide cover to Dollars 250m. A third arrangement, Shoreline Mutual Management, would provide Dollars 300m of cover on top of the Dollars 700m available to shipowners through their protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) club, the traditional method of obtaining cover. But it has yet to win approval. The problem with the insurance schemes which have been devised is that shipowners fear a court might still be able to pin higher financial liabilities on them or their P&amp;I Club, said Mr Chris Horrocks, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping.</p>

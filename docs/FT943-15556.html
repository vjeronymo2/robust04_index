			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Smith New Court holds back the tide for brokers Smith New Court, the UK securities house, announced yesterday it would accommodate private client stockbrokers 'for a transitory period' following the move to 10-day rolling settlement on July 18. The move is likely to prompt other UK marketmakers, who are keen to retain their share of the private client stockbroking order flow, to match the offer. Smith New Court said that from July 18 it would offer a facility for these stockbrokers to request special settlement at the point of execution if Trade Date plus 10 is not suitable. They will not be charged additional interest for a longer settlement period. Settlement is the process by which shares are delivered to a buyer in exchange for delivery of payment. From July 18, UK securities bargains will settle 10 business days after they are struck, a departure from the current position in which trades settle as a block within two- or three-week settlement periods. While institutional investors are expected to make the switch to 10-day rolling settlement with ease, some private client stockbrokers fear it will create difficulties for retail investors. Some fear they will not be able to remit cash to their stockbroker in time to pay for shares within 10 business days, nor may they be able to deliver share certificates on time.</p>

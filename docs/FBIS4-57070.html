			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Walter Lima from the Federal Police </F> headquarters in Brasilia -- live]    [Text] Today at dawn, the Army surrounded the Federal  Police [PF] headquarters in Brasilia. The Army surrounded the  perimeter of the Federal Police installations at about 0100  today. The Army surrounded the PF headquarters in the Southern  Autarky [State autonomous organizations] block of Brasilia, the  PF regional office at the southern police block, and the PF  office at the Justice Ministry, strategically stationing men  armed with rifles and submachine guns and accompanied by German  shepherds.    The area here in the Southern Autarky sector is isolated.  Both drivers and pedestrians must identify themselves if they  want to go through any of the isolation cordons. Traffic has  been diverted from the area.    The situation here is so far apparently calm. There is great  expectation over the arrival of the PF members on strike. There  are nearly 1,000 soldiers stationed here in the PF headquarters.  A short while ago reinforcements arrived in two trucks and a  jeep.    We will have more information from the Southern Autarky  block  where Army troops surrounded the perimeter of the PF  headquarters in Brasilia.</p>

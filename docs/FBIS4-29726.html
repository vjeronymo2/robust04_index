			<p>BFN     [Text] In order to make it more convenient for Chinese in  southwest China to visit Thailand and following the approval of  the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Thai Foreign Ministry decided  to open a consulate general in Kunming City of Yunnan Province  on 1 July. The consulate general will be responsible for issuing  entry visas for Chinese living in Yunnan and nearby provinces so  that those Chinese who want to travel to Thailand for  sightseeing or visiting their relatives will not have to travel  a long distance to apply for a visa from the Thai Embassy in  Beijing.    Silachai Sulai, director of the Chiang Mai Branch of the  Tourism Authority of Thailand, says that the establishment of  the Thai consulate general in Kunming will help promote the  development of a quadrangular economic, cultural, and tourism  cooperation among Thailand, Burma, Laos, and China.</p>

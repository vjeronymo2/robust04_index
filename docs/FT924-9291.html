			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs hold Major's post-dated cheque  -Ivo Dawnay counts the cost of the prime minister's narrow victory against the Maastricht renegades in the Commons AFTER the party, the bill. Mr John Major's revelation that the Commons will not complete ratification of the Maastricht treaty until after the Danes hold a second referendum, roughly pencilled in for May, looks set to provoke groans on the Continent. There is every possibility that this was the post-dated cheque that bought the three crucial votes which won the embattled prime minister the day. Yesterday, as the Tory Euro-sceptics regrouped, their defectors defended their wounded pride by blaming the brutal tactics of the whips. If a lengthy ratification process was the price Mr Major paid, the quality of his victory is seriously impaired and his ego is not left unbruised. Arguably well short of a U-turn, the concession still bears all the signs of an 11th-hour deal offered even after he had made his speech and found that the voting figures still failed to add up. If that is the case, Mr Major's authority cannot be assumed to be fully rehabilitated. How did the prime minister manage to get himself into such a damaging confrontation - a struggle that at one point left both his own future and that of the treaty itself seriously under threat? With hindsight, the showdown became inevitable when, last June, Mr Major promised Mr Neil Kinnock, then the Labour leader, a routine debate on the bill before it went to committee stage. That was before the Danish referendum and Britain's humiliating ejection from the exchange rate mechanism. After Black Wednesday, Mr Major appeared to have opted for the safer path of holding the debate but putting intensive Commons discussion of the treaty text on the back-burner until after next month's Edinburgh summit. His statement on September 24 that the committee stage of the bill would be postponed to await Danish developments and new language on subsidiarity appeared to satisfy the doubters. However, the warm reception for the prime minister's speech at the annual party conference in Brighton early last month has boosted efforts by the cabinet's pro-European wing to capitalise on the goodwill and take on his enemies within. The still unexplained about-turn that led to this week's debate was provoked at least in part by the attacks on Mr Major's leadership qualities after the row and consequent U-turn over the coal-mine closures. It was further hardened when the Euro-sceptic right objected strenuously to the announcement by Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, that the government would table a substantive - as opposed to purely technical motion - for debate. That move provoked Lord Tebbit, the fiercely anti-Maastricht former party chairman, to launch a direct and undisguised dismissal of the prime minister's personal commitment to ratification. He suggested, woundingly: 'Maastricht is more important that any individual and therefore whether the prime minister would resign or not is not material in the terms of the debate.' Journalists travelling with Mr Major to El Alamein the following weekend were convinced that it was this remark which provoked the undenied reports that the PM would call an election if his will was thwarted. In the next 10 days, the run-up to the debate became a head-on battle of wills between the two sides. At first the Euro-sceptics appeared to make the running. A meeting of the rightwing 92 Group showed speakers lined up 21 to nine against Mr Major's approach. His apparent election threat was dismissed as 'silly and petulant' by one MP. The following day, Downing Street gave ground, conceding that the prospect of an election was 'not relevant'. But there was no quarter given on the government's determination to table a substantive motion as Mr Major launched a charm offensive from his Commons office. Within a day, Labour's shadow cabinet set the scene for a showdown by committing the party to outright opposition on the grounds that any debate would, in effect, be a vote of confidence in the government and Mr Major. That stance appeared, at least in part, to be vindicated by an ambiguous reply from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. At Foreign Office questions, he said the Commons would have to decide whether it wanted the prime minister to preside over the Edinburgh summit - preserving and extending the influence of Britain in Europe - or whether it did not. Deftly Mr Jack Cunningham, his shadow, ignored the sub-clause and asked: 'How do you expect us to support that?' As tension mounted, Mr Major launched an impassioned and well-received appeal to the backbench 1922 Committee before a weekend of frantic telephone lobbying by the whips. Still the discipline and determination of the anti-treaty lobby remained intact, provoking ever more dire warnings from the cabinet. Raising the stakes, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned that a defeat for the government would leave a 'policy vacuum of incalculable destructiveness'. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, appeared to vindicate Labour's claims further by arguing in a BBC interview on Sunday: 'We have to show confidence not only in the government but in the prime minister.' As the numbers still failed to add up, speculation mounted at Westminster of a behind-the-scenes deal - most probably with the Ulster unionists. Even Mr Major's apparently desperate claim to those trooping into his Commons office that he was 'the biggest Euro-sceptic in the cabinet' failed to deliver the breakthrough. By the day of the debate, the members' lobby resembled a goldfish bowl invaded by sharks as the circling whips pressed their case. Allegations of calls to tearful wives, missions to constituency chairmen and all the other ungentlemanly conduct with which the whips are sometimes associated have all been made. The bottom line was the three votes that won the day - three votes that may prove the most important in Mr Major's career. By the time it comes to a final decision - possibly as late as October next year - the government hopes that an official Labour abstention on the third reading will ensure they are never as vulnerable again. Nonetheless, one tranche of Danegeld has already been paid.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Reprieve for Trident missile The US House of Representatives yesterday defeated an attempt to kill the D-5 nuclear missile, voting by 226-169 to allow the navy to fit the upgraded missile to eight Trident submarines in the Pacific. Congressman Ron Dellums, chairman of the House armed services committee, led the opposition to the Trident missile, built by Lockheed, which he described as 'a relic'. But in a letter to the House President Clinton said ending the D-5 'would severely limit our ability to support the Trident programme which is the backbone of the US deterrent well into the next century'.</p>

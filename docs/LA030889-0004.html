			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CITIZEN OF YEAR MOLESTED BOYS  </P> <P> A Galt civic leader and scoutmaster has admitted that he molested eight boys  and punished some of them by making them stand naked, according to court  documents. Allen Lee Trueman, 42, pleaded no contest to eight felony charges  when he was arraigned in Sacramento Municipal Court. A carpenter, who was named  Galt's Citizen of the Year in 1988 for his volunteer work, Trueman initially  denied molesting the 8- to 14-year-old boys in his home. But court records said  he later told investigators he had bathed some of the boys, tickled their  genitals and made them stand naked when they misbehaved. "I do what I do  because I'm searching for satisfaction," police quoted Trueman as saying. "When  I'm helping the boys, I need to feel needed and loved in return." Trueman told  police he is dropping out of all Scout activities.  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Snack foods move boosts JLI A MOVE into snack foods helped JLI, the food processor and distributor which supplies popcorn to UK film audiences, increase first half pre-tax profit by 61 per cent. It rose from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.84m in the six months ended September 30 1992 and was generated on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 50.9m (Pounds 40.2m). Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said the increases had been achieved within a food sector suffering limited growth, low consumer confidence and margin pressures. He was confident the group would continue to benefit from increasing efficiency and the strategic shift away from low-margin distribution and into food processing. The strongest performance came from the snacks division, built up on the back two rights issues (raising Pounds 20.7m) and three acquisitions in little more than a year. Operating profits rose from Pounds 450,000 last year - which included less than three months of Playtime, the nuts and popcorn group purchased in July 1991 - to Pounds 1.3m. Mr Gottesman said JLI had become the UK's number one processor and supplier of own label nuts with the acquisitions of TG Smith and Golden Twin during the first half. Distribution suffered a decline in sales and profits as the group abandoned low margin business. Operating surplus fell from Pounds 840,000 to Pounds 730,000 on sales Pounds 5.6m lower at Pounds 21.3m. However, operating margins improved from 3.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent. The group expected to benefit from the trend towards more adventurous eating in the UK through the acquisition in late September of Brookerpaks, distributor of high value products such as garlic and ginger. The ingredients division saw profits fall 14 per cent to Pounds 550,000 on sales 38 per cent ahead to Pounds 14.9m. The enlarged share capital depressed earnings per share from 3.4p to 3.2p. The dividend is raised just 0.05p to 1.55p.</p>

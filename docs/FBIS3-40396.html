			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Strategy: Bull Launches Strong </F> Offensive in Facilities Management"--first paragraph is 01  INFORMATIQUE introduction]    [Text] Bull displays European-scale ambitions in facilities  management with the creation of a dedicated subsidiary, Athesa.  It is also refocusing its activities in advanced technologies in  an attempt to turn a profit.    Blitzkrieg, or swift and sudden warfare. While Bull's  operational organization is taking shape, after the breakup of  its activities into 12 divisions, Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the  Bull CEO, sends his troops to storm the market. Fighting to  restore operational balance by the end of 1994, he opens the  game by creating a dedicated FM subsidiary and overhauling  several leading-edge activities (AI and EDI). The State and  France Telecom's contributions (Fr11.1 billion), two thirds of  which is earmarked to pay off the manufacturer's debts, might  also be used to promote development in sectors deemed buoyant.    The FM offensive is by far the strongest. Athesa, the  structure just created, has Europe for its territory, and it  ambitions to achieve sales of Fr3 billion within two years. Bull  will therefore acquire 51 percent of the Athesa International  holding, the remaining shares being divided among three French  financial and industrial investors. Jacques Tordjman, former CEO  of EDS France will be the president of Athesa International and  its subsidiary, Athesa France. "The market is dominated by the  Americans, but there may be a niche for a European group," he  said. Within one month, he should have a full complement of  shareholders, which he is negotiating with the help of Thierry  Breton, the interministerial delegate to telecommuting who is  now Bull's strategy manager and head of the FM division. The  latter will consolidate the results of Athesa and Integris, the  manufacturer's American FM subsidiary. Bulls maneuver in this  sector is in every respect similar to that of IBM, which  entrusted its FM activities to a subsidiary in order to  strengthen Axone when it became its fully-owned subsidiary.    At the start, Athesa International will control three  subsidiaries: Athesa France (a joint subsidiary of CISI  [International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull,  owned 50-50); Athesa Technical Support &amp; Partners [Athesa  TSP]  (100-percent owned); and the Institute for New Technologies  (100-percent owned). Foreign subsidiaries will be added  progressively, starting probably with the United Kingdom, Italy,  and Benelux. Athesa France should be worth Fr400 million, and it  should bring together the activities of CISI Telematics (400  people) and two Bull subsidiaries: Methods and Information  Processing, and SSIG (i.e. 250 people and Fr180 million in  sales). It will be headed by Claude Moireau, the current CEO of  CISI Telematics, and it is designed to be a multiplatform  company (CISI will contribute its IBM hardware and its contract  with the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], worth Fr70 million per  year) and to cover all outsourcing services.    Next to it, Athesa TSP will be in charge of Bull's in-house  data-processing activity (worth an estimated Fr500 million to  Fr1 billion), and it will take over the data processing of the  holding company's shareholders. As for the Institute of New  Technologies, it will be in charge of training the personnel  that Athesa will inherit when it takes over outside sites. By  early January 1993, the holding company should be worth Fr1.2  billion, for a market estimated at Fr4 billion in France and  Fr10 billion in Europe. Jacques Tordjman, who claims paternity  of this project of a European group using French capital, hopes  to attract a clientele of French administrations. Apart from the  Reunion of National Museums, administrations until now have been  wary of subcontracting their data processing to outsiders.    While Bull has great FM ambitions, it is far more pragmatic  in the field of advanced technologies. The Cediag, a body  specialized in artificial intelligence, is now a full-fledged  Bull subsidiary. According to Herve Yahi, the Cediag manager, it  is dedicated to "solutions that make it possible to automate  complex corporate functions" and will no longer develop  software; software development will be subcontracted to  outsiders. Reduced to a team of 60 for sales of Fr40 million,  Cediag should be profitable by the end of the year. Finally, the  computer-data exchange activity, the sale of which was mentioned  by labor unions, will be assigned to Bull Engineering, a Bull  France subsidiary.</p>

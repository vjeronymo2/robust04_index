			<p>SUMMARY:        February and March editions of the Phnom Penh daily  REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reported continuing problems with Vietnam over  the demarcation of the Cambodian-Vietnamese border and with the  influx of ethnic Vietnamese, who allegedly engage in illegal  logging, fishing, and farming.  The paper indicated that local  officials are considering measures to address these problems.      Reflecting Cambodian concern over border issues with Vietnam, the  12 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA quoted State Secretary of the Ministry  of the Interior (MOT) Khan Savoeun telling Mondolkiri provincial  officials that "a national security force and a provincial security  force would be formed as soon as possible" for duty along the  border.  According to the paper, Khan Savoeun went on to say that  "all issues pertaining to missing markers along the border must be  revisited."      In line with Phnom Penh's attempt to deal with the influx of  ethnic Vietnamese, an article in the 27 February REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA  reported that the new Cambodian immigration law--which draws on laws  in effect during former Sihanoukist, Lon Nol, and State of Cambodia  regimes--"will give the MOT full authority to expel illegal  immigrants and protect the livelihoods of those in Cambodia  legally."  The article cited an unnamed MOT official as saying that  the law "is not just for Vietnamese, but applies to all foreigners."  The paper noted that 5,000 Vietnamese are waiting in boats along the  SRV border.  The article said that these people--many of whom fled  Cambodia following Khmer Rouge attacks in 1993--claimed to have  documentation verifying Cambodian citizenship, long-term residence  in Cambodia, and fluency in Cambodian, adding that they expect to  return when the new law is promulgated.  The paper cited an unnamed  analyst as saying that the new law "should solve the Vietnamese  settler problem" but that negotiations will have to be held with SRV  immigration authorities to return illegals to the SRV.      A 3,000-word article in the 5 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA that  extensively quoted a Pursat Province subdistrict official's remarks  on the continuing influx of Vietnamese immigrants served to  underscore longstanding ethnic Khmer fears of Vietnamese  encroachment.  The official, according to the article, estimated  that his jurisdiction's population is about 80 percent Vietnamese  and that 60-70 percent of them are undocumented.  The article ended  with the observation that the ethnic Khmer in the subdistrict live  in poverty "while the Yuon [pejorative for Vietnamese] live in  proper houses and accumulate lots of money."      Complaints about a Vietnamese influx were also given front page  coverage in a 10 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA article.  The article  quoted an unnamed Kandal Province agriculture official as saying  that immigrants are "farming dozen of hectares" of prime land in Koh  Thom District, opposite the SRV's Ben Tre Province.  The article was  accompanied by a photograph of boats lashed together below a  headline that read "Chrei Thom and Prek Chrei:  Khmer or Yuon  Territory?"  The article cited the agriculture official as saying  "there is no sign that the Vietnamese have stopped coming," although  Kandal's governor has negotiated extensively with Ben Tre  authorities on the problem.  According to the article, Vietnamese  families in Prek Chrei Subdistrict outnumber the Cambodians nearly  10 to one, "and that doesn't include those living on boats."  The  article added that Vietnamese living there grow peanuts and corn and  take the crops back to Vietnam.  The article went on to cite a Khmer  villager as complaining that all the good, flat land has been taken  by the "Yuon" while the Khmer are left with the marginal, hilly  areas.  Noting that the majority of the Vietnamese settlers have  Cambodian identity cards, the article cited a villager as blaming  local authorities and the military for this situation and as saying  that many Khmer natives "have been forced to leave because they  can't live with the Yuon."      The 12 March article also reflected Cambodian fears about  Vietnamese encroachment.  The apaper quoted an unnamed Mondolkiri  Province police official as claiming that "hundreds of Yuon  nationals are illegally logging 40 kilometers inside Cambodian  territory" and that "armed units are protecting them."

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gloomy outlook for Continental Mr Robert Ferguson, chief executive officer of Continental Airlines of the US, said yesterday that he did not expect the airline to be profitable for 1994, Reuter reports from Houston. Mr Ferguson was responding to a question after the annual meeting about whether the Houston-based carrier would be profitable for the year. But he added that he expected the airline to achieve sustained profitability in 1995. Mr Ferguson also expected the first phase of the new no-frills, short-haul service, nicknamed Calite, to be profitable this summer and looked for expansion in the autumn.</p>

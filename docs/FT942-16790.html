			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / People: Henry Cooke Lumsden David Adams is to leave Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based stockbroking and financial services group. A former chief executive, he says the parting is 'amicable', but is precluded from saying more. Most members of the northern network of professionals are interpreting this as the push after a rocky 1990s. First, Cooke's merchant banking arm - Edington - was shut down by the Bank of England; in the general crisis of confidence in small deposit-takers three years ago some local authorities withdrew deposits, which damaged liquidity. A successful receivership has so far returned 85p in the pound to depositors, with at least another 5p due this year. This has helped save both Cooke's and Adams' reputations, but the core stockbroking business suffered badly from low trading volumes in the recession. The market stirred just in time to avert serious redundancies, but a wounded Cooke then had merger discussions with the Birmingham-based Albert E. Sharp. These foundered, but Sharp now has a Manchester office, run by some former Cooke's people - a thorn in Cooke's side. Field Walton, a former Cazenove stockbroker, became chairman late last year. Cooke has now been reorganised into divisions catering for private clients, institutions, corporate finance and management of unit trusts and Peps, each with its own chief. Adams was shunted sideways to become finance director. His departure confirms people's suspicions this was not an entirely happy arrangement. 'Once you have been the boss, it's difficult not to go on being the boss,' Adams let slip to a friend. He is 50 and on the look-out. Influential contacts include Joe Dwek, chairman of Bodycote and his brother-in-law. He is also one of the leading activists behind Manchester's emergence as a European regional financial centre.</p>

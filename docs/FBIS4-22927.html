Kirov, St. Petersburg; UDC 616.8-009.2-02:616.831-001-092.9-085]    [Abstract] The difficulty of correcting stable motor  function disorders due to the central motor system impairment of  varying origin and the scarcity of data on the pathogenic  mechanisms of these disorders prompted an extended research  effort aimed at establishing the molecular-chemical mechanisms  which underlie the so-called pyramid syndrome conducted at the  Physiology Department of the I.P. Pavlov Institute. It  established the specific neurohumoral factors capable, if  injected to intact animals, of inducing motor disorders similar  to those of the donor. There factors became known that the  postural asymmetry factors (FPA) present in the cerebrospinal  fluid (TsSZh). Special studies reveal that the postural  asymmetry factor activity is blocked by a high-molecular peptide  factor referred to as the inactivation factor (FI). The role of  the specific brain peptide factors in the pathogenesis of, and  compensation for, neurological disorders and the outlook for  using them in the nervous disease treatment are investigated,  and a new method is proposed on the basis of the experimental  and theoretical work of Institute personnel (which have been  issued patent No. 365 on 11 May 89 by the State Committee on  Inventions and Discoveries). The method is based on using the  donor liquor from patients who have convalesced well. To this  end, the clinical effectiveness of the proposed method was  examined using a contingent of patients with rather severe  disorders; the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with a good  recovery history was used as the donor liquor. The conclusion is  drawn that liquor therapy is a promising treatment method for  some disorders and that the hypothesis that the ligands search  for the liquor of own receptors can be confirmed. It is noted  that basic research into the molecular-chemical mechanisms of  pathogenetic and compensatory brain processes make it possible  not only to widen the scope of theoretical notions in the field  of neuropathology but also to use them effectively in clinical  practices.

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: The price is right The combination of excellent news on UK retail price inflation and Tuesday's increase in US interest rates was just what the UK stock market wanted to hear. An early rise in British interest rates is now both unlikely and unnecessary. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve's crackdown on US inflationary pressures should cap bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic. Though gilts closed off their highs last night as European markets wobbled ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting, equities remained strong. Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, may still be itching to raise base rates. He is rightly concerned to maintain his anti-inflationary credibility with the markets. But the battle against inflation must not eclipse all other economic goals. The objective at this stage of the cycle should be to prolong the upturn for as long as possible. Confidence that inflation will remain subdued is, of course, necessary to persuade industry to invest in new capacity. Yet a premature tightening of monetary policy could also deter industry from expanding its capacity, particularly since another twist of the fiscal screw is due next April. Given the dearth of inflationary signs, a rise in base rates would now be premature. Not only is the underlying retail price inflation rate of 2.2 per cent at its lowest level since the series began in 1975, but wage inflation remains under control while both the housing and car markets are sluggish. At some stage, UK interest rates will have to follow their US counterparts higher. But that time has not yet arrived.</p>

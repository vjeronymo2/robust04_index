			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Drop in NZ inflation beats target THE New Zealand Reserve Bank said yesterday that the country's inflation rate fell more sharply than expected last year, to levels not expected until 1993. The rate was down to minus 0.02 per cent in December, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The bank, which was given responsibility for handling monetary policy in pursuit of low inflation in 1988, was not supposed to achieve nil to 2 per cent inflation until 1993. Releasing the latest six monthly outlook yesterday, the bank governor, Dr Don Brash, said that 'with hindsight, there could be some validity' in accusations that the bank's monetary target settings had been too tight and that this added to business difficulties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 13 May (Notimex) -- There was concern in  Venezuela today due to reports of a plot to stage a coup d'etat  against the administration of President Rafael Caldera, who is  facing growing social unrest.    Newspapers assert that Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias,  leader of the coup attempt in February 1992, has reported that  ranking military officers are planning a coup d'etat.    The report, published in an EL NACIONAL column, pointed out  that the Caldera administration and the economic and political  elite are perfectly aware of the situation and that they even  have the name of a military leader who may be involved in the  conspiracy.    According to columnist Alfredo Pena, Armed Forces officers  told Chavez Frias that a coup d'etat would be staged by high  command members and that the Interior Ministry has been  informed. This is the first rumor that Caldera's administration  has had to deal with, added to which are the remarks of Defense  Minister Rafael Montero, who said today that Venezuela is on the  verge of a civil war.    Although his remarks would seem to point to the armed  attacks  on policemen during a demonstration at a university campus,  analysts have not dismissed the possibility that Montero's  assertion had some other connotation. In the opinion of analyst  Alfredo Pena, "it is all very confusing, and the government  should remain alert. The economic, fiscal, and financial crises  have caused widespread anger among the people, but an  insurrection would not be justified. [no closing quotation mark  as received]    Pena added that the Executive has made serious mistakes in  the handling of the crisis it inherited from the social  democratic administrations of the past 10 years, but that does  not justify the rejection of all attempts to resolve such a  serious problem.    Deputies from the opposition Radical Cause Party (CR) and  the  Movement Toward Socialism requested a thorough investigation to  determine the veracity of Chavez's report and, in any event, to  reveal the names of the people responsible for the plot.    Alfredo Pena said that a military coup at this time would  unleash a series of actions and reactions out of fear and that  there would be a blood bath "because in Venezuela there is no  chance of a plain coup."    In contrast, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said  that,  despite the wave of student demonstrations that degenerated into  riots and plunder during the week, for the time being there is  no possibility of a coup d'etat.    According to the EL NACIONAL columnist, "there are civilian  instigators" who are taking advantage of the wave of marches,  which are also to protest against the high cost of living and  the lack of services.</p>

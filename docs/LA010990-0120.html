			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Direct Decline: McDonnell Douglas Computer System's effort to sell Pick systems  directly to customers, rather than through resellers, was a key factor in  bringing about the company's decline, according to Howarth. McDonnell Douglas  has laid off 100 of the 450 workers at its Santa Ana computer unit, and the  entire operation will probably be transferred to the United Kingdom next year.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas pioneered Pick through a computer subsidiary in the 1970s and  remains one of the largest vendors of Pick products. But Howarth said the  company made a key strategic error in trying to sell the system directly to  customers and was unable to make the eventual transition to indirect sales  effectively.

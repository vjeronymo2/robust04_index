According to the communique, a delegation of Hanminjon led  by  vice-chairman of its Central Committee Hong Chi-yong visited  Belgium in late November last year and held two rounds of talks  with a delegation of the Belgian Labour Party led by chairman of  its Central Committee Ludo Martens.    At the talks, Hanminjon expressed support and solidarity for  the Belgian party's struggle for the interests of the working  class and other working masses, social progress and world peace  and noted with appreciation that the Belgian party was striving  to implement the Pyongyang declaration after signing it.    The Belgian Labour Party recognised Hanminjon guided by the  chuche idea as the organisation representing the desire and will  of the South Korean people and the patriotic vanguard of the  movement for a change in South Korea and highly estimated the  South Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy and  reunification. It also urged the South Korean authorities to  stop their acts of dependence, fascism, division and war.    The Belgian Labour Party recognised "10-point programme of  the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  country" put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song  as the best way of removing the danger of catastrophic war and  tragic division and achieving peace and reunification on the  Korean peninsula, and expressed support and solidarity for the  struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people to realise the  10-point programme.    Hanminjon and the Belgian Labour Party published a joint  statement expressing their will to support and closely cooperate  with each other on the principles of independence, mutual  respect and non-interference in other's internal affairs and  further develop inter-party relations through expanded mutual  contacts.    The Hanminjon delegation also visited Switzerland where it  held talks with a delegation of ohe Workers' Party of  Switzerland led by President Josef Zisyadis and with former  mayor of Geneva Roger Dafflon who is Politburo member of the  Workers' Party of Switzerland, president Edith Ballantyne and  the general secretary of the International League of Women for  Peace and Freedom, and others.</p>

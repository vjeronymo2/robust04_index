			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  said on Wednesday [1 June] -- International Children's Day --  that his government was committed to a comprehensive programme  that would ensure security, rights and privileges for children  in line with the UN declaration on the rights of the child. He  said in a statement the government had already begun  implementation of various programmes, first announced in  parliament, to realise these objectives.    They include:     -  free medical care in state hospitals and clinics for  children under six years of age;    -  a nutritional feeding scheme in primary schools;    -  a detailed programme to be announced soon to empty the  country's jails of children and to provide alternative care  centres;    -  legislation introducing free and quality education for all  children to be introduced at the next parliamentary session;    -  urgent attention being given to address the plight of  homeless  street children; and,    -  legislation on the eradication of child abuse and child  labour  to be processed with deliberate speed.        "On this day, we also extend our solidarity with children  throughout the world whose lives are ravaged by the scourges of  hunger, war and ignorance. We commit ourselves to contribute to  the best of our ability to the international efforts aimed at  resolving these problems," Mr Mandela said.</p>

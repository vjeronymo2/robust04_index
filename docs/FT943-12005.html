			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Placer Pacific figures improve before tax Placer Pacific, the Sydney-based mining group which is controlled by Canada's Placer Dome but quoted separately on the Australian stock exchange, yesterday reported after-tax profits of ADollars 41.3m (USDollars 30.8m) in the six months to end-June, down from ADollars 50.4m a year ago. The company said, however, that the 1993 figures had been boosted by tax adjustments, totalling ADollars 33.7m. At pre-tax level, and before outside equity interests in earnings, Placer Pacific's operating profits rose to ADollars 72.9m, compared with ADollars 37.4m in the previous year. The company said higher gold production and sales, and lower operating costs and depreciation charges explained the improvement. The average price received per ounce of gold was ADollars 544 in the six-month period, ADollars 38 higher than in the first six months of 1993-94. Placer, operator of the large Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, also revealed that estimated reserves there have been increased to 9.4m ounces of gold, from 8.5m previously. It said the upgrading of the reserves was due 'mainly to the increase in the resource reported in the May 1993 update and additional underground reserves in the West Zone stopes'. Placer Pacific holds a 25 per cent stake in the mine, with Highlands Gold (which is controlled by Queensland's MIM), Renison Goldfields and the PNG government having similar one-quarter interests.</p>

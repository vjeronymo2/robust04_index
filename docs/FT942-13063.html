			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Shares and rand rise to occasion Capping a volatile run-up to South Africa's first all-race elections, which has at various times seen the Johannesburg stock exchange hit new highs and the currency crash to record lows, the markets reacted with palpable relief to the start of voting as the industrial index closed 226 points up at a new all-time high of 6,257, a rise of nearly 4 per cent on the day. In a wave of across-the-board buying, the market shrugged off news of the rash of bombings round the country, and a bomb threat to the exchange itself, as some blue-chip shares rose as much as 10 per cent. The gold index, which has been under pressure from a weaker bullion price, rose 60 points to 1,906, while the overall index closed at 5,240, a rise of 172 points. The financial rand, the currency used for transactions by non-residents and the best barometer of foreign sentiment, also had a good day, closing at R4.68 to the dollar, 5 per cent up on Monday and nearly 20 per cent up on the record low of R5.71 reached only three weeks ag - after the initial failure of talks to bring Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party into the election. The commercial rand, the trading currency, strengthened to R3.58 from R3.614, while long bond yields dipped further to 12.69 per cent from a recent high of 13.39 per cent reached after the summit failure. There had been concern among dealers that news of bomb blasts in Johannesburg and the nearby town of Germiston might cause jittery foreign investors to sell their holdings, but when it was clear that no one was panicking both local and international buyers started looking around for bargains. 'The market seems to have decided that the election was going to take place whatever happened, so people who were a little underinvested wanted to get on board,' said Mr Richard Jesse of stockbroker Martin and Co. The business community seems to have already discounted the possibility of right-wing violence, regarding unrest as inevitable but unlikely to have a serious bearing on political or economic events. Despite the upbeat mood, analysts agree that the market is still largely driven by political factors, and will continue to be jumpy until the final results are known and business can begin to come to terms with the economic policies of the new government. 'The key phrase is still cautious optimism,' said Mr Tony Twine, an economist at consultant Econometrix. He said business was relieved to have reached the election, but will wait to see 'the new set of rules' and who the main players will be.</p>

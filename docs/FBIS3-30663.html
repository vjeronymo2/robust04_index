He said he saw success of his own and of Czech foreign  policy  in the Security Council mainly in the fact that now the other  countries in the Council "view the Czech Republic in a different  way than a month ago." Kovanda said he succeeded in  intentionally reducing the Council's talks, but increasing their  efficiency, though this was hampered by a slower pace of some  Council's member countries.    "The Security Council proceeds ahead in line with the  slowest  of those essentially interested in the problem discussed,"  Kovanda explained, adding while in his post, he became aware of  the extent of control exerted over the chairman by the Council's  other members: "Some topics I originally believed to be  partially settled during the month of the Czech chairmanship,  have not been taken up at all, or only marginally," he stated.    Things were similar with the talks on specific world  problems: "When we adopted the chairman's statement on Bosnia,  journalists asked me what good another statement would be -- the  Serbians would laugh at it and it would be of no help to  Bosnians. And I could only agree with them. But if a group of  the Council's members submits a proposal or request that the  chairman issue a statement, how can this be prevented?," Kovanda  said.    It is a "tough reality" of present world that the Security  Council's possibilities are limited, and can be further  restricted with the decline in countries' willingness to support  the council, including by offering their soldiers. "If member  countries do not offer their soldiers, it is impossible for the  Security Council to send anybody anywhere," Kovanda stated. As  an example he gave the case of Somalia. After many countries  announced their intention to withdraw soldiers from there, the  UN Secretary General asked all 42 countries to offer their  soldiers. All of them refused to do so.    On the other hand, in the past there was insufficient link  between the Council's political resolutions and the rules  enabling soldiers in the field to fulfill these resolutions with  less or more success. "I think that the link between the  Council's activities and the views and troubles of the countries  offering soldiers is one of the ways to lessen the differences  between what the Council would like and what is feasible,"  Kovanda said.    He himself presented such a diplomatic initiative in the  form  of a coordination meeting between the Council and the countries  with soldiers stationed in Somalia.</p>

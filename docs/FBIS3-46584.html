			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] It is expected that full-fledged intracoalition  discussions on the issue of how to secure sources of revenue to  make up for a revenue shortfall resulting from the income tax  cut, which the Hosokawa Government plans as a prop of its  economic stimulus measures, will begin early in the new year.  However, there is a growing voice within the ruling parties,  including in the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], that  the Finance Ministry-proposed hike in the consumption tax rate  should not be included in the immediate economic pump-priming  measures. For that reason, there is a view that the government  will make a political decision on this issue with emphasis on  ensuring the unity of the ruling parties.    The ruling coalition government is scheduled to resume  sessions of the economic affairs consultation council, which is  composed of representatives from each of the ruling parties,  starting on 5 January in hopes of reaching a certain conclusion  -- it is hoped by the middle of January -- on the issue of  cutting the income tax and raising the consumption tax. In this  connection, the Finance Ministry insists that the decision  should be made to raise the consumption tax simultaneously with  the income tax cuts on the grounds that even if the income tax  cut is carried out before the consumption tax is raised, it is  necessary to decide in the council session on the timing of  raising the consumption tax.    On the contrary, the SDPJ, the largest party in the ruling  coalition, is strongly opposed to a hike in the consumption tax,  saying that sources of revenue should be obtained by issuing  deficit-covering bonds. In addition, some SDPJ member are  saying that the party should leave the coalition depending on  the situation. There is another opinion within the other ruling  parties that although it is inevitable that there will need to  be a study of a possible increase in the consumption tax as a  source of revenue for the future improvement of the welfare  system, the issue of raising the consumption tax should be  discussed separately from the issue of the tax cut, which the  government plans to include in its immediate economic stimulus  measures.    In this way, there are opinions within the ruling parties  opposing the simultaneous implementation of the tax cut and the  hike in the consumption tax, and therefore, work for an  intracoalition coordination of views on this issue is expected  to be rough sailing. In this sense, a view has also been  expressed that Prime Minister Hosokawa will make a political  decision with emphasis on how the deliberation of political  reform bills -- wherein attention has been focused on the SDPJ's  move -- will develop and on the unity of the ruling partners.</p>

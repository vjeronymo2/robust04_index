			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 3 (AFP)--China will only go so far  to ensure its re-entry into GATT and will revive import controls  should its bid to rejoin the world body be rejected, a senior  foreign trade ministry official was quoted as warning Sunday [3  April]. "The bottom line is equal treatment," said the foreign  trade ministry's deputy director for international relations, Li  Longzhou, who stressed that China was not so desperate that it  would pay any price for GATT membership. Li also accused some  of China's major trading partners -- especially the United  States -- of using the GATT membership issue to extract  unreasonable concessions from Beijing.    While admitting that a rejection of China's bid would hurt  the country's trade expansion and slow the pace of reform, Li  said steps could be taken to ensure China's global  competitiveness if it were left outside GATT. "A passive return  to import substitution (a measure to restrict imports) in  parallel with continued investment incentives may actually  encourage greater foreign investment (in China) because local  production would then be favoured over imports," the CHINA DAILY  BUSINESS WEEKLY quoted Li as saying. "The world trade community  has a choice between accepting China as an equal trading partner  by granting it GATT membership, or competing for access to the  Chinese market on a reciprocal basis," he added.    Li also slammed the United States for making the renewal in  June of China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status  conditional on progress in Beijing's human rights record.  "China hopes to obtain unconditional MFN treatment equivalent  to that accorded to all other contracting parties by  participating in GATT," Li said, adding that by attaching human  rights conditions to MFN, Washington was going against the  spirit of the world trade body.    As a purely economic issue, China's re-entry to GATT "has  been complicated by non-economic factors and the negotiation has  been delayed for an unwarranted period," Li said. The United  States was one of the few member states that did not support  early Chinese re- entry to GATT at the 16th session of the GATT  Working Party on China held in Geneva next month, Li noted. A  founding member of GATT, China withdrew in 1949 after the  communists came to power.    Li also criticised some trading partners for demanding China  eliminate all non-tariff trade barriers "while they themselves  maintain quantitative restrictions on thousands of items such as  textiles and clothing, agricultural products, steel and  footwear." In the case of increased protection against Chinese  goods, "China will be forced to reduce imports in order to  balance its foreign trade," Li stressed.</p>

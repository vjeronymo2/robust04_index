			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> A NEW BOSS FOR NEW YORK?;  </P> <P> YANKEES: STEINBRENNER WANTS TO TURN DAILY OPERATION OF THE TEAM OVER TO HIS  SON, FRANK  </P> <P> Will the new Boss be the son of the old Boss?  </P> <P> If George Steinbrenner turns over day-to-day operations of the New York Yankees  to his 33-year-old son Hank, more than the names may remain the same.  </P> <P> Hank Steinbrenner started in baseball as a 13-year-old recommending trades and  second-guessing Yankee management -- including his father -- on player moves  and manager selection.  </P> <P> Sound familiar?  </P> <P> "I was a statistical freak," he once said. "Like most kids I studied the  boxscores and the averages every day. And every so often, I'd make suggestions  to George."  </P> <P> He has been credited for the Yankees' 1976 acquisition of pitcher Doyle  Alexander from Baltimore. In 1986, when the Yankees hired Lou Piniella as  manager, Hank was also involved.  </P> <P> And current Yankee manager Stump Merrill shouldn't feel a sudden surge of job  security just because George was forced by baseball to give up day-to-day  control of the team.  </P> <P> Though father Steinbrenner made 18 managerial changes in 18 years, little  Steinbrenner spoke up in 1985 when dad was debating whether to fire Billy  Martin after a barroom brawl.  </P> <P> "If you want to fire Billy, don't use the Baltimore fights as an excuse," Hank  said at the time, according to a New York Times story. "Use the way he messed  up the pitching staff and the moves he made late in the season."  </P> <P> Harvey Greene, who was a team spokesman at the time, said that although the  younger Steinbrenner never held an official capacity with the team, "he was  involved in minor league operations."  </P> <P> If nothing else is known about him, Hank Steinbrenner has already shown a  capacity for honesty. When he was asked a few years ago how to improve the  team, he said: "Get rid of my father."  </P></p>

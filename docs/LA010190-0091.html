			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-AGENT'S TIES TO NORIEGA GIVE ISRAELIS PAUSE;  </P> <P> MERCENARIES: MIKE HARARI ONCE WORKED FOR MOSSAD. BUT HE BECAME THE PANAMA  STRONGMAN'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.  </P> <P> The news proved false, but a report last week that Mike Harari, an Israeli  mercenary and right-hand man to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega,  was under arrest caused brief anxiety among government officials here.  </P> <P> Harari is a former agent in the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, who  gained prominence as a figure in business and arms dealings between Israel and  Panama, of which he was reported to take hefty commissions. Harari also trained  anti-terrorist and private security squads for Noriega.  </P> <P> Israeli diplomats in Panama and American congressmen have warned Israel on  several occasions that if Noriega and Washington collided, Harari could prove  to be an embarrassment.  </P> <P> Before word arrived that U.S. troops had in fact not detained Harari, officials  here had already moved to disown him. Whatever he was doing, he was doing it on  his own, they insisted.  </P> <P> "He is a private citizen. As far as I know, he has no connection with the  government of Israel," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> Relatives of Harari say that he is in Israel, Israel Radio reported last week.  It is not yet clear whether Harari would face charges in Panama if he were  captured.  </P> <P> Harari, 62, is the second prominent Israeli whose tangled relationships with  suspected Latin American drug dealers made Israel blush last year. Officials in  Colombia accused Yair Klein, a retired army colonel, of training killers on  behalf of cocaine smugglers. Klein said he was training cattle ranchers to  defend themselves against terrorists.  </P> <P> The Harari and Klein cases had another common thread: Both men evidently traded  on skills that have limited marketability in their home country, once their  official services ended. There are more than 800 Israeli companies that export  anti-terrorist, paramilitary and security training overseas; most are manned by  former soldiers and intelligence agents.  </P> <P> Harari's long career with the Mossad included some of the agency's most deadly  missions. He headed a force of "hit squads" to kill Palestinian terrorists in  Europe. Harari's Mossad career seemed at an end when, in the mid-1970s, one of  the hit squads mistook a Moroccan waiter in Norway for an Arab terrorist and  shot him dead.  </P> <P> Harari also served as Mossad chief for Mexico and Central America before  retiring in the late 1970s. After leaving the Mossad, Harari managed a large  insurance firm for a while, published reports here said.  </P> <P> As early as 1983, Harari was reported to be selling arms to Panama. An Israeli  partnership that included Harari won a contract to harvest lumber in Panama,  and he was a middleman in deals that led to Israeli participation in public  works and telephone projects in Panama.  </P> <P> In 1987, Harari appeared in Jerusalem with credentials from the Panamanian  government appointing him honorary consul in Israel, and he headed Panama's  commercial mission here. That same year, he was photographed -- wearing his  trademark aviator sunglasses -- escorting Panama's civilian president at that  time, Eric A. Delvalle, around Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Israeli newspapers reported that businessmen here resented Harari because they  said he demanded participation in any dealings with Panama. "Mister 60%," his  detractors called him. In 1988, Jose Blandon, Noriega's former consul in New  York, told U.S. congressional investigators that Harari managed arms-smuggling  operations for Noriega.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Israeli newspapers reported that Washington asked Israel to  recall Harari from Panama, but Jerusalem responded that it had no control over  him. But intelligence observers point out that it is rare for former Mossad  officials to completely sever their links with the intelligence agency.  </P> <P> "It would strain relations with the U.S. if someone working for Israel was also  undermining the Americans in a place like Panama," said one observer.  </P></p>

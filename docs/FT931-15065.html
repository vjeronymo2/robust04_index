			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / EC's chemical industry faces a difficult year EUROPE'S chemical industry faces a tough year, with production growth rates slowing, exports falling and companies unable to push through meaningful prices rises. The European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) warned yesterday that profit improvements would only be generated through cost cutting, particularly labour. Employment in the chemical industry, which fell 1.4 per cent last year, is set to drop a further 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months, it predicted in its annual forecast. Cefic estimates 2.1m people are directly employed by the industry in Europe. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist of Imperial Chemical Industries, as well as chairman of Cefic's economic appraisal committee, said output of chemicals had been surprisingly strong last year, growing at 2 per cent. But the large additions to capacity, particularly in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France, had led to a significant build-up of stocks. These were still rising from relatively high levels. The weakening economies of west Germany, France and Spain would provide little to help the industry. Cefic estimated that West European GDP would grow at only 1 per cent this year. The outlook for manufacturing output of all European industry was bleak, and would fall 0.2 per cent by volume during 1993, said Mr Freeman. West German manufacturing output would fall 2 per cent over the same period, he added. Demand for chemicals would rise only 0.9 per cent next year. Prospects for the chemical industry were not promising, said Mr Freeman. In Europe, the US and Japan, chemical production was flat or on a downward trend. US chemical production is set to fall from 5 per cent last year to 4.6 per cent over the next 12 months, although Mr Freeman said this would require a marked improvement in conditions over the next few months. Japanese production was static last year but will increase 1 per cent this year. West European chemical production increased 2.2 per cent in 1992, but will fall to only 1 per cent this year. West German production will be static, while production should grow at 2.1 per cent in France, 0.4 per cent in Italy, 1.5 per cent in the UK, 4 per cent in Belgium, and 2.5 per cent in the Netherlands. Spain's production will fall 1 per cent. All chemical sectors will experience a decline in the rate of growth in production apart from fertilisers and inorganics, according to the forecast. Even pharmaceuticals will slow, mainly because of government measures against drugs prices in Germany and Italy. Sales are expected to rise only 1 per cent in Germany, and will fall 2 per cent in Italy. Europe's chemical industry will be unable to export its way out of trouble. Growth in exports is expected to decline sharply from 4.1 per cent last year to only 2.5 per cent. Prices are likely to be flat in much of Europe, with no rises in west Germany, France and the Netherlands. In the UK and Italy they are expected to rise 3 per cent following devaluations last year. Prices should rise 2 per cent in Belgium, but fall 0.5 per cent in Spain. Employment will fall as chemical groups attempt to control costs. In West Germany and France employment in the chemical industry will fall 1 per cent. In Italy it will drop 1.7 per cent, in the UK 3.3 per cent, the Netherlands 1.9 per cent and Spain 0.2 per cent. In Belgium, it should remain static. Investment in the industry, which fell 4.9 per cent last year to about Ecu22bn (Pounds 17.8bn), is expected to fall another 3 per cent this year.  --------------------------------------------------------          WEST EUROPEAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY OUTLOOK                    (percentage changes)  --------------------------------------------------------                   Prices      Employment     Production  --------------------------------------------------------                  92    93     92      93     92      93  -------------------------------------------------------- West Germany   -2.0   0.0   -1.0    -1.0    1.5     0.0 France         -1.5   0.0   -1.0    -1.0    3.2     2.1 Italy           0.8   3.0   -2.8    -1.7    0.8     0.4 UK              1.7   3.0   -2.0    -3.3    0.5     1.5 Belgium        -1.0   2.0    0.0     0.0    7.5     4.0 Netherlands    -4.5   0.0   -4.0    -1.9    2.5     2.5 Spain          -0.5  -0.5   -0.2    -0.2    2.5    -1.0  -------------------------------------------------------- Figures for 92 are estimates, for 93 are forecasts  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONVICTION OF JOHN POINDEXTER  </P> <P> Fein contends that Poindexter's conviction has "worrisome implications for a  strong executive branch."  </P> <P> I think Poindexter's conviction should be cause for concern to all members of  the executive branch.  </P> <P> It should serve as a reminder to politicians that they need to conduct  themselves with both conscience and respect for the law.  </P> <P> Fein feels that the executive branch needs to have the freedom to operate  outside of the law. He says that there is a whole underworld that merits  "secrecy." I'm sure this is true, but secrecy does not have to include illegal  activity and lies to Congress.  </P> <P> Fein further feels that Poindexter's "patriotic," "official misjudgments" and  "overzealousness" should be overlooked. Apparently Fein does not recognize the  violation that Poindexter's (and Oliver North's) actions effect on the moral  and ideological fabric of this nation.  </P> <P> For the past several years many of us have felt left out of the mainstream of  American life. We have felt frustration in always seemingly being part of the  problem, and hardly ever part of the solution. We have been left with the  impression that the concern of government officials has been self-serving and  that somehow they have been above the law.  </P> <P> The conviction of Poindexter has given us a renewed faith in our system of  justice and in our ability to right past wrongs by government officials.  </P> <P> This should send out a very clear signal to all politicians, both at the  national and local level, that arrogant misuse of power and position will not  be tolerated by the American people. It is a strong signal to the rest of us  that equality under the law is a hallmark of our system.  </P> <P> JUSTO RIVERA  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

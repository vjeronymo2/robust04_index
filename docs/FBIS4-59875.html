			<p>BFN     [Text] The Juba political conference ended in the Bahr  al-Jabal provincial capital today. It issued its resolutions  and recommendations and the Juba declaration document.    The closing session was addressed by Angelo Beda, deputy  speaker of the Transitional National Assembly and chairman of  the conference steering committee, who said that the Juba  conference constitutes a confirmation of national unity, a call  to end the conflict, a prop for ongoing peace efforts, and an  amplification of the voice of the silent majority of the sons of  the south. He stressed that the conference was a means of  strengthening federal rule, the policy adopted by the national  salvation resolution to rebuild the country. Mr. Beda said the  blend of cultures and different dialects emerging during the  conference confirmed the keenness of the sons of the country to  strengthen national unity.    Mr. Beda then read out the conference resolutions and  recommendations, which broadly call for adherence to national  unity and rejection of foreign interference aimed at weakening  the country. The resolutions and recommendations condemned the  desperate attempts by some southern factions to introduce  proposals inconsistent with the views of the majority. The  recommendations also stressed the need to establish just,  permanent, and comprehensive peace; to speed up the end of the  war; to adhere to the principles laid down by the national  salvation revolution; to accept the federal system as a safe  means of achieving national unity and to ensure effective  participation in the process to ensure its success; and to  establish a general authority to follow up the proceedings of  the conference by steering the peace movement from within.    Afterwards, Professor 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu Zayd, rapporteur of  the conference steering committee, presented the Juba  declaration document, which appeals to those bearing arms to  respond to the voice of reason, to stop the fighting, to return  to the mainstream of the nation, to participate in the  reconstruction of a respected and honored Sudan, to restore  development and stability in the south, and to support ongoing  efforts to establish peace from within.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Codan posts profit of DKr503m THE CODAN insurance group, which became Denmark's leading group when it took over the Hafnia insurance and banking operations earlier this year, made a first-half net profit of DKr503m (Dollars 72.97m), giving a return on equity of 22.6 per cent. The group, which is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, did not publish pro rata figures for the two groups for 1992, when first-half profits (for Codan only) were DKr49m. The merger, which took effect from January 1 this year, has tripled group assets to DKr52.44bn from DKr15.3bn on December 31. Equity capital increased to DKr4.49bn on June 30 from DKr3.98bn at the end of last year. Codan made a first half loss of DKr163m before financial income, which came to DKr704m, while taxes were DKr39m. Earnings by the accident insurance divisions, where premium income increased to DKr2.47bn from DKr652m last year, increased to DKr597m from DKr180m, but Codan said the Hafnia accident insurance business made a loss.</p>

That price reflects a gain of more than 23.1  cents in three days. The more actively traded December contract finished at  $5.38 an ounce.  </P> <P> Gold futures settled 30 to 70 cents higher, with October at $366.70 an ounce.  </P> <P> Most energy futures ended lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, although  the October gasoline contract advanced slightly amid speculation about the  extent of damage caused by Hurricane Hugo to an Amerada Hess Corp. refinery on  the Caribbean island of St. Croix.  </P> <P> Other energy contracts retreated on profit taking after rallying sharply on  hurricane-related fears earlier in the week.  </P> <P> Coffee futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as  hopes for a restoration of coffee export quotas faded.  </P> <P> The International Coffee Organization opens a two-week meeting Monday in London  but most experts do not expect the 74 nation-members to agree on new  price-support measures.  </P></p>

The company is 77 per cent owned by Clayform Properties. The board had been attempting to achieve this by acquisition or the injection of assets, but despite protracted discussions none of the proposals was thought to reflect the value of the existing business. The shares were suspended in January. The company also announced increased pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 of IPounds 432,000 (Pounds 442,000), against IPounds 165,000. The result included an exceptional charge of IPounds 257,000 being the provision against a loss on the sale of two properties. Turnover was IPounds 76,000 (IPounds 79,000). Losses per share were 2.43p (0.93p).</p>

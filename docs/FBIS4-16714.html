			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>   [Text] Barnaul, 18 Apr -- Progress in implementing the  program for conversion of defense enterprises, which was adopted  in the Altay in May last year, has been examined by the kray's  coordinating council for industrial policy and conversion.  Although 52 types of civilian goods have gone into production  during the past 12 months, managers of former defense plants are  unhappy with the results of their work. They are dissatisfied  about mutual nonpayments, reduction of investment activity, and  the failure of many existing development projects to match up to  the requirements of domestic and, especially, foreign investors.  According to Anatoliy Karpov, president of the Polieks  joint-stock company, conversion in the kray has been conducted  in an incompetent and uncivilized way. Traditional markets for  output are being lost as a result. Over 5,000 employees have  been made redundant from enterprises undergoing conversion.    The council decided to set up collateral and insurance funds  in the form of precious metals, minerals, raw materials and land  allocations. The conversion program for the current year was  endorsed. It is intended that another 44 new articles should go  into production, including a prototype consignment of passenger  carriages, multipurpose diesel engines, microwave stations,  electric meters, electric motors for pumps and domestic  appliances, hay cutters and motor assemblies, medical equipment  and medicine. Specialists reckon that all this will require over  138 billion rubles of credit. Some of the kray defense  enterprises, included in the republican conversion program, are  hoping to get funds from the federal budget. Others are relying  on their own resources and assistance from domestic and foreign  investors.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Pistols on the pistes: Skiing and possibly a pistol or even a machine gun to the right of them, as into the Trois Vallees, Val d'Isere, Valmorel and even the Val d'Aosta ski the 200 British ski guides who could be facing trouble from local guides anxious to protect their jobs from 'foreign invaders' this winter. Two or three years ago, a number of British ski instructors working in the Alps were arrested for allegedly working illegally. Some were briefly jailed and some were fined. Even Britain's best known ski guru, Ali Ross, was briefly under arrest. Now, as the season beckons, the signs are that the problem this year could be even worse. New regulations seem to suggest that the French will deal severely with British ski guides this season - although they may possibly recognise Grade 3 of the BASI qualification (British Association of Ski Instructors) for the first time. Ce n'est pas la guerre, but it certainly might become distinctly unpleasant as French gendarmes take on the peculiar all-purpose British animal who arranges airport transfers, works out the guests' entertainment programme, organises their ski passes, ski school and ski rental, dines with guests, and just happens to ski with them for all or part of the holiday. Ski Hosts, Ski Leaders, Ski Directors - call them what you will, British tour operators have tried desperately to think of a new title to escape the unfortunate 'guide' connotations and pacify the locals. After a year or two of relative peace, Mark Chitty, managing director of Mark Warner, which pioneered the ski guide concept 15 years ago, is convinced there will be an outbreak of hostilities this winter. 'The problem hasn't gone away' says Chitty. 'Now there has been a small but significant change in French law No. 84-610. Article 43 used to state that no one may teach a sport or physical activity without a diploma. The revised article rules that no one may teach, supervise or lead people without one. I fear that this winter, with pressure from the local ski schools, the authorities will take action against our company. This would have a very serious effect on our operations and future programme in France.' Extracts from a Mark Warner official account highlight just one incident: 'On Friday the 2nd of April at approximately 11.30 hrs Jamie Bentley (Ski Guide) and his group of 15 left the restaurant at the top of Blanchot. Sitting opposite had been two gendarmes and an French ski instructor. Jamie was stopped by the gendarmes, who were insistent that he had been instructing his group, and asked to see his passport and papers. 'A member of the group who spoke fluent French asked how Jamie could be instructing when he had no poles and a broken rib. Jamie showed them the bandage on his chest and the police officer, apparently looking for papers, hit Jamie on several occasions. He was then asked to appear at the police station with all his papers and passport. 'The senior gendarme enquired what qualifications Jamie had to instruct. It was explained that he had no qualifications and that is why he did not instruct. It was highlighted that guests are regularly sent to Ski Cocktail (a local French ski school) for lessons. By this time the gendarme seemed relatively satisfied that the guides had not broken the law - which he confessed was relatively unclear.' Chitty and other tour operators like him - only a couple of months away from the start of the season - is now trying to find out where he stands. He has approached BASI to see whether it might consider running courses for British ski guides to give them official status in the Alps. 'But they won't do it,' he says. 'I think they are worried that just as BASI is on the verge of being recognised in the Alps, to get embroiled with the ski guides issue could be damaging.' One company, Interski, already operates its own BASI ski school in the Alps. Although based mainly in the Italian resort of Courmayeur, Interski also operates in La Thuile (also Italy) and the linked French resort of La Rosiere. One would expect the problems to arise when skiing from Italy into French territory. But Interski's Roger Walker says: 'For several seasons we were hounded by the police in Courmayeur, with numerous inconvenient and embarrassing arrests. One February, my group of schoolchildren from Hull were a quarter of the way down a gentle green piste. I had been questioned several times about my qualifications, and asked to produce my passport, work visa and BASI licence by the local police. 'What I was not prepared for was my encounter round the next corner. As we skied out of the trees, we were confronted by a policeman brandishing an automatic machine gun. 'Coming to a stop with 11 children behind you, who had only been skiing for three days, is no easy task, even when there is a uniformed officer pointing a gun at you. The children seemed shocked into silence. 'Not only was the officer gesticulating with a machine gun, but he carried a shoulder belt full of ammunition and a pistol in a holster - the 24 ski poles we carried between us were no real match. A ski school official informed me that I was working illegally and that I must stop teaching immediately. As I stared down the barrel of a gun that was definitely pointing in my direction, I pointed out that I had a class of 11 beginners, who, if left to their own devices, would certainly never make it back to the bottom alive] Begrudgingly, the pair agreed to escort me. 'Five other Interski instructors were informed that we were to go to the local police station. One by one we were taken from the small room where we were being held, into an interview room. Our paperwork and passports were examined while the policemen whispered in a corner. They seemed to infer that we were to be deported or imprisoned for our 'crime' of teaching skiing without permission from the local ski school. 'Well after midnight, without warning, we were released. We were free to go, but not to teach skiing - no explanation, no apologies.' According to EC regulations, says Walker, Interski instructors should now be legally allowed to teach skiing. 'But the authorities have just informed us that our maximum class size must now be eight. With Italian ski classes of 12 to 14, are we not being singled out for special treatment?' One organisation which may not experience ski-guiding problems is the Ski Club of Great Britain. Article 43 specifically relates to ski guides 'working for financial gain'. The Ski Club does not pay its representatives. Maybe in the end, tour operators may have to follow their example, and find some way of only paying them for the other 'odd jobs' they do and perhaps allowing them just out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

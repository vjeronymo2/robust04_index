			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Watchdog chief pledges fraud probes: Local government under scrutiny THE AUDIT Commission, the public-spending watchdog, is to investigate fraud and corruption in local government following allegations about malpractice on an 'unpre-cedented' scale in the south London borough of Lambeth. Mr Andrew Foster, the new controller of the commission, said at a conference yesterday to mark its 10th anniversary that the investigation would be launched next month. A second study into the health service was likely to follow. Mr Foster said that the study would analyse the extent of corruption by re-opening every case notified to the commission in the past three years. The investigation would then identify steps to prevent fraud by improving the audit process or financial management systems. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, immediately welcomed the investigation. He promised to consider any recommendations for additional powers for auditors or local authorities. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said that corruption was 60 times greater in central government and quangos than in local government. 'For all its imperfections, open, accountable local government is the best antidote to corruption,' he said. In his first newspaper interview since becoming controller, Mr Foster told the Financial Times that the commission had repeatedly tried to draw attention to what was going on in Lambeth. 'In every year since the Audit Commission was founded, our auditors have made public interest reports saying that Lambeth's finances were in a totally unacceptable state,' he said. Before legislation was passed last year the commission could only send its reports to the Department of the Environment and the local authority concerned. Now it can publicise failure to address audit concerns, and intends to do so with vigour. Meanwhile, Lambeth's auditor has been working closely with the council leader and chief officer to help them put things right. Mr Foster, formerly deputy chief executive of the NHS management executive, said he wanted to put much more effort into working with clients to improve their systems. 'Government reforms in many public services are delegating budgets to local managers and encouraging more entrepreneurial behaviour. The people now handling public money are less experienced, and there's a chance of things going wrong without a clear regulatory framework.' Mr Foster said the emphasis on contracting-out and market-testing required new approaches to public-sector management, since it introduced new opportunities for corruption in the awarding of contracts. 'People brought up in one sort of public-service culture must adapt to a very different market-oriented culture,' he said. 'It needs new procedures to ensure that those handling public money remain publicly accountable for it.' Mr Foster hopes to extend the commission's activities beyond local government and the health service to other public-sector organisations. He believes that the approach developed by the commission could help add value to other public services.</p>

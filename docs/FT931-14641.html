			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Parry, an almost Elgar HUBERT H PARRY: HIS LIFE AND MUSIC by Jeremy Dibble Clarendon Press Oxford Pounds 45, 570 pages HUBERT Parry was almost, but not quite, the Elgar of his day. Elgar acknowledged the kinship. Scholars have spent the years since Parry's death in 1918 trying to explain the shortfall. Much of Parry's achievement was against the odds. His mother died soon after his birth and a youthful heart condition persistently interrupted his career. His doting marriage conferred some income, but its stability hinged on a frail, hypochondriac wife and insipid aristocratic relations. Parry was a classic victim of the late-l9th century Brahms-Wagner divide. His traditional grounding in harmony and counterpoint often threatened to muzzle his thematic invention. He revered Brahms, but his instincts lay with Bayreuth, whither, with his mentor and champion, the Liszt pupil Edward Dannreuther, he made ritual pilgrimages, like Elgar after him. An insatiable workaholic, Parry deputised for Grove on the first edition of his pioneering musical dictionary. Succeeding to the directorship of the new Royal College, he later became Professor at Oxford. Open, generous and conscientious, he strove unsuccessfully to resolve the futile Elgar-Stanford feud and was the principle inspiration to young composers of the successor generation. Tensions were inevitable: between academia and sufficient time for gestation and composition (his output, including chamber, organ music and a dozen volumes of songs, was vast); between symphonic writing, at which he excelled, and the flood of fashionable religious cantatas solicited for larger festivals and choral societies, whose sentiments quickly palled with his Liberal, humanist leanings. His solution to this, a sort of pantheistic or humanist 'ethical' cantata, to a medley of texts by Browning, Bridges or himself, brought mixed success. Had he allowed his Weimar inclinations unashamed rein, like Delius with A Mass of Life, he might have caught the spirit of an era. His best efforts, endlessly revised, remain uplifting, if bitty: their blend of rearguard diatonicism and proselytising text can appear bland. Jeremy Dibble's critical biography - the first for six decades - is as welcome as it is overdue. Parry's family background (he inherited his painter father's estate near Gloucester) and struggle for early recognition while working for Lloyd's of London, are well charted. Elected a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1908, his relaxation involved sailing a 73-foot ketch from Sussex to the coast of Galway, or entertaining friends like Burne-Jones, Balfour and Mrs Pankhurst, whose demonstrations he espoused. This is an enthusiastic, painstakingly researched book, backed by generous, interspersed musical examples. It discerningly attempts for Parry something akin to what Percy M. Young's Elgar, OM did for his successor. Some of the wordier analysis preserves a ring of the doctoral thesis. But the judgments are neither dogmatic nor cloying. Parry's correspondence and diaries have been left dormant too long; that Dr. Dibble has restored them and reassessed the music deserves our gratitude. Hubert Parry's Complete Symphonies have been recorded on Chandos, CHAD 9120-2</p>

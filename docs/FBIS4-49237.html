			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Political Editor Danny Gittings and Queenie Wang] </F>   [Text] When Lu Ping, China's chief of Hong Kong affairs,  arrives tonight, it will be into a territory that members of his  immediate family know intimately. Both his wife and son have  worked for various Hong Kong companies for years, and have easy  access to the territory's top businessmen and community leaders.  Their combined knowledge of the territory may give some the  impression that they are a conduit of information for Mr Lu, who  has not visited the territory for the past two years because of  the row over Chris Patten's political reforms. However, a close  look at the relationship suggests this is unlikely to be the  case.    Mr Lu's wife, Xi Liang, has worked in Hong Kong since 1985,  while his son, Kenneth Lu Gong, has been employed by a string of  Hong Kong companies. As China's most senior official on Hong  Kong affairs, Mr Lu makes it his business to know what is going  on here -- yet his absence from Hong Kong has made this  difficult. Neither his wife nor son will be at Hung Hom station  to greet him when his train arrives from Guangzhou. Some  suggest the Lu family has grown apart. Others say their absence  is purely a coincidence.    According to colleagues, Ms Xi deputy general manager of  China International Trade and Investment Corporation (Hong  Kong), is currently on the mainland on business, believed to be  using her engineering background to oversee the construction of  new power plants. Ms Xi, 65, works from a plush office in The  Landmark, and is not expected back in Hong Kong until the middle  of the month, according to her secretary. A frequent traveller  to the mainland, she was also away during her husband's last  Hong Kong visit, in early 1992. Like many other mainland  couples of their generation, they work apart and rarely see each  other, leaving little scope for Hong Kong businessmen to win  favours from Mr Lu by pampering his wife.    The younger Lu has worked for a number of Hong Kong  companies. He is currently employed by Li Kashing's Cheung Kong.  Previous employers include the Sino Land property group, headed  by Robert Ng Chee-siong, and Shell Hong Kong. Mr Lu began  working for Cheung Kong at the beginning of the year. And  although he is based in Beijing, his value to Hong Kong  companies comes through his connections with other influential  sons of senior Chinese leaders -- the so-called "princelings".  Besides frequent job changes, the younger Mr Lu has had a  troubled personal life in recent years. His first wife divorced  him after she was sent to work in Paris. He remarried last  year. Those seeking favours from his father's office through  the younger Mr Lu have little chance of success. "The old man  would never allow it," said a friend of Mr Lu for 40 years.  "He's very strict about not using personal connections to win  favours and gets very angry when anything like that comes up."    With so many Hong Kong people wanting to see the elder Mr  Lu,  from the Governor down, the absence of his family will probably  be overlooked. Mr Lu is not the kind of person to let family  matters mar the important visit. The trip, originally expected  to last only until Friday, will now continue until April 9.  Despite the extension, which will give him more time to meet  people, he will not visit the Governor. A visit by any Chinese  official to Mr Patten, once dubbed by Mr Lu as a "man of guilt  for 1,000 years", with the reforms row still unresolved would be  seen in Beijing as completely impolitic. It would also run into  opposition from local XINHUA (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) chief Zhou  Nan.    Forgetting the people Mr Lu will not see in Hong Kong, he is  still in for a busy time -- and it will not all be pleasant.  From the moment his train from Guangzhou pulls in at 7 pm, Mr  Lu and his entourage of 23 aides and mainland Preliminary  Working Committee members will be the target of protests.  Operation Save Xi Yang, an umbrella organisation campaigning  for the release of the jailed MING PAO journalist, is organising  a major demonstration to mark Mr Lu's arrival. A small radical  group, Kick Out The PWC, is also planning a protest. Two  car-loads of Special Branch and XINHUA bodyguards will whisk Mr  Lu -- and secretary Liu Zhenxin -- past the protesters as he  leaves Hung Hom for Mr Zhou's villa in Stanley Beach Road, his  base during the visit. Friends say Mr Lu dislikes the Stanley  villa, regarding it as too far out of town, although that will  not deter demonstrators who intend to camp outside while he is  in residence. Its choice for this visit has already sparked  speculation of a tacit agreement with Mr Zhou that the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office director will stay out of the spotlight  this time around. Also accompanying Mr Lu will be top Hong Kong  affairs officials Wang Fengchao, Xu Ze, and Zhang Liangdong.    Mr Lu's first meeting, a gathering of the Preliminary  Working  Committee political sub-group, will be held tomorrow in the Bank  of China Building. This will be followed by a 6 pm ceremony on  the 17th floor to mark the issuing of the Bank of China's first  Hong Kong dollar banknotes, at which Mr Lu will rub shoulders  with minor government officials, such as Monetary Authority  Chief Executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong. While these two events  have been widely presented as the reason for Mr Lu's trip, in  reality they are little more than a politically convenient  excuse. During the past year, Mr Lu had made it clear to  friends that ordinarily he could not return to the territory  until the political reform row was resolved.    The idea of holding PWC sub group meetings in Hong Kong is  nothing new. Local members, tired of flying to Beijing almost  every month, have long recommended it as a chance for mainland  officials to enjoy closer consultation with the local community.  But the decision to make this week's sub-group meeting the  first to be held in the territory appears to be politically  motivated. Although the last session discussed the sensitive  subject of the civil service, controversially concluding that  all 180,000 public employees should be asked if they wished to  remain after the handover, it was nonetheless held in Beijing.    "This (the plan to hold the latest meeting in Hong Kong)  will boost the importance of the Preliminary Working Committee,"  said Professor Lau Siu-kai, an academic and political sub-group  member. "The symbolic meaning of Mr Lu's visit is more  important than the subject of the meeting." He said the visit  showed Beijing had given up all hope of co-operating with  Britain, and would now concentrate on winning support in the  local community, a point repeatedly stressed by Chinese leaders  in recent months. Professor Lau also claimed a meeting with the  Governor would send out the wrong signals. "Pictures of Mr Lu  shaking hands with Mr Patten would be misleading to Hong Kong  people," he said. "This ... might be used by Mr Patten to  `prove' his strategy is correct; that China's angry reaction to  his (political) reform proposals is only temporary."    The political sub-group meeting which ends on Tuesday, will  be followed by a session of its economic counterpart. It is not  yet clear if Mr Lu will attend the meeting, scheduled for  Wednesday and Thursday. He has skipped several in the past.  However he will lunch with members on Thursday. Much of his  remaining time is expected to be spent pursuing the united front  strategy in meetings with local leftists. Many have already  been invited to a cocktail reception at the China Resources  Building in Wan Chai on Tuesday. Some Hong Kong Affairs advisers  have also requested a separate session with him, and a dinner --  with, as yet, unknown guests -- has been arranged for Thursday  at the Hilton hotel. The Heung Yee Kuk, which is seeking  support in its battle with the Government over New Territories  land rights, is also likely to see him. As on previous visits,  Mr Lu will visit the Kowloon headquarters of the 170,000-strong  Federation of Trade Unions, China's main grassroots supporter in  Hong Kong. This is scheduled for next Sunday.    But Mr Lu's expected emphasis on meetings with Beijing's  hard- core supporters, rather than more representative members  of the community, has already sparked criticism from one local  leftist. Maverick National People's Congress (NPC) delegate Liu  Yiu-chu called on the pro-Beijing camp to step back and allow Mr  Lu time to meet ordinary Hong Kong people. "This time the NPC  delegates Chinese People's Political Consultation Conference  delegates and Hong Kong Affairs advisers should not fight for  meetings with Mr Lu because we already have many opportunities  and channels to convey our opinions to him," she said. "This  opportunity should be left to other Hong Kong people." Ms Liu  said the territory's delegates and advisers numbered only a few  hundred and could hardly claim to represent Hong Kong's  population of six million.</p>

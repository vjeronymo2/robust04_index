			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome sellers return DRUGS group Wellcome lost ground in spite of attempts by the company yesterday to staunch the recent blood-letting. Wellcome tried to counter doubts about the effectiveness of its AZT anti-Aids drug with data suggesting that early use could improve the chances of survival. However, the attempt appeared to fuel controversy as investors, unimpressed with the company's arguments, sold shares again on fears of another round of negative publicity for the drug. The argument over the accuracy of the long-lasting Concorde trial was taken a stage further as one of the trial's senior researchers hit out at the company. Professor Ian Weller, the trial's principal UK investigator, accused Wellcome of 'manipulating the data of the trial'. Wellcome shares closed 23 lower at 698p. There was some switching into Glaxo, which rose 8 to 584p.</p>

He concluded secret agreements with Russia on oil  some time ago. It has now become apparent that he is supporting  the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. He has appointed several  PKK sympathizers to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic Internal  Affairs Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK members  from Turkey to Armenia through Nakhichevan. Furthermore,  Aliyev, who is one of Moscow's underlings, has used state funds  to finance and distribute DENGE KURD, a newspaper that opposes  Turkey.    Geydar Aliyev, who is known for his support of initiatives  against Turkey, is on Ankara's agenda [as published] because of  his support for the PKK. Aliyev describes Turkey as a friendly  and fraternal country whenever he finds himself in a difficult  situation. However, he has tried to stab Turkey in the back at  every opportunity. Meanwhile, another of his deceptive moves  has been exposed. Aliyev has cooperated with Armenia in  providing funds and logistical support to the PKK, which is  trying to divide Turkey. He has appointed PKK sympathizers, who  are known to be militants, to the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs  Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK terrorists from  Turkey to Armenia and Azerbaijan.    Geydar Aliyev is known as an indispensable person for  Russia.  He has supported PKK's printed propaganda activities in  Azerbaijan. Recall that not so long ago Aliyev placed all of  Azerbaijan's press organs under his control and obstructed those  opposed to his regime. Meanwhile, his administration has met all  the needs of DENGE KURD, from ink to paper. That newspaper is  printed in Cyrillic in Baku. Furthermore, he has allowed PKK  members to open 20 shops in Baku. DENGE KURD is a newspaper  opposed to Turkey. Aliyev has guaranteed its distribution  through the help of his administration. While conveying  friendly messages to Turkey, Aliyev has exposed his true face by  supporting the treacherous elements.    DENGE KURD is a PKK newspaper supported by Aliyev. It  describes southeastern Anatolia as a part of Kurdistan.  Furthermore, it describes Abdullah Ocalan, who is the leader of  the PKK terrorists, as the "national leader of the Kurdish  people."    The following are several passages from the October 1993  edition of DENGE KURD, which is supported by Aliyev:    "The Turkish State is a servant of imperialism. The  liberation of the Turkish people depends on the strengthening of  the PKK and the independence of the Kurdish people."    "I organized the Kurdish people's struggle for independence  not because I am a Kurd but because I am a socialist."  (Quotation from Abdullah Ocalan)    "Everyone is fighting in Kurdistan at the present time. Of  course, the children are fighting as well...."    "Turkey has not changed its chauvinist and Kemalist  traditions. Meanwhile, the Kurdish people are changing to  achieve progress in accordance with the training they receive  from the PKK. That will guarantee our future...."    Aliyev served as a KGB general and then as first deputy  prime  minister in the former Soviet Union. He has been known as one  of Moscow's most favored employees for more than 25 years.</p>

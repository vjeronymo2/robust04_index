			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rise in jobless hits Tory seats THE overwhelming majority of constituencies in which unemployment has risen since the 1987 general election are Conservative-held, according to the Unemployment Unit, a research group that campaigns for the jobless. Unemployment nationally is lower than before the 1987 election, but it has risen in 261 constituencies of which the Tories are defending 87 per cent. Unemployment is higher in 108 of the 112 constituencies in the south-east, 72 out of 84 London constituencies and 15 out of 20 constituencies in East Anglia. Unemployment is lower in every constituency in Scotland, and in all but two in Wales.</p>

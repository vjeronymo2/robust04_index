			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / BCCI creditors win further adjournment THE HIGH COURT granted a further adjournment yesterday to creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International who last week decided to reject the proposed liquidation settlement negotiated with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. During a brief hearing lawyers for the creditors said they were seeking clarification on the deal from the majority shareholders. The British-based creditors are unhappy with the terms of the deal but officials involved in the negotiations believe there is little room for manoeuvre within the Pounds 1.7bn compensation package al-ready agreed with Abu Dhabi. Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator who negotiated the deal, refused to comment on the impasse yesterday. The hearing will reconvene on June 8, when the liquidator will be anxious to have secured creditors' approval as the timetable for the deal assumes that court approvals for the deal will have been obtained by June 30. Before the provisions in the draft agreement can take effect, the liquidators must also secure acceptance of creditors with claims totalling Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.9bn) by September 30. Outside court, Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, who has campaigned for a better deal for depositors and former bank staff, urged Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to intervene on behalf of depositors. The Foreign Office said yesterday that no intervention was planned.</p>

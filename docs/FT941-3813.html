			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Inkatha 'may still join all-race poll' A senior member of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday that the party might still participate in South Africa's first all-race elections, despite its failure to register candidates for the poll by last Friday's deadline. Mr Ben Ngobane, a member of Inkatha's executive, said that 'far from being out of elections, the IFP has yet to decide on participation or non-participation'. But the conditions he set for participation may make it difficult to ensure Inkatha takes part in the April 26-28 poll. He stressed that international mediation must result in changes to the constitution, and agreement must be reached on the constitutional status of the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, before Inkatha would take part. African National Congress and Inkatha negotiators are continuing to discuss the issue of international mediation, but with only six weeks to go until polling, results may be delayed until near the date. If this happens, Inkatha is counting on a decision to delay the election, but ANC leader Nelson Mandela is adamant there will be no delay. The Independent Electoral Commission has said Inkatha's name has been deleted from ballot papers being printed at the moment in Britain. But Mr Ngobane said he believed President FW de Klerk could change the deadline for registration by proclamation, if he so desired. President de Klerk warned of the risk of serious violence in Inkatha's Natal province stronghold if the party boycotted the elections, and ultra-right leader Eugene Terre'blanche said South Africans were 'heading for chaos, not an election'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Stober] </F>   [Text] A powerful team is assembling in the office of State  President Nelson Mandela to drive the ANC's Reconstruction and  Development Programme (RDP). Although the composition and  priorities of the new president's office are still under  discussion, it is clear the building of the new South Africa  will be high on its agenda and will receive Mandela's personal  attention.    Said the recently appointed director general of the  President's Office, Jakes Gerwel: "I can't presume for the  president, but he will most likely be interested in the RDP and  nation-building."    The choice of Gerwel director general is a clear indication  of Mandela's personal commitment to ensuring old government  structures change and the new government delivers. As rector of  the University of the Western Cape for the seven years, Gerwel  has first-hand experience of the difficulties of turning  apartheid institutions around. He understands the problems the  new government will encounter from its constituencies as well as  those with other agendas. As director general, Gerwel will be  heading the administration of the office and making further  appointments. How effective the office will be depends largely  on the style and priorities of Mandela and the people staffing  his office.    Others tipped for positions in the president's office are  Rivonia trialist Ahmed Kathrada -- who was squeezed out of the  cabinet to make room for smaller parties -- as parliamentary  liaison, and human rights lawyer Fink Haysom as a constitutional  and legal adviser.    Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, who will be  overseeing  the implementation of the RDP, will also operate from the  President's Office. It is likely all ministries affected by the  RDP will have to report to Naidoo, who will monitor the progress  of the programme.    The ANC's Women's Emancipation Committee has proposed the  new  president establish a cabinet committee, under his office, to  ensure the advancement of women in government. There is little  doubt the proposal will be accepted.    Mandela is expected soon to announce five projects aimed at  providing visible examples of the new government's commitment to  improving the living standards of the poor. The projects will  address the needs of those displaced by violence; of children;  and the provision of facilities to townships.    Those involved say the idea behind putting key development  projects into the president's office is to give them clout and  place them where the president can oversee them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(b) that processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain sanitation control records that document the occurrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and findings of the inspections required by &sect;123.10(a) as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the frequency required by &sect;123.10(c). FDA is also proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require that the problems found during these inspections be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected, and the corrections recorded in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.10(d). Such corrections are essential to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper working of the HACCP system. The records that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.8, including being subject to inspection by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigators. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive controls, including recordkeeping, will ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazards caused by insanitation are controlled by design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recordkeeping is the key to an HACCP-type system. The agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to these records is essential to ensuring that the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is working.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these proposed requirements, FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraging processors in &sect;123.10(e) to have a written standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating procedure for sanitation. The details of many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation procedures can differ from plant to plant depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the type of operation and other conditions. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how a piece of equipment should be cleaned can differ from plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to plant. In one plant, it may be necessary to disassemble all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or part of the equipment in order to clean it. In other plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaking down the equipment may not be necessary. Likewise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different cleaning compounds may be needed from one plant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another in order to solve specialized problems such as buildups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of mineral deposits. FDA is therefore encouraging each processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to study its own plant and develop a procedure that is tailored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to that processor's needs and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Evisceration of Raw Fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1988, following botulism outbreaks traced to consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of kapchunka, FDA published compliance policy guide (CPG) 7108.17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for salt-cured, air-dried, uneviscerated fish (53 FR 44949  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 7, 1988). In this CPG, FDA stated that the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sale of smoked and salted uneviscerated fish products pose a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential health hazard, and that it would consider such products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act in that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 175). FDA issued this CPG in an effort to prevent further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outbreaks, as well as other potential health hazards, related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consumption of ungutted fish products. The agency recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only two exceptions: (1) Small species, such as anchovies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herring pieces (sprats), provided that they are processed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method that will ensure a water-phase salt content of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) fish that are fully cooked before further processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously noted,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as well as other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms, are naturally present in the intestinal tract of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both fresh-water fish and marine fish. Therefore, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential not only to remove the viscera but to do so in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that does not contaminate the fish flesh with viscera contents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the viscera that can contain the majority of the hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose the potential health hazard (Refs. 165 through 167). After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the viscera is removed, it must be discarded immediately to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segregated area, using a method that minimizes the potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination or cross-contamination of utensils, equipment, raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials, and other processed products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uneviscerated fish that have been smoked, smoke-flavored, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salted, and that are intended to be filleted after processing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose the same potential health hazard as those products sold as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uneviscerated whole fish. The potential health hazard is created  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the viscera is removed after processing. As the fish are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being filleted, the viscera may be cut, and its contents may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spill out, contaminating the processed fish. As a result, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity arises for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spore outgrowth and toxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production as well as for growth of other food spoilage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms in these types of products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the agency is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, subject to the same limitations that were set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPG: (1) All fish for smoking or salting be eviscerated prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to processing, and (2) the process of evisceration must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed in an area that is segregated and separate from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Imported Seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated earlier, imports make up over half of the seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumed in this country, in sharp contrast to meat and poultry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are primarily domestically produced. Many of the hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can affect imported seafood are likely to occur before it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enters the United States. These hazards include those that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be acquired from the environment before harvest and those that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are process-induced. Detection of these hazards is the focus of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current regulatory system, and thus FDA tries to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety by testing imported product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, product testing places a substantial burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency. The system currently is overburdened because of limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the number of government personnel available to collect and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze samples of imported product. In addition, FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned because this system does not promote industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and accountability the way an HACCP-based problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevention system would. Given when most problems with imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood occur, these problems can be more efficiently controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the seafood is subject to HACCP controls before it is offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for import into this country than if the product is simply tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time that it is offered for sale. Therefore, FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concluded that these HACCP regulations should cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported products in the same manner, to the extent possible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they cover domestic products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

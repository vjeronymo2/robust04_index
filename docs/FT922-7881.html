			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Pricing gap emerges in bank fees SOME HIGH street banks' charges to small-business customers are substantially higher than their rivals', according to a survey of banking business charges published by the consultancy Rochester Research. The pricing gap is particularly wide between Lloyds and Midland, the two banks locked in a takeover battle. Lloyds emerges as the most expensive bank for small businesses and Midland the cheapest. The survey was carried out in bank branches in Kent but its findings are valid for the UK as a whole. Rochester says some Lloyds small-business customers would save at least 20 per cent if they banked with Midland. It has forwarded a copy of its report to the Office of Fair Trading, which is considering whether to refer Lloyds' bid for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Lloyds said yesterday it was unfair to compare its prices with Midland's when predicting what customers of a merged bank might pay two years from now. 'We have made it clear that the kind of cost savings which would then be possible would clearly benefit the customer,' Lloyds said. The bank declined to say why its charges were higher than those of the other banks. The survey says a small business with 80 transactions on its account each month would find itself paying Pounds 39.50 a quarter more in charges if it banked with Lloyds rather than Midland. For a customer writing 60 cheques a month, paying six bills by standing order and another six by direct debit, and receiving eight credits, Lloyds would charge Pounds 187.50 compared with Midland's Pounds 147.90. The charges of the other big clearers are closer to Midland than Lloyds. A NatWest customer would pay Pounds 159.60 for identical services and a Barclays customer Pounds 156.20. Lloyds scores better than other banks with its Premier Interest Account, in which businesses can hold funds. Business Banking in the Medway Towns.

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Kinnock pledges to increase investment: Tories ready to retaliate with promise to cut taxes and inflation MR NEIL KINNOCK set out his central election message yesterday when he contrasted an exhausted Tory government, bereft of vision, with a Labour administration pledged to 'invest, invest, invest'. As Mr John Major prepared to unveil his campaign themes today, Mr Kinnock, the Labour leader, said his government would 'take the lead' with a programme of economic measures to bring Britain out of recession and free the country of the fear of unemployment. In a passionate speech to Scottish party members, Mr Kinnock quoted his hero, Aneurin Bevan, saying debts, unemployment and a 'fear of the future' had halted consumer spending, investment and undermined Britain's confidence. Labour's programme would centre on time-limited tax incentives for industry, training projects and capital works for the National Health Service, schools and housing. With two opinion polls today both showing Labour just one percentage point ahead of the Tories, Mr Major will counter-attack in an address to supporters in Torquay by stressing his commitment to lower taxes and inflation. Strategists of both parties are braced for the six opinion polls to be published tomorrow, already dubbed 'Super Sunday' at Westminster. Mr Major will tackle head-on the opposition's insistence on the need for a change after 13 years of the Conservatives. He will say: 'The Labour party want to change Britain. There would be change all right - short change, for pensioners as savings shrank, for home owners as interest rates soar.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, began his intense election programme yesterday with flying visits to London, Wales and Scotland. He urged his opponents to abandon negative campaigning and debate problems which Britain must address by the end of the century. At Westminster, MPs rushed through all the stages of a heavily truncated Finance Bill in preparation for the dissolution of Parliament on Monday. In his Edinburgh speech, Mr Kinnock combined a personal attack on Mr Major with an attempt to increase the pressure for a televised debate between the two leaders. He ridiculed the prime minister for hesitating over the election date and added: 'It seems he is certain about only one thing: he is definitely not willing to face me in a television debate.' Labour strategists claimed the Tories were in 'a shambles' over TV debates during the campaign. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Hesel-tine, environment secretary, have agreed to head-to-head debates with their Labour shadows. But Tories argue a debate between the two party leaders would be in a different league. Mr Kinnock launched a two-pronged attack on the Tories and Scottish National party in words carefully phrased to head off support for independence and to promote Labour's plan for a Scottish parliament. Mr Major will also address the constitutional future of Scotland today. He will set out his view of what devolution might entail - not institutional change or added tiers of government, but of passing power directly to people by enabling them to take more decisions about their lives. The Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph shows Labour down half a percentage point from last week at 38 per cent, the Tories on 37 (down 1 1/2 points) and the Liberal Democrats on 20. The Harris poll for the Daily Express, carried out after the Budget, puts Labour on 40, the Tories on 39 and the Liberal Democrats on 16.

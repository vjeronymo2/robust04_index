			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIMINAL TYPE WINS WHITNEY;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: FIVE-YEAR-OLD BEATS DANCING SPREE BY 1 1/2 LENGTHS AT SARATOGA,  EARNS $140,640.  </P> <P> Criminal Type, ridden by Gary Stevens and assigned the high weight of 126  pounds, beat Dancing Spree by 1 1/2 lengths Saturday in the $234,400 Whitney  Stakes at Saratoga Race Course.  </P> <P> The Calumet Farm product, giving five pounds to the runner-up, covered 1 1/8  miles in 1:48 3/5 to collect the winner's share of $140,640, increasing his  career earnings to $2,351,817 and his stock as the best handicap horse in the  country. The 5-year-old son of Alydar has won seven of 10 starts and $2,270,290  this year. In 23 career starts, he has won 10 times and has been in the money  18 times.  </P> <P> "We thought he would run well today, but you never know until they open up,"  trainer Wayne Lukas said. "I wasn't worried when he went wide. I told Gary to  stay in the middle of the track and stay out of trouble. I wanted him to be out  in the clear. I didn't want anyone pushing him down on the rail.  </P> <P> "He's a campaigner. He's very professional. Horse of the year is our major  goal. Calumet has been on top before and we want to get them back on top. We'll  look at the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold Cup next."  </P> <P> The Whitney victory was Criminal Type's fourth in a row and comes on the heels  of wins over Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, both since retired, in Belmont's  Metropolitan Handicap and the Hollywood Gold Cup.  </P> <P> Criminal Type was allowed to set the pace and posted moderate fractions of 24  2/5 for the quarter, 48 2/5 for the half-mile and 1:12 2/5 for three quarters.  </P> <P> Midway in the turn, Stevens asked Criminal Type for speed and the horse  responded, completing a mile in 1:36 2/5 and covering the final furlong in 12  1/5 seconds.  </P> <P> Dancing Spree, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., finished well along the inside to  claim second in the six-horse field, 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Mi Selecto. Tricky  Creek, Exemplary Leader and Forever Silver completed the order of finish.  </P> <P> Criminal Type returned $2.80, $2.20 and $2.10. Dancing Spree paid $2.80 and  $2.10 and Mi Selecto was worth $2.10.  </P> <P> In the Grade III A Phenomenon Stakes on the same card, Julio Garcia rode  Prospectors Gamble to a 2 1/2-length victory over Sewickley in a six-furlong  test for horses ages 3 and up. Prospectors Gamble, a 5-year-old son of Crafty  Prospector, went the distance in 1:09 1-5 for his third victory in seven starts  this year.  </P> <P> Sewickley was 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Mr. Nickerson, with Quick Call the trailer  in the four-horse field.  </P> <P> Prospectors Gamble earned $50,400 from a purse of $84,000 and returned $11 and  $3.60. Sewickley paid $2.80. There was no show betting.  </P></p>

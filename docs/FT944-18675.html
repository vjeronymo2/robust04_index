			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Patchy start seen to training plan The government's Pounds 1.25bn apprenticeship programme, which aims to train thousands of young people every year, has made a patchy start, a report from the Institute of Personnel and Development says. Many of the Training and Enterprise Councils which will run the scheme are behind schedule, often because they are still looking for businesses to take on apprentices. Some Tecs in London have secured barely half the places they need for the programme which is designed for people aged 16 and 17 wanting to learn vocational skills in the workplace rather than school.</p>

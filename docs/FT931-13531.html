			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Banks head Belgium's sell-off list BELGIUM may begin a series of state asset sales this year by selling two public credit institutions and several industrial assets to raise Bfr25bn (Dollars 751m) a finance ministry official said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The two public banks are the country's biggest savings bank, ASLK-CGER, and the industrial credit bank, NMKN-SNCI. 'These are the assets that are under consideration,' the official said, quoting the finance minister, Mr Philippe Maystadt. He said Mr Maystadt received a list of companies for possible privatisation in 1993 from the Maldague Commission, an advisory body on the sell-off. The government also plans to sell a stake in mortgage company, OCCH-CBHK. The industrial assets for sale are stakes held by the state holding company, SNI-NIM, in the natural gas company, Distrigaz, the holding company, Nationale Portfeuillemaatschapij, the National Pipeline Company, and the Societe Publique d'Electricite. The nuclear energy company, Belgonucleaire, is also on the list. The centre-left government of the prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, intends to use the sale of state assets to cut the huge budget deficit. The Finance Ministry later said that the Maldague Commission has not yet set minimum prices for the assets. State companies to be sold after 1993 are yet to be studied by the commission, it added.</p>

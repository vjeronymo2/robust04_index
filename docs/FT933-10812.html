			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television Television is often condemned for its triviality, so we can hardly complain when Channel 4 begins a week of programmes under the general title 'Bloody Bosnia'. However, after watching the first few items it is hard to believe that this will attract a very large or dedicated audience. When sticking to factual content, as in The Essential Guide (9.00) the material tends to look like schools programmes jazzed up with graphics borrowed from the yoof department; and when they branch out into entertainment, as in Artists For Bosnia (11.00) with Ute Lemper singing songs from World War 2, you wonder what it has to do with Bosnia. World In Action uses photographs taken by the late Dan Eldon to tell the story of the war in Somalia. The programme asks whether it was really US policy in Somalia and the conduct of UN troops that led to his death (8.30 ITV). Frank Stubbs Promotes is the best comic drama of its sort since 'Minder'. This week the inept Stubbs is promoting a young female drama student (9.00 ITV).</p>

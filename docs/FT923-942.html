			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Observer: Pork scratchings The strange reappearance of the name Ross Perot in connection with the presidential election race has set American calculators clicking. When earlier this year he stepped out of the limelight there was speculation that he was unwilling to fund the scale of the task. If he's now back - in some form - has he found the necessary? The necessary, in this case, is pretty huge. Back in July, Horizon Media calculated that a third-party candidate would need to spend Dollars 4.49 a vote, or Dollars 153m, to stand a chance of winning 34 per cent of the 100m Americans expected to vote in November, the minimum percentage required to win a three-way race. That's a big pork barrel by anyone's standards.</p>

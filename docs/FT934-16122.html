			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / NZ 'headed for close election' NEW ZEALAND seems headed for a close general election on November 6, with latest opinion polls showing the opposition Labour party has steadily gained support over the past month through attacks on the government's handling of social welfare issues. The Heylen One Network News poll says Labour and the ruling National party are neck and neck at 37 per cent, with Labour gaining two percentage points over the past month. The TV3 Gallup Poll showed the National party at 40 per cent, a drop of seven points since early September, while Labour had gained ground to 39 per cent. The minor Alliance and New Zealand First parties had a combined 20 per cent in both polls. Mr Murray McCully, government communications committee chairman, said the polls showed that the National administration had no room for complacency. Labour had gained momentum by 'firing all the policy shots' over the past month'. Mr Mike Moore, Labour leader, was the preferred prime minister in both polls, with about 20 per cent support; the incumbent, Mr Jim Bolger, scored 8 per cent, behind Mr Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party, on 17 per cent. At the November 6 election, voters will also be called on to take part in a referendum to vote on a change in the electoral system. At present New Zealand elections are won on the British first-past-the-post system, which means that the government is elected on the number of parliamentary seats it wins. At a referendum, voters will be asked to choose whether they wish to adopt the German mixed-member proportional system. The latest polls showed that support for the change was falling slightly, with 46 per cent in favour of the German system and 37 per cent against.</p>

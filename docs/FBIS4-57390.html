			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (DPA) -- President Joaquin  Balaguer and his Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) remain  in the lead in the vote count for the presidency, with 66.5  percent of voting tables counted.    According to the latest bulletin issued by the Central  Electoral Council (JCE), Balaguer and his running mate, Jacinto  Peynado, had approximately 844,639 votes or 43 percent. His  closest rival, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who is seeking the  presidency on the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) ticket,  had a total of 788,134 votes or 40 percent.    Former President Juan Bosch and running mate Lionel  Fernandez  remain in a distant third place with 255,164 votes or 13 percent  of the votes counted. Fourth place is occupied by Jacobo  Majluta with 43,633 votes, 2.0 percent of the votes counted.    The PRD Political Commission will meet tonight to debate the  actions to be taken regarding the charges of alleged fraud in  the electoral process. This organization asserts that through  the manipulation of the electoral lists, thousands of their  followers were not allowed to exert their right to vote.    Meanwhile, the capital city of Dominican Republic remains  militarized and surveillance has been increased at key points.  The police and soldiers search vehicles that move close to the  JCE headquarters and that arrive in Santo Domingo from cities in  the interior. The search, it has been reported, is for weapons,  which will be confiscated if found.    The situation continues to be one of tense tranquility and  people await the final results of the electoral process.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Observer: Family game Who is going to win control of Everton, the luckless Liverpool football club controlled by the family of the late Sir John Moores, the pools millionaire and founder of Littlewoods? Will it be Everton's home side led by Bill Kenwright - whose courageous production of Blood Brothers has defied the New York critics and is packing them in on Broadway? Or will it be the self-made millionaire Peter Johnson, who has rejuvenated neighbouring Tranmere Rovers? All eyes are on Lady Grantchester, Sir John's daughter, who chairs the family's interviewing panel. Her detailed knowledge of the game's finances has surprised contenders. So surely she will not let her family's loyalty to Everton be affected by the fact that Johnson has had a season ticket for Liverpool, Everton's arch rivals, for the last 25 years.</p>

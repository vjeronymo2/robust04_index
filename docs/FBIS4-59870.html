			<p>BFN     [Text] This evening, Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi chaired  a Ministerial Economic Group meeting to review the  implementation of the economic reform program's second phase and  to discuss future cooperation between Egypt, the IMF, and the  World Bank.    In a press statement released today, the prime minister said  that Egypt has achieved distinct success in implementing  economic reform programs. This, he added, was evident in the  Egyptian pounds' steady exchange rates against foreign  currencies, especially the dollar. He said the Egyptian Central  Bank had a $16 billion surplus and this recently increased by  $400 million.    Sidqi said the government is in the process of devising a  new  workers' law to be submitted to the People's Assembly during its  current session.</p>

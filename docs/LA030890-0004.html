			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: REDRESSING THE CLASSIC CAESAR SALAD  </P> <P> Though the Ides of March proved to be Caesar's downfall on March 15, 44 B.C.,  the salad bearing his name has been a year-round favorite ever since it was  created by Caesar Cardini, an Italian restaurateur, in Tijuana in 1924.  </P> <P> This version has far less cholesterol, since I use only the white instead of  the whole egg called for in a classic Caesar salad.  </P> <P> HAPPY HEART CAESAR SALAD  </P> <P> 2 heads Romaine lettuce  </P> <P> 2 cups garlic croutons  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Happy Heart Caesar Dressing  </P> <P> Several hours before serving, wash and dry lettuce thoroughly. Tear into  bite-size pieces (there should be 16 cups) and place in large bowl lined with  cloth to absorb any remaining moisture. Store in refrigerator.  </P> <P> When ready to serve, remove cloth from under lettuce and add dressing. Toss  salad until every leaf glistens. Add croutons and again toss thoroughly. Makes  16 cups, 8 (2-cup) servings.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> 66 calories  </P> <P> 3 mg cholesterol  </P> <P> 2 gm fat  </P> <P> 140 mg sodium  </P> <P> Happy Heart Caesar Dressing  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons anchovy paste  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Using garlic press, squeeze garlic into oil in skillet over low heat. Cook just  until garlic sizzles. Do not brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool.  </P> <P> Add anchovy paste to garlic oil and mix well.  </P> <P> Dip egg into boiling water for 30 seconds. Separate egg, discarding yolk. Add  egg white to oil mixture. Blend well.  </P> <P> Add pepper, lemon juice, Worcestershire, vinegar and Parmesan, mixing well.  Store tightly covered in refrigerator. Makes 1/2 cup, 8 (1 tablespoon)  servings.  </P> <P> Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and  recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be  used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute  package for applications.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> 52 calories  </P> <P> 4 mg cholesterol  </P> <P> 5 gm fat  </P> <P> 97 mg sodium  </P></p>

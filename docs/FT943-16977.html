			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Building on the recovery For the first time since 1991, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been able to revise its projections upwards. It now expects the output of its members to grow 2.6 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995, up from 2.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively, in its forecasts of last December. Never mind the forecast, the upward revision is itself an excellent indicator of recovery. The principal question now is how to make recovery as long and as strong as possible. The recovery in OECD countries - still divergent, but becoming less so  - is an important element in a brightening global picture. Aggregate growth in the dynamic Asian economies - Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia - is expected to remain at about 7 per cent in 1994 and 1995. China's economy is growing faster still. The Latin American economies are expected to grow at about 4 per cent in 1994 and 1995, while output is even beginning to rise in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Market-led growth has not only become global, but the Uruguay Round trade agreement should, if ratified, ensure that it stays so. OECD-wide inflation is also lower than since the 1960s, with aggregate inflation in the group of seven leading industrial countries forecast at only 2 per cent in 1994. The effort to eliminate the high inflation of the 1970s has now succeeded and must not be repeated. All OECD countries need to create institutional arrangements that not only prevent inflation from getting out of hand once more, but do so credibly. Perhaps the most important obstacle to securing that goal is their fiscal positions. Between 1989 and 1995 the ratio of general government gross debt to GDP in the OECD countries is expected to rise from 58 per cent to 72 per cent. It should then stabilise, argues the secretariat, though under what seem to be optimistic assumptions. Worryingly, real interest rates are now higher than the likely long-term rate of growth of most OECD countries. In addition, members have substantial net pension liabilities - of more than twice GDP in some cases. The question investors in bonds ask themselves is whether governments might find an inflationary default tempting. The answer depends on how heavily the burden of debt weighs upon them. On some countries, it weighs heavily already: in Italy, for example, net debt interest makes up a fifth of all government spending. There are other important reasons for undertaking further fiscal consolidation. But the most important is to make sustained low inflation more credible and inflation-risk premia in long-term interest rates correspondingly smaller. Inflation, like fiscal deficits, is not an immediate problem for most major countries. But the beginning of a recovery is the ideal time to tackle longer-term constraints. The world enjoys a splendid economic opportunity. Governments should be thinking now about how to ensure it lasts.</p>

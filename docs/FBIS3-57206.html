The enemy gunners were suppressed by  counter fire. No Russian serviceman was hurt.    As an army officer in Dushanbe has told Interfax, the height  has been continuously shelled for the second day from Tajikistan  by small groups of infiltrators from Afghanistan.    The spokesman reported that two Tajiks were detained when  they tried to cross into Afghanistan in the Ishkashim area of  the Gorno-Badakhshan region on Thursday night [20 January].  They were unarmed.</p>

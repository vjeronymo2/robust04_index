			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. WATER RATE HIKE DECISION DELAYED  </P> <P> For the first time in recent memory, the Los Angeles City Council has balked at  a water rate increase requested by the Department of Water and Power, delaying  a decision on the politically touchy matter until January.  </P> <P> But in the meantime, the council members find themselves in the uncomfortable  predicament of having to choose between the apparently intractable positions of  warring city agencies.  </P> <P> At the root of the controversy is an unusual public squabble between the  powerful DWP, which says a 6.5% revenue increase is essential, and the more  obscure city administrative office, whose financial analysts insist that the  DWP is actually operating at a huge surplus.  </P> <P> Despite the pleadings of some council members who want the agencies to work  things out quietly -- as they always have in the past -- the sides, at least  for the moment, refuse to budge."  </P> <P> "I have never seen such open one-upmanship between two offices," said  Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. "Somehow a feud developed that stopped  conversation between the two."  </P> <P> For the council members, half of whom face reelection in 1991, the situation  could develop into a political disaster. Without unassailable evidence that a  rate hike is necessary, few council members want to vote for it. But they have  been warned by DWP that, if they turn down the increase now, they may find  themselves voting for a double-digit rate hike next year, precariously close to  election time.  </P> <P> "I'm not interested in voting for a double-digit rate increase," said  Councilman Richard Alatorre, who faces reelection in 1991. "It makes more sense  to do it now when the amount is smaller."  </P> <P> Alatorre called the controversy a "turf fight" and said, "Until now they've at  least agreed on what the increase would be."  </P> <P> The administrative office "thinks Water and Power is sitting fat," Alatorre  said, adding that he thinks DWP has performed "fairly well" over the years.  </P> <P> Council members say they are not sure precisely why the issue erupted now after  years of peace.  </P> <P> But officials of the administrative office say the process got off to a bad  start this summer when the DWP failed to send its rate-increase request to the  mayor's office in time for the administrative office to analyze it.  </P> <P> Normally, the agencies come to an agreement before a proposal is sent to the  Water and Power Commission. Instead, the proposal went to the commission with  no input from the administrative office. Lacking any other information, the  commission approved the DWP request.  </P> <P> But, by the time the matter got to the City Council in October, Keith Comrie,  the city's chief administrative officer, had taken a hard look at the data  offered by DWP and came up with a dramatically different conclusion.  </P> <P> "We just did our normal analysis," Comrie said. "They finished last year with a  $47-million excess cash balance. . . . We were not in a position to recommend  an increase."  </P> <P> The initial report from Comrie's office predicted a $30-million surplus by the  end of the current fiscal year. That figure has since been increased to nearly  $50 million.  </P> <P> Under the DWP proposal, water rates would increase an average of 6.5% for the  rest of the fiscal year. The monthly bill for the average homeowner, who uses  1,800 cubic feet of water, would increase from $21.26 to $22.51, a 5.9% jump.  Other customers, such as publicly owned grounds, municipally sponsored  agriculture and street and drainage facilities, would face higher increases,  bringing the average to 6.5%.  </P> <P> If the increase had taken effect in October, it would have brought the DWP an  additional $19 million in revenue.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section also proposes minor revisions to &sect;270.42(d) of the modification procedures and addresses those modification requests that are not classified in the Appendix I table of &sect;270.42. Today's proposal clarifies how facilities may implement and utilize the provision for other modifications in &sect;270.42(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Background Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA first promulgated procedures for RCRA permit modifications in 1980 as part of the initial regulations establishing the RCRA permit program. This system of modifications consisted of two types: Major and minor. Major modifications followed the same public notice and comment procedures as for permit issuance, while minor modifications required only approval by the permitting authority. ``Minor modifications'' were defined as any modification contained in a short list in the regulations; all other modifications were deemed ``major.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA gained experience in implementing these procedures and decided that the Agency could improve the modifications process. One of the Agency's primary concerns was that most modifications were processed under the major modification procedures since few modifications were listed as minor. Since many less consequential permit changes and facility improvements were subject to extensive ``major'' modification procedures, EPA found that facilities were discouraged from making improvements to upgrade the facility to be more protective. At the same time, EPA and the States were diverting their resources to address minor modifications, instead of addressing modifications with greater environmental significance, or other permitting and enforcement actions. In considering how to address these concerns, EPA determined that the procedural structure needed modifying in order to classify the many activities that did not fall easily into only the major and minor categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA amended the procedures for facility-initiated permit modifications on September 28, 1988 (see 53 FR 37912). The goals of this rule were to allow for additional flexibility in processing permit modifications and to provide for an appropriate level of public involvement in the decision-making process. The main feature of these revised procedures was a system of three classes of permit modifications, ranging from Class 1 for the least significant changes to Class 3 for the most significant facility modifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA continues to believe that Agency and State permitting authorities must focus time, efforts, and resources on substantive changes to protect human health and the environment. With three classes of procedures, permitting authorities can classify modifications more accurately, according to their environmental significance, than they could under the former system. Individual examples of modifications are classified in a detailed appendix to the rule (Appendix I to &sect;270.42). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Technical Corrections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's rule, EPA is proposing certain technical corrections in &sect;&sect;270.42(a)(1)(ii), 270.42(b)(2), and 270.42(c)(2). One correction would change the reference for notifying appropriate units of state and local government in each of these paragraphs to &sect;124.10(c)(1)(x), in order to correct a typographical error. At present, these sections incorrectly reference &sect;124.10(c)(ix), which is the reference for notifying the facility mailing list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing to make a technical correction to &sect;270.42(b)(6)(i). In this paragraph, the term ``notification request'' should be changed to ``modification request.'' It is clear from the preamble to the September 28, 1988 permit modification rule (see 53 FR 37916) that EPA intended that the deadline for EPA action be related to the date that the modification request is submitted to the permitting authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Unclassified Modifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the development of the September 1988 permit modification rule, EPA recognized that classifying all possible permit modifications under the items listed in Appendix I of &sect;270.42 would be impossible. Therefore, the Agency provided a procedure in &sect;270.42(d) to enable facilities to submit modification requests for changes that are not specifically listed in Appendix I. For these unclassified modifications, facilities must either use the Class 3 modification procedures or, alternatively, request that the Agency make a determination that the activity is either a Class 1 or 2 modification. In general, requests for a classification determination would be attached to the modification request. In making its determination whether to process the request as a Class 1, 2, modification instead of a Class 3, the Agency would consider the similarity of the specific modification to others listed in Appendix I and the criteria listed in &sect;270.42(d)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After several years' experience, EPA has found that very few unclassified modifications have been processed using this procedure. EPA believes that both facilities and permit writers may be restricting themselves to only the classification examples that are in Appendix I. EPA is also concerned that in those cases where &sect;270.42(d) is used, the Class 3 modification procedure may be automatically selected, without consideration of whether the permit activity is less significant and should be reclassified to a lower category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA believes that Appendix I offers a good starting point for classifying modifications, facilities and the permitting authority should both make additional efforts to use the flexibility in &sect;270.42(d) when proposing modifications. Use of this flexibility will allow permit writers to better focus their efforts and resources on modification procedures that are necessary and appropriately tailored to the substantive changes proposed. Therefore, EPA believes that facilities should use the flexibility contained in &sect;270.42(d) when their site-specific permit changes are not listed in the Appendix I table. To address this situation, EPA is proposing to modify the wording in &sect;270.42(d) to clarify that unclassified modifications can be processed under Class 1 or 2 procedures, if this lower classification is more appropriate. EPA is also proposing to add a notation to Appendix I that instructs facilities to use the procedures in &sect;270.42(d) if a proposed modification is not listed in Appendix I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA would like to clarify that the temporary authorization provision in &sect;270.42(e) may be used by the facility, subject to approval by the permitting authority, to implement unclassified modifications as well as classified ones. In other words, the permitting agency may grant a temporary authorization, without prior notice and comment, for activities that are necessary for facilities to respond promptly to changing conditions to be protective of human health and the environment. Temporary authorizations have a term of up to 180 days; the permitting agency may grant temporary authorizations for Class 2 or 3 modifications that meet the criteria in &sect;270.42(e), including compliance with the part 264 standards. Activities that will be completed before the 180 day term expires do not require a modification request. If a facility knows up front that the activity will take longer than 180 days to complete, it should submit a modification request at the same time as its request for temporary authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

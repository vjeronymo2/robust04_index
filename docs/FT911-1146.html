			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: The danger of being left out - Judy Dempsey and Ariane Genillard continue an occasional series on cleaning up eastern Europe by examining Bulgaria's obstacles to change On a cool February day in 1989 Grisha Filipov, former communist prime minister of Bulgaria, stood on the balcony of the local communist party headquarters in Ruse. Once a thriving merchant centre under the Habsburgs but now a shabby and delapidated city, Ruse is built on the river Danube and divides Bulgaria from Romania. Filipov, in his customary, condescending fashion, waved to the crowds. He tried to reassure them that the chlorine fumes wafting across the Danube from a chemical factory in the Romanian town of Giurgiu were harmless. The crowds were too cynical to believe anything told them by this veteran party apparatchik. That day, mothers and their children placed scarves and handkerchiefs over their faces, not as a sign of defiance to Filipov but to demonstrate the need to protect themselves from the contaminated air which they breathed.* For several years, the local population had been subjected to these fumes. Studies show that over the past 15 years the incidence of lung disease has increased sharply. Ruse's inhabitants seemed powerless to do anything, until the arrival in 1989 of the national Independent Committee for the Protection of the Environment, also known as the Ruse Committee. It joined forces with Eco-Glasnost, Bulgaria's first national independent environmental movement, which quickly galvanised public opinion behind it. The Ruse Committee and Eco-Glasnost formed the beginnings of the country's first green movement. They soon became a powerful force in Bulgarian politics. By daring to challenge the monopoly of power held by the ruling communists, the green movement attracted a broad range of support, and with it experts who accumulated statistics, carried out studies and placed the environment high on the country's political agenda. The facts drawn together by independent experts make grim reading. Environment minister Dimitar Vodenicharov, who assumed office in January, says energy generation is the greatest polluter. Bulgaria's industry is energy-intensive - it relies on brown coal; Vodenicharov says: 'Between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide are emitted each year.' Other industrial activities produce 250,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide a year which seep into underground water supplies. Recent reports drawn up by Eco-Glasnost estimates that about 70 per cent of the country's water is contaminated. The catalogue of woes appears unremitting. Some 4.7m hectares of arable land, or about 44 per cent of the country's territory has been eroded, polluted, or destroyed because 68m tonnes of dust and toxic gases are emitted each year. The coalition government is realising that it will take years - and considerable sums of money - to tackle the environment, as a recent incident at the Srednogorie copper factory confirmed. On April 19, 300 tonnes of sulphuric acid leaked from the factory into the ground. The surrounding agricultural regions were contaminated and use of the local water supply was forbidden. The point about this incident is that the government had temporarily closed down the factory last year following local protests. But because the factory was interconnected with so many other enterprises - it supplies 20 of them with important industrial metals - and because it employs more than 2,000 workers, the authorities were forced to re-open it. All the other countries of eastern Europe share a similar, if not worse, fate than Bulgaria. But Bulgaria's large agrarian base tends to act as a counter-weight to the large-scale programmes of industrialisation undertaken in the other countries. That should make the Bulgarian government's task somewhat easier but officials in Sofia think differently. What concerns them is that this small Balkan country of 8.9m people will not be able to compete for the interest already being shown by western governments and investors in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The response by western consultancy firms advising western governments and industry about the costs and challenges of cleaning up the environment in eastern Europe has justified the officials' fears. 'No, we are not yet thinking about working in Bulgaria. It's not high up on our agenda. We have to obtain a clearer picture,' said one consultant. The task of collating the data is now being undertaken by the European Community's Phare programme. In December 1990 it allocated Ecu 3.5m (Pounds 2.4m) to monitor air pollution. Vodenicharov says Phare has already earmarked Ecu 15m to be spread over two years - from 1990 until the end of 1991 - for the development of a data-gathering agency. The World Bank, which has already granted Poland an Dollars 18m loan to strengthen environmental management and provide technical assistance, has not yet earmarked any finance or credits for Bulgaria's environmental problems. 'We are sending missions to Bulgaria regularly to gather data. It is too early to say what kind of programme will emerge from this,' commented a World Bank official. The World Bank's recommendations towards cleaning up the environment in eastern Europe tend initially to focus on the need to reduce the use of energy. In a recent study** the World Bank suggested that 'these governments (of eastern Europe) need to take an active role in promoting environmental clean-up through altered economic incentives and new public investments'. It proposed that 'on the incentive side, raising energy prices and imposing (and rigorously enforcing) reasonable fees and fines on polluters are two important steps that can be taken early. On the investment side, the needs are enormous, far beyond the financial resources likely to be available. 'One obvious need is for investment to switch away from coal and towards natural gas as a major energy source, accompanied by investments to clean up existing coal-burning facilities and improve the safety of nuclear plans or in some cases, decommission them . . . ' The Bulgarian government has already embarked on the first phase of economic reforms, which include the liberalisation of prices, the reduction of the budget deficit, higher interest rates, a squeeze on consumer spending and higher energy prices. Despite these efforts, Vodenicharov believes Bulgaria will remain low on the economic agenda of western countries. And because Bulgaria is far away from central Europe, he believes that unless his country makes the effort to lock into Europe as quickly as possible in order to attract investments for tackling the environment, cleaning up the country will take a long time. 'Our standards must be European,' explains Vodenicharov, who is clearly exhausted with trying to keep the environment high on the agenda at a time when the coffers are empty. He believes, for instance, that closer co-operation with the Budapest-based Regional Environmental Centre, which was set up last September, will provide some assistance. He says the centre, financed by a US grant of Dollars 5m and matched by a Phare grant, will help to co-ordinate environmental issues throughout the region. But when asked what the Bulgarian government is doing to address some of the damage, Vodenicharov shrugs his shoulders. The bitter in-fighting among the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose coalition of 19 political movements, to which Eco-Glasnost and the Green Party belong, and between the UDF and the parliamentary majority held by the Socialist (former communist) Party, means that every issue is politicised. Vodenicharov says the government, wrestling to reduce the budget deficit from 11 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1991, is in no position to place the environment high on its economic agenda. 'Everybody is in one way or other in favour of improving the environment, but my biggest enemy is the empty pocket.' * Eastern Europe: Environmental Briefing. January 1990.

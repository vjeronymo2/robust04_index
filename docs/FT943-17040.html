			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Sectarianism sours Monklands contest Attending the Monklands East by-election count was a bit like going to a match between Rangers and Celtic, the pre-eminent Glasgow football teams. It was not the signs of virtually every pub saying, 'No team colours.' Nor was it the crowds outside the small town hall of Airdrie near Glasgow with songs and slogans, with their benign early evening ebullience turning predictably to nastiness as the drink took hold. It was not even the excitement arising from an unexpectedly close fight between Labour and the Scottish Nationalists. The tension arose because this particular battle has been dominated, not to say defaced, by a sectarianism relieved only by some almost farcical own goals. As every Scottish schoolboy knows, Rangers is a Protestant team and Celtic a Catholic one. As in football so it would seem in politics. The main issue in the by-election - caused by the death of John Smith - was widespread discontent with Monklands district council's alleged favouring of Catholics. Airdrie in Monklands East is predominately Protestant. Coatbridge in Monklands West is Catholic. The council straddles both. It has 17 Labour councillors out of 20, all of the Labour councillors are Catholic. Ms Helen Liddell, 47, the Labour candidate, former employee of Robert Maxwell, a novelist and once general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, tried to stay aloof from the controversy, saying it was just tittle-tattle. Then a poll showed that she was just 3 per cent ahead of the Nationalists. Smith's own personal popularity notwithstanding, she could lose the seat. Unthinkable. Ms Liddell did a quick about face, said she had seen documents that indeed showed Coatbridge had been favoured. She added that she would fight for Monklands East irrespective of whom she would have to fight with - implying she would take on Mr Tom Clarke, Labour MP for Monklands West, friend of Catholic councillors and shadow spokesman for international development. The home team were fighting among themselves. Scottish Nationalists one, Labour nil. Then Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, 51, a social worker, made a mistake of her own. She said that the nationalist party would spend Pounds 23bn on Scottish economic development, a modest over-estimate of Pounds 22bn. Scottish Nationalists one, Labour one. As the game went into injury time, Ms Liddell was still not predicting the outcome. Nor was Mrs Ullrich. It was really too close to call. Mrs Susan Bell, the Thatcherite Conservative candidate, who was heroically defiant that she would hold her deposit amid all the religious turmoil, looked as if she wanted to go home to put her feet up. In the circumstances it was perhaps just as well that Ireland wasn't playing in the World Cup last night.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BECKER OUTLASTS MCENROE; EDBERG WINS  </P> <P> Boris Becker caught John McEnroe on one of McEnroe's best days, which means he  was as brilliant as he was temperamental.  </P> <P> And Becker was better.  </P> <P> The West German advanced to the final of the $1.3-million Paris Open by  unleashing big serves on big points to beat the third-seeded McEnroe, 7-6  (7-2), 4-6, 6-3, Saturday.  </P> <P> Becker will play No. 2 Stefan Edberg in today's final, which is worth $300,000  to the winner. Edberg beat sixth-seeded Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, in the  other semifinal.  </P> <P> "At the end, he was just a little better," McEnroe said. "But I felt I played  well. We both did. It's exciting to be part of a match like that."  </P> <P> It was the fifth consecutive time that Becker had defeated McEnroe.  </P> <P> But McEnroe, who lost seven consecutive points in the first-set tiebreaker, did  not go quietly. His game took a decided upswing after he was assessed a penalty  point in the fourth game of the second set.  </P> <P> The outburst began with McEnroe leading, 2-1, and Becker serving at 15-15.  McEnroe had already been complaining loudly about Becker's slow preparation for  service. Then, McEnroe was warned about his delaying tactics while waiting for  Becker to serve.  </P> <P> "He's not ready to play when he gets to the line," McEnroe argued with chair  umpire Richard Ings. "What makes you think I couldn't get ready to play in 10  seconds?"  </P> <P> Eventually, the tournament supervisor came out and McEnroe drew a penalty, but  his play improved. He quickly broke Becker's serve and won the second set.  </P> <P> Becker responded in the third set by breaking McEnroe's serve in the second  game and holding serve for the rest of the match.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova needed only 61 minutes to defeat unseeded Anne  Smith, 6-3, 6-2, in one semifinal match of a $300,000 tournament at Worcester,  Mass.  </P> <P> Navratilova will play third-seeded Zina Garrison, who upset second-seeded  Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3), in the other semifinal.  </P></p>

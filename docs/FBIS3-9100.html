The planes strafed the area, terrorizing  the population in the areas of Kljuc, Drvar, Petrovac,  Krupa-on-the-Una and the Serb municipality of Bihac. Moslem  forces over the past 24 hours continuously mounted fierce  attacks on this part of the battlefront, Bosnian Serb military  sources have said. Serb forces keep all front lines under  control and respond to attacks only if necessary and in case  when their property and lives of fighters are being threatened.  The Bosnian Serb Army has had no casualties in the fighting.    Moslem forces have continued regrouping on the Srbobran  (formerly Gornji Vakuf) battlefront, in central Bosnia, Serb  military sources said. Despite strong Moslem attacks launched on  Srbobran from Bugojno during the past week, trucks of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have shipped off,  via Srbobran, 600 tonnes of food for Moslems in central Bosnia,  the same sources said. Moslem forces have again staged  provocations against Serb positions towards Cajnice (south of  Mostar) and Konjic (north of Mostar), local Serb military  sources said. In western Bosnia-Herzegovina, fierce inter-Moslem  clashes continue between loyalists of hardline Moslem leader  Alia Izetbegovic and his moderate rival Fikret Abdic, leader of  the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Aquino calls on Bush to mend rift PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino of the Philippines has asked President George Bush to put aside bitterness between the two countries and help turn the US Subic naval base into a commercial port providing access to American warships, Reuter reports from Manila. In a letter to Mr Bush released by the presidential palace yesterday, Mrs Aquino said the Philippine Senate's decision last September to reject a new bases treaty with the US should not damage the relationship between the two allies. Rejection of the new treaty, which would have given the US use of Subic for 10 more years, has forced Mrs Aquino to tell Washington to withdraw its forces by year-end. The US departure would signal an end to nearly a century of an US military presence in its former colony. Mrs Aquino said in her letter: 'It is in our mutual interest that this transition be carried out in a manner that conveys to Americans and Filipinos abroad and the world at large that we have put behind us the bitterness generated by the acrimonious bases negotiations and that we remain true friends.' Manila says it plans to convert Subic, a US ship repair yard, into a commercial port but wants the Americans to leave behind some facilities, including floating dry docks. 'I would have preferred an orderly withdrawal that would have permitted the retention in Subic of one or two of the floating dry docks and the related ship repair facilities, to be operated under mutually acceptable arrangements,' Mrs Aquino said in her letter, dated February 3. She said 'a minimum of these repair facilities would need to remain in place if the US Seventh Fleet is to have access to the facilities.' If the dry docks remained, US Navy ships would be given preference in their use. A spokesman for Mrs Aquino said the dry docks were not absolutely necessary in a commercial port, but would be necessary if the port were to be used for military purposes. It was not known if Mr Bush had replied to Mrs Aquino but an American official hinted that the US forces might take the dry docks with them when they left Subic.</p>

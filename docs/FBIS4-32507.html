			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, Jun 26 (TANJUG) -- Lord David Owen, the  European Union's mediator for the former Yugoslavia, has warned  of a danger of the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina  turning into an all-out war against the Serbs in both of the  former Yugoslav republics.    Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international  conference on the former Yugoslavia, U.N. mediator Thorvald  Stoltenberg, arrived in the Croatian capital of Zagreb on  Saturday evening for talks with Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman.    Lord Owen told the press in Zagreb that "if things went  wrong  in Bosnia, there is always a danger of the Bosnian and Croatian  Serbs link-up, and (of) the Croats and Muslims, and another big  war involving both Bosnia and Croatia".    Serbs proclaimed their national states on historically and  ethnically their territories in Croatia -- the republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK), and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Srpska republic  (R.S.) in late 1991 and 1992, respectively, that is, after the  two republics forcibly seceded from the former Yugoslav  Federation.    Lord Owen said that the main topic of the Zagreb talks was  how to renew the talks between the RSK Serbs and Croatian  authorities.    Lord Owen set out that no date had been set for a new round  of Croat-Serb talks, which were put off last on June 16.    The international negotiator underscored that the talks must  be held separately from those between the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs  and Croats.    The co-chairmen of the international conference on the  former  Yugoslavia visited the capital of The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia (FYROM), Skopje, and Belgrade before arriving in  Zagreb. They conferred with FYROM President Kiro Gligorov and  President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.</p>

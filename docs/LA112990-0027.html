			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: STROLLING MARIACHIS, BLUE CORN CHIPS AND BEER! SALUD!  </P> <P> The owners of Salud! Restaurant and Bar must have been toasting the planned  success of their new establishment when they came up with this name. And, given  the crowds that pack the place, there's every reason to party.  </P> <P> Salud! is a great after-work pit stop. Drinks are well-stirred and the happy  hour buffet table is well-stocked with spicy finger foods, including blue corn  chips, buffalo wings and taquitos.  </P> <P> The majority of the customers come in to share a few drinks in the bar with  their co-workers or to wait for the next show at a nearby movie theater  complex. And they come to Salud! for good reason.  </P> <P> Once inside, one can't help but feel like it's fiesta time. Papier-mache  parrots and chintzy decorations hang from wooden rafters. On Tuesday nights  mariachis stroll through the crowd and there are a taco bar and beer wells. The  chatter level can get high, especially during the televised games, so be  prepared to get a buzzing in the ears -- or escape onto the outdoor patio.  </P> <P> A glass-enclosed patio faces the parking lot of the Holiday Health Spa. (Major  jock watch alert!) Not that everyone who sits outside is there to catch a  glimpse of the veritable hunks, and leotard-clad hunkettes, ambling to and from  their cars. The patio is in front of the restaurant, so it's also a good spot  to cruise the suits as they wander into the bar. Not that everyone at the bar  is cruising. . . .  </P> <P> Whatever you're toasting (or whomever you're chasing), Salud! is an upbeat  place to escape office drudgery and get on with the serious business of  partying.  </P> <P>  Salud!, 17041 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open Mondays through Thursdays,  11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays till midnight; Sundays, 4 to 11  p.m. (714) 842-1194. APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

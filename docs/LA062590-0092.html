			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> MARKET OWNER FACES FALSE-ALARM CHARGE  </P> <P> A Simi Valley meat market owner has been arrested on suspicion of setting off  an emergency alarm after waiting for an hour for police to respond to a  graffiti complaint.  </P> <P> Dino Andrade, 29, is the first person to be arrested for violating the city's  year-old law prohibiting intentional false alarms.  </P> <P> Andrade was arrested last week and released. He faces a maximum of one year in  jail and a $500 fine.  </P> <P> "We got a call from an alarm company saying there's a robbery in progress, but  Andrade had just called to test our response," Police Lt. Bob Robbins said.  </P> <P> Andrade, owner of El Ranchito Meats in the 1600 block of Royal Avenue, said he  pressed the alarm in frustration because police officers had not responded to a  call he had made an hour before denouncing graffiti vandalism.  </P> <P> Andrade said that he first called police after he noticed that his van had been  smeared with graffiti and that a group of teen-agers carrying spray cans were  gathered nearby.  </P> <P> Andrade said he believes that he is innocent because he didn't know he was  committing a misdemeanor. "I just have a button here that says 'emergency,' but  what does the word emergency come down to?"  </P> <P> Andrade vowed to fight the charges in court. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

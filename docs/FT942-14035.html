			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Key French interest rate is trimmed France is showing signs of non-inflationary growth based on healthy economic fundamentals, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said yesterday. However, he stressed that the government must stick to its policy of reducing the public sector deficit. 'It is essential that the effort which has been decided be effectively put in place year after year,' he said, referring to the government's five-year plan to curb its deficit. Mr Trichet was speaking after the central bank announced a reduction in the intervention rate, the key short-term interest rate, by one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.8 per cent. The 5-to-10 day borrowing rate was also cut from 7 per cent to 6.75 per cent. The moves were in line with the bank's strategy of gradually reducing interest rates in tandem with falling German borrowing costs. On Wednesday the Bundesbank cut its repo rate by 12 basis points to 5.58 per cent. Investors and economists in Paris said that yesterday's cuts were the minimum expected. But Mr Trichet warned against too rapid a reduction in short term rates. 'A brutal reduction in short-term interest rates could damage the economy,' he said. According to Mr Trichet, an excessive cut in short-term rates would undermine the bank's objective of internal and external monetary stability, putting upward pressure on longer term interest rates. This would jeopardise investment and housing expenditure, both of which were crucial for economic recovery, he said. The modest cut disappointed some investors. The CAC-40 index of leading shares on the Paris stock market slipped by 0.5 per cent to close at 2,091. But some welcomed the move. 'It was not a big cut, but it shows that exchange rate considerations have not been put above the needs of the real economy,' said one currency economist. The French franc, which this week fell below FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark, its previous narrow band floor rate in the European exchange rate mechanism, firmed after the announcement, closing at FFr3.4270 in London. Mr Trichet emphasised that the level of the franc remained a central consideration. 'The monetary policy committee (of the Bank of France) is extremely attentive to the stability of the franc,' he said. According to Mr Trichet, the economy's strong fundamentals are evident in the inflation rate and the trade balance. Figures released yesterday by Insee, the national economics statistics institute, confirmed that inflation fell in March to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent. The trade balance registered a surplus of FFr89bn (Pounds 10.42bn) last year which, Mr Trichet said, reflected industry's competitiveness. To ensure recovery, however, Mr Trichet said that efforts to curb government spending must be maintained. He noted that France's public sector debt rose to 44.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993, compared with 39.5 per cent in 1992. 'This ratio is one of the lowest in Europe, but it is rising,' he said.</p>

Tom Monson said.  </P> <P> Gardena police arrested the driver, Christopher Russell, 24, of Redondo Beach,  and booked him on suspicion of felony drunk driving and felony hit-and-run,  Monson said.  </P> <P> The injured man could not be identified, Monson said, because a police report  that would provide that information had not yet been filed. Monson said the man  was taken to Harbor General Hospital, where he was listed in satisfactory  condition.  </P></p>

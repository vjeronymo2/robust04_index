			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERCHANT MARINE  </P> <P> As a Vietnam War historian, I was pleased to read the Aug. 26 review by Charles  Bowden on "Looking for a Ship" by John McPhee. Bowden's review summarizes the  changes within the merchant-marine industry during the past 20 years and it  clearly outlines the potential impacts the current events in the Middle East  and the Persian Gulf may have on the merchant fleet.  </P> <P> However, readers should not forget that when American merchant ships become the  illegal targets of foreign governments' military action, it is the American  military that is called to the rescue. All we have to do is recall the Vietnam  War and the SS Mayaguez.  </P> <P> On May 12, 1975, while the U.S. was still at war in Southeast Asia, the  Mayaguez, under Capt. Charles Miller, was fired upon by Cambodian gunboats and  forcefully boarded while in international waters off the coast of Cambodia. The  40 civilian crew members were taken hostage.  </P> <P> As outlined in Roy Rowan's book, "The Four Days of Mayaguez," President Ford  ordered a rescue mission involving Air Force, Marine and Navy personnel. The  crew members and ship were rescued, but at a loss of 15 American military  personnel killed and three missing. Fifty more were wounded in the rescue  effort.  </P> <P> As the United States answers a new call for democracy, let us not forget that  when serving in a battle zone, the merchant marine is at times exposed to  danger. Yet it is ultimately the American military personnel, earning far less  per year than the $30,000 to $60,000 of a merchant seaman, who will be called  upon to rescue that merchant fleet, even at the risk of being wounded or  killed.  </P> <P> JOSEPH MONTOYA  </P> <P> SOUTH PASADENA  </P></p>

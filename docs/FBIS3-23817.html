			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduard Shevardnadze under the rubric </F> "Commentary": "Eduard Shevardnadze: `The President of Russia Had  the Courage...': Georgian Head of State and Parliament Chairman  Comments for MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI on the Results of Boris  Yeltsin's Visit"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin is probably the only Russian  politician who has realized and taken upon himself full  responsibility for a full-scale adjustment of Russian-Georgian  relations. Even my democrat friends in Moscow still do not wish  to understand the importance and necessity of the president of  Russia's recent visit to Tbilisi. It is difficult for me to say  this, but I must: Yegor Gaydar was in charge of the government  during the period of the Georgian-Abkhazian war, while his  cabinet provided immense financial and material aid to  separatists. Boris Nikolayevich understands that normalization  of our relations is in the interests of the preservation of  political stability not only in Georgia but also in Russia  itself. In the course of a one-on-one conversation we  practically came to mutual understanding with respect to the  resolution of common problems. Graphic evidence of this is the  package of agreements that have been signed, including on  freedom of trade, protection of borders, and many others--24 of  them so far. More than 10 are still to be signed in the nearest  future at the level of the prime ministers. In order to properly  implement our agreements, a decision was made to create working  commissions headed by Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets.    Speaking at the Academy of Sciences in Tbilisi to the  academic and creative intelligentsia, the president of Russia  had the courage and fortitude to say that his country does not  absolve itself of responsibility for what happened in Abkhazia.  We discussed this problem too, of course. There are three  options for settling it with the participation of the United  Nations and the use of peacekeeping forces. We found mutual  understanding with respect to practically all three options.    The first option envisages the participation of combined UN  peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone.    The second also assumes the participation of this contingent  with an analogous status, except that 80 percent of participants  will be comprised of only Russian armed forces personnel. But in  this case the point of contention is financing this process,  which requires approximately $200 million, which, according to  Butrus-Ghali, the United Nations currently does not have. There  is also another option, which has been proposed by the UN  secretary general--let Russia and Georgia come to an agreement  among themselves regarding peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. But  in this case we face the same dilemma: Who will undertake the  burden of financing?    Intensive consultations are currently underway in all  directions. I know that the American government is looking for  possible sources of financing. I think that in the nearest  future we will arrive at a common denominator. In parallel, work  is in progress on a model of political system for Abkhazia that  will take into account protection of the rights of the peoples  living there, which will be reflected in the new Georgian  constitution.    One may ask: Why in the text of the final communique is the  issue of ratification of this agreement linked to the problem of  peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem? We have to  understand that Russia also has its own difficulties in the  North Caucasus. And this fact obligates both us and our neighbor  to find a peaceful resolution to the existing confrontation. At  the same time, Russia took it upon itself to provide  organizational development for the Georgian national army.  Before taking this step, I thought long and hard and consulted  with many leaders of different countries. All were willing to  provide aid only on the level of inspectors and consultants, but  no one would undertake to provide aid in the form of armaments.  Nobody except Russia is in a position today to provide tangible  aid in this matter.    There are currently 30,000 soldiers and officers officially  listed in our army on paper, but in reality you probably will  not count even a few thousand. And nobody knows where the money  allocated by the government goes.    Besides all these issues, many people want to know whether  Georgia will join the ruble zone. I asked the president of  Russia how he views this. His answer was straightforward: There  is not much enthusiasm. It is an additional burden for Russia.  Nevertheless, it was decided to set up a special commission,  which will weigh all "pros" and "cons" and then will arrive at a  concrete decision.    I consider it an important point of the visit that the  president of Russia has accepted my "3 + 1" model for settling  the Caucasus problem as a whole--creating a permanent  consultative body with the participation of heads of  Transcaucasus states and Russia.    Despite the opposition forces' skeptical attitude to this  visit, the absolute majority of the population sees  normalization of our relations as the only chance for Georgia to  get out of the crisis. According to sociological surveys, 75  percent actively support our course and only 10 percent feel  negative about it.</p>

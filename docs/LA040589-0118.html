			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REFUSES TO STOP RINGING OF CHURCH BELL  </P> <P> A small-town church in rural Hatfield has rung up a first-round victory in its  battle of the bell.  </P> <P> A judge has refused to silence the bell at the Hatfield Congregational Church,  ruling that a couple next door who claim the ringing has left them with  sleepless nights will have to prove their case at trial, a spokeswoman said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Hampshire Superior Court Judge John Murphy Jr. refused to grant a preliminary  injunction that would have prevented the bell from tolling between 9 p.m. and 7  a.m. each day, a court spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

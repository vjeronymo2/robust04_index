			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: A family affair One person seems to have been overlooked in all the gossip about who will take over the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, may be the natural front runner in the eyes of the French government. But getting the nod from Madame de Larosiere may be a different matter. De Larosiere - due to retire from the Bank of France at the age of 65 next year - would certainly have the gravitas Jacques Attali lacked, but his wife may have other ideas. The owner of a chateau in Picardy, she played a strong role in persuading her husband to return to France in 1987 from his post in Washington as IMF managing director - a job he swapped with his countryman Michel Camdessus. However, central bankers do soldier on, so it would be odd if de Larosiere didn't accept the London job, if offerred. In which case expect Jean Claude Trichet, top man at the French Treasury, to get the Bank of France job.</p>

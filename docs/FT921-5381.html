			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Late rally helps Ford keep lead on sales REGISTRATIONS of new Ford cars in the UK speeded up late last month, in spite of the company's repeated claims that it would not 'buy market share' to boost sales figures. At the end of last week Ford of Britain said overall sales of new cars in the UK had weakened dramatically in the final days of the month, as private buyers delayed purchases ahead of a possible cut in car tax in next week's Budget. It expected to be ousted by Vauxhall from leadership of the market for the first time - on a monthly basis  - since the mid 1970s. Official car registration figures for February will be announced tomorrow. It was disclosed at the Geneva motor show yesterday that Ford's sales surged late in the month, contrary to the company's statement last week. Ford's daily market share was never above 20 per cent in the first 20 days of the month, but its daily share accelerated in the latest four reporting days to 25 per cent, 24.1 per cent, 32.3 per cent and finally to 36.3 per cent. The impact of the sudden surge in Ford registrations on the UK new-car market has been significant, with total daily sales jumping to 6,723 and then to 7,501 in the last two reporting days available compared with a daily average for the month of 4,884. As a result Ford is expected to hold its market leadership narrowly ahead of Vauxhall. With one reporting day left for the month it had captured 19.7 per cent compared with Vauxhall's 19.8 per cent. After 20 days it was still in third place behind Vauxhall and Rover. Ford officials were embarrassed yesterday at the disclosure of the last-minute surge. Ford insisted that it was abiding by its new policy of reducing loss-making sales of heavily discounted cars to the daily rental fleets and said there were no special programmes in place to persuade dealers to register cars on to their own fleets of demonstration cars. The surge in Ford registrations means the fall in overall UK new-car sales last month is likely to be about 11 per cent compared with the industry's earlier fear of a 15 per cent fall. Sales remained very depressed, however, and February's registrations are expected to be more than 40 per cent below the 1989 peak.</p>

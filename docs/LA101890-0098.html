			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIDEAST SETTING OBSCURES 'OTHELLO'  </P> <P> There's been punk Shakespeare, cowboy Shakespeare, even extraterrestrial  Shakespeare. Now, at Fullerton College, there's Persian Gulf Shakespeare.  </P> <P> Director Tom Blank has taken "Othello," that wrenching epiphany of jealousy and  vengeance, and tossed it into a militaristic Middle East framework. It's not  Kuwait that's been invaded, but Cyprus, prompting an infusion of American  soldiers to protect imperialist interests.  </P> <P> The vain Othello is now a brigadier general; his wife, Desdemona, is the  daughter of a Southern U.S. senator. Treacherous Iago deals drugs in every  barrack with the help of cocaine-snorting Roderigo. Most of the men wear combat  camouflage, except for Roderigo, who's partial to "Miami Vice" duds.  </P> <P> In this age of conceptual Shakespeare, the trend is toward experimentation and  license, which aren't such bad things. If the idea is grounded by Shakespeare's  original intent and keeps faith with the characters, then why not? Modern ideas  for modern times.  </P> <P> The trouble with Blank's sweeping revision is the scale of the situation to  which he turns for inspiration. By citing the Middle East, and with his barely  disguised references to Iraq and Kuwait, Blank creates a backdrop so loaded  with associations that the gist of "Othello" is obscured.  </P> <P> The machinations of Iago and the succumbing of Othello wind up seeming like  minor human folly. The concept threatens to swallow the characters.  </P> <P> To Blank's credit, the production did seem to hold the primarily college-age  audience at a recent performance. This "Othello" may not have included all the  shading that a Shakespeare purist might like, but its bold imagery seemed to  entertain, and the applause was loud at play's end.  </P> <P> GIs dancing at a smoky disco with miniskirted hookers, contrasted with devout  Muslims supplicating at sunset, helped create visual interest, even if it  ultimately seemed gratuitous. Rex Heuschkel's abstractly pillared set and Bob  Jensen's gauzy lighting are dramatically designed.  </P> <P> So are the performances, but not always with the refinement found on the  technical side. Shakespeare may be the toughest assignment even for the best  students, and the toil of the challenge is clear throughout the cast. Paul  Hagerty's Iago is interesting, though, mainly for the enthusiasm in his  wild-eyed nastiness.  </P> <P> Cress Williams also gets wild-eyed as Othello, especially when jealousy begins  to reign in his house. But the portrayal doesn't go beyond the obvious, and  Williams tends to overact. All his emotions are on the outside; it's difficult  to connect with Othello's internal struggle.  </P> <P> 'OTHELLO'  </P> <P> A Fullerton College production of William Shakespeare's tragedy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of leading British businessmen, led by  George Young, minister for housing, inner cities and  construction, has ended its visit to the republic. The outcome  of the visit was concluded by a news conference held at the  Kazakh Ministry of Construction. It was noted that Great  Britain last year ranked fifth in the foreign trade turnover of  our republic, with 12 joint Kazakh-British ventures functioning  at the moment. Representatives of British major businesses  continue to establish ties with the economic structures of  Kazakhstan, even during this visit. As is known, the winner of  the tender for the Karachaganak deposit development in West  Kazakhstan oblast is the British Gas company. Together with the  Italian Agip, the British Enterprise Oil and the Spanish Ereston  companies, British Gas won the tender for the search for  hydrocarbons in the promising Bayganin field in Aktyubinsk  oblast. The British [name indistinct] company successfully  completed talks on setting up a joint venture with Kazakh firms  in Mangistau oblast. British businesses are displaying evident  interest in the development of the Republic's construction  complex. An accord has already been reached whereby British  companies and banks will participate in the modernization of the  construction industry and the training of personnel. Joint  production will be set up, including use of new technology and  know-how, and projects which are of mutual benefit for both  sides will receive investment.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ashley Group falls Pounds 6.67m into red ASHLEY GROUP has plunged from profits of Pounds 8.01m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.67m in the six months to February 29. Mr Tony Butler, chief executive, resigned at the end of the period amid disagreements over strategy and pressure from institutional shareholders for change. Mr James White, chairman of the Spanish food retailing and window blind distribution and plywood group, said: 'The period was one of considerable difficulty,' adding that he hoped it would 'prove to have been the nadir in the group's fortune'. All three divisions suffered downturns and the interest charge jumped to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 117,000), after an increase in average net borrowings to between Pounds 25m and Pounds 28m, caused by 'the adverse trading results, working capital movements and the absence of anticipated property disposals'. The pre-tax line was further hit by a swing from exceptional credits of Pounds 1.32m to charges of Pounds 2.81m. These comprised parent company costs of Pounds 1.17m relating to the board's strategic review and Mr Butler's Pounds 593,000 golden handshake, and Pounds 1.64m abnormal bad debts and provisions for reorganisation and rationalisation in Digsa, the Spanish food retailer. Mr White said he had thought it best to clear all the decks at once. He said that the changes at Digsa, bought for Pounds 30m in 1988 by Mr Butler from his former company, Dee (later Gateway) Corporation, were about two thirds complete. Senior management has been strengthened and Mr White has called a halt to further acquisitions. Two of Digsa's five regions were performing profitably, one just above break-even and two were the cause of the divisional tumble to trading losses of Pounds 2.79m (profits Pounds 4.09m). Profits in the blinds distribution side fell to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 3.06m) and in British Plywood to Pounds 37,000 (Pounds 186,000). Group turnover grew to Pounds 213.6m (Pounds 183.5m) with the food distribution side accounting for Pounds 196.8m (Pounds 169.9m). Losses per share emerged at 5.3p (earnings 4.5p) and the interim dividend is halved to 0.375p. The shares were unchanged on 29p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashot Gazazyan: "The President of Azerbaijan </F> Proposes To Immediately Vacate Seven Rayons and One City"]    [Text] Information agencies have brought stunning news: It  turns out that Baku does not rule out the possibility of a  Russian plan intended to settle the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh  and eliminate the consequences having been produced...in  Yerevan. This assessment of Russia's new peacemaking initiative  confirms the traditionally established idea that Azerbaijan is  not even thinking about winding down combat actions and indeed  is placing its bets on crude force.    Meanwhile, let us recall that the Russian plan calls for  discontinuing combat actions in the conflict zone, vacating  Azerbaijani territories, and allowing refugees to return. Moscow  proposes to disengage the conflicting parties within three days  after a cease-fire and to spend an equal amount of time  establishing a buffer zone where international observers are  expected to be located. Ultimately the blockade of Armenia would  be broken, Karabakh would finally get relatively stable security  guarantees, and Azerbaijan would get back its territories seized  by the Karabakh Defense Army solely in order to ensure the  security of its lines and the civilian population.    However, even this did not satisfy the politicians from  Baku.  They have now recalled that...Shusha also is among the  "occupied" territories--incidentally, it is a city that is an  inalienable part of Nagorno-Karabakh. If we adhere to the logic  of G. Aliyev, we may also hear very soon that, for example,  Mardakert is not mentioned in the Russians' plan.... As far as  Lachin is concerned, according to Aliyev, it has also been  "completely left out" of the new Russian plan. That is to say,  the Lachin humanitarian corridor, Nagorno- Karabakh's only  outlet to the outside world, should also be vacated by "Armenian  formations." Thereafter, one would expect that Azeri soldiers  will only have to conduct the last military operation in order  to once again occupy the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, in its  turn, and bring the population to its knees. It is hard to say  whether these conditions of Baku are a ploy or complete lack of  acceptance of existing realities, most likely caused by the  quite understandable desire of the Azerbaijani leader to not  share the fate of previous presidents of the state.... Be that  as it may, Baku's reluctance to accept the world as it now is  will not bring either Azerbaijan or the region as a whole more  peace.    President Aliyev invited people from Karabakh to visit  Baku--this is yet another sensation of recent days. In the  process he made it clearly understood that those invited are  citizens of Azerbaijan, and must engage in dialogue with Aliyev  in the capital city in a way befitting people speaking with the  president. It is hard to understand why the leaders of Karabakh  must set out for Baku for anything at all. Clearly they might as  well engage in "constructive" dialogue with, for example, the  leaders of Kyrgyzstan or Sweden. The list could be continued....    Yet another proposal by Aliyev confirms yet again that there  are no political forces in Baku capable of evaluating the real  situation in the region soberly; this means that a new  escalation of combat actions should be expected, naturally, with  all the peacemaking efforts, and not just those of Russia, being  completely ignored. It is hard to say how much longer Baku will  be able to play a duet alone, thus misleading the world  community. One thing is obvious: Whatever the array of forces,  Nagorno-Karabakh will never again be a protectorate of  Azerbaijan. If a few more weapons emplacements of the aggressor  need to be suppressed in order to ensure the security of the  people of Karabakh, they have the means to accomplish this and  support for these actions from commonly accepted norms of  international law. If a weapons emplacement threatens the  security of the population, it can be suppressed. This begs the  following resume: If mistakes are not perceived today, their  number may triple tomorrow. One cannot ride a tank or fly a  bomber to peace and welfare in the region. If only all the sides  understood this....</p>

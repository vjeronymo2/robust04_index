"Macro-controls over the banking sector, however, should be  distinguished from government mandates to banks," said Wang  Chuanlun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and an  economics professor of Chinese People's University.    To have macro-control means, the professor said, the  government must establish and improve various kinds of financial  markets in a systematic way.    First to be established, Wang said, is a market for  short-term inter-banking lending and borrowing, to be followed  successively by a bill discount market, a market for the trading  of treasury bonds, a market for the trading of enterprise bonds  and shares and a mortgage loan market.    In the meantime, he said, the existing foreign exchange  market should be improved.    For the central bank, he said, the main function is to  maintain the value of the Chinese yuan and determine its  exchange rates with other currencies.    In converting existing banks into purely commercial banks,  he  said, the first thing to do is to determine their assets through  careful auditing.    It is necessary, he said, for the government to decide  establishing some "policy" banks. But the government should  have concrete decisions on who exercise control over such banks,  where their founding capital should come from, and who will bear  their future risks and losses.</p>

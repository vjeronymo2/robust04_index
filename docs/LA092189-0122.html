			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> A FRUSTRATED ANGLER GOES DEEP TO HOOK HIS SURFACE FISH  </P> <P> It wasn't a typical three-day tuna fishing trip for Charlie Floven of Long  Beach, aboard the El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing.  </P> <P> On the first day out, steady catches of small albacore were being taken on jig  stops. Floven failed to land one while trolling.  </P> <P> On the second day, the El Dorado started kelp-hopping stops for yellowtail.  </P> <P> At every stop the crew kept busy gaffing albacore catches. Floven kept getting  hits but was not able to bring a longfin aboard.  </P> <P> Not one to give up, he changed his tactics.  </P> <P> Floven put an 80-pound test line on his rod and tied a treble hook with an  eight-ounce sinker.  </P> <P> "I'm going to try something that is not conventional for surface fishing. I am  not about to get skunked on this trip," Floven told the crew.  </P> <P> Down toward the bottom, he let his line out with a small whitefish for bait,  and within minutes was hooked up with a yellowtail. He was following his fish  and reeling at the same time when suddenly his reel handle failed to turn.  </P> <P> "This is one that could be the jackpot and he's not going to get away," said  Floven. As the rod bent, he started to hand line the heavy fish to the surface  and the waiting gaff.  </P> <P> It was indeed a jackpot contender, but Floven lost out by one pound to a  26-pound yellowtail caught by Paul Bentacy of San Pedro.  </P> <P> Kelley Wall of Carson returned Monday from a five-day albacore trip to San  Benitos Island off Mexico and said it was the most fabulous trip he had ever  been on.  </P> <P> Wall caught 15 yellowfin tuna and 15 yellowtail and won the jackpot with a  33-pound yellowtail. He caught three albacore but released the small one.  </P> <P> The sixth annual Dave Freeman Fire Department Burn Foundation derby saw 56  anglers fishing for cash awards.  </P> <P> First place with a six-pound bonito went to Mark Young, who got a cash award of  $361. Second spot, worth $217, went to Don Sutton and third, for $73, to Bob  Olsen. All three winners were from Wilmington Fire House 49.  </P> <P> The big winner of the derby was the burn fund, which received most of the  proceeds from the derby.  </P> <P> Another International Game Fish Assn. record is pending.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach angler Nick Curcione, fishing with a small fly rod and  eight-pound test line, caught a 10-pound, 5-ounce skipjack while fishing for  albacore aboard the Searcher. It has been officially weighed and registered  with the IGFA.  </P> <P> Carrie Friedman of Redondo Beach was also aboard the Searcher and won the  trip's top lady angler award when she decked nine albacore and seven skipjack.  </P> <P> The Catalina Island Gold Cup Marlin Tournament will take place Monday and  Tuesday with 110 boats signed up to compete. First place is worth $40,000.  </P> <P> Prospects are good as 204 marlin have been weighed in at Avalon so far this  year.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Dennis McCullough of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Pacifica on a multiday  trip, caught the whopper of the week with his 55-pound bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Mike Tamaray of Hawthorne won the jackpot with his 28-pound yellowtail fishing  aboard the Blackjack at Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Jess Conti of Long Beach won the jackpot aboard the Victory with his 22-pound  yellowtail fishing at the rigs.  </P> <P> Mike Carson of West Los Angeles, fishing for sand bass aboard the Spitfire,  hooked a big barracuda; the jackpot fish weighed eight pounds.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> Rain and wind failed to dampen local fishing. Multiday tuna trips are all  scoring with a variety of exotics.  </P> <P> At Marina Del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught  40 sculpin, 35 sand bass and three barracuda.  </P> <P> The Delmar fished the rockpiles and anglers returned with 140 rock cod and one  ling cod.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod trip to Redondo canyon had a catch of 150 rock cod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished the twin roads area and anglers  returned with 80 bonito and 55 calico bass.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo half-day trip to rocky point resulted in a catch of 50  bonito and 30 sand bass.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special half-day trip returned with 51 sand bass and 43 bonito.  </P> <P> The Blackjack fished Santa Barbara Island on a rock cod trip and anglers sacked  360 rock cod and three ling cod.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked Catalina Island for 81 bonito,  52 calico bass and 12 barracuda.  </P> <P> Anglers on the Monte Carlo half-day trip to the horseshoe kelp caught 88 calico  bass, 37 bonito and one halibut.  </P> <P> At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Sportking headed to Catalina and anglers  caught 93 bonito, 22 calico bass, 11 sculpin and two sheepshead.  </P> <P> The Matt Walsh half-day trip resulted in a catch of 200 bonito, 20 sculpin and  16 rockfish.  </P> <P> The Outerlimits multiday trip chalked up 35 skipjack.  </P> <P> The Shogun fished San Clemente Island and anglers sacked a variety -- 175 blue  perch, 45 rockfish, 39 whitefish and 25 sheeps head.  </P> <P> At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory, fishing rocky point, found a wide-open  bonito bite with anglers sacking 249 plus 24 calico bass and one halibut.  </P> <P> The Toronado fished Catalina and chalked up 141 whitefish, 68 rockfish, 41  calico bass and 28 sheeps head.  </P></p>

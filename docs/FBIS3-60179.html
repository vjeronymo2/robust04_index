			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Drug Bust Mystery: Why Always </F> Abroad?"]    [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an  unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming  from Trinidad and Tobago take place outside this country's  territory.    Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with  clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place  everywhere--in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina;  Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada--but here.    Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins  and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went  unreturned up to late Friday.    Law enforcement sources said in both shipping  incidents--involving the methanol tanker Harold La  Borde and the schooner Let Me Live--local police  had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined  total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels  in places outside Trinidad and Tobago.    The Ministry of National Security has gone a step further  and  rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration  between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an  official government press release.    Despite this, no one could say why, if information was  available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and  on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by  local narcotics or Coast Guard officers, instead of allowing the  US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Grenada Coast  Guard to break those two smuggling operations.    In the case of the Harold La Borde the DEA gave  credit to a local informant who was paid "good money" by the US  counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to  the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians.    Pierre Sharette, assistant special agent of the DEA Miami  office with responsibility for the Caribbean, told the SUNDAY  EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no  connection to law enforcement agencies.    Current bids for credit by local officials recall the  episode  two years ago when the Narcotics Bureau claimed credit for the  Florida arrest by US authorities of Paul Mansoor with five  kilograms of cocaine.    Vexed by the false claim, a US source later told this  newspaper that Mansoor was picked up in Miami because he was  acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the  T&amp;T police.    Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a  "controlled delivery"--the reason, some people believe, for the  failure of local authorities to act on the information here.    In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off  the DEA, who in turn alerted the Grenada Coast Guard that drugs  were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the  schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the  drugs but allowed the ship to leave the Caricom jetty and sail  clear out of T&amp;T waters has not been explained.    A top policeman would say only that "we were aware of it  (drugs on board the schooner)." Pressed further, he said: "The  information is very sensitive."    He claimed that authorities here "are aware of the local  connection" in both drug runs. He added only that: "We have an  idea what's going on (in the drug business)."    He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local  dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the  arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on  outbound flights at Piarco International Airport and low-level  street dealers.    Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in Germany  with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on BWIA  flight 980--Port of Spain to Frankfurt.    Suspicions created since charges last year about a police  "drug cartel" have slowed the sharing of information even  between the newly created narcotics unit and Selman's OSS. Each  agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and  sharing it "on a need to know basis only."    There is no explanation either why there are no busts for  drugs coming into Trinidad and Tobago, or how much of  what comes in remains here.    Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace  with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by  traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major  shift in US drug policy.    The Clinton administration announced it will slash drug  interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the  Caribbean and pump more aid to South America to fight cocaine at  the source.    Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that Trinidad and  Tobago  is being used as a "staging area" by the Medellin and Cali  cartels to move drugs to Europe and North America.    Sharette said DEA intelligence indicates that single and  twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in Trinidad  and Tobago territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for  repackaging and shipping to Europe and North America.    Meanwhile, despite Huggins' vow to get tough, cocaine  cartels  continue to bring their drugs into Trinidad and Tobago and, as  evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some  of it out.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Four jailed after bullion trial: Large part of proceeds from Pounds 26m Brink's-Mat robbery still missing A LARGE part of the spoils from Britain's biggest bullion robbery continues to evade detectives some nine years and 12 trials after an armed gang escaped with Pounds 26m in gold bars from a top security warehouse near Heathrow Airport. As four members of the criminal network that handled and conspired to handle proceeds from the Brink's-Mat raid were sentenced yesterday to prison sentences ranging from five to 10 years, police were still pondering what had happened to part of the proceeds. Mr Brian Perry and Mrs Jean Savage, who were convicted yesterday at the Old Bailey of taking part in a plot to launder profits from the raid, received sentences of nine years and five years respectively. Fellow defendants who were convicted last week, Mr Gordon Parry and Mr Patrick Clark, were sentenced to 10 years and six years. Mr Clark's son, Stephen, was acquitted. In the Brink's-Mat case - Britain's most notorious robbery since the Great Train Robbery more than 20 years earlier - armed raiders threatened to turn security guards into human torches to make them disclose the combination of the vault. Unlike the train robbers, however, the Brink's-Mat gang had evolved an elaborate plan to convert the bullion into cash and launder the proceeds in the international financial system. Gold was melted down and sold on the open market by Mr Kenneth Noye, a Kent businessman said to be the central linkman in the scheme. Noye was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in jail for his part in the plot. Previously he had been acquitted of murder after stabbing a police officer who had been keeping his home under surveillance. Some Pounds 14m is thought to have been laundered through two groups using the Noye route. Another route is so far undiscovered. According to the prosecution, once the money had entered the banking system it went on a merry-go-round between various banks and offshore institutions. Initially, however, the money entered banks through large cash deposits. Mrs Savage took a total of Pounds 2.5m of cash in shopping bags to a branch of the Bank of Ireland in Croydon. The prosecution noted it was a lot of money to be banked by a 'lady tobacconist'. Her nest egg, which was later transferred to Dublin, grew to Pounds 4m with interest before part of it was transferred to another bank account in Dubai. That money was frozen by the courts before it could go further but other profits from the raid were said by the prosecution to have been ploughed back into property ventures, including some in London's Docklands. Whether cash could be transferred into the bank system so easily today is unlikely given the publication of Bank of England guidelines in 1990 which urged banks and building societies to report suspicious transactions to the police.</p>

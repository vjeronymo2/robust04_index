			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Oil prices Yesterday's decision by Shell Oil to cut its US workforce by 20 per cent underlines the tough conditions for oil companies. Overall, Shell is better placed than most, yet the management of the US subsidiary still felt enough heat to act before the Anglo-Dutch parent stepped in. With the oil majors having to pay dividends and finance massive capital expenditure programmes through the recession, cost control and improved productivity are the obvious ways to control cash flow. A weakening crude oil price only makes matters worse. The market seems bemused by the recent fall below Dollars 20 a barrel, given that there is no obvious over-supply. In part this may reflect scepticism that November's Opec meeting will give a positive lead. Indeed, with tensions between the Gulf producers growing, there is a risk that Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will continue to pump near full capacity into the spring. A sustained fall below Dollars 18 might start to threaten some capital projects.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henrik Ennart including unattributed interview </F> with Anders Eriksson, new head of SAPO, in Salen on 7 April:  "New SAPO Chief Unknown From Justice: Strict Discretion  Distinctive"]    [Text] In sun and snow, the Justice Ministry's head of the  legal section, Anders Eriksson, 49, on Thursday [7 April] tried  to absorb the fact that the government had decided to appoint  him the new head of the security police. He spent the day  cross-country skiing in Salen with his wife, Bodil, and daughter  Louise, 17. But via a telephone connection from the Hogfjall  Hotel, he told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that SAPO [Security Police]  will continue its reorientation when he takes over on 1 May.  <H5>  More Terrorism </H5>   [Eriksson] My appointment will not affect anything. Because  of the fall of the East bloc, the security police are moving  away from military threat perceptions and devoting more energy  to terrorism and serious crime.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Russian crime?    [Eriksson] All serious crime.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The United States has recently organized  a group of environmental agents who are working under the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Is this something for  Sweden to copy? You were once secretary in the environmental  damage fund commission.    [Eriksson] In the United States they have agents for just  about everything, but environmental agents in Sweden are not  necessary. The government has instead decided to add an  environmental ombudsman.  <H5>  Time To Find </H5>   The government took its time finding a successor for former  SAPO chief Mats Borjesson. When they finally decided, they  picked a person who, in the manner of top legal professionals,  disdains the public spotlight and always observes strict  discretion.    Few know him outside the circles of power, despite the fact  that he has held top positions at the Justice Ministry since he  was hired as an adviser in 1980 and despite the fact that he has  been an appeals court judge in the Gota Court of Appeals since  1986.  <H5>  No Comments </H5>   He is keeping this low profile even after his appointment.  To every question concerning SAPO's activities or his  qualifications for appointment, the answer was "I cannot comment  on that."    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But your background as a captain in the  reserves in Skanska dragoon regiment P2 probably played a role?  There you belong to the secret forces that have special tasks  in the early stages of a war.    [Eriksson] As you surely understand, I cannot comment on  that.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So it is your experience at the ministry  that weighed most heavily in the appointment?    [Eriksson] I don't know. I have also taught at the police  academy and have worked in the court system. You have already  mentioned the military background.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How much contact have you had with SAPO  up until now?    [Eriksson] Some contact, but in my job at the Justice  Ministry, I have not needed to know the entire picture. To  begin with, I must familiarize myself with this.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you will now go through the files in  SAPO's archives?    [Eriksson] Maybe I won't quite go about it in that manner.</p>

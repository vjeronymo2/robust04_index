			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Spain cuts benchmark rate: Economic Watch The Bank of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate to 7.75 per cent, from 8 per cent, at its regular seven-to-thirteen day repurchase tender. The central bank satisfied 93 per cent of the Pta4,590bn (Pounds 22.7bn) in bids, allocating Pta4,280bn. The tender coincided with the expiry of Pta3,020bn in repurchase agreements, and represents a net injection of about Pta1,260bn in liquidity. Spain's Bankinter followed the central bank announcement by trimming its prime lending rate to 7.75 per cent. Analysts said the recent strength of the peseta against the German mark and the US dollar, together with the absence of fresh inflationary pressures, allowed room for the third reduction in two months. AP, Madrid Italy's retail sales index rose 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993 from a year earlier, the state statistical institute, Istat, said yesterday. Italian industrial output climbed 0.7 per cent for the first two months of 1994 compared with the same period in 1993.

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIZZLE POSTPONES DRAG RACE TRIALS  </P> <P> A persistent drizzle Friday afternoon caused postponement of the second round  of qualifying for the Chief Auto Parts Winternationals drag race at Pomona.  </P> <P> Weather permitting, qualifying for the National Hot Rod Assn. event will resume  today at the Fairgrounds strip with pro classes running at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.  If today's program is washed out, however, the entire schedule will not be  resumed until next Friday.  </P> <P> A number of favorites, including Winston funny car champion Kenny Bernstein,  pro stock champion Bob Glidden and top-fuel veterans Gene Snow and Eddie Hill,  remain unqualified.

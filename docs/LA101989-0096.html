			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: TOPANGA;  </P> <P> PART-TIME SHERIFF'S OFFICE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will increase its presence in  Topanga by assigning two deputies to a part-time office there by Nov. 1,  sheriff's officials said this week.  </P> <P> Concerned by what they say has been an influx of transient day laborers in the  Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu, residents in recent months have renewed a  request for an increased law-enforcement presence in the community.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Bill McSweeney said two deputies assigned to patrol the area from  the Malibu Sheriff's Station will use the new office, in a shopping center near  Topanga's post office, primarily as a place to write reports. He emphasized  that the facility "will not be a regular sheriff's office, per se, with regular  hours, at least not for the time being."  </P> <P> The owner of the shopping center donated the space; the Topanga Town Council is  paying to install a telephone, and a local resident even volunteered to make a  sign.  </P> <P> "We're excited about it and think it will help with the transient problem, and  contribute generally to better law enforcement," said Barry Glaser, president  of the Town Council.  </P></p>

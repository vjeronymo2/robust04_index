			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of the self-styled Republic of  Transdniestria [Dniester] supports the idea of setting up a  Russian military base on the basis of the Russian 14th Army,  Transdniestrian state secretary Valeriy Litskay told INTERFAX on  Monday. However, there has been no official proposal from  Moscow yet, he said.    Litskay stressed that the base question and the future of  Transdniestria could be discussed in parallel at bilateral talks  with Moldova. The latest round of talks on 9 April gives the  chance for settling the dispute, Litskay said. And he added  that the emergence of a Russian Army base in Transdniestria  could help resolve many controversial issues.</p>

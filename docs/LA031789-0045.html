			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> More on Letterman: His uninvited guest -- a woman charged with breaking into  his home on several occasions -- has been ordered to undergo further  psychiatric exams to determine whether she understands the charges against her.  The attorney for Margaret Ray, 36, requested the additional tests after one  psychiatrist found her competent to stand trial. Ray faces charges of criminal  trespassing, burglary, possession of marijuana and larceny. She was arrested  for breaking into Letterman's home in New Canaan, Conn., on Feb. 28. It was the  second time in five days that she had been found inside Letterman's unoccupied  house, and last spring, she also had been arrested twice for breaking into his  home that's about 40 miles north of New York City. Ray will return to court  March 28 to learn whether the judge believes she is competent to stand trial.  Aleene Macminn  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF TIMUR THE GREAT;  </P> <P> LACMA'S REMARKABLE EXHIBITION TESTIFIES TO THE URBANE REFINEMENT OF ART UNDER  THE CONQUEROR TAMERLANE  </P> <P> Devout followers of art do a good bit of grumping these days about the ways  their sacred objects are being used. Junk bond traders use art to gain cultural  prestige. Corporations finance luster-lending exhibitions. Right-wing  legislators threaten to sanitize the National Endowment for the Arts. Art, in  short, is being transformed from a garden of cultural insight into a political  plow.  </P> <P> A remarkable exhibition opening today at the County Museum of Art proves -- if  it is any comfort -- that this is not the first time art has been put to work  to tart up someone's reputation.  </P> <P> The exhibition, on view to Nov. 15, is called "Timur and the Princely Vision"  and concerns Persian art and culture in the 15th Century.  </P> <P> Exhibitions about the Middle East tend to get Westerners balled up on account  of current hostility and ignorance, plus real historical complications, all  compounded by changes in scholarly convention. The lands that used to be known  as Persia are now roughly encompassed by Iran. The tyrant here called Timur  might be more readily recognized by his old occidental handle: Tamerlane the  Great, or sometimes Tamerlane the Lame.  </P> <P> Oh, him. Sure, I knew it all the time. He was the most awesome conqueror of the  Middle East after his own hero Genghis Khan.  </P> <P> Timur -- born in 1336 -- came roaring out of Transoxonia with his  Turco-Mongolian hordes pillaging and plundering until he controlled an empire  that gobbled up all of what is now Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq and chunks of  India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, China and the U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> Timur used terror systematically. One favorite trick was to mass the skulls of  thousands of victims into huge columns outside the gates of cities he wished to  impress.  </P> <P> Decidedly not a nice guy, but a charismatic leader capable of unifying factions  and a shrewd politician who used the arts to impress the rubes, mollify the  opposition and, naturally, glorify his glorious self.  </P> <P> This cultural manipulation is what the exhibition is all about, and it is a  first. Put together by LACMA curator Thomas Lentz and Glenn D. Lowry, curator  at the Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington D.C., it is an understated  triumph of organization.  </P> <P> Anyone expecting to be bowled over by gallons of gold and cornucopias of  precious stones as they walk into the exhibition should be forewarned. In the  first place, the most grandiose Timurid art is its architectural monuments such  as the sanctuary dome of the masjid-i jami of Timur in Samarqand, which can be  shown only in photographic murals. In the second place, this is one of those  revelatory pieces of scholarship whose very fine catalogue is a virtual must  for getting the best from the show.  </P> <P> The exhibition includes stunning objects such as Chinese-style jade cups and  sections of architectural mosaics, but the largest number of works are  drawings, calligraphic sheets and illustrated manuscripts that include some of  the greatest known examples. Artistic pleasure here comes from such rarefied  masterpieces as a bookbinding as delicate as lace where silhouettes of plants  and animals have been cut from a single piece of leather. That's just a trick,  of course, as is the calligraphic page where microscopic arabesques are  individually cut from paper. What makes them work is an exquisite sense of  refinement that turns work after work into delicate visual poetry akin to  patterns in a kaleidoscope.  </P> <P> Such attenuated elegance did not represent Timur's personal taste, which tended  to run to powerful candlesticks the size of cannon and Koran pages as big as  pup tents. One hapless artist made Timur the Islamic version of the New  Testament engraved on the head of a pin and he drummed the poor chap out of  court. Who needs this little-bitty stuff? We need something huge to awe the  plebes. The Trump Mosque.  </P> <P> There were buildings aplenty and luckily Timur's vision was better than his  taste. He needed the fealty of his Islamic subjects and so incorporated their  literature, poetry and beliefs. He established Kitabkhana -- royal libraries or  workshops that became the centers of art, literature and learning. (Many a  Timurid noble paid pious patronage and lip service to Islam while violating  most of its codes in private.)  </P> <P> Timur introduced elaborate ritual codes into courtly ceremonies all designed to  enhance his own awesomeness. Court etiquette was so complex that visitors had  to be manhandled through the ceremonies to make sure they groveled correctly.  This sense of convoluted correctness comes across in an art so intensely  stylized it is a wonder it is often as fine as it is.  </P> <P> Timur died in 1405 at age 69. Without his leadership the empire came unglued,  potential successors scrapping bloodily. When the dust settled the emergent  leader was called Shahrukh. Until 1447 he ruled over an empire that was as  fragmented within as it was opulent without.  </P> <P> Slowly the empire eroded into the kind of dalliance that is bad for politics  and terrific for art. Manuscript illuminations and scalpel-sharp drawings tell  the story in their style. They depict a world of disembodied pleasure where  concubines loll in patterned rose gardens while the prince hunts, composes  poetry, studies the Koran or consults his astrologer. (The stars were taken  seriously. One prince drank himself to death after receiving a bad horoscope.)  </P> <P> The pictures may seem unreal but they are the precise metaphor of the reigning  ideal of the princely world -- separate, private and luxurious. As time wore  on, cultural refinement held such sway that reputations were made and broken  with literary quips and elaborate word games. During one of these literary  jousts a noted social arbiter and wit became simultaneously annoyed at a door  that was banging in the wind and another guest who was just as noisy. The wit  asked someone to bolt the door. When the man rose to comply the wit said, "I  meant to bolt it from the other side."  </P> <P> There is a kind of predictability to histories of crumbling empires. As the  Timurids lost yet more power they had to cultivate the good will of religious  men, and we see a series of paintings of bedizened nobles visiting hermit  monks. As things got even more out of hand there was a Reagan-style revival of  The Good Old Days where Timur is depicted as the great hero -- the George  Washington of his day, strong and wise. The paintings are as magnificent as  their motive impulse is sentimental.  </P> <P> By the time the ferocious Uzbeks became belligerent in 1507, former Timurid  boldness had given way to refinement. The empire was done for. Or was it?  Timur's manipulative and eclectic artistic program turned out to be his  greatest legacy. It set a standard for urbane refinement that held sway through  four Turkish dynasties from the Uzbeks to the Mughals. Timurid aesthetics were  so widespread that they mark one of the world's most fabled palaces. We think  of the Taj Mahal as quintessentially Indian. As the show's curators whisper  enticingly: "Hey, folks, the Taj Mahal is a Timurid-style building."  </P></p>

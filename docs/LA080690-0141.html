			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECOND THOUGHTS ON SOCRATES;  </P> <P> PHILOSOPHY: FOR 30 YEARS WHAT GREGORY VLASTOS THOUGHT ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHER  CAME TO BE WHAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT. BUT NOW VLASTOS IS REVISING HIMSELF.  </P> <P> Working from his home above the UC Berkeley campus, Gregory Vlastos looks out  across the San Francisco Bay as its morning fog drifts toward the city famous  for its precipitous slopes.  </P> <P> But the philosopher's thoughts are wandering through another renowned hilltop  metropolis, that of ancient Athens, itself much obscured by nearly 2 1/2  milleniums of history.  </P> <P> Internationally eminent as a historian of ancient Greek philosophy, Vlastos,  who recently turned 83, has pioneered current thinking about one of the  city-state's most illustrious citizens, Socrates. Roaming the marketplace in  his well-worn coat, button-holing merchants and youths with his insistent  questions, Socrates "brought philosophy from heaven to earth," in the acclaimed  words of the Roman orator, Cicero. At a time when other thinkers were either  speculating on the nature of the cosmos or cultivating the esoterica of  metaphysics, Socrates began his analyses of human conduct, and in so doing  helped to lay the philosophical foundation of Western culture.  </P> <P> Vlastos, who is also Greek, has spent more than 30 years patiently striving to  better understand the ideas of his countryman, whose life spanned 70 years from  approximately 470 to 399 BC. The fruits of his labors are now twofold: Last  month the octogenarian philosopher became the recipient of a $375,000 MacArthur  Foundation Fellowship, awarded for creative endeavors by the John D. and  Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and, in the process, tied two former winners  for the record of oldest honoree. In addition, next spring, his scholarly  exploration will culminate in the publication of his book, "Socrates, Ironist  and Moral Philosopher" (Cornell University Press and Cambridge University Press  in England).  </P> <P> According to specialists in ancient Greek philosophy, Vlastos, like Socrates,  has done much to humanize the field at a time when emphasis is being placed on  the logical validity of arguments rather than the substance of thought.  </P> <P> "He has shown that philosophy can speak with a public voice and address  problems that are of concern to everyone," says Alexander Nehamus, professor of  philosophy at Princeton University and a former student of Vlastos.  </P> <P> Along with British philosopher, G.E.L. Owen, Vlastos, says Nehamus,  "established Greek philosophy as a serious field of study in America."  Previously, "philosophy in America was unhistorical," and concerned more with  solving contemporary problems. Vlastos showed there was relevance in the  solution of problems bequeathed by ancient philosophers, he says.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, Vlastos formed the generally accepted view of Socrates as a  negative thinker who pointed out contradictions in other people's thinking,  says Nehamus. His new book, he believes, "is going to change the way Socrates  is being seen within philosophy. It's Vlastos revising Vlastos, but at the same  time it's Vlastos revising common sense, because what he thought about Socrates  for the past 30 years came to be what everybody thought about Socrates."  </P> <P> Vlastos, who regrets that scholars have come to depict Socrates as a dull  moralist, now presents a dynamic positive figure whose views had a charismatic  influence on the youth of his time and have an immediate relationship to our  own. In the late 20th Century he would be a brilliant debunker of hocus-pocus  in issues of public morality.  </P> <P> "We could use a whole platoon of people like Socrates," says Vlastos, who bears  on his cane to ease himself into a living room chair. Suffering from bone  cancer, which has left him frail, he nonetheless speaks forcefully, with the  sort of fearless assertions and brisk ironic gusts of humor that are said to  have characterized Socrates.  </P> <P> "The most important single thing about Socrates is his insistence on clear  thinking," says Vlastos. "There's a tremendous amount of fuzzy thinking today,  particularly on the topic of morals, which allows ecclesiastical dogmas to be  slipped in on us, like the questions of contraception and abortion."  </P> <P> Vlastos, who attacks anti-abortion arguments with alacrity, finds "the idea  that a fertilized ovum, within a day of its fertilization, is a person is  simply absurd."  </P> <P> Compounding the wrongness of reasoning, he says, is the fact that this dogma  has been foisted off on a nation whose constitution proclaims the separation of  church and State.  </P> <P> "Socrates would have had a field day pointing out these absurdities," he  declares.  </P> <P> As the critic of the public conscience, Socrates, says Vlastos, would have a  plateful of issues on which to speak:  </P> <P> * Donald Trump: "He would really press him as to whether he can find happiness  by piling up endless quantities of money and possessions."  </P> <P> * The slashing of funds from social services and concurrent support for  military defense: "The only way we apply modern technology, which can produce  unlimited quantities of wealth, is by running into military crises and then  diverting vast amounts of money to the production of 'illth,' which is the  opposite of wealth."  </P> <P> * The ethics of the Ronald Reagan era: "He was a great joker. . . . He had no  compassion for others less fortunate than himself.  </P> <P> "These are the kinds of questions Socrates loved to address," Vlastos states,  "the problems which real human beings have to face in real life."  </P> <P> Furthermore, the media would give him the opportunity to reach an audience of  millions, rather than a scattering of individuals. "Socrates would be a prime  subject for TV talk shows," says Vlastos. "He had something of substance to say  and he would say it with wit and irony and fearlessness."  </P> <P> The most important moral lesson that Socrates taught, and one to which Socratic  students have not previously given proper attention, Vlastos believes, is his  rejection of the principle of retaliation.  </P> <P> "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was a very well-established  principle of morality in Greece," he says, "far stronger" than it is in today's  society, with Greeks commonly supplicating the gods to take vengeance on their  foes.  </P> <P> Yet Socrates held that "if your only reason for hurting someone is that that  person did a nasty thing to you, that is totally unjustified," Vlastos says.  "This is the principle that wrought havoc in the ancient world," setting Athens  and Sparta in a nearly 30-year war of retaliation.  </P> <P> Similarly, it was to refute the principle of retaliation that Socrates, who was  sentenced to death for impiety and the corruption of the city's youth, chose to  drink the poisonous hemlock, the state's method of inflicting death, rather  than accepting the escape from prison that his friends had prepared.  </P> <P> "The argument that was made to him was 'the Athenians have done you dirt.  They've condemned you unjustly. So you should feel free to do whatever is most  advantageous to your personal safety,' " says Vlastos.  </P> <P> Instead, Socrates obeyed the lawful punishment of the city, which, he  recognized, had allowed him the freedom to question traditional platitudes for  most of his life, a freedom he would not have enjoyed in Sparta.  </P> <P> It is such an act of integrity that separates Socrates from American notables  of our day, Vlastos thinks. Although there are some celebrated thinkers, he  finds, "people with true integrity are quite rare in our society. I can't think  of a contemporary Socrates."  </P> <P> His style was in diametrical opposition to popular contemporary celebrities.  Considered ugly by Greek standards of aesthetics, he was slightly pop-eyed and  snub-nosed with large flaring nostrils (the better to take in fresh air, he  would joke, Vlastos says), though as his pupil Plato wrote, he was "all  glorious within." And rather than trumpeting his importance, says Vlastos, "he  was always running himself down."  </P> <P> In some ways, he invented irony, Vlastos says. "He'd come up to you and say,  'Oh, you look like a very wise lady to me. Now what do you think about this and  that.' And pretty soon it would appear that your wisdom was a little bit  over-rated."  </P> <P> He was suspicious of politics, refused to become entangled with wealth, and  felt his life's mission, commanded by God, was to examine himself and provoke  self-examination among the citizens of Athens.  </P> <P> He used language with striking virtuosity, engaging young men in debate on the  benches of the city's gymnasia, at the same time that they developed their  physical powers.  </P> <P> But if Socrates flourished as a conspicuous celebrity, Vlastos points out, it  was because he was part and parcel of a society in which intellectual prowess  was highly prized. The word and the act of philosophizing, as it is known in  Western civilization, are Greek in origin, as is "the idea that fundamental  principles are all susceptible to rational criticism -- all of them," Vlastos  says.  </P> <P> "The Greeks had a much livelier intellect than appears in our young people  whose minds are stupefied by TV and other essentially passive entertainments  which don't call on them to exert their minds.  </P> <P> "The general atmosphere of the age is not critical. In our society we have this  success bug." Consequently, Vlastos says, "one adopts the conventional signs of  good behavior and becomes very wary of departing from established habits."  </P> <P> This, in turn, results in "the fact that people are buffaloed by all these  uncritical dogmas," which Vlastos thinks is the source of "so many of our  problems today."  </P> <P> Vlastos' own critical thought was formed at an early age in the particularly  Socratic manner of one-on-one tutoring, which he continues to tout in  opposition to classroom instruction. Raised among the Greek minority in a  Turkish village on the Bosphorus Sea, he received his schooling from his  mother, proving its efficacy by entering Istanbul's (then Constantinople)  American-run Robert College at the age of 14.  </P> <P> Graduating three years later, he left to study for the Congregational ministry  on a fellowship at the Chicago Theological Seminary. For a summer he served as  pastor in the hamlet of Beverly, Mass., before earning a doctorate in  philosophy at Harvard University and opting for a life studying secular  morality.  </P> <P> Devoting so many years to the examination of Socrates' thoughts has greatly  influenced his own life, Vlastos says. "You can't help it, living with a man  like that who is a person of complete integrity."  </P> <P> Like Socrates, he has spent much of his life teaching, influencing the thoughts  of two generations of students. A professor of philosophy at Princeton  University for 21 years, he retired in 1976 and became professor emeritus at UC  Berkeley, leaving that post three years ago. He has also been a visiting  professor at St. Andrews University in Scotland and Cambridge University,  England, where he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.  </P> <P> He has also achieved a Socratic moderation in his life, which he partially  credits for his longevity. "That's one reason I've lived to my present age," he  says, musing that he has presently outlived Socrates by 13 years.  </P> <P> Having survived his wife (he has a daughter in Alhambra and a son in Iowa), he  spends most of his time in his secluded hillside house, which he finds  conducive to thought. Since his illness, however, days of strenuous work have  given way to three hours of morning writing. He has been working on his book  for a dozen years.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased I finished it," he says, allowing himself a modest measure of  self-satisfaction. "I thought my illness would finish me off before I finished  the book. But I won, and now I hope to write a second volume."  </P></p>

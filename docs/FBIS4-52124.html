			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hiroki Fukuda] </F>   [Text] Damascus, 7 May -- Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  held a meeting on 6 May with reporters, who are traveling with  him, and commented on the Japan-U.S. new economic talks, saying:  "As long as free economy and free trade are foundations of  Japan and the United States, I think it is not logical for the  United States to demand Japan to set numerical targets. I have  a feeling that determining it is not logical to call for  numerical targets, the United States is beginning to realize  that such a demand will not gain support from the world opinion."    The foreign minister held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher in Cairo on 3 May. According to the foreign  minister, the secretary of state said at the meeting that "we  are not demanding Japan to set numerical targets." It seems  that the foreign minister's remarks were based on Christopher's  comment.</p>

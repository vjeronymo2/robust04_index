			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: HK hotel group static at Dollars 40m Mandarin Oriental Inter, the hotel group controlled by Jardine Matheson, yesterday announced unchanged net earnings of USDollars 40.8m for 1993, compared with Dollars 40.3m the previous year. Improved contributions from the Hong Kong hotels were offset by weak performances in most other markets, the company said. The results fell short of expectations, and the group has been hit by a fall in hotel visitors. For 1989, profits totalled HKDollars 392.8m (USDollars 50.8m). Some 64 per cent of profits before interest and tax came from Hong Kong and Macao last year, and Mr Robert Riley, managing director, earmarked the colony as one of next year's better performers, due to shrinking supply as hotels are pulled down and converted into office blocks. Mr Riley said the average room rate at the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong was lower than it was in 1989, during which time inflation in the colony had risen more than 50 per cent. This year he sees rates outpacing inflation as the sector attempts to catch up. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The company's two hotels in Hong Kong should benefit from stronger demand in 1994. 'While the immediate outlook is mixed in the group's other markets, the groundwork has been laid for future growth and the prospects for Mandarin Oriental remain encouraging.' Earning per share were 6 US cents, against 5.94 cents. The group is maintaining a 5 cents a share dividend.</p>

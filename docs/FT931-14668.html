			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Nuances of CGT on trusts YOU recently explained the CGT treatment of unit and investment trust savings schemes. Is not the situation even more complicated? According to the leaflet sent with my unit trust annual report, for CGT purposes the total amount of income reinvested, as shown on the tax credit vouchers, should be added to the original cost. For indexation, when is the dividend received? Presumably it is added to the value of the units as it is received from the constituent companies, and the voucher is only a summary of the amounts received in the year. Yes, the calculations for accumulation units are generally more complicated than those for monthly savings schemes, or automatic reinvestment schemes. For accumulation units purchased after the end of March 1985, the net retained income shown on the first voucher ranks for indexation from the day on which the units were purchased; subsequent net retentions rank for indexation from either the latest date provided by the trust deed (for any distribution in respect of the distribution period in question), or, if no date is so provided, the last day of the distribution period. This complex rule is derived from sections 99 and 113 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, in conjunction with section 468 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The rules are slightly different for units purchased between the end of 1981-82 and the beginning of April 1985; they are significantly different for units purchased before April 6 1982. The position would also be slightly different if more than one retention date fell within the first year after the purchase, or if none did. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

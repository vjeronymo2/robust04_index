			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Lottery pair lead in vetting stakes Nearly nine weeks into the great National Lottery stakes two of the bidders appear to have gone into an early lead - at least as far as the volume of questions they have received from the Office of National Lottery. The two are Camelot, a consortium that includes De La Rue and Cadbury Schweppes, and Lotco, an associated company of the Rank Organisation. They were already widely considered to be front-ranking applicants before receiving a greater number of vetting questions than other bidders. Camelot advertised for staff last month and has already had more than 2,000 applicants for about 200 of the more important jobs. It intends to make conditional appointments before the winner of the lottery is announced. Most other candidates being vetted have received only a handful of questions  -typically a mere three or four. Those who have had only a small number of queries range from Games For Good Causes, the Ladbroke-MAI consortium; the Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada and Carlton Communications; Richard Branson's UK Lottery Foundation; the Rothschild Tattersalls Lottery Consortium; and Rainbow, a consortium put together by Sir Patrick Sheehy, the BAT chairman. The position of The Enterprise Lottery, a consortium including the Tote and Thorn EMI, is unknown. Camelot is believed to have received several dozen questions and Rank has also received a significant number of detailed questions. The eight consortia are vying for the right to run the UK's first national lottery in modern times - an operation that could turn into the world's largest single lottery. The Office of the National Lottery has reached the half-way stage in the selection process and hopes to announce the winner by the last week of May.</p>

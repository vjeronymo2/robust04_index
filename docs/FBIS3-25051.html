			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk in Johannesburg by </F> announcer Jon Snow in London on 4 January; from the "Channel 4"  newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Snow] Is there still a chance of persuading Inkatha  to participate in the elections?    [De Klerk] I think, maybe because time is becoming of the  essence, it is just possible that a form of accommodation and  settlement can be reached. Even if it does not take place, then  it is not impossible that Inkatha, as an active party with a  sound organization, might still decide to take part. I really  and sincerely hope so. That is what democracy is about, that is  what parties should do.    [Snow] Now there is already a residual level of violence in  South Africa. Do you fear that if Inkatha does not take part  that violence might inevitably escalate?    [De Klerk] I think that there might be a definite risk of  escalation, we will go out of our way firstly to prevent that  and were it does occur, to handle it firmly so that there can be  free and fair elections.    [Snow] Now, what about the white right-wing. Can you be sure  after the elections that the Armed Forces in particular, will  respect the results and will not in any way rally to the cry of  those on the white right who might want to wreck things?    [De Klerk] Our Armed Forces have a very proud history of  being apolitical, they, especially in terms of the new  constitution, are safeguarded in that regard. We have excellent  cooperation, for instance of the Army, with regard to the fusion  of the Army and other so-called armed forces which fought  against them for many years, and this fusion is taking place as  planned and we have the cooperation of the Army. So therefore,  while there might be individuals and while there might be quite  a number of individuals in the Army and the police, the  Conservative Party and the far right, I am convinced that  discipline will be maintained and the basic loyalty of the  forces to the state, as opposed to any party, can be and will be  maintained.    [Snow] Can I ask you now about the National Party's campaign  itself. How do you persuade, particularly black and colored  people, that the party which after all oppressed them over the  past 50 years is suddenly going to work in their interests.    [De Klerk] Well it is not really so difficult to persuade  them to do that because they know that it was I, while Mr.  Mandela was still in jail, who made the speech of 2 February  1990. They know that even before negotiations with the ANC  [African National Congress] got off the ground we were still in  the initial stages. I repealed all discriminatory legislation,  the group areas act and all the other apartheid laws, and  wherever I go I am engulfed with warmth and friendship from  black South Africans, and they come up to me even if they are  ANC in some instances, and shake my hand and say: We admire you.  They are friendly toward me, they accept that the National  Party is a newly National Party. Our congress today has proved  it, my walkabouts proved it.    [Snow] Let me just interrupt you there, because surely it  would be fair to say that quite a lot of these rallies, as in  many other countries, are very staged events. People say that  large numbers of black people in particular, are shipped in to  give the appearance of a much more multiracial party than really  exists.    [De Klerk] No, some of the meetings which I have, for  instance when I do, as we call it, a road show. Yes people come  to a prearranged venue, but much of it is absolutely  spontaneous. I go, for instance, to a market place -- I walked  into a vegetable market the other day, nobody expected me, there  were no posters up, nothing, and I took a mike and I stood up  and spoke, and there were up to 600 people. They all came to  shake my hand and I had the chance to spread my message. It was  not a put-up job at all.    [Snow] What then is your realistic expectation of how you  can  come out of all this? What sort of percentage do you think you  are going to get?    [De Klerk] I am not quoting percentages, I am saying we are  working and we are very serious about it. I say it as an old  campaigner, it is achievable to get the biggest percentage of  the vote. That does not mean getting more than 50 percent, it  means getting the biggest percentage out of 100 of the vote --  that is first prize, we are working for that, and we truly  believe that it is achievable. If we can gain some significant  support from black South Africans, and by the day I am becoming  more and more convinced that we can, we will be the biggest  party in South Africa.    [Snow] Mr. de Klerk are you in end the greatest pragmatist  of  the 20th century, or do you really believe it all?    [De Klerk] I really believe it all, I am a realistic  idealist. I do not walk with my head in the clouds, I have my  feet firmly on the ground, but I am an optimist and I believe we  can make South Africa a much better South Africa. I think we  can unlock it's tremendous potential, and I think there is  widespread enthusiasm for this vision of the future.    [Snow] One is bound to ask somebody who grew up steeped in  the apartheid idea, who then saw the need for change, whether  even after this process, you will still find it easy to treat  black politicians with absolute equality?    [De Klerk] I have no problem whatsoever, I have been doing  it  for the past years. We opened our party's membership more than  two years ago to all South Africans. I now have in my  parliamentary caucus more people of color than white people and  there is a wonderful spirit of unity at this congress of ours.  Black and white took hands and spontaneously sang together.  There is no racism left in the National Party and I have no  inhibitions whatsoever in associating with them and calling them  my partners, my colleagues, my brothers.    [Snow] Mr. de Klerk, thank you for talking to us.</p>

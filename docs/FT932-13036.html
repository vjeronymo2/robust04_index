			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Scalfaro steps up hunt for new PM ITALIAN President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday put strong pressure on the leaders of the main parties to co-operate in forming a new government as quickly as possible. After three days of consultations with all 16 parties represented in parliament, there was little sign that any of the leaders had shifted from entrenched positions. This was despite Mr Scalfaro's aim to have a new government agreed at the latest by today. Mr Scalfaro alluded to widely contrasting views when he wound up his formal consultations yesterday. 'The difficulties are there for all to see, and everyone must confront them with absolute clarity and calm,' he said. It is the first time that an Italian president has assumed such a direct role in forming a new government. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, handed in the resignation of his four-party coalition last Thursday following the overwhelming referendum vote in favour of electoral reform. However, Mr Scalfaro has yet formally to accept the government's resignation. In the search for a new prime minister, the Christian Democrats have refused to drop their objections to the candidature of Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the highly respected former communist who is leader of the Chamber of Deputies. Mr Napolitano has been proposed by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) to head a non-partisan 'institutional' government. The Christian Democrats say they favour a government with a clear political base in parliament rather than relying on the prestige of a bipartisan figure to secure a majority. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, has also been unenthusiastic about the candidature of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum movement leader who is backed by the Lombard League and as an alternative by the PDS. Among possible compromise candidates yesterday were the names of Mr Amato himself; Mr Leopoldo Elia, a Christian Democrat senator and former president of the constitutional court; Mr Romano Prodi, the distinguished economist and former chairman of Iri, the state holding company; and Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the veteran governor of the Bank of Italy.</p>

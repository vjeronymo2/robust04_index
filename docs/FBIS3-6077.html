This was disclosed by his brother Datuk  Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Parti Bersatu Sabah, PBS, [Sabah  United Party] assemblyman for Bingkor. Datuk Jeffrey said he  will inform Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and  his deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, of the offer in a special  meeting tonight.    Datuk Jeffrey was speaking to reporters at the open house  hosted by Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir at Sri Perdana [prime  minister's official residence] today.    The three Parti Bersatu Sabah assemblymen who quit the party  last Saturday lodged a police report against Chief Minister  Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan and two others at the Bukit Aman  Federal Police Headquarters early this morning.    UMNO [United Malays National Organization] information  chief,  Haji Karim Zain, said the report by the trio -- Datuk Lajim  Ukin, Rubin Balang, and Datuk Zainal Ishak -- alleged fraud  against Datuk Pairin, State Assembly Speaker Datuk Haji Hasan  Alban Sandukan, and Assembly Secretary Datuk Francis Yap in  respect of their update undated resignation letters as state  assemblymen.    In their reports, lodged in about 1:45 AM, they denied that  they had consented or given approval that their letters be  submitted or that they had instructed anybody to put a date to  the letters and submit them to the state assembly.    The three assemblymen also asked police to investigate their  case and to take appropriate action. They were accompanied by  two lawyers when making the police report.    The three state assemblymen announced their resignation from  PBS to throw their support behind Barisan Nasional [National  Front] last Saturday. They issued a statutory declaration  stating that all documents or letters signed by them -- whether  dated or undated -- pertaining to their resignation from the  state assembly were null and void.    Hours after the announcement which put Datuk Pairin's  three-week-old state government in jeopardy, Datuk Yap announced  that the trio had resigned from the state assembly and that  by-elections would be called.</p>

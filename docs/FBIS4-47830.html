			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 3 SAPA -- The African National Congress  Midlands region in KwaZulu/Natal on Tuesday [3 May] claimed  large-scale voting irregularities, particularly in areas north  of the Tugela River. "We are obviously concerned and anxious  about this lead (in election results in the province by the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]). We are convinced there has been  massive irregularities," said ANC spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande.    The IFP's Dr Ziba Jiyane earlier predicted a 60 per cent  majority for his party, adding that the IFP had overwhelming  support north of the Tugela River. "This lead is not a true  reflection of the IFP's popularity," Dr Nzimande said.    On Tuesday afternoon an Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] report gave the IFP a lead of 21.4 per cent over its ANC  rival. Dr Nzimande said the three ANC Natal regions were  meeting to discuss "this grave situation".    Discrepancies were noted in votes cast, particularly in  KwaZulu- administrated areas, and had been forwarded to the IEC  for investigation, he said. He said even in rural areas, where  the ANC had a marginal support base, "it doesn't reflect at all".</p>

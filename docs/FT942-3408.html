			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Reliefs granted to laws on competing Further measures to relieve the burden of competition laws on businesses were announced yesterday by Mr Neil Hamilton, deregulation minister, Robert Rice writes. The government proposes to cut the maximum time allowed for ministers to consider whether to refer a pre-notified merger to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for full investigation from 45 days to 35 days. It is also planning to relieve small businesses from the burden of investigation for anti-competitive conduct under the 1980 Competition Act by raising the turnover threshold below which they escape scrutiny from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m. The government has rejected a call by MPs to give the proposed new deregulation committee the power to summon ministers. It said in response to a report by the Commons procedure committee that the power would be 'unprecedented' and 'unnecessary'.</p>

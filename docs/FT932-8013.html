			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool After last week's price surge in Australia, taking the market indicator up by 20pc from its low point only two weeks previously, the market there has given a steadier impression this week. Competition is still good with China, Taiwan and Japan active as well as the EEC. Prices for most merino fleece have, however, slipped a little, bringing the market indicator down to 449c/kg on May 19, from 455c/kg at the end of last week. In consuming countries covering pressure also appears to have subsided somewhat. There is, nevertheless, confidence that the lowest point of the season has been passed.</p>

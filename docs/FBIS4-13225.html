			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we have just received the following  statement from the presidential council of the Kurdistan region  on the destruction of the two helicopters in the airspace of  Kurdistan:    O esteemed citizens, o masses of our struggling people; on  14  April, two helicopters belonging to the coalition states, which  were entrusted with defending the security of Kurdistan, were  destroyed when they were fired upon by mistake by coalition  fighter planes. The incident left all the passengers of the two  helicopters dead.    As a sign of our appreciation for their sacrifice and spirit  of cooperation in the service of human rights and democracy in  Kurdistan, we have decided to declare a three-day general  mourning period, effective today, 15 April. Prayers will be  performed in all mosques and bells will be tolled in all  churches for this painful event.    All media networks in Kurdistan shall comply with this  decision.</p>

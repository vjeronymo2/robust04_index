			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Iraqi assets to be seized by UN THE United Nations security council last night directed states that hold blocked Iraqi oil assets to seize them to pay for food and medicines for needy Iraqis, begin compensating victims of the invasion of Kuwait and meet some UN peacekeeping costs. The resolution, adopted by 14 to 0 with China abstaining, sets a limit of Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m) per state holding funds. The money must be transferred 'as soon as possible' to an escrow account administered by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. Officials estimated combined proceeds at a minimum of Dollars 1bn. The US holds the bulk of the Dollars 4bn in Iraqi assets which were frozen after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq may still avert the punitive measure by ending its refusal to export up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil every six months to pay for essential imports and compensation claims. That provision was approved last year in the first relaxation of sanctions. In the general assembly this week, the Iraqis again objected that the terms insulted their national sovereignty. In a bid to head off last night's resolution, they asked instead to be allowed to sell Dollars 4bn worth of oil, mainly for relief. They also offered to donate 5 per cent for non-Iraqi aid, including some to Bosnia-Hercegovina. Much of the cash raised by the seizure of assets is intended for more than 3m Kurds facing famine in northern Iraq.</p>

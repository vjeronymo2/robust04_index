The proposal on holding  the referendum March 27 was earlier advanced by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk.    Speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning, Plyushch said  that the constitutional law on power should be adopted by  parliament.    According to the draft law that is to be debated in  parliament Thursday, the local executive power should be in the  hands of the heads of locals councils who are to be elected.    The institute of the president's representatives, Plyushch  proposed, is to be annulled after the constitutional law comes  into force.</p>

Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROYALS, RED SOX CLOSE BOGGS TALKS  </P> <P> The Kansas City Royals ended talks with Boston today over a possible trade for  Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs.  </P> <P> Royals General Manager John Schuerholz told Boston General Manager Lou Gorman  that nothing could be worked out.  </P> <P> "We're not going to do anything with them," Schuerholz said. "There is no deal  with the Red Sox, and there won't be."  </P> <P> Schuerholz met with Gorman this morning at the Red Sox camp.  </P> <P> Trade rumors had the Royals sending third baseman Kevin Seitzer and left-handed  pitcher Floyd Bannister to the Red Sox for Boggs and a pitcher. There were also  rumors of a three-way trade with Kansas City, Boston and the New York Mets  involving Boggs and Royals right fielder Danny Tartabull.  </P> <P> Boggs has angered the Boston management by his continued willingness to talk  about his four-year affair with Margo Adams.  </P></p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Insurer to pay rebates to California drivers PROGRESSIVE Insurance Company, the Ohio-based insurer which specialises in non-standard private passenger car coverage, has agreed to pay Dollars 51.2m (Pounds 28.1m) in rebates to Californian motor vehicle insurance policyholders. The agreement represents further progress for Mr John Garamendi, the Californian Insurance Commissioner, as he struggles to implement Proposition 103, the state's voter initiative which was passed in 1988. Prop 103 called for rate rollbacks based on the profitability of car insurers operating in the states. However, the insurance companies quickly mounted formidable legal opposition to its provisions, and implementation of Prop 103 led to a tangled courtroom battle. Progressive is only the third big insurer to agree to pay out Prop 103 rebates. The others are Auto Club of Southern California and Mercury Insurance. Progressive's pay-out will be shared among 260,000 policyholders, providing them with an average cheque of Dollars 200 apiece. The California Insurance Department also said that the insurer had agreed to make future rate reductions for certain private passenger lines and coverages, and to freeze any rate increases for 12 months. Progressive's shares were suspended in New York on Friday at Dollars 52 1/4.</p>

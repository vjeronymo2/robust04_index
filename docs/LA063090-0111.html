			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS' OFFENSIVE TARGETS TAX SWITCH, S&amp;LS ISSUES;  </P> <P> POLITICS: PARTY LEADERS GATHER AS THE DUAL ASSAULT ON BUSH AND THE GOP IS  UNVEILED. SOME WORRY THAT THE TOUGH NEW STRATEGY MAY GO TOO FAR.  </P> <P> Democratic Party leaders, gathered here this weekend from around the country,  are planning a double-barreled offensive against President Bush for reneging on  his no-new-taxes campaign promise and on the GOP for its handling of the  savings and loan scandal.  </P> <P> "We're going to take off the gloves," national chairman Ron Brown told the  opening session of the summer conference of the Assn. of State Democratic  Chairs here Friday, only a few hours after Bush tried to defend his switch on  taxes in a nationally televised press conference.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee research staff put the finishing  touches on a strategy memorandum for distribution to the state party officials  and Democratic candidates. A draft version made available to the press urges  Democrats to emphasize that the Bush Administration "is failing to make the  S&amp;L crooks pay," that the Administration's bailout plan is unfair and that  Democrats offer their own plan "to make sure that these problems will never  happen again."  </P> <P> Party strategists see the linkage of the tax hike and savings and loan issues  as made to order for them this campaign year as they strive to maintain their  control of Congress and most of the nation's statehouses.  </P> <P> The combination allows them to challenge the Republicans on what is supposed to  be their strongest ground -- stewardship of the nation's economy. "The issue  here is fiscal mismanagement," said Ohio chairman Jim Ruvolo, president of the  state chairs association.  </P> <P> At the same time, the dual controversies also help the Democrats to emphasize  the sort of bread-and-butter concerns and populist rhetoric which have  traditionally been their stock in trade. "I think just saying we ought to put  these crooks in jail is a good issue for Democrats," Bob Slagle, Texas party  chairman, said of the savings and loan issue.  </P> <P> To be sure, the Democrats face some obstacles in implementing this strategic  blueprint. On the tax issue, party leaders acknowledge the need for a measure  of restraint because they are still trying to live down their own reputation as  the party of tax hikes, which hurt them so seriously during the 1980s.  </P> <P> "Some Democratic governors have had to ask for tax increases, too," Ruvolo  pointed out in suggesting that Democrats need to seem constructive in  responding to Bush's fiscal change of heart. "If we can appear more fiscally  responsible, that's what the American people want," Ruvolo said. "The party  that doesn't appear fiscally responsible is the one that is going to get hurt."  </P> <P> Still, Democrats maintain that Bush's willingness to consider a tax increase  would shield their state and local officeholders who have backed tax increases  from attacks by Republican challengers.  </P> <P> The savings and loan issue also poses problems for Democrats because some of  their prominent officeholders have been embroiled in that controversy in one  way or another. Ties to the thrift industry made former House Speaker Jim  Wright of Texas and former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California  vulnerable to charges of unethical behavior which led to their resignations  from Congress last year.  </P> <P> In addition, four Democratic senators, Alan Cranston of California, Dennis  DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,  have come under fire because of their links to controversial savings and loan  operator Charles H. Keating.  </P> <P> The criticism of the Democratic connection to the scandal has been extensive  enough that Paul Goldman, Virginia state party chairman, objects to a  resolution submitted by national chairman Brown to the executive committee of  the national party, putting the blame for the scandal solely on the faulty  supervision and the economic philosophy of "two successive Republican  administrations."  </P> <P> "The Democrats make a terrible mistake by saying it's totally the Republicans  fault," he said of the resolution which the executive committee is expected to  approve at its meeting here today. "The media knows that's not true and so does  the public, and we'll lose our credibility," he added. Goldman advocates  creating a nonpartisan commission to investigate the root causes of the scandal  and calculate its ultimate cost.  </P> <P> But Brown shrugged off this criticism. "Of course the Democrats bear some  responsibility," he said. "But if you measure who is really responsible and on  whose watch it has occurred, it was this Administration which is responsible  for enforcing the laws of this country."  </P> <P> Driving home the populist thrust of the Democratic attack, in a speech prepared  for delivery to today's executive committee meeting, Brown argues that Bush  refused to call for a tax increase to raise funds for a range of domestic needs  such as helping the homeless, increasing federal aid to education, bolstering  the nation's infrastructure or cleaning up the environment.  </P> <P> "This summer, though, we have found the one cause for which George Bush is  willing to break his 'no-new-taxes' pledge," Brown said, "the bankers and  speculators who ran the savings and loan industry into the ground."  </P></p>

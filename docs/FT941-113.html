			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Window on Whitehall 'Outsiders do not understand.' This ancient cry from Authority is being rehearsed once again. It will not do. Too much evidence of the secrecy and manipulation inherent in British governance has already been presented to the Scott inquiry. There is still room for argument about whether particular individuals who have appeared before Lord Justice Scott acted in good faith, according to rules then extant, but there is no doubt about the verdict on the way ministers and officials sometimes go about their business. The system is flawed. It must be put right. This outsiders do understand, perhaps too well for Whitehall's comfort. Lord Justice Scott was asked to investigate two charges. First, did the government disregard its own regulations restricting the sale of arms-related equipment to Iraq? Second, did ministers and officials deploy public interest immunity (PII) certificates to cover their embarrassment, at the risk of sending innocent men to prison? The inquiry's findings on these specific points will be published in November. The report of the inquiry may include observations on the need for systemic change, particularly in the use of PII certificates. It is also open to Lord Justice Scott to comment on decisions made by members of the cabinet and the civil servants who advise them. Overly circumspect He will be handicapped by the nature of the defence put up by the government and its apologists - that decisions on arms sales are necessarily political. A balance has to be struck between the desirability of telling Parliament when flexible rules are reinterpreted, and the interests of exporters. Foreign policy cannot always be made in public, least of all by judges. If PII certificates are issued, there is always a good public-interest reason. Lord Justice Scott, trained in the law, but not proficient in politics, must use legal arguments to clear away such obvious smokescreens. That lies in the future. What can be said today relates to the broader charge, implicit in the terms of reference, that Whitehall is overly circumspect, its mandarins and ministers too ready to conceal information that ought to be in the public domain. This is supported by the evidence given at the public sessions of the inquiry over the past 11 months. Fortunately, the proceedings have been unencumbered by the adversarial rules advocated by Lord Howe. These might have lengthened the inquiry, perhaps beyond the attention span of the electorate. Those who have been called do have their reputations, and perhaps their careers, at stake. They have been asked to endure something of an inquisition. This is no bad thing. Most of them, particularly the ministers and senior civil servants, are well able to look after themselves. Unassailable right Using skilful cross-examination, Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, have opened a window into the workings of government. No parliamentary select committee, no media report, and no inquiry stultified by traditional methodology could have exposed so much. What has been revealed is what might have been expected. The executive branch of British government believes that it has an unassailable right to decide what it is good for both Parliament and the wider public to know. In exercising this self-perpetuating prerogative, it sometimes picks the truth from an a la carte menu of its own making, and serves it with garnishes of its choice. Most of the witnesses honestly could not see that any of this is wrong. One element of the inquiry will ensure that the public understands what is at stake. The machinery exported by Matrix Churchill to Iraq could be used to make arms, but many in Whitehall knew this. Yet three directors were hauled before the court. Mr Michael Heseltine perceived that to sign a PII certificate might lead to a miscarriage of justice. Sir Nicholas Lyell apparently did not. Sir Nicholas, whose performance was uncertain, may be found to have acted mistakenly. Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for open government, may not remain unscathed. Both may be found blameless, but the likelihood is that, if not them, other individuals will be named. It will be regrettable if reputations, or jobs, are sacrificed, but the shock to Whitehall would be salutary.</p>

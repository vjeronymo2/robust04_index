Unwilling to slow down, she began attending art classes at the  hospital, where she often uses her teeth and right arm to complete projects,  said Cherie Buss, a social service aide at the hospital. "She is very  independent," Buss said.  </P> <P> Hosford, a former resident of San Diego, moved to the convalescent hospital  after her stroke.  </P></p>

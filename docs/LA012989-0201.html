			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURNING PAIN INTO CASH IS CREMATION CASE CHALLENGE  </P> <P> It was an unpleasant thought but one that Eileen Heffley just couldn't put out  of her mind.  </P> <P> Several irregularities had occurred in the cremation and funeral of her late  brother by the Harbor Lawn Memorial Park in Costa Mesa. Heffley believed the  corpse had been roughly treated by the man who collected it at her home, where  her brother died.  </P> <P> Then there were repeated delays in receiving the ashes.  </P> <P> The worry became a nagging doubt. She couldn't help but think the unthinkable:  that something had gone wrong, and that her brother's remains had not been  treated with the dignity and respect they deserved.  </P> <P> She telephoned her lawyer with questions.  </P> <P> That call 6 years ago has led to the filing of more than 300 lawsuits against  Harbor Lawn and firms that used its cremation services alleging the mishandling  of corpses during 12,000 cremations conducted between 1978 and 1983. The  alleged misconduct potentially could touch as many as 30,000 relatives and  friends of the dead. Harbor Lawn and the other defendants have denied the  charges.  </P> <P> While similar lawsuits in Pasadena and San Francisco have alleged improprieties  in cremations, the Harbor Lawn cases -- involving plaintiffs from all over the  country, but mostly from Orange County -- were the first in California to  allege such extensive mishandling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flood of Lawsuits  </P> <P> The flood of lawsuits, all revolving around the same allegations of wrongdoing  against the defendants but each involving different victims, at one time  threatened to overwhelm the Orange County Superior Court in a wave of  litigation.  </P> <P> Instead, on Monday a judge will preside over what could be the last significant  hearing in the cases. After more than 3 years of effort, most of the parties  involved have proposed to end the massive case with payments now approaching  $30 million.  </P> <P> Turning a monumental legal headache into a model of judicial efficiency has  required demanding negotiations among dozens of warring parties and insurers,  adjustments in legal tactics as the law itself has changed during the lengthy  case, and finally the creation of a settlement that has cracked traditional  legal molds.  </P> <P> The deal is scheduled to move from Superior Court Judge Jerrold S. Oliver, who  presided over the talks, to his colleague, Judge John L. Flynn Jr., who in 2  weeks of hearings beginning Monday will determine if the delicate compromise  warrants approval.  </P> <P> If Flynn endorses the settlement, no trials will be held. The defendants --  Harbor Lawn, a group of Orange County funeral homes that used Harbor Lawn's  crematory services, and the Neptune Society of Orange County, which arranged  cremations -- have steadfastly denied the charges and, under the agreement,  will not have to admit any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back Up Allegations  </P> <P> Betty McMullen, the Tustin lawyer who represents Heffley and the majority of  those who have come forward so far, said she was ready to back up the gruesome  allegations with testimony.  </P> <P> A man who worked in the crematorium has already stated under oath that he  regularly stuffed more than one corpse in a single furnace. Other Harbor Lawn  employees -- morticians, embalmers, funeral arrangers, delivery workers -- were  ready to testify about improper practices, according to McMullen.  </P> <P> And perhaps most painful of all for survivors, ashes of loved ones were  commingled, McMullen alleged.  </P> <P> "These people suffered from intense emotional, and at times physical, distress  when they learned what happened. And they still don't know what happened to the  remains, and where they are now. Harbor Lawn can't tell them. They're never  going to know for sure," McMullen said.  </P> <P> The task of translating that anguish into dollars and cents emerged as the  challenge of the settlement.  </P> <P> Cases involving recovery solely for emotional distress are rare, offering  little guidance. Lawyers had to consider that, like any case, damages were  within the limits of insurance of the defendants. But their central concern was  making sure that all claimants were included. More than 400 people had filed  lawsuits, but 12,000 cremations had been performed during the period in  question. Many thousands might come forward with new demands after the  announcement of a settlement.  </P> <P> If Harbor Lawn was going to agree to pay, it would do so only if it knew for  certain that claims made later would be covered by the settlement as well those  already on file.  </P> <P> The solution was to transform the individual cases into a class action for the  settlement. The current plaintiffs would be represented by their own lawyers; a  judge would appoint counsel for those yet to come forward.  </P> <P> That approach has been used with success in other cases involving hundreds and  thousands of victims, such as Vietnam veterans suing over exposure to Agent  Orange, the nationwide litigation over the use of asbestos to insulate many  schools, lawsuits over the Dalkon Shield, and so-called "mass torts," such as  plane crashes and train derailments.  </P> <P> But an unusual and controversial aspect of the Harbor Lawn deal is that, if  approved by Judge Flynn, no plaintiff will have the option to "go it alone."  Anyone who claims damages must do so through the class structure, and none will  be allowed to proceed to trial independently, unlike other class action cases.  </P> <P> Forcing all those who have and will sue into the same class is an unusual  approach. The settlement would cut off the victims' normal right to a trial by  jury and has been the target of the most serious challenges to the deal.  </P> <P> "It is unusual," said attorney Nancy Sher Cohen, representing Harbor Lawn. "But  California law allows for flexibility in its approach to class action law. We  must rely on the ability of the (judge) to adopt innovative procedures that  will be fair to litigants and expedient."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Its Knees  </P> <P> Said one court employee: "If the settlement isn't approved, it will bring our  court system to its knees."  </P> <P> With the protection of the proposed mandatory class action, the defendants  signed on between May, 1986, and last summer. As part of the tentative  settlement, they have paid a total of $21,183,000 into a fund over the last 2  years -- $14 million by Harbor Lawn, $2,675,000 by the Neptune Society, and the  remaining $4,508,000 from five groups of mortuaries that did business with  Harbor Lawn.  </P> <P> The interest earned to date, earmarked for the victims, is now estimated at $2  million. In another unusual aspect of the case, the defendants have agreed to  pay directly for the costs of managing the fund -- keeping track of the money,  notifying potential claimants, advertising, and administering the machinery for  making payments. Total costs of administration have been estimated at $3  million to $5 million.  </P> <P> As the pot grew, conflicts between claimants arose over how to divide it.  </P> <P> The first group of plaintiffs, those who had filed lawsuits by mid-1986, argued  that they deserved higher damages than those who followed. The original group  investigated and prepared the case, at great expense, and its members argued  that victims who show up later do not deserve an equal share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demanding Too Much  </P> <P> But counsel named to represent the interests of the estimated 30,000 customers  of Harbor Lawn who had not yet sued felt the original group was demanding too  much.  </P> <P> "The original (389) plaintiffs believed that they had been promised 80% of any  settlement. We in effect have been able to renegotiate it, first down to 25%,  and now even lower." said Polly Horn, whose firm was appointed to represent the  class of people who may make claims in the future.  </P> <P> The first plaintiffs have already collected $3.5 million under an earlier phase  of the settlement, averaging $9,281.36 apiece. They will also collect from the  remainder of the fund, the amount determined by how many others file claims.  </P> <P> Another $1 million has been set aside for minors, incompetent people and those  not yet born who may file claims.  </P> <P> To date, all known plaintiffs in the case, except one couple from Fountain  Valley, have agreed to the settlement. While all defendants have not accepted  the deal, all their insurers have, and the settlement would legally protect all  defendants, whether they have supported the deal or not.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proud of Settlement  </P> <P> "We are very proud of the settlement," said Cohen for Harbor Lawn. "The point  we've made all along is that it's fair to the plaintiffs, it's fair to the  defendants who want to get this matter behind them, and obviously it's a relief  to the court."  </P> <P> "We believe the settlement fund is substantial and should give the class  members adequate redress," said Horn.  </P> <P> In most cases, getting the damage money to the victim is usually the last and  easiest step. But nothing has been easy in the cremation cases, and its  conclusion, if the settlement is accepted, will be no exception.  </P> <P> First there will be a publicity blitz, for which $250,000 has been set aside to  purchase television time and notices in such publications as Parade magazine,  TV Guide and the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> Those who think they deserve a share will have a limited amount of time to file  claims. The number to come forward will determine how much longer the  litigation will go on, as well as the amount of money individuals will receive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who Can Make a Claim?  </P> <P> "There were 12,000 cremations between July 1, 1978, and July 31, 1983. The  question becomes: Who can make a claim?" said Cohen.  </P> <P> Those qualified to make claims, estimated as high as 30,000, are anyone who  arranged for the cremation, those who had the legal right to dispose of the  remains, anyone related by blood, marriage or adoption and anyone claiming a  "special relationship" to the deceased.  </P> <P> "You tell me how many people are going to be able to claim on that basis," said  Cohen. "We sit around here and say, 'Oh God. How many are there going to be?' "  </P> <P> Damages will be based on objective factors that are designed to measure how  much a person suffered. Individuals will receive points determined by their  relation to the deceased.  </P> <P> "If you are a surviving spouse, you get more points than if you are a sibling,"  McMullen said. "You get points if you arranged for the cremation."  </P> <P> "It's taken a lot of time to work out the details. It takes into consideration  the legal factors in trying to divide the money equitably. You can't put this  out with cookie cutters. Emotional distress is unique," McMullen said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complex Point System  </P> <P> Lawyers involved say that while the point system is complex, the claim form  itself should be easy to understand and complete. There will be a toll-free  telephone number to help those who have questions.  </P> <P> In a bow to the unique type of damages involved, yet another fund has been set  up. It is designed to be the last resort for those who have been denied  recovery or feel they have been shortchanged by the point system.  </P> <P> People will be permitted to make their pitch before a hearing officer, probably  a retired judge, who will make the final decision. While there will be no  representatives of the defendants present, the plan calls for an informal trial  to take place.  </P> <P> "In a case of this size, normally you try to develop a system dealing only with  objective factors, and have a computer run out the points and cut the checks,"  Cohen said. "We felt that because emotional distress damages are extremely  subjective, we needed a vehicle for compensating people who were particularly  distressed and perturbed."  </P> <P> Finally, separate funds for minors and for lawyers and others who worked on the  case will be created. Legal fees generally will be capped at 25% of the total  settlement.  </P> <P> The entire package, 4 years in the making, will be reviewed by Judge Flynn, who  is the fifth Superior Court judge to be involved in the case. If he approves,  the machinery for processing will begin, with Flynn taking a final look at the  deal at the end of this year.  </P> <P> Other cases alleging mishandling of remains are now pending in Southern  California. A Bay Area lawsuit, in which a burial-at-sea firm was accused of  mixing the ashes of 5,000 cremations, was settled last year for about $30  million.  </P> <P> And the operators of the Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena have been the target of  bizarre allegations not only of desecration, but sale of organs for  transplants. The owners face criminal charges in the case.  </P> <P> But the avalanche of cases Eileen Heffley helped trigger 6 years ago remains  the first, and in the words of Harbor Lawn attorneys, "the most troublesome  group of cases ever to descend upon the courts in Orange County."  </P> <P> After 6 years of uncertainty and delays, Heffley said she believes the lawsuit  was worthwhile.  </P> <P> "I think it did some good," she said. "I think we did some good for the funeral  industry."  </P> <P> One family refuses to settle, insists on trial. Part II, Page 1.  </P></p>

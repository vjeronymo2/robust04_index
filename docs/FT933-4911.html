			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan pressed to lift rice import ban - Poor harvest will mean shortfall JAPAN may be forced to import rice for emergency supplies because of this year's poor rice harvest, the result of cold weather and a spate of typhoons. The rice shortage coincides with mounting pressure on Japan to open its rice market within the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. While the Ministry of Agriculture denies that there is a shortage, industry analysts point out emergency rice imports will be inevitable. Japan relaxed its ban on rice imports on one occasion, for 150,000 tonnes of rice from South Korea in 1984, to make up for a shortage. This time the government is facing increasing pressure from the US and other leading rice producers. Mr David Graves, president of the US Rice Millers Association, last month called for Japan to buy American rice for emergency imports, while the Australian government has also lobbied Tokyo. The coalition government under Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has backed the import ban. Many members of the coalition are supported by rural constituencies. Electoral reform, which Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce this year, is expected to correct the under-represented urban vote and dilute the powerful rice lobby, quickening the pace of liberalisation. As of August 15, the Agriculture Ministry said the rice harvest index stood at 95 against the average harvest of 100. However, Mr Yoshiro Takahashi of Rice Databank, a private research organisation on rice, says the final index could fall below 90, and the actual shortfall could rise to 700,000 tonnes. The average annual demand is 10.6m tonnes. The ministry intends to review its policy of reducing rice production, established in 1971 to prevent an oversupply. The ministry is now asking local governments to find out whether farmers who turned their rice paddies into vegetable and fruit fields wish to resume rice growing. Japan and the US will meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss a framework for a new economic partnership, Reuter adds. The environment, technology, human resource development, population control and Aids will be discussed, along with Japan's global trade surplus. Japan's global trade surplus grew to Dollars 11.82bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in July from Dollars 9.23bn a year earlier. The surplus with the US climbed to Dollars 4.68bn from Dollars 3.81bn.</p>

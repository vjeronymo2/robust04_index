			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Personal View: Feather beds in South Africa's boardrooms South Africa is a continental anomaly. A third-world country, with the tribalism, the violence, the excessive public spending, overregulation, the overweening bureaucracy, state-owned behemoths, the protection and politicisation of much economic activity. But superimposed on these is a convincing presence of the first world in the form of the great mining and manufacturing corporations. The English-speaking South Africans have dominated this private business sector, just as Afrikaners have been predominant in government employment, while blacks have provided the labour. An oversimplification? A caricature? Perhaps, but it conveys the essence of South Africa for most of this century. The incomes generated by the industrial and mining sector produced a large tax revenue to finance the jobs and sinecures in the public sector. The stated objective of the leadership of the African National Congress is to capture control of government in order to secure and expand those public sector jobs. There has also been much talk of expanding the public sector by nationalisation, quotas for blacks, Africanisation, and so on. But now there is growing realisation among black leaders that such measures have been the root cause of the dismal economic performance of all the second (communist) world and most of the third-world economies. If there is a golden rule in economic management, it is that high taxation, expropriation, regulation and control lead to dilapidated infrastructure, political turmoil and uncertainty which drives capital and jobs away. That, in turn, exacerbates both economic and political tensions  - and so leads to a vicious circle of decline. What can the ANC, Inkatha, the National party and other groups do to promote wealth and growth, to break out of this vicious circle? The solution is to send not for Marx and Lenin, but for Hanson and Goldsmith. As in any other dirigiste socialist country (and, with its high ratio of government involvement and interference in economic life, South Africa must be so classed), the economy is dominated by very large corporations. In South Africa fewer than 10 conglomerates dominate the first-world industrial sector. They have pyramidal or interlocking shareholdings which lock out their external shareholders from any influence over management and protect their management from any true accountability to shareholders. As is well documented, conglomeration, especially with monopoly power and protection against intruders, leads to much inefficiency. The rate of return on capital in the many peripheral activities is low. This is reflected in the fact that for most of these conglomerates the share price is less than the value of their component assets. In any free market there would be a corrective, namely a takeover bid. Lords Hanson and White or Sir James Goldsmith would buy up the shares, take control, strip off the peripheral loss-making companies, change management and sell them for perhaps more than their acquisition cost, and get the company back to basics in its mining operations. But few managements in South Africa fear a takeover bid. Many reasons explain these feather beds in the boardrooms. The most important is that everyone is in a feather bed with everyone else. Large blocks of shares are held by corporations in the same group as well as by controlled pension and insurance funds. It is virtually impossible for any outsider to mount a takeover bid against the interlocked interests of the five conglomerates which account for more than three-quarters of the market capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It is, however, a moot point whether in the absence of such interlocking holdings, a protectionist, socialist government of the kind which has been in power in South Africa for so long would ever allow takeovers. Socialist governments are characteristically averse to buccaneers like Goldsmith and Hanson. They prefer their house-trained managers, who are more amenable to the habits of bureaucracy. Yet, they wonder why foreign capital is so reluctant to appear. We believe takeovers would benefit virtually all groups in South Africa. Let us take the difficult one first: would they benefit the blacks? We believe they would. First, such takeovers and unbundling would create, not destroy, jobs. The efficiency gains that can be made are high  - perhaps reductions in cost of 50 per cent or more. This would make much industry efficient and competitive in terms of world as well as African markets. Second, South African manufactures could flood into their natural markets  - displacing Asian manufactures, but also developing new markets that do not now exist. This is the basis for real jobs and prosperity in the black townships as well as in the grassy suburbs. As for the owners of these conglomerates, their shareholdings would be worth much more under an open takeover regime. True, some family shareholding groups as well as entrenched management cliques would lose their power to decide the fate of industry, but that is the price they must pay for the opening of the economy  - and how handsome would be the rewards. The Afrikaners would lose their privileged positions in the public sector while all races would be free to exploit the opportunities which a liberalisation of the white cartel-dominated industrial sector will provide. We suspect that removing the feather beds in both the public and private sectors will be the making of a new generation of multiracial entrepreneurs. The main task of a reforming government must be to insist on the disentanglement of the crossholdings of the conglomerates and the opening up of South Africa to foreign as well as domestic corporate raiders. The first step is so simple. It is for the regulatory authorities of government and the stock exchange to cease the restrictive practice of protecting entrenched management groups from their disenfranchised private shareholders. If a takeover appears, the cross-shareholding should have the option of accepting the offer or of bettering it, but not of turning complacently away. Such a simple shift in regulatory policy would not only bring South Africa into line with most efficient, modern, capitalist economies, but simultaneously awaken those sleeping assets which form South Africa's hidden wealth.

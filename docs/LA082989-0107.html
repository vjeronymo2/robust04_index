			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 7.94%, down from 7.99% last week. Another $7.2  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.88%,  up from 7.85% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual return to  investors -- 8.21% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for  $9,799.30 and 8.32% for a six-month bill selling for $9,601.60. The discount  rate reflects the price discount received when they are purchased at less than  face value. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve reported that the average  yield for one-year T-bills, the most popular index for making changes in  adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 8.36% last week, up from 8.30% the previous  week.  </P></p>

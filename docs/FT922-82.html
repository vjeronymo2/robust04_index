			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Brazilian markets hit by fears for president THE Brazilian financial markets fell sharply yesterday in reaction to a further wave of corruption allegations involving President Fernando Collor and increasing fears that he will be unable to ride out the crisis. Mr Collor is expected to address the nation today to answer accusations that his household expenses are being paid by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, his campaign treasurer, who is the subject of a congressional inquiry for alleged extortion. A barely controlled Mr Collor told reporters: 'I will respond to the charges item by item.' The Inland Revenue yesterday began investigating the bank accounts of Ms Ana Maria Acioli Gomes, Mr Collor's private secretary, in response to the allegations which appeared in Istoe, a respected magazine. According to an interview given by the former driver of Ms Acioli, Mr Farias was paying money into her account under the name Maria Gomes from which it was transferred to pay Mr Collor's household staff and bills and to give money to the president's current wife Rosane and former wife Lilibeth. The magazine backed up its claims with copies of cheques which the driver had been asked to deposit. The driver will be called to testify tomorrow. Mr Collor has asked his government for 48 hours to respond to the latest allegations. The Liberal Front (PFL), the main party in the government, has threatened to withdraw its support unless he disproves the charges. Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques, the economy minister, tried to avoid a market collapse by appealing for 'maturity' and insisting that economic policy would not change. But the main Sao Paulo index dropped 14.6 per cent by the close - its largest fall this year - and Telebras, the leading bluechip stock, fell 22 per cent.</p>

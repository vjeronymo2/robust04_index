			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Observer: Near thing Although the official winners of the Weekend FT's crossword competition on February 13 won't be announced until tomorrow, Observer is awarding a special advance prize to Jimmy Page of Richmond, Surrey. When someone bet him he couldn't complete the puzzle, offering odds of a half-bottle of scotch to his stake of 50p, his first thought was that a magnum of champagne to 5p would have been a fairer reflection of the risk. But he had a go, failed, and paid up. The reason why he merits a full bottle of malt is not so much that he fell short by only two of the 32 clues in the crossword, as that he is 97 years old.</p>

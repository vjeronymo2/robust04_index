			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall as base rate hopes fade INCREASING concern that further reductions in domestic interest rates may be postponed until next year made for a poor start to the new trading account in the UK stock market yesterday. Share prices, on the downward path from the opening, took a turn for the worse at mid-session when early losses in government bonds were suddenly extended. However, traders detected few signs of selling pressure, and Seaq-reported trading volume was nearly one third down on Friday's total. The market's concern is focused on prospects for future government funding in the light of the forecast for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement incorporated in his Autumn economic statement last week by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Equity strategists warned that government bond yields could be forced higher next year, and that bond sales could 'crowd out' potential investment in equities. However, there were few signs of nervousness ahead of today's October PSBR number, which was expected to be relatively low. Nor was the stock market expecting surprises from the important speech in the City of London last night from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Equities opened lower and, with stock index futures at a discount, and both short sterling and the money markets signalling fading confidence in a further base rate cut before Christmas, losses were extended. An attempted rally was abruptly terminated when government bonds turned off and by late afternoon, the FT-SE Index was nearly 20 points down. A weak start to the new Wall Street session, where the Dow Average was 18 points down in early trade, left London to close a shade above the worst but still listless. Traders referred to yesterday's trading session as 'a washout,' and saw the market remaining lacklustre for some weeks. One experienced dealer saw the Footsie trading in the 2,650 to 2,675 for the near term. The FT-SE Index closed the session at 2,679 for a net loss of 17.9. The Seaq network reported trading of 434.1m shares compared with 628.4m in the previous session; retail, or customer, business on Friday was worth Pounds 1.2bn, maintaining the improved levels of the past two months. Firmness in the US dollar brought only modest support for the international stocks which also reacted to warnings of poor economic prospects in Germany. Some pharmaceuticals once again reflected worries over possible medical funding policy under the new US president. Domestic interest-related stocks suffered as doubts grew over prospects for the further one point reduction in base rates so widely predicted by sector analysts. Losses in the store and consumer groups were modest but there were larger falls among the building and contracter issues which have become heavily dependent on interest rate perceptions. Significant losses were also marked against the domestic banking issues, some of which also suffered from adverse comment in the investment press last weekend. Bank stocks have benefited from the fall in UK base rates because this trend is likely to reduce their burden of bad and doubtful debts.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Eastleigh bickering dents truce: Roland Rudd discovers a change of mood as accusations fly The agreement between the political parties to suspend campaigning in the wake of John Smith's death appeared to have collapsed yesterday as the government moved the writ for the Eastleigh by-election for June 9, the same day as the European elections and four other by-elections. The Liberal Democrats were criticised by the other parties for launching their campaign with a national press conference. Ms Marilyn Birks, the Labour candidate, was said to be 'very disappointed', while Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, said he was very surprised to hear of the press conference in the week of Mr Smith's funeral. Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, accused his opponents of hypocrisy.

People of all political beliefs and of none expressed genuine sorrow at Mr Smith's death but few thought it would have a significant political fall-out. It is unlikely to affect the by-election result - the Liberal Democrats still appear to be on course to win the seat with a big majority, overturning the Tory majority of 17,702. In old people's sheltered accommodation in prosperous Bursledon support for the Conservatives appeared to be haemorrhaging, primarily because of tax increases and rising crime. Labour supporters were contemplating switching to the Liberal Democrats as the party best placed to take the seat from the Tories. Mr Maurice Wichall seemed to sum up the mood of many when he said there was 'enormous sympathy' for Labour. So would he be voting Labour? 'Goodness no,' he replied. 'People die all the time.</p>

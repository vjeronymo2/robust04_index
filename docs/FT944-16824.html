			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / France offers gulf forces, but without enthusiasm France has told the US that French forces in the Gulf region are available for any allied riposte to Iraq, but has so far moved only a single frigate towards Kuwait, in an effort not to over-dramatise the situation. In the same relatively cool vein, the French Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, saw no need to modify his planned trip to other three Gulf states this weekend by stopping off in Kuwait. Mr Juppe told his US counterpart, Mr Warren Christopher, on Monday that Paris shared Washington's 'serious concern' about Iraqi threats to Kuwait, and that its forces in the general region, including six Mirages in Saudi Arabia, five Jaguars in Turkey, two ships in Muscat and 4,000 men in Djibouti, would be available for any necessary action. Just as France had been somewhat readier than the US or Britain to contemplate an easing of sanctions against Bagdhad after a trial period of a new United Nations monitoring system in Iraq, so France has been a bit less enthusiastic than its Anglo-American Security Council partners to return in force to the Gulf. While Mr Juppe stressed that no risks should be taken with Iraqi troops, his Foreign Ministry officials were cautioning against 'excessive dramatisation' of the situation lest very rapid mobilisation on both sides of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti frontier should make a clash almost inevitable.</p>

The conference, organized by the Washington-based Centre for  International and Strategic Studies, was attended by the German  Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Member of the European  Commission Sir Leon Brittan, representatives of Polish political  and economic circles, including Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Janusz Lewandowski, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, and  many other Polish and West European politicians and businessmen.    Pawlak said that trade concessions offered Poland by Western  European nations were fine in theory but that in practice  enormous administrative and bureaucratic obstacles remained. He  declared a staunch defence of the Polish interests and  reiterated the firm will of Poland to fully integrate with the  European Union.    The Prime Minister spoke in high terms of the Polish  economic  situation, mentioning this year's targets of 4.5 percent growth  in the GDP and an inflation rate of ca. 25 per cent. But he  said the days of easy profits from investments in Poland were  over and that his government was now looking "to do business  which is good for both sides."</p>

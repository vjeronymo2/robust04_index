			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Standard's latest board move Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday put in place one of the final elements in its reorganisation of senior management following the retirement of Rodney Galpin, the bank's chairman, last month. Following Standard's recruitment of Peter Wood, formerly Barclays' finance director, as head of finance, it announced that John McFarlane, Citibank's UK chief executive, (pictured right) is to join the bank as an executive director. McFarlane replaces Alan Orsich, deputy managing director. He will work under Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, alongside Wood, David Moir, head of Asia Pacific operations, and David Broome, head of Standard's banking business. Williamson has been working on a new management structure to tighten management controls and prevent a repetition of costly accidents such as the Bombay securities trading scandal, which lost the bank Pounds 305m in India last year. McFarlane and Wood's recruitment is part of a reform of senior management which will strengthen functional reporting lines rather than operating Standard's businesses more through managers in regions and countries around the world. McFarlane has worked for Citibank since 1975, although his career started outside financial services in the power train division of Ford Motor Company's Dagenham plant. At Citibank, he worked in treasury, capital markets, and global finance. McFarlane, a 45-year-old Scot with an MA from Edinburgh University and an MBA from Cranfield, said it had been 'an agonising decision' to leave Citibank but he felt he had achieved the task he was set as chief executive in 1990. He said Standard's global business, with a concentration in the Asia Pacific, had 'a lot of similarities' to Citibank. He is likely to work closely with Wood in reviewing controls and risk, although the final structure is yet to be refined.</p>

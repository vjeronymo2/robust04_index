			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The Long View: Biggles flies east POTENT SYMBOLISM has been offered this week by the mooted departure to Taiwan of most of the residual operations of one of British aviation's most famous manufacturing units, birthplace of the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and the Comet. The parent company British Aerospace, the country's biggest manufacturer, is valued by the stock market at below Pounds 500m, a lot less than MFI Furniture, say, or Welsh Water. Such developments may say as much about the emergence of new economic powerhouses around the globe as about Britain's absolute decline. Meanwhile, however, the country's obsession with financial manipulation has never been more in evidence: the current economic crisis, for instance, has revolved entirely around exchange rates and interest rates. In a rational world financial policies would surely be designed to create a stable framework for the real economy, but instead the real economy has been asked to 'adjust' to rigid financial conditions laid down for various political reasons. Part of that adjustment is taking the form of a flight abroad by high-profile segments of Britain's manufacturing base. Elsewhere the fascinating raw material of the week has come not from Thursday's emergency debate in Parliament - although I will come to that in a moment - but from routine economic releases on trade and gross domestic product. The August balance of payments figures were shocking: a current account deficit of Pounds 1.1bn for the month, in the middle of a serious recession. We are now heading for a deficit of Pounds 12bn for the year, almost twice as much as forecast by the Treasury in March. Recently import volumes have been running nearly 6 per cent higher than a year ago, even though domestic demand has been flat. Exports have dropped a little compared with last summer (the Treasury forecast that they would be rising by 3 1/2 per cent) and plainly there now has to be a big shift of economic effort into exports and import substitution. As for GDP, it fell marginally in the second quarter, when political euphoria and recovering confidence were supposed to have caused an economic rebound. True, excluding North Sea oil there was a 0.1 per cent upturn; but the evidence is that the downwards momentum has resumed in the current quarter. For all the tales of economic gloom, however, the statistics suggest that the general public have barely suffered yet - unless, of course, they have lost their jobs. Real GDP is now running at roughly the same as it was back at the beginning of 1988 (and about 4 per cent less than the quarterly peak attained in April-June 1990). But real average employee earnings have risen by 6 1/2 per cent in the past 4 1/2 years, and real personal disposable income is 5 or 6 per cent higher than in 1988 (although consumer expenditure has scarcely risen, because more of the income is being saved). The stock market is already beginning to look forward to better times for the corporate sector. But in the personal sector the worst is yet to come, with sharp cuts in real incomes becoming inevitable (that is what devaluation is all about). The question is whether this can be achieved smoothly or only through an inflationary crisis. An alternative agenda is beginning to surface among the backbenchers of both major parties. On Thursday the Labour Economy Policy Group published a robust pamphlet written by Austin Mitchell MP. 'What industry needs is a low exchange rate, low interest rates, and an accommodating monetary policy . . . moderate inflation is much better than no growth . . . outside the ERM interest rates could be reduced to at least the rate of inflation, if not well below . . . without growth, redistribution becomes too painful to be sustained." For growth, read inflation. For moderate, insert your own figure. The investment markets are starting to take some of this on board. Index-linked gilts have had a particularly good week and since sterling came out of the ERM ten days ago the real yield - then a highest-ever 4.76 per cent - has tumbled by more than half a percentage point. Meanwhile the yield on long-dated fixed interest gilts has gone up, but quite modestly, from 8.96 per cent to about 9.35 per cent. One implication is, of course, that the market is gloomier about inflation. The gap between the two yields (not quite the implied market inflation expectation, but something close to it) has risen from 4.2 per cent to 5.1 per cent. The relative stability of fixed interest gilts, however, means that there is expected at the same time to be a fall in real yields outside the ERM. There would be nothing surprising if this were to happen. For much of the postwar period up to about 1980 the real returns on gilts were nil. Indeed, lower real interest rates may be a precondition for an economic recovery. The Mitchell-type strategy involves a big inflation tax on the holders of monetary assets, this being used to cushion the blow for average wage earners as wealth is shifted into investment (or maybe into subsidies). To be a practical proposition, however, this would need to be backed up with exchange controls to prevent a flight of capital and a collapse of the floating currency. It is not such a fanciful idea given that Spain, Portugal and Ireland have reimposed exchange controls this week. In Parliament the focus was not on any of this but on the Germans and the Eurocrats. Maybe that is fair enough, because it would be wrong for new domestic policies to be cobbled together in undue haste. But unless this rather dim government produces some really tough and imaginative measures quite soon the British economy is bound to drift into its unhealthy old ways. Norman Lamont had to admit on Thursday that the markets had driven the willy-nilly UK out of the ERM, and they will go on determining government policy if they are allowed to. That would not be at all bad for index-linked gilts, or for Austin Mitchell.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Stand on the Liberalization of Banking </F> Business"]    [Excerpts] The current of globalization now creeping into  the livelihood of the Thai people and society is expected to  bring about several abrupt changes in many areas. Without well  planned and effective precautions, national development will be  obstructed and delayed while businesses and trade with foreign  countries will be adversely affected.    Based on our observation, changes in three areas will take  place in the near future. They are: First, the launching of  the "Thaicom" satellite which, as everyone knows, will greatly  benefit Thai society. Second, the introduction of an fiber  optic cable into telephone service which will be tremendously  beneficial to telecommunication facilities. Third, the  promulgation of the new international investment and trade  regulations under the "GATT" agreement in which Thailand is also  a signatory.    Under the "GATT" agreement, the structure and system of  trade  and investment will have to be significantly readjusted. It is  imperative that the government clearly explain as well as give  sufficient knowledge to the people so as to enable them to be  fully prepared in advance to cope with possible impacts.  Educational institutions should also disseminate necessary  information and knowledge to their students because we will  certainly be unable to avoid the consequences.    Also under the "GATT" agreement, the United States will play  a role in trade and investment in this country. Aside from  telecommunications, the United States is likely to get more  involved in other businesses. The United States particularly  has been pressing for the liberalization of banking business in  this country.    Two events which took place in the past week gave us some  hint about the U.S. stand in this connection. On 5 February,  David Lambertson, U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and Colonel  Chinnawut Sunthonsima, minister attached to the Prime Minister's  Office, jointly opened the "Development Partnership" program  under which the United States has agreed to provide 225 million  baht for environmental development and AIDS prevention. [passage  omitted] Another event is the 3 February announcement on the  lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. [passage  omitted]    The two cited events indicate the U.S. role and expectations  in Thailand and the Indochinese region. Naturally, the United  States intends profit more here.    However, if it is true that the United States is pressing  for  the liberalization of banking business to allow its commercial  banks to operate in this country, the government must treat this  matter as important as other major issues such as relations  between the two countries. The government must work out  necessary measures to cope with the situation as a result of the  enforcement of the new "GATT" regulations.</p>

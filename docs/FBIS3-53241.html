The military panel found seven senior officers, including  the  military intelligence chief, responsible for the unprecedented  assault on the northern Pooneryn army and navy complex on  November 11, the sources said.    Former army commander General Cecil Waidyaratne, who  resigned  at the end of December after taking responsibility for the  attack, forwarded the findings of the inquiry to President  Dingiri Banda Wijetunga on Sunday.    "Yes. I took responsibility but not the blame. Like Jesus  Christ, I had to take responsibility for the others. I was  crucified, while others slept," Waidyaratne told AFP.    He said the military panel appointed by him apportioned  blame  on officers found responsible for not preventing the debacle,  but it was up to the government to initiate either court martial  proceedings or take any other action.    Military sources said the findings of the four-man court ran  to nearly 200 pages and was a serious indictment of the  military's field commanders leading the battle against  separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).    A lieutenant colonel, who was promoted full colonel for  holding out against the LTTE for three straight days at  Pooneryn, was also found to be partly responsible for the  debacle, the sources said.    The court of inquiry passed strictures against the northern  commander Major General Rohan Daluwatte, chief of military  intelligence Brigadier L. Balagalle, two other brigadiers, a  colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a major.    They said the military would have to rethink its war  strategy  against the LTTE following the report submitted by the court  compromising three brigadiers and a colonel, the sources said.    The LTTE is leading a protracted guerrilla campaign to  establish an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's northern and  eastern regions where the two million Tamil minority is  concentrated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 27 (ATA) -- Three tank trucks  destined for Montenegro have been intercepted and the vehicles  together with 67 thousand litres of fuel confiscated. This is  the latest bag of the Shkoder financial police, who arrested the  three drivers in a blitz operation as they were attempting to  move their contraband cargo across the Buna river. According to  the financial police, the vehicles had Tirana, Lac and Fier  plates. The tank trucks and the fuel are now in the possession  of the Shkoder financial police. The drivers will face  prosecution.    At the beginning of the year, the financial police broke up  another smuggling operation destined for Montenegro involving  three tractors each with 1,000 litres of fuel and 15 barrels of  oil. The police also shut down a trading station near Velipoje,  which was furnishing kerosene to smugglers.</p>

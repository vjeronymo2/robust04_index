			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- "Romania's  integration in the European political, economic, and military  structures is one of the main directions of the Romanian foreign  policy. Its essence lies in a process of modernization devised  to include the army too, so that this could become a modern  army," National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told a ROMPRES  correspondent. This line of policy finds its reflection in the  principles of military diplomacy, which mirror the efforts to  develop bilateral relations with the armies of other states.  Very soon, the Romanian minister said, he will be on a visit to  Great Britain, and arrangements are being made for similar tours  to the U.S.A., probably in July, and to Portugal. There are also  invitations to Spain, Albania, Egypt, Qatar, and other  countries. He mentioned also the neighboring countries with  which "Romania has lately concluded a well defined chapter," the  Romanian minister said.    Another dimension of the Romanian military diplomacy is the  Partnership for Peace, meant to consolidate stability in our  region, and wider yet, in the European region.    "Whenever we speak of integration, we must also specify what  we want to integrate into, and that is in the partnership with  NATO, an alliance which, after the cessation of the cold war,  proved viable and apt to ensure a climate of security."    In the opinion of the Romanian defense minister, "the North-  Atlantic alliance should undergo certain changes, now that the  other pole of rivalry has ceased to exist, and find itself a new  logic, the logic of collective gain. Confrontation will have to  be replaced with something else, perhaps with cooperation."    While pleading for a partnership formula open to all states  and stressing the idea of equal security for all European states  and of sovereignty and independence of their decisions for all  the countries included in the partnership program, the Romanian  minister said that such a formula could contribute to defining a  system of general security, which, based on what already forms  the skeleton of NATO, could "form the necessary security  umbrella apt to encourage a course to prosperity in this part of  Europe, too," Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca said.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / The reluctant policeman The idea that President-elect Bill Clinton will escape from the clutches of foreign policy is piffle. He hopes to devote nearly all his time to US domestic affairs. He can forget that. When he delivers his inaugural address tomorrow, the smoke will be rising from bombed-out ruins in Baghdad. Americans will be twisting arms in Somalia. Bullets fired in Sarajevo will whistle around the new president's ears. More to the point, the remnants of the Soviet empire will still be in danger of further collapse into a series of local wars. Any of the eastern states, including Russia, might fall victim to a right-wing coup. Their nuclear arsenals are still intact. The US cannot ignore such threats to its security. Mr Clinton should know. He is a 'wonk', a swot, a voracious reader. He has studied the history of his predecessors. Every inaugural speech since the conclusion of the 1939-45 war has included a promise that Uncle Sam will continue to act as the world's policeman, or at least as a global peacemaker. On January 20 1949, President Truman spoke of opposition to a regime that adhered to a 'false philosophy'. It lasted for 40 years. Mr Truman announced the establishment of a new defence pact, which, three months later, became Nato. In January 1953 General Eisenhower was equally clear. 'To meet the challenge of our time,' he said, 'destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership.' No one will forget President Kennedy's 'pay any price, bear any burden' speech of 1961. Four years later President Johnson vowed that 'in concert with other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom'. It took President Nixon nearly two terms to extricate the US from the Vietnam war, a direct consequence of the Kennedy-Johnson dicta. In spite of that experience, President Carter devoted part of his dovish address of January 1977 to a message 'to you, citizens of the world'. It included an undertaking that 'the United States will meet its obligation to help create a stable, just and peaceful world order'. Mr Carter was unlucky. Iran held US citizens hostage until the day after he stepped down. In 1981 President Reagan's first speech was focused on the domestic economy, as Governor Clinton's is expected to be tomorrow. Yet Mr Reagan warned: 'We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of not having to use that strength.' He has since boasted that that sentiment won him the cold war. He could be right. His successor was not so fortunate. After his inauguration on January 20 1989, when he predicted that 'the day of the dictator is over', President Bush was caught napping by the falls of both Mr Gorbachev and the Communist party of the Soviet Union. He tried to construct a post-cold war policy, around the notion of a 'new world order'. Actions were to be legitimised by the United Nations and supported by American power. He did well in assembling the coalition that won the first Gulf war. He does not, however, leave office with a new order in place. In Iraq, the day of the dictator is demonstrably not over. Mr Bush's problem - our problem - is that no convincing mechanism for a global foreign policy or its regional constituent parts exists. Mr Clinton has acknowledged this. 'We cannot go four more years without a plan to lead the world,' he says in Putting People First, the book of his campaign. In a sentence that could easily fit into tomorrow's address he adds: 'The defence of freedom and the promotion of democracy around the world not only reflect our deepest values; they serve our national interest.' He does not actually have a plan, but proposes to ap-point a team to construct one. Yet we have been invited to believe that the anti-Vietnam war generation, of which Mr Clinton is the most celebrated product, may dissociate the world's most powerful republic from its previous international concerns. The issue is not isolationism. That narrow sentiment is stronger now that the Soviet threat has disappeared. It will thrive while so many domestic problems are pressing. It flourishes in recession. But it cannot prevail. The world will not allow it to do so. What Mr Clinton needs is a structure that can guide the conduct of US relations with other states. Foreign ministries knew where they stood when there were two superpowers and a third world. Nobody knows quite what to think now that those neat divisions have faded. What we outsiders will look for in tomorrow's inaugural address is more than a mere ritual affirmation of America's acceptance of its global reach. We need to see evidence that Mr Clinton meant what he said when he wrote last year: 'We must define a new national security policy to build on the victory of freedom in the cold war.' If he cannot find a single theme, a grouping of policies for specific areas will do. For example, the bombing has not yet destroyed Mr Saddam. It can only defeat or contain Iraq as part of a regional strategy that has been clearly thought through. There are many questions for the policy wonk. Does Washington see a long-term threat in a resurgent Iran? Is there to be a pause in the Middle East peace negotiations, or is the new president not quite so beholden to the Israeli lobby as was first thought? Is Syria to be trusted? Again, incremental yet ineffectual measures in former Yugoslavia have not yet brought peace. The Vance-Owen plan is ingenious, but lasting stability can only be guaranteed when we have a European-American alliance that is willing and able to defend the principle that borders are not to be changed by force. As to Russia, the maintenance of a democratic, pro-market government in office is of at least as much importance to the US as any single domestic programme. Yet Washington can no longer be relied on to support global policies on its own. It demands participating allies. This is reasonable. I offer these phrases to the Clinton inaugural address: 'We shall pay part of any price, share any burden, meet a fair percentage of any hardship . . . in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.' The new president will have to pin something like that on his wall. There is no serious alternative.</p>

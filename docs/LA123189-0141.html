			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY OF '89;  </P> <P> RUSTY KENNEDY ON CRIMES AGAINST GAYS  </P> <P> During 1989, many Orange County residents wrote about their thoughts and  feelings in commentary pieces for Orange County opinion pages. As the year  comes to a close, we look back on some of those thoughts.  </P> <P> Name-calling, tire-slashing, thrown objects and violent physical assaults are a  regular part of weekend nights in Orange County near gay and lesbian social  centers, as bigoted criminals prey on people assumed to be gay.  </P> <P> This hate and extreme vituperation are products of deep-rooted prejudice in our  society. People project their fears on people who are different. The message of  these anti-gay efforts is clear. It says some people are not hearing from their  parents, clergy or teachers that attacking people who are different is illegal,  immoral and intolerable.  </P> <P> They are not hearing that gay men and lesbian woman are contributing members of  our society. They are not hearing that gays are brothers and sisters and that  they have mothers and fathers.  </P> <P> If it becomes acceptable in our society to consider gays less than full  citizens with less than full human rights, who will be the next target? What  unpopular group will be set upon next to eliminate from our midst? Gays and  lesbians are not asking us to join their ranks, only that we allow them to live  their lives without fear of persecution.  </P></p>

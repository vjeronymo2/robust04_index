			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Presov, east Slovakia, March 27 (CTK) -- Vladimir  Meciar, who was today reelected chairman of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), said the HZDS would remain a  movement until early elections in autumn. A two-day HZDS  conference, which opened here yesterday, elected today Olga  Keltosova HZDS deputy chairwoman in charge of social welfare  area and Sergej Kozlik HZDS deputy chairman in charge of the  economy. Ivan Lexa was elected HZDS executive secretary.    After the election of the new HZDS leadership, Meciar told  journalists that about half of the delegates spoke in favour of  the movement's transformation into a party, while the other half  was against. He said the HZDS programme described HZDS as a  future "pragmatic centre party." A lot will also depend on the  development of other parties, Meciar said. The current  withdrawal of experts and a part of members from the Democratic  Left Party (SDL) gave the HZDS a chance to gain influence among  the Social Democrats, he added.    HZDS leading official Ivan Laluha said the issue of HZDS  orientation had not yet been settled and added that he himself  favoured social democratic orientation. Referring to Slovak  President Michal Kovac, Meciar said: "I can only state that  political culture is not a strong point of the Primacialny  Palace (the seat of Slovak President)." He said that after a  letter which Kovac sent to the conference yesterday was read,  delegates whistled. "There was no one clapping their hands, but  many were whistling," Meciar said. In the letter, Kovac said he  did not want to hide the tension between him and Meciar which  had gradually grown into open attacks on Kovac. In Kovac's  opinion, it was not a personal but a social and political  conflict which had a negative impact on the developments in  Slovakia. Meciar said that the HZDS was coming to the conclusion  that Kovac and his office would be tripped by what they had done  to Meciar and his cabinet. "They will slowly come to realise --  it is a question of days or hours for them to figure that out --  that this is the way it is and that they will have to fight hard  for themselves," Meciar said. He went on to say that the HZDS  would not consider legitimiate new leaders of the Supreme  Inspection Office (NKU), to be elected at a forthcoming  parliamentary session, and would not acknowledge them as  constitutional officials.    The NKU leadership was dismissed by the new coalition  government at the latest session of parliament. Meciar said  this ran counter to the constitution. He stressed the HZDS  would reject the coalition-announced offer that the HZDS fill  the post of NKU deputy chairman. Meciar described as shaky the  position of the present Slovak government of Jozef Moravcik. He  said the HZDS "was familiar with curricula vitae of the  government members" and that government discussion on its  programme could already indicate something. HZDS deputy chairman  Sergej Kozlik told reporters that the priorities of a new HZDS  economic programme were pro-export policies, qualified  protection of the home market, rapid privatisation and revival  of financial channels and agriculture. He said he had "great"  reservations about work of the present government in the area of  home market protection. Kozlik said Moravcik's cabinet had  launched a frontal retreat from positions which the cabinet of  Vladimir Meciar "had worked out in considerable detail" with  relation to the Czech Republic and other countries.</p>

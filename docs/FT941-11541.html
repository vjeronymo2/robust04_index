			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee traders nervous - Market Report COFFEE futures closed little changed at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday, the market remaining nervous of news that Brazil had switched responsibility for financing coffee retention to the private sector, though some traders said this should raise prices. The May delivery position ended at Dollars 1,161 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day. At the London bullion market SILVER's bull run continued, the cash price ending another 9 cents higher at Dollars 5.30 1/2 a troy ounce. PLATINUM also added to this week's advance but GOLD was left behind, closing 15 cents down at Dollars 384.60 an ounce. Compiled from Reuter</p>

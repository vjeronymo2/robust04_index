			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA June 18 -- The National Assembly at its  fifth session on June 17 passed the Labour Law with 326 (out of  332) votes in favour.    The Labour Law, the first of its kind in Vietnam, includes  12  chapters and 198 articles. To ensure the interest of both  employees and employers, the law includes provisions on jobs,  job training, labour contracts and collective labour agreements,  wages, working and rest hours, labour disciplines, material  responsibilities, labour safety, woman and juvenile labour,  local employees at foreign enterprises and foreign labour in  Vietnam, and so on. The law also stipulates such issues as  social insurance, trade unions and their roles, labour disputes,  state management on labour, state labour inspection and  punishment for labour law breaking.    The chapter on settlement of labour disputes including the  issue of strike caused hot discussions. The law provides that  strike shall be decided by the executive committee of the trade  union at grassroots level with more than half of its secret  votes or signatures in favour. The law seriously prohibits any  acts of violence causing damage to machinery and equipment and  other properties of the enterprises, and public disorders during  the strike. Article 174 stipulates that no strike shall be  allowed at public service enterprises and major enterprises  essential to the national economy or national security and  defence listed by the Vietnamese Government.</p>

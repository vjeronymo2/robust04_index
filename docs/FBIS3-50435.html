Mariano Mena, general secretary of the General Confederation  of Panamanian Workers (CGTP) and a member of ARI, told LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that the Torrijos-Carter Treaties must be  fulfilled. The country is in no condition to negotiate the  military bases.    According to the leader, the proximity of the election and  the political situation do not offer the appropriate conditions  for modifying the treaty.    According to the Southern Command Treaty Implementation  Office, 9,000 U.S. soldiers and 2,562 civilians work at the U.S.  bases in Panama along with 5,718 Panamanian civilian employees.    David Guerra, presidential candidate for the National Unity  Mission party (MUN), said Panama has more immediate needs to  attend to, and modifying the Torrijos Carter Treaty would just  create more problems.    Tomas Herrera, presidential candidate for the Civic Renewal  Party, said he agrees with former President Jimmy Carter that  the bases will disappear within the time established by the  treaty.    He indicated that the new government could negotiate the  treaties responsibly, seeking to increase Panama's income.    Herrera pointed out that "Panama could benefit by  renegotiating the U.S. military bases as Italy, Germany, the  United Kingdom, Turkey, and Korea have."</p>

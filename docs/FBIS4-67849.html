			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Chong Hae-yong reports from Washington] </F>   [Text] North Korea was learnt to have recently proposed to  the United States that they resume unofficial working-level  contacts to discuss means for a breakthrough in the nuclear  issue. This comes at a time when the United States has beefed  up firm actions against North Korea's unwillingness to accept  nuclear inspections, through consecutive contacts with the ROK,  China, and Japan. The talks, however, are unlikely to be  realized by next week since U.S. Defense Secretary Perry and  Robert Gallucci, the special envoy on the North Korean nuclear  issue, will be visiting the ROK, China, and Japan. North Korea  also does not usually make moves before or after Kim Il- song's  birthday on 15 April.    A high-level U.S. source on 13 April assessed that North  Korea proposed the contact to determine the true intentions of  the United States since the United States and the ROK have taken  active moves with China, Japan, and Russia aimed at  strengthening the international cooperative system following the  adoption of the UN Security Council President's statement  calling on North Korea to accept inspections. North Korea  apparently hopes to resume contacts in order to open a dialogue  channel with the United States prior to the next phase of action  the UN Security Council may pursue following the early May  deadline in the Council President's statement, the source added.</p>

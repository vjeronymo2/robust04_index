			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (9): New spirit of enterprise - Science and technology Portugal pioneered the application of science and technology to commercial endeavour in the 15th century when Prince Henry the Navigator created the School of Sagres. Leading astronomers, shipbuilders and cartographers were challenged to make scientific breakthroughs that laid the technological foundation for the Age of Discoveries. Few such stimulating demands are made on Portuguese researchers today. Industry, protected from competition and dependent on captive colonial markets for most of this century, has made little effort to move beyond unsophisticated, low-cost products. Scientists, lacking any challenge from business, have turned to pure research or work for foreign companies with a greater capacity to apply their findings. The mistrust and misunderstanding that impair the relationship between companies and universities in Portugal is a marked disadvantage for a country now competing in a single European market, where technological innovation is crucial for success. A few notably successful collaborations between business and research institutes are exceptions that prove the rule. Portugal invests only 0.8 per cent of GDP in research and development, compared with a European Union average of 2.5 per cent. Little more than a quarter of the total is invested in industrial research, compared with about three-quarters for the most successful European economies. Analysts have repeatedly highlighted the weak link between industry and academia as a flaw in Portugal's strategy to build more competitive companies. Efforts are now under way to rekindle the spirit of Sagres. The most prominent development is Taguspark, a science and technology park due to be completed in 1997. It will create an educational, scientific and business community of about 10,000 people and involve a global investment of some Es50bn (Dollars 321m). The School of Sagres was the Renaissance equivalent of Cape Canaveral, providing a scientific framework that helped launch Portugal into an era of expansion and wealth. Taguspark has decidedly more modest aims, but nonetheless hopes to build a bridge between science and enterprise that will foster development. 'Our objective is to contribute to modernising Portugal by creating a new framework for interaction between education, research and business and by building an environment that favours innovation,' says Jose Sucena Paiva, chairman of the Taguspark management board. Emphasis is being given to providing support for technological development by the small and medium-sized companies that dominate the economy. The first stage of Taguspark, begun in 1992, will occupy 114 hectares overlooking the Tagus river at Oeiras, a few minutes by road from central Lisbon. Facilities will include a business and innovation centre, designed as a small company incubator, as well as a scientific and technical information centre, a congress and exhibition hall, a hotel, residential areas and services. Strong emphasis will be given to education. The Lisbon Technical University (UTL), the Higher Technology Institute (IST) and the Systems and Computers Engineering Institute (INESC) all plan to open faculties in Taguspark, which will initially cater for about 3,000 university students. Jose Tribolet, president of INESC, also wants the project to provide secondary school teaching and short-term professional training courses, which would make Portugal a pioneer in stimulating the practical application of academic learning and research. Large companies are also installing research and development centres in Taguspark. The project's 19 shareholders, whose investments will be supplemented by considerable amounts of EU and government aid, include the state-owned power, telecommunication and post office utilities. They have been joined by important private companies including Banco Comercial Portugues, Banco Portugues de Investimento and the Inter-Banking Services Society (SIBS), a European leader in automated banking services. Many other companies, including foreign investors, are subsequently expected to choose what promises to be a fertile new environment for the interchange of ideas between science and industry as a launching pad for innovation.</p>

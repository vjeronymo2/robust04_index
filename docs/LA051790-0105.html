			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUPS SPLIT OVER ENDORSING FIRE-SAFE CIGARETTES  </P> <P> Burn victims and consumer advocates urged Congress on Wednesday to pass  legislation designed to reduce the fire danger from cigarettes, the nation's  leading cause of fatal fires.  </P> <P> But tobacco officials, testifying against the bill before a House subcommittee,  were joined by some fire officials in urging that more research be done before  a fire safety standard is set.  </P> <P> Consumer activists and congressmen pushing the bill had hoped for a united  front by fire groups. But the proposal has split the ranks of the groups, some  of which have received grants and contracts from the Tobacco Institute in  recent years.  </P> <P> "It is now time to begin the process of moving a fire-safe cigarette from the  laboratory into the environment where it can make a difference," said District  of Columbia Fire Chief Rayfield Alfred, speaking for the International Assn. of  Fire Chiefs.  </P> <P> "Let us see if the fire-safe cigarettes can be made before we attempt to  mandate them," countered Philip Stittleburg, representing the National  Volunteer Fire Council. "It is not a political determination but a scientific  one."  </P> <P> Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer  protection and competitiveness of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,  questioned whether support from the industry played a role in persuading some  fire organizations to endorse study over action.  </P> <P> "Simply put, we need a cigarette which, when dropped accidentally in a chair or  bed, goes out before a life-threatening fire can start," Walgren said.  </P> <P> Cigarette fires kill nearly 1,500 Americans a year, including children who were  at home when a smoker fell asleep.  </P> <P> Two years ago, a federal task force concluded that it would be "technically  feasible" to produce safer cigarettes. The study found that thinner cigarettes,  using looser-packed tobacco and less-porous paper, would cause fewer fires.  </P> <P> Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) introduced a bill that would give the Consumer  Product Safety Commission a year to establish an ignition resistance standard  for cigarettes. The industry then would have another year to bring its products  into line with the standard.  </P> <P> A rival bill by Reps. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) on  behalf of the industry would launch a three-year study of unresolved issues,  including the commercial potential of safer cigarettes. It would not require  any action upon completion.  </P> <P> "The issue of commercial feasibility is a real question," said Charles Whitley,  a former congressman who testified on behalf of the Tobacco Institute. "More  research needs to be done."  </P> <P> Asked by Walgren about the industry's financial support of fire groups, Whitley  said there were "no strings" attached to the grants.  </P> <P> The industry several years ago began providing the grants, creating what an  industry lawyer called "the largest privately financed fire education/fire  prevention program in the United States."  </P> <P> Johnson reported from Washington and Levin reported from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> At least 13 people were arrested in San Rafael when more than 250 protesters on  both sides of the abortion issue staged an early morning demonstration outside  a Planned Parenthood clinic, police said. Lt. Ken Homen said those arrested  were charged with trespassing. The demonstrators were "hollering a lot" but  otherwise were not unruly, Homen said. Operation Rescue spokeswoman Judy Hockel  said her group hoped to persuade women not to have abortions. Jessica Braverman  of the National Organization for Women, said her supporters were there to  demonstrate against the Operation Rescue group.  </P></p>

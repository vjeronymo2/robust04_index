			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS  </P> <P> A relatively mild form of hepatitis has infected seven elementary  schoolchildren and one adult in Encinitas, the county Health Department said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The children, students at Paul Ecke Central School, are believed to have  contracted hepatitis A from one infected student during a Thanksgiving  kindergarten banquet at the school.  </P> <P> Department spokesman Dave Carey said parents have been advised to have their  children inoculated to protect against the disease, which has symptoms of  fever, fatigue, nausea and jaundice. However, hepatitis A is a fairly mild  version of the disease and is "rarely disabling," said Carey.  </P> <P> The incubation period before symptoms appear is anywhere between 15 and 50  days, and Carey said the illness lasts one to two weeks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BARGAIN CORNER: FREQUENT GUEST CLUB  </P> <P> San Diego-based TraveLodge and Viscount Hotels, subsidiaries of Trusthouse  Forte Hotels, are offering free membership in a new frequent guest club.  </P> <P> You don't have to stay at any of the 500 participating properties in North  America to join. Though the TraveLodge Business Break Club is geared to attract  business travelers, it is open to pleasure travelers as well.  </P> <P> The club has set a target of 50,000 members, which it expects to reach by the  end of May. At that point the program may be changed and a membership fee  assessed. However, existing members will get any new benefits that may be added  to the program after May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10% Discount  </P> <P> The major benefit of membership is a guaranteed 10% discount at all TraveLodge  and Viscount hotels, when rooms are available. No charge is levied for a second  person staying in the room, and free room upgrades are provided on a  space-available basis. Indicate that you are a club member when making a  reservation.  </P> <P> In addition, you get a coupon booklet with five vouchers worth $5 each at  Viscount properties and $3 each at TraveLodge properties, which can be combined  with the 10% discount.  </P> <P> Applications can be picked up at any TraveLodge or Viscount Hotel. You can also  get an application, as well as more information, by calling the chain toll free  at (800) 526-CLUB.  </P> <P> Holiday Inns is continuing its Winter Great Rates weekend program through April  30. More than 1,000 of the chain's properties, including Holiday Inn Crowne  Plazas, are participating.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Rate Cuts  </P> <P> The promotion covers Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, with rates either $35,  $45, $55, or $59 per room a night, depending on the hotel and type of room.  Contact travel agents or Holiday Inns at (800) 228-3000.  </P> <P> These discount programs are generally run on a capacity-controlled,  space-available basis. Consequently, the amount of rooms available at lower  rates can vary from hotel to hotel and weekend to weekend. The earlier you make  a reservation, the better your chances of getting a lower rate.

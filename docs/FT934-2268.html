			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Segregation revives in American schools Schools in the US are becoming more segregated by race, thus reversing 30 years of progress and of policy designed to produce more integrated classrooms, says a new, federally commissioned study. The Harvard Project on School Desegregation attributed its findings more to higher birth rates and a new wave of immigration than to the flight of white Americans to the suburbs. Mr Gary Orfield, its director, gloomily concluded: 'The civil rights impulse of the 1960s is dead in the water and the ship is floating backwards to the shoals of racial segregation.' The study found that 66 per cent of all black students and 74 per cent of Hispanics attended 'predominantly minority' primary and secondary schools in the 1991-92 academic year, the highest percentages for both communities since 1968. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled - in Brown vs the Topeka, Kansas, Board of Education - that segregated education was unconstitutional. Flowing from that landmark judgment, government policies, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, were primarily directed to promote integration, in some case by court-ordered busing of school children. These policies were substantially reversed by the Reagan administration. Mr Orfield ascribed the study's findings to the delayed effect of this change in approach. The south, the target of the most bitter integration battles, is now less segregated in education, but recent trends suggest it is moving in the same way as the rest of the country. The biggest concentration of segregated schools is found in the larger cities, primarily in the north and north-east. In state terms, Illinois, Michigan, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania contain the most predominantly black schools; New York, New Jersey, Texas, California and Illinois the most schools predominantly given over to Hispanic students. The study makes the explicit, but unsurprising, link between poverty and the concentration of minorities in schools. Black and Hispanic students, it said, were much more likely to be in schools with poor academic records. It recommends redrawing and enlarging school district boundaries to encompass both inner cities and suburbs, thus making it possible for students to have greater choice. It doubted that existing federal programmes to improve the quality of inner city education were sufficient.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Albanian Helsinki Committee has addressed a  protest to the Serbian Government, energetically reacting  against the violent act of usurping the Albanological Institute  in Prishtina. The protest states that this Serbian apartheid and  segregation against the ethnic Albanians in former Yugoslavia is  every day exterminating every kind of institution and legal  structure of the spiritual and material world in Kosova. This  is a manifestation of another form of ethnic cleansing, which  the Belgrade authorities are practicing in Kosova.    The Albanian Helsinki Committee addresses all international  institutions to stop, as soon as possible, these inhuman acts  that incite and provoke the spread of war toward the south of  Balkans at any cost. The committee feels that the European  consciousness cannot stand indifferent when academies are closed  in front of its eyes, cultural and academic institutions are  locked, and art and culture representatives are beaten,  maltreated, and imprisoned, thus challenging the European  science and culture itself.    The Albanian Helsinki Committee expresses its conviction  that  the international public, as well as the recent approved  resolutions accepting the CSCE Commission as observers against  the violations of human rights of Albanians in former  Yugoslavia, will exert their pressure to stop Serbian  repression, apartheid, and segregation in Kosova.</p>

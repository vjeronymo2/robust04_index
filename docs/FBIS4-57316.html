			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Panamanian Minister of Foreign Relations </F> Roberto Robaina by unidentified LA JORNADA reporter; place and  date not given]    [Text] [LA JORNADA] There are a number of economic  reforms under way in your country that were unthinkable just a  few years ago. Why are these reforms being made? How will you  overcome the democratic deficit, given that the single party  system only offers Cuban voters one option?    [Robaina] I don't think one can analyze these issues outside  the context in which the people live, work, and develop. I am  not saying our democracy is perfect, but we do have our own  special democratic system. No one has been able to show me that  any other model is perfect. In some countries, 70 percent of  the eligible voters stay away from the polls out of  indifference. I respect all versions of democracy and only ask  that people respect ours. We will see how many things can be  discussed regarding models and modes of popular participation as  soon as my country is out from under the foreign threat hanging  over us. Our form of democracy is not what it was five years  ago, and it will surely be different five years from today. We  are currently working on ideological pluralism. It is more a  pluralism for participation than a pluralism of parties.    [LA JORNADA] What can you tell all those sectors, including  the intellectual left wing, which believe that the blockade  benefits Fidel Castro inasmuch as it helps him when it is time  to fall in line and defend the revolution against foreign  threats?    [Robaina] If lifting the blockade means overthrowing Fidel  (Castro), as many so absurdly propose, the blockade would have  been lifted by now. One cannot associate the existence of a  political system with the blockade. The blockade is against an  entire population that has been sentenced to die of hunger and  disease.    [LA JORNADA] Has there been any kind of progress to indicate  that the tension between Cuba and the United States is  weakening, opening the way to normal relations?    [Robaina] There is no reason for excessive enthusiasm. We  have publicly stated that this (U.S.) Administration does not  display the constant aggression of past administrations. That  in and of itself means very little, but it could create a  certain atmosphere. Although the aggression is absent, there  are other things indicative of a certain stagnation, such as the  tightening of the blockade by the Torricelli Bill and the failed  U.S. attempt to prevent the United Nations from discussing this  issue. We see no indications that relations are heading toward  a major change. I think this administration was highly  committed when it came to office. I do not think it is a matter  of what they want to do but a matter of what they really can do.    [LA JORNADA] From a distance, the economic reforms you are  implementing have a certain smell of neoliberalism; shock  measures. Don't you think this new direction could shatter the  consensus you seem to enjoy among the people?    [Robaina] To say that the people are adjusting easily to  these measures would be untrue. We are conducting a persuasion  campaign, explaining the reasons behind the changes neighborhood  by neighborhood. There are already some measures in effect that  have a high social and political cost. A large portion of the  population did not welcome the decision to legalize foreign  currency after 30 years of working in the opposite direction  because they were taught a different way of thinking. That  measure is just another way of keeping our feet on the ground,  as there are more and more people with a working relationship  with foreign investment every day. We concluded that if 10  million people are unable to solve the situation we are facing  but 5 million are able to do it, then we must decide to make a  sacrifice and somehow create the social differences to which we  are unaccustomed.    [LA JORNADA] What guarantees will foreign investors have  that their properties will not be seized by the state?    [Robaina] We have given foreign investment constitutional  support through regulations that are flexible enough to include  everyone and every circumstance. In addition, we are not  interested in meddling in any area, especially the economic one.  Under no circumstances will we risk foreign investment. Some  even wonder what would happen if Cuba returned to capitalism.  Even if that happened it wouldn't entail any shocks for  businessmen because they would be in their element.    [LA JORNADA] Is a return to capitalism possible?    [Robaina] I don't think so.    [LA JORNADA] What then would be the middle ground between an  unsuccessful socialist system and the capitalism you seem to  dislike?    [Robaina] Cuba does not believe that there is any reason to  turn back from what has been done. We want the Cuban project,  as we have been planning and implementing it, to be viable.    [LA JORNADA] You are planning a meeting in Havana next year  with a large segment of the Cuban exile community. Why now,  after so many years and mutual ill will, is this meeting, which  in some ways implies a national reconciliation, taking place?    [Robaina] The time is right whenever Cuban exiles overseas  --  not just in the United States -- want to talk to us and meet  with us in Cuba. It is very likely that a delegation from a  group in that exile community will hold a positive meeting with  us. The aforementioned group follows a moderate position, as  opposed to the hostile attitude held by some toward Cubans who  defend projects on the island.    [LA JORNADA] Do you mean that if prominent exiles such as  Jorge Mas Canosa and Carlos Montaner changed their positions  vis-a-vis the revolution, they could participate in this  incipient dialogue?    [Robaina] Our prospects for dialogue do not depend on  individuals but on positions. Anyway, we have so many  relationships with people, groups, and sectors which have  positions different from those advocated by Mas Canosa and  Montaner that we do not need to consider talking to them. At  any rate, I do not believe they are thinking of changing their  position toward Cuba. Therefore, meeting with them doesn't make  any sense.</p>

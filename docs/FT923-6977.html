			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Watchdog warns on council tax changes THE government has been warned against making last-minute changes to the council tax by the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog. In its annual report for the year ending March 31, the commission says the timetable for introducing the tax - which replaces the poll tax, or community charge, next April - is 'exceptionally short'. This has meant local authorities faced a tight schedule for writing the software for collection of the council tax, training staff to operate the systems and providing information to the public on the tax. The commission says: 'It is particularly important that the government does not introduce late amendments to the council tax procedures which will require new software routines at a late stage in the process.' Software problems contributed to difficulties when the poll tax was introduced. The warning comes as pressure mounts for government action to ease the introduction of the council tax. There have been calls to adjust the values of homes on which bills will be calculated to reflect price falls since the valuation date - April 1 last year. Backbench Conservative MPs are also pressing for generous Treasury support to ease the introduction of the tax. Local authority leaders, though, have backed the commission's warning and urged the government not to indulge in 'last-gasp intervention' to try to keep bills down. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said late government interference in two of the three years of the poll tax had discredited the system and compounded tax-collection difficulties for local authorities. 'If the government panics again and changes the council tax in a bid to keep bills down, it could kill the tax in its infancy and fatally undermine any future system of local government finance by creating a culture of non-payment,' said Mr Beecham. 'Local government will cope with the introduction of the council tax, but only if the government keeps its hands to itself and does not interfere simply because it wants to placate its backbenchers.' A lack of reliable management information in the National Health Service is a significant obstacle to progress, according to the Audit Commission, which is also responsible for auditing health authorities. Financial controls and systems are sometimes 'rather basic' and there are still too few good finance staff, the commission says. Meanwhile, Labour has attacked government plans to announce today a further 150 applications for hospital trust status - the third wave due to become operational in April next year. Ministers will also invite applications for a fourth wave of trusts. Audit Commission report and accounts for year ended March 31 1992. HMSO. Pounds 8.50.</p>

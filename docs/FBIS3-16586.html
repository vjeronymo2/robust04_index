Vasev will not comment on the plan until a meeting with  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and Transdniestrian leader Igor  Smirnov scheduled for 17 March. He said that it gives  Transdniestria greater autonomy.    "It is important for Moldova and the Transdniestrian region  that this status should be within the framework of a single and  integral Moldovan state," Vasev pointed out.</p>

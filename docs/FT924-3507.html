			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / 'We Swiss may get up early, but we wake up late' 'WE have just built an obstacle for ourselves. We now have to find a way to get around it.' This was how Mr Jean Rodolphe de Salis, Switzerland's most respected historian, summed up yesterday his country's rejection of the European Economic Area (EEA) - a vote which potentially leaves Switzerland isolated in the midst of an integrated Europe. The overall reaction to Sunday's referendum appeared a mix of angst and confusion - tinged with a modicum of Swiss-style indifference. 'The world couldn't care less about Switzerland's relations with Europe,' says Mr Silvan Trachsler, head of equity research at Union Bank of Switzerland, explaining why Swiss financial markets yesterday closed virtually unchanged. Other financial analysts registered disappointment at the outcome. 'We Swiss may get up early, but we wake up late,' one Zurich banker said yesterday. But many German Swiss speakers - who voted by a large margin against the EEA  -had clearly been worried that closer ties to Europe would bring disadvantages through greater flows of immigrants or increased unemployment. There was, however, near universal surprise that these fears were strong enough to overwhelm economic self-interest. Normally fewer than half of German Swiss voters turn out for plebiscites. This time, over 80 per cent voted, and 61 per cent said No. Even leaders of the anti-EEA forces seemed perplexed, emphasising that they do not seek isolation. Instead, they claim that Switzerland must press ahead with liberalising its structures and markets. 'We want to have good relations with each of the European states and with the European Community,' said Mr Christoph Blocher, leader of the anti-EEA campaign and chairman of the Ems-Chemie chemical group. As a small country with modest resources, Switzerland knows that it has only limited control over relations with the rest of Europe. As the EEA and the single market develop, Switzerland will, in a number of important ways, be isolated. There will, for instance, be no automatic freedom for people to move between Switzerland and EEA countries. More important economically, Swiss industrial products will not automatically be accepted as meeting EEA standards. Delays on Swiss imports imposed by EC authorities' examinations could be disruptive. Mr Blocher says that the EC will not do anything to hurt the country which is its second largest trading partner. But many Swiss companies are already thinking of relocating production to EC countries. For high technology companies, there is disappointment that Switzerland will not be able to sit on the EC committees planning Community-wide research projects. Swissair, the national airline, will suffer through not being able to participate in the gradual liberalisation of air traffic within the EEA. The airline's hopes for minimising its disadvantages rest on negotiations for a new bilateral agreement with the EC due to begin soon. Swiss ministers say they will press ahead with plans to harmonise as many of the country's laws and regulations as possible with those of the EC. But that provides no guarantee that the EC will acknowledge them. Meanwhile, many analysts fear that without pressure from EC regulations, the momentum for dismantling Swiss cartels in many sectors could be lost, adding to cxompetitiveness problems. However, if the cost of remaining outside the EEA turns out to be high, the Swiss will probably change course.</p>

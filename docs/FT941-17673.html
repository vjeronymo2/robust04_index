			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Commodities (Year in the markets): Metals end 1993 in good heart Despite running into general, year-end profit-taking yesterday, London Metal Exchange base metal contracts mostly ended 1993 with their tails up as traders looked forward to a sustained upturn in global economic activity in 1994. The scars left by a dismal first half were still plain to see, however, with 12-month price falls ranging from just under 7 per cent for zinc to more than 20 per cent for copper. An honourable exception was lead, which ended about 60 per cent up on the year. Precious metals ended with substantial gains on the year, though gold bulls were still waiting for a decisive breach of the psychological barrier at Dollars 400 a troy ounce. Similarly, cocoa and coffee markets, having shaken out some of the speculative gains of recent months, were widely expected to take off again this year. In contrast, oil traders saw little reason to expect a significant price upturn after a year that saw the Brent blend crude price slump by nearly 27 per cent to a five-year low. The LME copper market had a very mixed year. An early rise fuelled by Chinese buying was followed by a steep price slide that culminated in a 5 1/2 -year low in May and landed several trading houses with huge losses. That was followed by a severe technical squeeze that was alleged to result from manipulation by Sumitomo, the Japanese metals group. At its height the squeeze pushed the cash price to an Dollars 80-a-tonne premium over the three months price. When the squeeze ended in September - as a result, some traders suggested, of behind-the-scenes pressure by exchange authorities - the cash premium quickly turned into a discount, as was more in keeping with the fact that LME warehouse stocks of the metal stood at a 15-year high. By the end of October prices had plunged to six-year lows but they have since recovered by 14 per cent. The aluminium market, already in the doldrums, had less downside potential than copper at the start of 1993. But as the flood of material from the former Soviet Union continued, it easily fulfilled that potential, the three months price dipping to an eight-year low of Dollars 1,040 a tonne at the start of November. Since then multilateral talks aimed at controlling the glut of material on the world aluminium market have helped sentiment and the market has recovered by nearly Dollars 100. The economic hopes that lifted the base metals from their lows also helped silver, the most 'industrial' of the precious metals, which ended the year with its price nearly 40 per cent up. Platinum, also principally an industrial metal, fared less well, reflecting its dependence on the recession-hit Japanese market. Gold had a relatively good year, its price ending more than 17 per cent higher. And many analysts expected 1994 to see it move substantially above Dollars 400 an ounce, a level reached briefly last year. The rise began in earnest in May, following an operation by investors George Soros and Sir James Goldsmith, involving the purchase of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest US gold producer, by the former from the latter, who used some of the cash to buy gold options. At the London Commodity Exchange, cocoa set the pace with a second position rise amounting to 65 per cent on the year, despite a recent 12 per cent retracement. The gain was encouraged by expectations of a continued drawdown from world stocks over the next few seasons as consumption growth outpaced production. It was topped up by speculative activity in response to concern about the political stability of the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, after the long-expected death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny last month, and the recent decline has been partly a reaction to the orderly hand-over of power in that country. Coffee futures were buoyed in the autumn in anticipation of the producers' export retention scheme, under which they are aiming to hold 20 per cent of their supplies off the world market. Since the scheme has been operating, however, the price gain since the start of the year has been trimmed back from 27 per cent to 16 per cent. In oil prices the traffic was all one way after the spring as members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries proved unable to forge an agreement to bring export quotas down to match flagging demand. And with the coming of the northern winter failing to underpin prices and the prospect of Iraqi crude's return to the market moving ever closer, analysts could see little reason to expect an upturn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium              +30,350     to     2,486,375 Aluminium alloy           +240     to        49,260 Copper                 +10,275     to       599,500 Lead                    +1,625     to       303,650 Nickel                  +1,320     to       124,104 Zinc                   +15,950     to       906,700 Tin                     +1,130     to        20,050  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

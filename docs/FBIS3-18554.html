In other words, its priority objective is to  safeguard and improve the Kurdish people's rights in Turkey. In  view of that, the problems it may create in the country must be  regarded as normal.    Meanwhile, separating the problem in southeastern Turkey  from  the question of terrorism and the confusion created by the armed  clashes in that region as well as placing it on the  parliamentary agenda will be in Turkey's interest.    The Kurdish problem is currently one of the most sensitive  issues in Turkey. The Turkish people are not yet accustomed to a  political party that assumes responsibility for an ethnic  problem and that appears on the political scene to defend it.  Obviously, such an establishment will create antagonism in  certain circles.    This being the case, how can DEP leader Hatip Dicle's  behavior be explained? How can the leader of a political party  forget he is a member of the Turkish Parliament? Mr. Dicle is a  member of the National Assembly and enjoys political immunity.  Nevertheless, as a public figure, he is bound by the laws.  Meanwhile, he has to see to it that his party is successful.    Can any politician forget or ignore all that and maintain  his  political activities?    Yesterday it was reported that Mr. Dicle has created a wave  of uneasiness even within his own party structure. It will be  recalled that he reacted to the incident in Tuzla by saying "a  war is being fought." Furthermore, he congratulated 300,000  eligible recruits for avoiding conscription. All that created  the impression that he represents the Workers Party of Kurdistan  and not the people.    Several DEP deputies, who have opposed Dicle's behavior,  fear  their party may lose its prestige and forfeit the support of its  grass roots.    Dicle's remarks apparently have exhausted the patience of  Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese and General Dogan Gures,  chief of the General Staff. They reacted strongly against  Dicle's behavior. It is necessary to recall Dicle's remarks  after the bomb attack in Tuzla in order to better understand the  meaning of the reaction by Mentese and Gures. Referring to the  cadets who were killed in that attack, Dicle said: "They were  in military uniform. Consequently, they were a military target.  Innocent people are also killed in a war. According to the  Geneva Conventions, military targets are fired on."    Was Dicle aware of the reaction his remarks would create in  various circles? Whether or not he was makes no difference. DEP  must learn the rules of politics if it wishes to have a place in  the parliamentary system in Turkey. However, if it wishes to be  the representative in the National Assembly of an armed  organization, then that is a different matter.    The people are waiting for that party to clarify its  position  on the matter.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Caution as Australian Alcan sees improvement ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent subsidiary of Alcan, the Canadian aluminium group, yesterday forecast a return to profit this year, following net losses of ADollars 15m (USDollars 10.8m) and ADollars 29m in the last two years. However, Mr Jeremy Davis, chairman, told the annual meeting the result was unlikely to represent a satisfactory return to shareholders. Mr Davis said the international environment was not promising, noting that aluminium prices had fallen to between USDollars 1,150 and USDollars 1,170 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. 'Aluminium prices today are the lowest they have been in real terms for more than 20 years, and some 25 per cent below a moving average trend price for metal over that period,' he said. Mr Davis said the low price for aluminium reflected the continuing flow of metal from the former Soviet Union, and widespread reluctance to close even the world's highest-cost smelters. He said there was no reason to expect any improvement in the current year because many of the higher-cost smelters were controlled by governments, which had motives other than profit for keeping them open. Mr Davis said demand might increase in the US, but the group was not confident of an upturn in Japan and western Europe.</p>

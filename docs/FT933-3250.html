			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / More pressure on Franco BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco yesterday looked further isolated from his main political supporters, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), after the resignation of another PMDB minister from the government, and the threatened departure of two more. Mr Coutinho Jorge, environment minister, resigned on Monday night as part of the dispute over whether the PMDB should have a greater role in formulating policy. His departure followed the ending on Sunday of the PMDB's conference, which provided a focus for discontent within the party. Two other ministers, as well as the government leader in the senate, offered to resign. But they were persuaded by the president to stay, at least until next week when the PMDB, the largest party in Congress, is due to decide whether to formally split with the government. The PMBD's main argument is with President Itamar Franco, who has made a number of senior appointments without consulting the party. The row overshadowed a press conference yesterday by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minster, designed to assess the first three months of his 'plan of immediate action', launched in June. Mr Cardoso outlined progress made in areas like agreements on state debts and greater transparency of central bank and treasury accounts. He repeated earlier pledges that there could be 'no magic plans' to reduce inflation, running at nearly 2,000 per cent. Mr Cardoso had planned a higher profile address on television but had to cancel the arrangements because of speculation he was about to launch a 'shock' plan to tackle inflation. Mr Cardoso said private research suggested Brazil would grow 5 per cent this year, its best performance since 1986. Tax revenues in the first half of the year were 31 per cent higher than the same period last year, and the government has signed agreements with 11 states on rolling over debts. A further six are due to sign agreements today, he said.</p>

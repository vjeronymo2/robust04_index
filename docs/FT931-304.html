			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Booker conflict Food group Booker was subject to conflicting pressures as the market remained divided over the company's prospects. Nomura produced its second downgrade in a week and turned cautious on the stock, arguing that the food distribution arm - the most significant contributor to Booker's profits - would continue under a cloud for the remainder of the year. The house pulled back its 1993 forecast to Pounds 92m. Booker's results last week produced a dramatic fall in the share price. Although largely in line with expectations, certain aspects, such as the large level of debt, caught analysts by surprise. A cautious accompanying company statement helped to send the shares into reverse, tumbling from 443p to yesterday's opening of 400p in just three days. The stock lost 5 to 395p yesterday. Kleinwort Benson believes the shares present a good buying opportunity. It argues that the decline in the stock makes it attractive and that the food distribution business is well positioned for recovery. The prospect of another reduction in UK interest rates triggered a further flurry of buying interest in a banks sector said to be attracting persistent strong institutional support. Last week's earnings upgrades in Royal Bank of Scotland saw the shares improve 5 more to 254p on 1.3m traded. Abbey National added 9 at 382p, TSB 4 1/2 at 173 1/2 p on good turnover of 4.5m and Lloyds 14 at 523p. Sun Alliance hardened to 345p after the purchase by its Danish subsidiary, Codan, of Hafnia's Danish offshoot for Pounds 140m. Mr Nick Bunker, insurance analyst at Hoare Govett, described the deal as 'an efficient way of utilising the excess assets within Codan, subject to some caveats about possible pitfalls within Hafnia's banking business'. BT shares extended last week's strong performance, climbing 8 to 438p on 8m dealt. In a comprehensive review of BT, Mr Chris Tucker of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said the shares 'look cheap on our estimates for the next two years'. He highlighted BT's recovery profile after two years of recession, high redundancy costs and large exceptional losses. He said the company 'should be able to achieve earnings per share and dividend per share growth of 10 per cent in the mid-1990s through improved productivity and strict cost control'. In a subdued oil and gas sector, BP continued to catch the eye, closing 4 firmer at 308 1/2 p. Turnover was a disappointingly low 4.8m, with specialists adding that much of that reflected yet more buying interest in the shares from across the Atlantic. US investors are thought to speak for at least 25 per cent of the company's shares. Burmah Castrol moved 7 higher to 721p, with the market becoming increasingly bullish about the stock ahead of Thursday's figures. A flood of statements from Euro Disney, ranging from fresh attendance figures to plans for new rides, helped to lift the theme park operator 40 to 1125p. Guinness improved, helped by recent presentations to institutions and a technical squeeze. The shares jumped 14 to 483p. There was further speculation over the 10.2 per cent stake in Sears held by the Al-Fayed brothers, owners of the House of Fraser group. The market has been rife with rumours for a number of weeks that some brokers have been testing the water in readiness should the brothers decide to sell. However, analysts continued to point out that the fact that the Al-Fayeds bought into the stores group at around 145p suggested a large-scale placing was unlikely given Sears' current share price. The shares closed steady at 102p yesterday. Elsewhere in an otherwise quiet stores sector, Kingfisher again improved following results last week, and helped yesterday by a NatWest Securities buy note. The shares firmed 5 1/2 to 563p. Marks and Spencer held steady at 339p. Kleinwort Benson upgraded the high street retailer, moving from Pounds 720m to Pounds 730m for this year and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 800m for the year after. Speculative buying of Dalepak Foods saw the shares rebound after their collapse last week. They closed 21 ahead at 233p. Following the company's latest profits warning last week, and the subsequent plunge in the share price, there were suggestions that the company may be susceptible to bid interest. Dealers mentioned Cargill and ConAgra, two US agricultural businesses, as potential predators. Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson was the best performer in the Footsie as its annual results were well received by the market. The group, which owns the Financial Times, announced 1992 profits of Pounds 150.8m and an increase in the dividend. Pearson shares strengthened 27 to 404p with 3.3m traded. Among transport stocks, a further advance in Eurotunnel, which said a tribunal had ruled in its favour over many of the issues in its dispute with tunnel builder TML, was checked by talk of a rights issue. The shares firmed only 2 to 492p. A buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs boosted Tomkins, which finished 7 better at 251p. Profit-taking along with an element of caution weakened Inchcape as it reported favourable figures, leaving the shares 4 lighter at 597p. The return of bid speculation helped Lucas Industries put on 2 at 139p, after it reported figures in line with expectations, albeit at a dull results meeting. The new five-year deal between the electricity generators and the regional electricity companies (recs), based on purchases of British coal over the five-year period, caused little activity in the stock market, where shares in the generators were marginally higher on the session and those of the recs no better than mixed. National Power settled 2 higher at 338p, while PowerGen, quoted ex the 7.15p dividend, was little changed on the day. Market activity in both shares - 469,000 in National Power and 1.9m in PowerGen - was well below recent levels, dealers said. The Scottish generators, now quoted 'cum' the final 70p call on the shares, showed Scottish Hydro 4 1/2 to the good at 346p.</p>

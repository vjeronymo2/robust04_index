			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Indians divided over 301 INDIAN business has made a strong protest against the US decision to put India, with China and Thailand, on the Special 301 list, under the US Trade Act. However, the Indian government is not showing concern over the decision, although punishment and retaliation by the US against India's exports can be taken after six months if Delhi makes no progress in protecting US companies' intellectual property rights. Dr Subramaniam Swamy, India's commerce minister, yesterday said 'we should not over-react' to the US decision. The statement by Ms Carla Hills, US trade representative, accompanying the announcement was 'conciliatory and leaves the door open for negotiations'. Dr Swamy's surprisingly mild reaction to a decision that could imperil India's exports to its largest trading partner, at a time when its balance-of-payments position is critical, is in marked contrast with the condemnation of the decision from Indian business and officials. The subdued comment could also be related to India's hope that the US and other donor countries will give emergency assistance to the country to help tide it over its current payments problems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The Public Sector,  Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV) on Tuesday [1  March] concluded its warning strikes, which were limited to two  days. As the OeTV headquarters in Stuttgart announced on  Tuesday, more than 180,000 OeTV members in western and eastern  Germany participated in the actions on Monday and Tuesday and  "opposed the wage break planned by the employers." On Tuesday  alone, 120,000 OeTV members all over Germany were on strike.    An OeTV spokesman said in Stuttgart that OeTV sees the  warning strikes as a "clear signal" addressed to the employers  to "finally start moving" in the fourth round of negotiations on  9-10 March. The employers have so far not made any offer in  response to the OeTV's 4-percent demand, but insisted on a "wage  break" and presented their own "list of cancellations."    Local traffic companies in Berlin, Hannover, Dresden,  Kassel,  and Munich on Tuesday were, among others, included in the  warning strikes. In Berlin alone, 50,000 OeTV members  reportedly participated in the strikes. In another 25 cities in  western and eastern Germany, traffic came to a temporary  standstill. Employees of kindergartens and hospitals also held  warning strikes on Tuesday, OeTV said.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Howard tries to defuse row over crime plan Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday tried to defuse a growing row over cuts in compensation for crime victims by announcing that they would have a greater say over when prisoners should be released. Following a court ruling last week that he had acted unlawfully in cutting levels of compensation for victims, Mr Howard said he would set up a Prison Helpline on which crime victims could state why particular prisoners should not be released from jail. Mr Howard vigorously defended recent cuts in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, in spite of a High Court ruling last week that he had abused his powers by introducing new tariffs. In a bid to reassert his authority on the issue, he claimed all the changes were made after taking legal advice and he renewed his pledge to fight the Court of Appeal ruling in the House of Lords. However, Mr Howard immediately came under fire from prison governors and pressure groups who argued that they had not been consulted over the creation of the helpline and that it was an unworkable idea. Mr Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Probation Officers' Association, said a hotline was totally impractical with some 140,000 cases of home and temporary leave each year. 'Who on earth is to tell the victims of crime that the prisoners are coming up for consideration? Certainly the probation officers can't do it because there are no resources,' he said on BBC Radio 4's prog-ramme The World at One. Mr Paul Cavadino, chair of the Penal Affairs Consortium, an alliance of 23 organisations concerned with the penal system, said that it would be wrong to refuse parole or home leave 'simply because the victim felt that the offender should be punished more severely'. Mr Howard, addressing the Victim Support organisation in London, said it had been difficult for victims of crime to get their voices heard. 'I also know that some victims of crime have seen or been contacted by serving prisoners - people are understandably afraid or distressed by that contact,' he said. He added: 'In future, victims will be able to pass on those concerns immediately and confidentially in the knowledge that something will be done.' However, his difficulties over the victim compensation issue have further undermined his authority as home secretary after a year of difficulties over the Criminal Justice Bill.</p>

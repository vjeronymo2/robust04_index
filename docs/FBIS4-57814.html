			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Francisco Ramirez Cardenas] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban  Government suspended summer vacations for sugar workers after  announcing that the harvest season will be extended and asked  workers to keep working "until the last cane is pressed" to  avoid losses in the sector resulting from the heavy rains.    "These are the times in which our intelligence, our work  ethic, and courage are necessary to produce as much sugar as  possible," Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres Perez said on  Tuesday in statements to official newspaper GRANMA. Torres  asked agro-industrial workers to raise their spirits and not to  give up in view of the heavy rains and floods, which paralyzed  harvests in the eastern provinces of the island, where at least  10 persons lost their lives.    Bridges, roads, thermoelectric plants, houses, and  plantations were adversely affected by the heavy rains, which  represented for the residents of the region a disaster similar  to the one they suffered last November.    The sugarcane harvest, which had been scheduled to end in  April, was first extended until May, and now, according to  official estimates, could be extended until June.    The critical situation was foreseen in mid-April by Vice  President Carlos Lage, who in an analysis meeting in Holguin  Province described the sugarcane harvest situation as tense and  difficult. Lage, the principal economic strategist, thereby  changed the criteria he had set at the beginning of the year  when he said that the 1994-95 harvest season would be greater  than the present one and that the present one would be greater  "by several hundred tons [as received] than the 1992-93 season."    The water excess, in addition to obstructing the work of the  scarce machinery that remains operating with the shortage of  fuel, decreases the amount of sucrose in the sugarcane. Cuba  registered in the last sugar cane harvest, its principal  industry, the lowest production in three decades of only 4.2  million tons of sugar, which President Fidel Castro described as  "a disaster."    The drop in production, as compared to the 1991-92 harvest  season, of 7 million tons, represented for the island a decrease  in revenue of $500 million at a time when the country is facing  a serious shortage of foreign exchange. "In July and August,  nothing will stop...most of the sugar cane workers will remain  in combat because there are no resources to perform work in  other areas, including repair work" at the sugar mills, Torres  said. "This effort we are making is not due to somebody's whim  or to the proud search for an objective," the sugar industry  minister said in the western city of Matanzas.    The rains of the last 30 days in the Provinces of  Guantanamo,  Granma, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba flooded hundreds of  hectares and paralyzed the sugarcane harvest, which is also  facing problems due to the lack of supplies.    Torres suggested taking advantage of the momentary absence  of  rain to work in the flooded fields because "we cannot spare even  a ton of sugar. The national economy and the commitments we  have made require it."    The Cuban Government has, for the past few weeks, made a  dramatic effort, which included the deployment of thousands of  workers with machetes -- cane cutters -- to step up production.</p>

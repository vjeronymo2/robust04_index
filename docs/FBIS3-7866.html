			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Karol Wolf in Bratislava; date not given:  "Peter Weiss: Prime Minister Meciar Does Not Want Elections"]    [Text] Bratislava--The strongest Slovak opposition party  is the postcommunist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). It has  28 seats in parliament, and, if an attempt is made to recall  Vladimir Meciar's government, it will play a decisive role. In  view of the continuing political crisis in Slovakia, MLADA  FRONTA DNES asked SDL Chairman Peter Weiss for an interview.    [Wolf] What do you think of the possibility that Prime  Minister Meciar's government may be recalled?    [Weiss] The reasons for such a step are clear. The prime  minister's Cabinet demonstrates day in and day out that it is  incapable of governing normally. On the other hand, the status  of the possible broad-coalition government or, rather, the issue  of whether it would have enough support in parliament is  unclear. At the moment, we cannot count on the definite support  of some of the deputies from the ruling Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and, what is more significant, the  opposition Hungarian Egyutteles movement has not given any clear  guarantees that it will not attempt to blackmail the new  government by making demands for its ethnic minority.  Egyutteles is setting the kind of conditions that even a  provisional government could not fulfill in the current  situation. We concur in this with Carnogursky's Christian  Democratic Movement.    [Wolf] What kind of conditions is Egyutteles setting?    [Weiss] For example, the adoption of the European Charter on  Self-Administrations and the Charter on Minority Rights. I am  not claiming that these issues cannot be dealt with later, but  Egyutteles has to realize that, in the Slovak environment, which  is strongly nationalized, no government can undertake such a  thing. These issues must be resolved by the cabinet that will  come out of the parliamentary elections.    [Wolf] What is the situation at the moment?    [Weiss] Negotiations are still taking place, and we have  even tried to hold talks with the HZDS. However, Vladimir  Meciar has made it clear that he does not want to negotiate. On  the contrary, he has initiated a petition on holding a  referendum. The aim of it is to expel from parliament those  deputies who have left the HZDS and Slovak National Party Clubs.    [Wolf] The prime minister has let it be known that he would  like elections as soon as possible. Do you really think he  wants early elections?    [Weiss] I am beginning to think more and more that he does  not. His plan is, in my opinion, to get the supporters of Milan  Knazko and Ludovit Cernak out of parliament and to get into a  situation in which he will again have a majority. Our party,  however, is working on a proposal for the Constitutional Court,  which has to say whether stripping a deputy of his mandate is  possible. In my opinion, this is out of order just as it is out  of order for a deputy to be held hostage by his party. As the  chairman of the largest opposition party, I know what it is like  to have a deputies' club at my disposal, but I would never be  able to take a step that would deprive a deputy of his freedom.  The question the HZDS wants to ask about mandates in the  referendum can be interpreted as follows: If a deputy is  expelled from his party, he loses his mandate. This could lead  to a situation in which five or six party chairmen hold sway  over parliament, and their deputies would be powerless. This  kind of situation is absolutely unacceptable.</p>

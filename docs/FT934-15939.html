			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Investors lengthen maturities as hopes of rate cuts fade EUROPE's bond markets caught their breath after the recent rally and prices drifted lower on moderate volume. However, traders reported little selling of cash bonds - if anything, some investors were picking up paper as it cheapened. A key feature continued to be maturity-lengthening by investors who felt further cuts in European short-term rates are unlikely in the near term. International investors' appetite for long-dated debt supported the auctions of 30-year bonds in the Netherlands and France. THE LONG end of the Dutch curve steamed ahead following the government's issue of Fl 2.8bn of the 7.50 per cent 30-year bond at 114.50. When the result was announced, traders who had sold the bonds around 114.20 ahead of the auction scrambled to cover their short positions, pushing the price as high as 114.85. It eased later on profit-taking, closing at 114.40. The long end of the yield curve flattened substantially, with the 30-year yield ending 51 basis points over 10-year yields, compared with 59 basis points on Wednesday. FRANCE auctioned FFr4.09bn of 8.5 per cent 30-year bonds and FFr9.26bn of 6.75 per cent 10-year bonds, which also met solid international demand, traders said. But prices drifted lower on widespread disenchantment over the Bank of France's reluctance to cut rates. As expected, it left its 6.75 per cent intervention rate unchanged at yesterday's repo. THE BUNDESBANK also left key rates steady at its latest meeting. German bonds slipped in lacklustre trade and are expected to make little headway before next week's bund issue. Once that is out of the way, the December bund future is expected to reach for new highs, targeting the key 100.00 level. It ended yesterday at 99.58, down 0.08 points from Wednesday. UK GILTS eased on profit-taking across the curve on disappointment that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke offered no new policy hints in his Conservative party conference speech. 'It was very much a speech geared to a party conference audience,' said Peter Fellner, gilts strategist with NatWest Markets. US Treasury prices were little changed in subdued trading for the third day running, as traders and investors remained on the sidelines awaiting today's employment figures. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  1/16 at 103 9/32 , yielding 6.007 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 3/32 , yielding 3.808 per cent. Once again the market was virtually on hold ahead of the September employment report, which will give the latest reading on the labour market. The market is looking for an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 150,000.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Krupp hit by losses in steel sector KRUPP, the German industrial conglomerate formed through merger of the Krupp and Hoesch groups, returned a loss of DM250m (Dollars 156m) in 1992. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said the poor result reflected high losses in the steel divisions, and the mounting costs of financing restructuring plans. The two groups merged in the middle of last year and these are the first consolidated figures to be reported. All the group's other divisions, which include machinery, buildings, automotive parts and trading services, showed positive results, the company said. Mr Cromme said the merger would allow cost-savings of up to DM500m. Part of the group's restructuring includes the closure of its Rheinhausen steel mill in the Ruhr valley, where 2,000 workers are employed. Thyssen, the industrial conglomerate hit by high losses in its steel division, said yesterday that group sales for the six months ending March declined by 8 per cent, to DM16.4bn. Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel producer, announced further production cuts last month. For the five months ending February, sales in the steel divisions were 20 per cent lower than the same period the previous year.</p>

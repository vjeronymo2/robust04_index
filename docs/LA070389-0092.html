			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ATTACK BY STREET PREACHERS PROBED  </P> <P> Los Angeles police were investigating an attack on a Roman Catholic woman who  said she was beaten by three Pacoima street preachers who told her she "needed  to be a 'born-again' Christian," authorities said today.  </P> <P> The attack on Alna Rosa Bolanos, 19, of Pacoima occurred at 11:40 p.m. Sunday  at the intersection of Laurel Canyon and San Fernando Mission boulevards in  Mission Hills, police said. The intersection is a popular Sunday night spot for  teen-agers who cruise the area in cars and on foot and for preachers who offer  sermons from the street curbs, police said.  </P> <P> Officers who went to the corner after Bolanos reported the attack at the  Foothill police station found no preachers there, and no arrests have been  made.  </P> <P> According to the police report, Bolanos was walking on the sidewalk at the  intersection when she passed a group of four or five street preachers.  </P> <P> "They were standing on the corner preaching, and the suspects began yelling at  her," Lt. Bernard D. Conine said. "She told them to leave her alone, that she  was Catholic. They said she needed to be a 'born-again' Christian."  </P> <P> Bolanos told police that three of the preachers, two women and a man, crowded  around her and began insulting her. She said one woman grabbed her from behind  and the other struck her repeatedly in the face before she was able to break  away.  </P> <P> The police report said Bolanos suffered a bruised cheek and two black eyes. She  told police she would seek medical treatment on her own. She could not be  reached for comment this morning.  </P></p>

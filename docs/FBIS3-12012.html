			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] The Attorney General's Office has issued a  bulletin explaining the charges filed against Mario Aburto  Martinez and what will happen to him in terms of legal  proceedings. Here is a report by Jesus Casasola:    [Begin Casasola recording] Mario Aburto Martinez has been  formally arraigned without bail on charges of being responsible  for the homicide of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate of  the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Judge Alejandro Ortiz,  First District criminal judge of Mexico State, made the official  announcement at Almoloya de Juarez Prison, where newsmen were  not allowed access. The judge said Aburto Martinez is accused of  carrying a weapon without a license, which means he could be  sentenced to more than 55 years, considering the maximum  sentence for homicide is 50 years. Aburto Martinez's lawyer has  three working days to appeal the judge's decision to allow the  normal course of the trial to continue. [sentence as heard]    The Attorney General's Office indicated that other charges  could be brought against him as the investigations progress. The  Attorney General's Office has also released reports on Aburto  Martinez's medical and drug tests. A report on the  reconstruction of the crime and an inspection of the crime scene  was compiled on the same day and includes 163 photos. In  addition, the ballistic and forensic report noted that the  wounds were caused by a .38-caliber revolver.    According to preliminary statements by Aburto Martinez, he  was not studying to be a priest, but he was to become a priest.  He said he did not belong to any political party or group and  that some people nicknamed him "Gentleman Eagle" [Caballero  Aguila] because of a ring he wore on his left hand.    Another important aspect is the testimony of Marcelina Ortiz  Martinez, who said that a few days before the killing the  suspect told her he was about to make a good deal of money in  the next few days. She added that he showed her a revolver,  which was the same .38-caliber revolver he used to kill Colosio.  It was also reported that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, arrested  in Tijuana, Baja California, on Sunday, was not a member of  Colosio's security guards headed by General Domiro Garcia Reyes.

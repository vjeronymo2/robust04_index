			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Russia deepens Black Sea fleet dispute THE ROW between Russia and Ukraine over possession of the Black Sea fleet escalated dangerously yesterday when Russia issued a decree claiming nominal control. Under the decree, signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the fleet, comprising some 300 ships, will be funded by Russia but will remain under the joint military command of the 11-nation Commonwealth of Independent States. The Russian move followed an identical decree issued by Ukraine earlier in the week and raised the prospect of the fleet's commanders being forced to answer to two conflicting authorities. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the CIS armed forces, told the Congress of Russian People's Deputies yesterday that the decree would put the fleet under the jurisdiction of Russia, though 'operational control' would still be vested in the CIS. Admiral Igor Kasotonov, the fleet's commander, warned against 'parallel structures of command'. The earlier decree signed by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, takes the fleet under the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, and brings all strategic nuclear forces under Ukrainian administrative control, though operational command is to remain with the CIS. Mr Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of Ukraine's parliamentary commission on economic reform, said that 'by making this statement Yeltsin is drawing us into a state of war with Russia'. He said Ukraine's claim was based on the fact that the fleet was largely stationed on Ukrainian territory and that Russia had no right to claim military forces located in a foreign country. Mr Yeltsin told the Congress that the Russian army would take over all CIS forces in other republics and abroad (in Poland and former East Germany). Although Mr Yeltsin did not say so, it is clearly envisaged that the strategic forces will also be put under Russian command, threatening further confrontation with Ukraine. Praising the decision to take the CIS forces nominally under his command under Russian control, Marshal Shaposhnikov said that it would raise morale and confirm Russian statehood. 'An army without a state is not an army, and a state without an army is not a state,' he said. The Ukrainian parliament is scheduled to debate today in closed session, laws which would further extend its control over the strategic nuclear weapons. The draft laws call on the Cabinet of Ministers to take immediate action to give Ukraine technical blocking power over the firing of nuclear weapons. Western experts and Ukrainian officials say it is technically possible to develop veto power over the use of nuclear weapons on its territory.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting has taken place in Szeged, Hungary,  between Mr. Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR], and Mr. Gyula Horn, president of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The meeting was also attended  for Romania by Mr. Dan Martian, parliamentary deputy and PDSR  vice president, Grigore Zanc, prefect of Cluj County, and  Dumitru Paslaru, deputy. Here is a dispatch from Budapest by our  correspondent Dorin Suciu.    [Begin Suciu recording] The meeting that the two party  presidents held this morning was an opportunity for a first  contact between them. The sides examined aspects of  Hungarian-Romanian relations and the PDSR-MSZP relations. In  the afternoon, the talks focused on the integration of the two  countries into the European Union and NATO.    During a news conference after the talks, MSZP President  Gyula Horn said: There is a need for a historic reconciliation  between Hungary and its neighbors. In concrete terms, this  means that we should push aside the so-called prejudices or  historical injustices, or at least remove them from the sphere  of politics. Otherwise, they will continue to be a source of  tension. Let us leave it up to the scientists and historians to  elucidate the white or dark spots in our common history.    In the MSZP's opinion, it is possible to reach a common  denominator on the issue of the basic treaty between the two  countries, Gyula Horn said. An essential aspect of this treaty  is Point No. 4, that is recognition of the integrity of borders  and, closely related to that aspect, the full ensurance of the  rights of the minorities living on the territory of the two  countries. One would like to see a law on minorities being  passed in Romania and Hungarian-language education based on  legal grounds. The MSZP president expressed serious  reservations on these two issues. According to Horn, the  Hungarian minorities both in Romania and Slovakia should enjoy  internal self-determination. I do not want to be misunderstood,  the MSZP president emphasized. I am referring to an  administrative autonomy in the regions inhabited by compact  masses of Hungarians. We have reservations about the way in  which the new Romanian Constitution safeguards the rights of the  minorities. Of course, this is an internal matter, but we would  positively receive a possible modification along these lines,  Mr. Horn added.    The socialist leader also emphasized the need to enhance  economic and trade relations and advocated closer links and more  contacts between the parliamentary deputies and politicians of  the two countries. I found in the PDSR a constructive partner  and I am convinced that future talks at expert level and a  subsequent meeting at a higher level would lead to a mutual  understanding, Mr Gyula Horn said in conclusion.    As far as PDSR President Mr. Oliviu Gherman is concerned, he  said that the following: From the list of problems raised by  President Gyula Horn, one might come to the erroneous conclusion  that there is a huge number of unsolved problems between the two  countries and that we are only at the beginning of the road.  Then, Mr. Oliviu Gherman continued:    [Gherman] In reality, many problems have been resolved and I  express the conviction that, with the signing of the fundamental  treaty of cooperation between the two countries, we will create  conditions for solving the key problems remaining between our  two states. I would like to point out that the party I am  representing sets out from the premise that real relations of  friendship and cooperation should be established between the two  countries. Unfortunately, the absence of a fundamental treaty of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries has  generated a sentiment of suspicion, at least in Romania.    The resolution of the problem of the minorities in Romania  is  fully covered by the constitutional stipulation which confirms  the prevalence of the provisions of the international laws on  human rights endorsed by the organizations to which Romania  belongs over the internal laws. This means -- if not  explicitly, at least implicitly -- that we are fully aligning  ourselves to international standards in the matter.    I would like to stress that the MSZP statement gave us the  feeling that we must start these initiatives to accelerate the  normalization of the relations between the two countries and  even raise them to a higher level. We express the hope that --  after the commissions of experts Mr. President Horn referred to  are going to start putting together a list of problems and  various ways and means for their resolution -- we will reach a  situation wherein the two parties will develop relations of  preferential cooperation links.    [Suciu] At the end of the news conference, MSZP President  Gyula Horn was asked the following question by a journalist: If  you become head of government, will you also say, as your  predecessors Joszef Antall and Peter Boross, that you consider  yourself spiritually the prime minister of 15 million  Hungarians? The socialist leader gave the following answer: I  would not like to make forecasts in connection with the post of  premier. However, if this were to happen, I would refrain from  such statements, which are bound to irritate our neighbors. In  my opinion, the future government should establish the best  possible relations with our neighbors. On the other hand, it  should do everything that it can to ensure the rights of the  Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders. [end recording]</p>

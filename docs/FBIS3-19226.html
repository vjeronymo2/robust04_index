"This is an important accord," said Salvatore Biondo of the  FIM [Italian Federation of Metal workers and Mechanics]  steelworkers union who reported, "It was reached with difficulty  because in play at the same time is restructurization, break-up  and privatization."    Another union spokesman, Maurizio Micolia of the UILM  [Italian Metal Workers Union], said the agreement reached with  the mediation of Labor Minister Gino Giugni, "confirms an  important philosophy for negotiations, that is, this accord will  be inherited by the private- sector buyers as a special clause  in the sales contracts."    Luigi Portioli of the FIOM [Federation of Employees and  Workers in the Metallurgical Industry] said the agreement was  "undoubtedly costly but certainly effective. We hope that Ilva  will be sold to a big national steel business capable of  assuring international cooperation."    Most of the workers whose jobs are targeted in the new plan,  10,450, will receive early retirement with benefits to be  written into an updated Labor Ministry law degree. According to  the labor side, early retirement costs will come to 1.8 billion  lire (1.07 billion dollars), to be added to expenditures for  other social safety nets for the additional jobs losses.</p>

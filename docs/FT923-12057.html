			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / People: Continuity confirms Coyne at JCB Martin Coyne (above left) is taking over as chief executive at JCB Excavators, the Staffordshire group which is one of the UK's largest privately-owned businesses. His accession is part of a reshuffle at the top of JCB, consequent upon the retirement, after 30 years in the company, of Gilbert Johnston the long-serving current chief executive. Johnston becomes deputy chairman. JCB, which places a premium on continuity, tends to fill its top jobs internally so the appointment of Coyne does not presage a sudden shake-up. Although Coyne is not interested in change for the sake of change, he notes that 'this is very much a changing world; anyone not comfortable with change is going to be in difficulties.' Indeed, his road through JCB and his reputation in the company are associated with new ventures. Now he is sponsoring internal innovation with the introduction to JCB of its version of total quality management. Earlier he had taken JCB into the mini-excavator market and forged a joint venture with Sumitomo, the Japanese group. Recently Japan has been playing a big part in his life. His son, a biotechnology graduate, is teaching English in Japan. His daughter is training to be an engineer. Coyne, 52, is a graduate of Ford; he joined JCB in 1975, the same year that Johnston became chief executive.</p>

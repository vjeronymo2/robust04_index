			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hawtal in the black A SIGNIFICANT upturn in activity enabled Hawtal Whiting, the Essex-based automotive design engineer, to move from losses of Pounds 1.38m to profits of Pounds 402,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30. Turnover at Pounds 34.5m was 26 per cent ahead of last time's Pounds 27.3m. The main contributors to the recovery were the North American and German operations. The UK, however, remained difficult and was so far showing little signs of recovery. The results also benefited from a Pounds 122,000 reduction in interest charges to Pounds 545,000. There was a swing from losses of 22.9p to earnings per share of 0.08p.</p>

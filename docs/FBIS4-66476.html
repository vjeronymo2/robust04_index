(JAIF) (Chairman, Takashi Mukaibo) held in Hiroshima  ended on 15th. During the three-day conference, it became  obvious that Japan and Europe are anxious and the United States  is critical toward commercial use of plutonium. Both Japanese  and European officials involved in nuclear power activities  countered with evidence of inadequate non-proliferation measures  in the U.S. The JAIF emphasized non-proliferation issues  through the meeting which was held at the site where the first  atomic bomb was dropped. The meeting also produced reassurance  of `cooperation' between Japan and Europe in the use of  plutonium, an issue which has become critical with the  achievement of criticality at the prototype `Monju' fast breeder  reactor.    The meeting featured a session on `Nuclear Power Generation  and Plutonium' during which the pros and cons of the commercial  use of plutonium were vigorously debated.    C. E. Paine, a senior staff member of the American Natural  Resources Protection Association stated, `It is a fact that  nuclear bombs can be produced with plutonium generated by  nuclear reactors.' He objected to the separation of plutonium  from spent nuclear fuel by saying, `If plutonium stockpiles  increase, it is difficult for nuclear inspectors to keep up with  their job.'    On the other hand, Atomic Energy Bureau' s Nuclear Fuel  Division Director Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and  Technology Agency, criticized the direct disposal of spent fuel  by the U.S. saying, `Plutonium mines will be created.'    Cogema Vice President J. L. Rikoh [phonetic] from France was  obviously displeased with the U.S. Government and said, `If the  U.S. does not like the separation of plutonium, they should stop  exporting uranium.    Belgium nuclear fuel company Cynatom [phonetic]'s Special  Advisor P. Felbeek [phonetic] indicated inadequate U.S.  non-proliferation measures saying, `Japan and Europe are not the  cause for concern. The problem lies in the United States which  lacks definite safety measures for its militarily used  plutonium.' He insisted that the plutonium gained as a result  of dismantling nuclear weapons `should be mixed with uranium  fuel and burned in reactors, from the economic perspective.'    Mitsubishi Materials Vice President Isami Akimoto said,  `there are neither facilities nor personnel left in the U.S.'  even if they wanted to burn the plutonium obtained through  dismantling of nuclear weapons. He also stated, `The  traditional policy of the U.S. for elimination of plutonium for  use in peaceful nuclear power generation has failed.'    In response to these comments, U.S. Nuclear Management  Research Insistute Director P. Rebensol [phonetic] (general  participant), who opposes the use of plutonium by Japan  proposed, It is not necessary to use plutonium if enriched  uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons is  reserved for later use. However, Tokyo Electric Power Company  Vice President Makoto Ikegame arugued, `Uranium is a buyers'  market. Therefore, it is not necessary to create reserves. It  is not even worth considering such a proposal unless there is  some specific measure planned (after the uranium researve is  used).'    STA' s Moriguchi also opposed the uranium reserve proposal  saying, `It represents short sighted thinking.' Differences in  focus between Japan, where plutonium has a place in their  long-term energy strategy, and the U.S., which is most concerned  with the negative impact of what they consider the immediate  threat of nuclear proliferation, were obvious.    Hiroshima Declaration of Non-Proliferation Treaty    On the 15th, the final day of their annual meeting, the JAIF  adopted the `Hiroshima Declaration' which appeals for the  elimination of nuclear weapons. The declaration included the  statement that `indefinite extension without any general future  perspective on the elimination of nuclear weapons is  problematic' for extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  . The declaration contrasted with the Japanese Government' s  position in support of indefinite extension of the NPT. It may  have some impact on future discussions of the NPT extension  issue.    During the press conference after the meeting, JAIF Chairman  Takashi Mukaibo said, `Our main objective is to eliminate all  nuclear weapons. We cannot agree to indefinite extension of the  NPT while those who own nuclear weapons do not eliminate them.'    Former Prime Minister Hosokawa supported indefinite  extension  of the NPT at the UN General Session in September 1993. He  obviously tried to eradicate the `groundless suspicion' of Japan  owning nuclear arms. The JAIF reiterated their demand that  nuclear weapon owning countries eliminate them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 30 May (EFE) -- This afternoon, European  Union [EU] ambassadors to Cuba met to analyze the conflict  triggered by 114 Cubans who took over the Belgian Embassy on 28  May and who are requesting political asylum.    None of the diplomats wanted to make the slightest comment  at  the end of the meeting, which lasted over two hours and took  place at the residence of Greek Ambassador Marinos Raftopoulos,  who represents the country that heads the EU.    Meanwhile, this afternoon, there seemed to be no new  developments at the Belgian ambassador's residence. The police,  which are visibly increasing the number of agents as the night  unfolds, cordoned off the diplomatic residence.    Some of those who took over the house could be seen from the  street at the windows of a house adjacent to the ambassador's  residence. Some very young children could also be seen at play  in the garden.    Official sources emphasized that the negotiations between  the  two governments continue and that the Cuban Government has  guaranteed that these people will not be punished when they  leave the embassy. They will be able to start the legal  procedures to leave the country.</p>

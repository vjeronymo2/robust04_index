			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Beijing push to mediate in Korea China's premier Li Peng, the most senior Chinese official to visit South Korea since the two countries normalised ties in 1992, is promoting China's role as diplomatic referee between North and South Korea. He is also trying to boost Chinese exports to South Korea, which enjoys a heavy trade surplus with Beijing, while resisting Seoul's demands for fewer trade and investment barriers. Mr Li agreed to a South Korean request that China, North Korea's closest and most influential ally, should help in ensuring Pyongyang abides by its recent agreement with the US to dismantle its nuclear programme. China has endorsed the US-North Korean accord as a vindication of its recent policy to promote dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang to solve the nuclear dispute. But the message brought by Mr Li to Seoul is that both Koreas need to make new concessions to increase stability on the peninsula. China expressed support for North Korean proposals to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 war with a peace treaty with the US. Beijing last week withdrew its representatives from the truce supervisory commission, to promote this policy. But Seoul is cautious about a treaty, since it could lead to US troops quitting South Korea. It worries that North Korea might try to use the treaty to isolate South Korea from its US ally, since Pyongyang insists Seoul cannot be a party to the pact because it refused to sign the armistice in 1953. But China is backing South Korea's call for renewed talks with North Korea, a proposal Pyongyang has proved reluctant to accept. China wants to stabilise the Korean peninsula, but analysts believe Beijing's long-term goal is to maintain two separate Koreas rather than see a united, Korea on its doorstep. 'There is nothing to rule out that China may try to keep North Korea as a buffer state,' Mr Stephen Linton of the Korea Studies Centre at Columbia University, says. Potential disputes could also affect the growth of close economic ties between China and South Korea. South Korea views China as a potentially huge market for its products and a cheap production base, but fears China's growing competitiveness abroad. China already sells more TV sets to the US than Korea. China views South Korea as a prime source of vital technology, but has imposed trade barriers on some Korean products and restricted investments because of the threat they pose to the development of key industries. Several Korean car companies, including Hyundai and Daewoo, want to set up plants in China, but Beijing has so far refused their requests. It is demanding Korean carmakers first set up car components factories, which would benefit the Chinese motor industry, as the price for acquiring manufacturing facilities. Moreover, Korean factories operating in China are mostly producing goods for export rather than the domestic market, because of marketing curbs. To try to persuade the Chinese to favour Korean investors, the chairmen of the country's four biggest conglomerates, Samsung, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo, are guiding Mr Li through their production facilities this week. The two countries have agreed to co-operate on several industrial projects, including aerospace, cars, high-definition television and automatic telephone switching systems. This week, they signed a memorandum of understanding on co-operation in nuclear power generation. South Korea hopes that in return for providing technology, it will gain extensive market access in China. Samsung Electronics yesterday said it plans to invest Dollars 3bn over 20 years to build a manufacturing complex in Tianjin; Kumho, South Korea's biggest tyre-maker, has agreed with Nanjing Tyre Factory a joint venture to produce tyres in Jiangsu Province. One indication the partnership may not be smooth came yesterday when the scheduled signing of a joint-venture pact on a new commercial aircraft project was postponed, owing to disagreements over the location of the aircraft factory planned by Samsung Aerospace and Aviation Industries of China. The two governments approved the joint venture on Monday.</p>

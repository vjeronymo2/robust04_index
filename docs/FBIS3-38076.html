The consensus should proceed from the  Russian president's initiative on the Bosnian settlement,"  Deputy Russian Foreign Minister and presidential envoy to the  conflict zone Vitaliy Churkin said here today.    "We do not need war and confrontation, we need a strong  foreign policy to be based on democratic consensus," said the  diplomat commenting on ITAR-TASS request at today's decision of  the Federation Council to assign additional troops to the U.N.  forces. The decision taken on request of Boris Yeltsin will give  hope to the consensus, he said.    In the words of Vitaliy Churkin, the question of expanded  Russian presence in other areas has not been raised.    "We still have to analyze the crisis around Sarajevo -- the  behavior of Russians and their Western partners, members of  NATO," said Churkin. "Our attempts to peacefully settle  problems of the crisis have not always been supported," he  noted. "We should clearly outline our stand and keep to it,"  said Churkin.</p>

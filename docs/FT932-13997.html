			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement 1993: A key to the pace of recovery / Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of UK industrial technology NEW ideas, technologies, and products are at a premium as Britain emerges from recession at long last. In a harsh and fast-changing world economic environment, it is innovation and flexibility which will largely determine who the future winners are in international markets. As the list of companies in the technological achievement section of the Queen's awards shows, there are successes to cheer about in the performance of British industry. The 25 awards range from advanced computers and software to more humble manufacturing products. They include products in the medical, farming, machinery, and chemical sectors. Among those singled out this year are large and well-known organisations like BT, Smiths Industries, ICL, Castrol, and Land Rover, as well as smaller operations like pneuPAC, Tronic Electronic Services, NextBase, and Pitman-Moore. Zeneca, ICI's bio-sciences subsidiary, is also honoured in the list, which contains fewer technology awards than in each of the previous eight years. But inspiring as the awards may be - they are only given for innovations which have achieved commercial success - there is a strong sense within much of industry, the academic and scientific world, and parts of the government that Britain lacks a strong enough technological impetus to compete effectively with rivals in the US, Japan, Europe and elsewhere. However much the top UK industrial companies spend on research and development, foreign competitors spend much more. ICI, the chemicals group, is Britain's top R&amp;D spender, but only 35th in the world. Glaxo, the successful pharmaceuticals concern, is in 49th place, Shell Transport and Trading in 50th, and General Electric at 55. Topping the list is General Motors of the US, followed by two German groups, Daimler-Benz, whose activities include vehicles, areospace, and electronics, and Siemens, the electrical and electronics manufacturer. IBM, the US computer giant, is in fourth place, and Japan's Hitachi is fifth. Altogether, the top 10 comprise four US companies - the others being Ford Motor and AT&amp;T - four from Japan (Toyota, Matsushita, and Fujitsu are also there) and the two German corporations. As the recent fortunes of some of these make clear, though, a high R&amp;D budget does not guarantee success. IBM, in particular, has been brought painfully down to earth by market pressures. In Europe, Daimler is having to struggle as competition hots up and its high German cost base is mercilessly exposed. Yet this is small comfort for British industry, however successful and thrusting some of its members may be. For it is not only in absolute terms that UK industry's R&amp;D spending lags behind. In Britain, corporate R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has fallen over the past decade. The picture is very different in the main competing countries, with rises in Germany, Japan, the US, France and Italy. The winning examples in the Queen's awards are proof that new ideas and processes can make it to the forefront of British industry. But making a success of technological breakthroughs and advances is tough. As innovation experts inside and outside industry stress, the management of technology is by no means easy. Innovation is a process that includes not just science and technology, but also management, marketing, and educational expertise. The companies that come up with the best ideas are not always the ones that reap the rewards. There are numerous examples around the world of companies which pioneered new products only to fail in the market. Often it is those which come along in second place who earn the profits; they can learn from the mistakes of the ones which went before and refine the original ideas or processes. In the UK, many executives bemoan the lack of priority given to industry both by the government and the general public. This is certainly in strong contrast to, say, Germany, where industry has a weight and influence superior to that in Britain and where quality of product and workmanship is highly prized, as are educational and training qualifications. Such differences cannot be narrowed rapidly, at least not significantly. But the Confederation of British Industry and Department of Trade and Industry are both concerned to ensure that the flame of innovation burns more brightly in the UK. Thus they have jointly embarked on a programme aimed at enhancing the awareness of the need for innovation within industry. The need is certainly there. The world competitiveness scoreboard compiled by IMD, the Lausanne business school, and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, puts the UK only in 13th place, behind not only such industrial powers as Japan, Germany and the US, but also smaller countries like Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, and Belgium; the UK is ahead of France and Italy, however. A technological ranking of the top 25 world companies, based on US patenting data and published by Business Week last year, included none from the UK. League tables certainly do not tell the whole story. But they provide enough evidence to demonstrate that action is required to encourage UK companies to become more innovative. The question is: how can they become so? A study by the DTI and CBI found that only one in 10 of the companies it surveyed could be called truly innovative; three in 10 had grasped some aspects of the innovation process, while half showed 'elements of good performance'. The answer does not just lie in spending money. Attitudes and organisation are just as important. Companies which are prepared to open themselves to new ideas - from their own staff or from outside - to communicate effectively, and to enter into alliances and exchanges of ideas with other firms have a better chance of success than those which remain closed to new influences. Often, it is marketing or management failures rather than any lack of technological skills which doom products to failure in the market. This certainly applies to individual inventors or small companies, who find it difficult to push their ideas through the tangle of regulatory, financial, and market requirements to the end user. Most inventions do not succeed, but a number of those which fail could probably be made to succeed, at least partly, with the right sort of help at an early stage. For companies to be able to exploit new ideas effectively, a stable economic environment is required. This has been lacking in recent years, as the UK has gone from boom to recession and back to slow recovery. Successful innovation also demands a longer term approach than is common in much of British industry, where dividend payments tend to be higher than abroad. Yet the ending of recession at last gives companies the chance to shake off the survival culture with which many have become fixated in recent years. With a more favourable economic climate and a louder blowing of the innovation trumpet by those concerned with the health of industry, Britain's technological future could be much brighter. But technology on its own is not enough. As the Queen's awards recognise, the practical and commercial elements are vital to success.</p>

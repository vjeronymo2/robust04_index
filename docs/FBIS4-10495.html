			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain  Goldenberg reiterated that Eduardo Ponce, the Peruvian  ambassador in Quito, will continue in his post as the Peruvian  Government sees no reason to replace him. Moreover, he asserted  that there is no problem with the Ecuadoran Government. The  minister stated: "The Peruvian ambassador in Quito does not need  to be confirmed in his post. Ambassadors are appointed, and  cannot be confirmed in their posts. Ponce therefore continues to  be Peruvian ambassador to Ecuador until the Peruvian Government  decides otherwise."    Goldenberg said that the relationship between the two  countries is satisfactory. "Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego  Paredes, with whom I met in Washington recently where we both  voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS secretary  general, can himself tell you that."    Regarding Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's visit,  Goldenberg explained that it is to return the visit he paid to  Buenos Aires last December.    Among the subjects on the agenda, he said, are the  arrangements for President Carlos Saul Menem's upcoming visit.    Moreover, he announced that a group of Peruvian Government  officials who belong to the Commission for the Promotion of  Private Investment (Copri) will shortly travel to Buenos Aires.  He said that "Argentine businessmen want to participate in the  privatization process," and then mentioned that this will be  another issue he will discuss with Di Tella.</p>

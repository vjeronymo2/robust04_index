			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / GPA sets out share issue details GPA Group yesterday unveiled its plans for a convertible preference share issue to raise between Dollars 300m (Pounds 152m) and Dollars 350m at a meeting of its key institutional shareholders at its headquarters in Shannon, the Irish Republic. Although the conversion price is still to be agreed next week, shareholders were told that it will be less than Dollars 12 a share. The yield on the new shares at the issue price is expected to be 7 1/2 per cent, which is significantly higher than the yield on the current shares. GPA said a group of 15 of its biggest shareholders have agreed to underwrite the planned share issue. Since GPA's aborted flotation, when it tried to raise Dollars 800m by offering shares at a price of Dollars 20, most of its shareholders have accepted that the value of their shares have fallen by at least Dollars 5 to Dollars 15. The shares are currently being quoted on the Dublin grey market at between Dollars 6 to Dollars 8, although no deals have taken place. Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman, said: 'We tabled outline plans for an equity placing primarily directed at our existing shareholders. We are considering the views of our major shareholders and expect to advance the matter further with them over the next few weeks.' Nomura International, global co-ordinator to the aborted flotation in June, and Davy Stockbrokers in the Irish Republic, are advising the company on the new share issue. Aer Lingus and Air Canada, which control 18 per cent of the group's shares, told GPA's management that they are likely to take part in the convertible preference share issue. They emphatically rejected reports that their own financial problems ruled out their participation in any new share issue. Their involvement could be crucial to the success of the share issue as many of the group's institutional shareholders said they would only participate if all the group's shareholders took part. GPA yesterday said that the injection of fresh equity was part of an overall recovery programme which includes two more asset-backed securitised issues and the renegotiation of its aircraft acquisition programme. The group has placed Dollars 12bn of aircraft orders for the rest of the decade.</p>

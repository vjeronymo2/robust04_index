			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FINDS 48% RISE IN DROPOUTS SINCE 1986;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE GLENDALE DISTRICT SAYS THE INCREASE FROM 12.9% TO 19.1% MAKES  THINGS APPEAR WORSE THAN THEY ARE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE TRANSIENCY INTO  ACCOUNT.  </P> <P> Glendale school officials said a state report issued this week showing the  district's high school dropout rate had jumped 48% in three years made things  appear worse than they actually are.  </P> <P> State figures released Monday showed that 19.1% of the Glendale Unified School  District's class of 1989 dropped out of school, compared with 13.1% of the  class of 1988 and 12.9% of the class of 1986. Despite the increase, last year's  rate measured below the statewide average of 20.4%. The Los Angeles Unified  School District improved its rate from 42.7% in 1986 to about 35% last year.  </P> <P> Glendale's 19.1% dropout rate represents about 377 students, 123 more dropouts  than in 1986. During the same period, district enrollment grew from nearly  20,000 to 23,130.  </P> <P> About 200 of the 377 dropouts in last year's class actually dropped out. The  remaining 177 or so left the district and never had their records requested by  another district or notified officials about where they were going, he said.  </P> <P> Even though the district provided the data used by the state, the figures do  not accurately reflect the number of students dropping out of Glendale schools,  said Gary Hess, the district's director of student services.  </P> <P> Hess, who said he was "very surprised" by the figures, is reviewing each high  school's records.  </P> <P> "We will admit we have 9.6% of that graduating class in 1989 who left before  they were 18, left without a high school diploma or left without passing the  California proficiency exam," Hess said.  </P> <P> "All the state of California uses the same criteria, so I have to accept that  our dropout rate has increased 48% over the last three years," he added. "But  the penalty is the image. And we maintain that the image isn't as bad as it  appears."  </P> <P> The state measures the dropout rate by calculating how many students entered  the 10th grade and left high school without a diploma or its equivalent by the  end of the 12th grade. A school has 45 days to track a student who leaves its  campus. If it cannot, the youth is recorded as a dropout -- even if the student  enrolled elsewhere and did not notify or request grades and other records from  the district he or she left, Hess said.  </P> <P> Because it is unlikely that the new school would not request the student's  records, a lack of notification is interpreted to mean that a student has  dropped out, state officials said.  </P> <P> "It is not necessarily the fault of a school that they have a high dropout rate  if things like transiency are the cause of it," said Susie Lange, a spokeswoman  for the state Department of Education. "They have no control if a kid is yanked  out of school. But if a student's records weren't requested, there's a good  chance they dropped out. It's important to be accurate about where these kids  are."  </P> <P> Glendale officials said the number of students moving in and out of Glendale  each year is rising -- about 40% of the district's 24,000 students last year  moved into and left the city -- and that group is difficult to track.  </P> <P> Transiency rates have risen in part because of the growing number of new  apartments in Glendale, which has allowed more mobility, Hess said. There were  nearly 35,800 apartments and condominium units in 1986; today, there are nearly  42,600, said Keith Palmer, a senior planner for the city.  </P> <P> In addition, some youths are foreign students who return to their countries,  where their schools do not request records or notify the district, Hess said.  </P> <P> "With students moving around at such a high rate, it's not uncommon that their  records aren't requested," said Vic Pallos, a district spokesman. "If a student  is a no-show, there is an attempt to follow up by contacting the last known  address or phone number. If no student is there and no indication is given of  the whereabouts of the family, there's not much we can do."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified schools also have high transiency rates -- as much as 70%  -- that make it difficult to track students.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of tracking," said Pete Martinez, coordinator of the Los Angeles  district's dropout prevention office. "We're constantly advising our people to  follow the paper trail. But we don't dispel the validity of the state's  figures. It's a benchmark we use that tells us we're losing youngsters."  </P> <P> Hess said the Glendale district will attempt next year to monitor the rate more  closely by requesting specific information about where students are moving and  the new schools they will attend. It also will continue a prevention program  that locates dropouts who have remained in the Glendale area and encourages  them to return to school, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: REDS' THROW-AWAY WOUND UP A KEEPER  </P> <P> Trading in baseball is almost a lost art. But even in its heyday, it used to be  axiomatic that the best trades are often the ones you never make.  </P> <P> This is because the worst ones are so highly visible. And humiliating. They  haunt the general manager for the rest of his baseball life.  </P> <P> The worst trade in the history of the major leagues is a matter of subjective  evaluation, but in the hunt has to be the dealing of Frank Robinson to the  Baltimore Orioles for right-handed pitcher Milt Pappas. A baseball rule of  thumb is, never trade a pitcher unless you get plenty.  </P> <P> The Orioles got plenty. Robinson not only became one of only 13 players in the  modern history of the game to win the triple crown (batting average, home runs,  runs batted in), but he was the catalyst in leading Baltimore to a succession  of pennants, World Series victories and chronic contending position. Robinson  made the Hall of Fame. Pappas went 46-47.  </P> <P> St. Louis appeared to be violating the never-trade-a-pitcher principle when  they sent right-hander Ernie Broglio to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Lou  Brock. Broglio was an 18-game winner the year before. But he went 14-31 for his  career at Chicago and was out of the game in three years. Brock went on to the  Hall of Fame, set the major league stolen base record and helped the Cardinals  to several World Series, where he usually batted .400 and set stolen base  records.  </P> <P> Those trades were bad. But how about trading Grover Cleveland Alexander in his  prime for -- are you ready? -- Pickles Dillhoefer?! Alex had only won 30 games  that year and was to win 373. The immortal Pickles, a catcher, went on to bat  .123, .091 and .213 in his next three seasons.  </P> <P> It's a risky business. It used to be the only way a player could travel from  one club to another. Player movement today is dictated by the player. He goes  when he wants, where he wants, and he gets the money, not the seller, the club  owner.  </P> <P> A general manager, however, still has to be nervous approaching a bargaining  session. Dennis Eckersley went to Oakland for three minor league players three  years ago -- the immortal David Wilder, Brian Guinn and Mark Leonette.  Philadelphia got Steve Carlton (and two pennants) for Rick Wise.  </P> <P> The "trade that will help both clubs" exists only in the team's publicity  handout. The trade that helps neither club is the more likely .  </P> <P> The "throw-ins," i.e., players considered of no importance but put in to  sweeten the attraction, and the "player to be named later" have sometimes  enjoyed a significant role. Sid Bream, an afterthought in the deal that sent  Bill Madlock from Pittsburgh to the Dodgers, is enjoying productive years with  the Pirates.  </P> <P> So, when Dodger General Manager Fred Claire approached the negotiating table  with the Cincinnati Reds last summer, he knew he had to keep one hand on his  wallet and the other on a Bible. The worst thing you can do is make a mistake  trading with a team not only in your league but in your division -- the team  you have to beat. He knew what he needed. He wanted another bat in the lineup  -- Kal Daniels, a natural .300 hitter with good power, was perfect for his  purposes. He knew what Cincinnati needed -- a pitcher.  </P> <P> Claire offered Tim Leary, a right-hander of great promise who had one 17-game  season with the Dodgers but had struggled to achieve consistency much of his  career.  </P> <P> The Reds countered they would need something else. The Dodgers threw in Mariano  Duncan, a sometimes brilliant but erratic shortstop who had trouble hitting the  major league curveball. When Cincinnati acquiesced, Claire pressed his luck. He  wondered whether he shouldn't have a throw-in of his own. He got Lenny Harris,  a good-enough ballplayer but one who found it so difficult to find a spot to  break in the lineup that he took to wearing four gloves. To stay in the big  leagues, he found he had to play wherever a spot opened up, either through  injury or poor play on the part of the incumbent.  </P> <P> It's a tough way to launch a career, but Harris had the perfect temperament for  it -- uncomplaining, cheerful. A utility infielder has to be like a butler.  Ready to serve wherever he's needed.  </P> <P> The Dodgers were delighted. On a team where cheerful acceptance is not in  abundance, Harris was a breath of fresh air. Or at least, fresh attitude.  </P> <P> Not since Jim Gilliam, have the Dodgers had a player who could roam between the  infield and outfield and play either position with equal skill and enthusiasm.  </P> <P> "He's an outstanding young man," insists his manager, Tommy Lasorda. "He's a  Dodger! I platoon him with Mike Sharperson, that's OK. I need him at second  base, that's OK. We need him in the outfield? Lenny runs out there. When Fred  Claire called me and said, 'We have a chance to get Lenny Harris,' I said, 'Get  him!' I remember one game against us, he went after a foul ball and he slammed  clear into the fence. But he caught it."  </P> <P> Daniels is hitting a predictable -- and satisfactory -- .290 with 19 home runs  and 62 runs batted in. Tim Leary, after a disappointing season, was traded to  the New York Yankees, with whom he is having a mediocre year.  </P> <P> But the throw-ins are prospering. Duncan is batting a rarefied .327, almost 100  points above his lifetime average.  </P> <P> And Harris is hitting a robust .296 after hovering around .300 most of the  year.  </P> <P> Harris is even content with his stand-in role. "I try to keep myself ready,  keep myself concentrated. I play where I'm needed. If they need a leadoff man,  I hit leadoff. When I knew they wanted me to lead off, I went to Brett Butler  (of San Francisco) and asked him for some pointers on how to play it. He told  me what you need is patience."  </P> <P> Harris has that. He is patient, low profile. On a recent evening, he was found  patiently standing at the fence signing baseballs and gloves for a line of  young fans.  </P> <P> He won't even bad-mouth a system that has scarcely let him get a full season  under his belt to learn his trade the only place you can -- on the field. "Oh,"  he says, "Pete (Rose) played me whenever he could, whenever he had a place for  me. I couldn't complain."  </P> <P> He could have. He just didn't.  </P> <P> A baseball trade is like any other business merger. You have to wait a while  for the bottom line. So far, Lenny Harris has made the Dodgers look as if  they've made the best deal since Wally Moon for Gino Cimoli. Or maybe since  Grover Alexander for Pickles Dillhoefer.  </P></p>

President Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu and  veteran economist Kim Tal-hyon have been appointed to jointly  manage the group dealing with South Korean Affairs, the official  said.    The team set up to take charge of relations with the U.S. is  headed jointly by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, both  secretaries of the Workers Party, he said.    "What laid behind the formation of these two special task  forces seemed to be North Korea's intention to break the logjam  in its relations with the U.S. and South Korea this year,  especially as it marks the 20th anniversary of the designation  of Kim Chong-il, son of President Kim Il-song, as his father's  successor," said the official, who spoke on condition of  anonymity.    North Korea's economy is reportedly in crisis and  Pyongyang's  refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities has  further aroused suspicion that it is secretly developing nuclear  weapons. The U.S. has put pressure on North Korea to accept  international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities  and clear up doubts about its nuclear intentions. The U.S. and  North Korea reportedly made progress last week in resolving the  dispute.    Among the North Korean officials named to head the key new  task forces, Kim Yong-chu, comanager of the South Korean affairs  team, made a sudden political comeback last month when named  vice president as part of a top-level personnel shakeup.    Kim Tal-hyon, dropped from the post of vice premier and  chairman of the State Planning Commission in the same reshuffle,  has reportedly been relegated to the post of manager of a  chemical factory in Hamhung, North Hamkyong Province.    But the South Korean official said that move appeared to be  purely a symbolic gesture and that Kim Tal-hyon will soon take  up a high-profile job as a major economic policymaker.    A North Korean source at the border village of Panmunjom  said  last month that Kim's appointment as a manager of the chemical  factory did not mean his "downgrading to an idle job."</p>

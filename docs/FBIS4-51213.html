			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special dispatch by staff reporter Chiang Chao-yung (5592 </F> 0340 0516): "Sichuan Party Secretary Xie Shijie Says Foreign  Investors in Sichuan Must Be Allowed To Make Profits"]    [Text] Chengdu, 29 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- While meeting with  Hong Kong and Macao reporters here today, Xie Shijie, secretary  of the Sichuan CPC Committee, said: Sichuan must seize the  opportunity to open up wider to the outside world and accelerate  its development. While urging cadres at all localities to  cooperate with foreign investors, he told them not to be too  calculating. They should allow foreign investors to make a  profit and increase investment returns.    Secretary Xie said: If you want to find a latent market with  a population of 110 million in the world today, besides Sichuan,  there is no other choice. This is the reason large overseas  groups have focused their attention on Sichuan. Sichuan must  seize this golden opportunity and change its ideological  concepts. Some localities always think too much about their own  interests, leaving little for foreign investors. This will make  it difficult for us to attain the goal of attracting foreign  investors.    Xie stated: Emancipation of mind is substantial and opening  up wider is specific.    There were no transactions in the auction sales of state  enterprises in Hong Kong. Some people want to cast off their  burdens. If foreign investors cannot make any profit, they  prefer running new enterprises to buying old ones. We will  continue to sell enterprises this year, turn fixed assets into  movable ones, and invest money in new fields.    A reporter asked about the race-course and gambling city in  Wenjiang county, which were banned. Xie Shijie explained that  there is no gambling city in Wenjiang. Instead, there is a  "lucky city," with a few slot machines. A handful of people  there want to develop gambling. But state regulations do not  allow unplanned development of gambling. If it has started, it  should be improved under leadership and in an organized way. It  should be well under control and be run well. Efforts are being  made in this regard, applications are submitted to relevant  state departments, and measures are adopted to that they will  function well. There is now a motorcycle race in Wenjiang, and  it will not affect Taiwan investment there. Except Wuhan,  Wenjiang has attracted the largest amount of Taiwan investment.  The state will soon approve a state- level investment zone in  Wenjiang for Taiwan investors.    Because of inflation, Xie Shijie also disclosed, some 10 to  15 percent of the university and college students have financial  difficulties. The Mianyang Changhong Television Factory has  donated 10 million yuan and Hong Kong's Jialing Company has  donated 4 million yuan to help students resolve their financial  difficulties.    Xie also disclosed that Thailand's Bank of Bangkok and  Singapore's Union Bank have set up offices in Chengdu.</p>

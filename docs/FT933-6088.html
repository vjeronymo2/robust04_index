			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Heathrow Express project Airport operator BAA is to use the New Engineering Contract (NEC) for the main tunnel for the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express scheme. This is believed to represent the biggest UK civil engineering project to adopt the new form of contract. The New Engineering Contract (NEC) is a standard form of contract suitable for use in the design and construction (including erection) of new works involving any, or all, of the building disciplines. BAA is a leading proponent of the NEC having already used this form of contract on a number of successfully completed projects at Heathrow and Southampton airports. The contract for a new terminal and car park at Southampton will be the first UK building contract to use the NEC. Explaining the benefits of the new form of contract, BAA's project director, David H. Williams said 'We see the radical and less adversarial approach which is required to administer this contract as improving the pre-planning productivity and project performance generally. The use of the NEC is one of a number of initiatives currently being embraced by BAA as part of a continuous improvement process for its Pounds 300m a year capital investment programme.</p>

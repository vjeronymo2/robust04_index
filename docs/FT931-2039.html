			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash boost for Portuguese farms PORTUGAL'S AGRICULTURE ministry has announced a Esc220bn (Pounds 975m) investment plan to promote and improve Portuguese food products to enable farmers to compete with their European Community partners, reports Reuter from Lisbon. The five-year programme includes Esc126bn of direct investment by the government. Portuguese farmers, hit by the worst drought this century, have protested at what they say are cheap imports. The plan includes a risk capital fund to help existing and new companies and the creation of credit lines at discount interest rates for producers of fruit and vegetables, rice and meat. Other planned measures are a Esc5bn fund for agricultural and food products promotion and investment in processing and distribution companies. The promotion and quality control of food products will be subsidised and new legislation will be introduced on the management of farm co-operatives.</p>

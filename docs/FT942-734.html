			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Smith New Court Edwin Marks, 68, a US investment banker, has resigned as a non-executive director of Smith New Court, the UK investment banking group which recently reported more than doubled profits. Marks, president of CMCO (formerly Carl Marks &amp; Co), joined the board in March 1988 when his firm merged its US securities trading, clearing and custodial business with Smith New Court. CMCO used to be the second biggest investor in Smith New Court, after the Rothschild group. However, over the past year it has reduced its stake from 8.05 per cent to 4.15 per cent. Meanwhile, the group has appointed five new executive directors thereby increasing the size of the board to 39, including six non-executives. Graham Meek, 47, a former partner in Wood Mackenzie who joined Smith New Court in May 1991, has joined the board along with Michael Davids, 40, deputy managing director of UK agency; Jun Miyazaki, 43, head of operations in Tokyo; David Smith, 44, who joined the firm as a market maker in 1972; and Jeremy Tulk-Hart, 47, who runs Smith New Court's syndication desk.</p>

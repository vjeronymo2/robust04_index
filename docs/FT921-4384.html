			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses gain ground after dull start SENIOR bourses overcame a dull start, while smaller markets were mixed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT recovered from an early setback, achieving its turnround on gains in a few blue chips, including Volkswagen, Daimler and Siemens. The DAX index closed 4.30 higher at 1,750.25 after an intraday low of 1,739.36 and a fall of 1.18 to 710.55 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume eased from DM5.6bn to DM5bn. Carmakers have performed well since mid-February, on good industry figures and the rising dollar. Daimler rose another DM5.50 yesterday to DM770.50, and VW by DM2.60 to DM375.50. Some analysts said Siemens was looking strong technically. The shares rose DM6.10 to DM696.10 yesterday but the real breakthrough was on February 21 when it cleared DM675, breaking out of a medium-term chart downtrend. Siemens was also in demand ahead of its dividend which is due to be paid this week. However, investors waiting for the big three chemicals may have to be patient: BASF's directors are due to decide whether to keep or cut the DM13 dividend today, but the official announcement is not expected before March 19. PARIS was surprisingly firm, as special situations dominated in the absence of one strong theme. The CAC-40 index rose 9.37 to 1,976.28 in moderate turnover of just over FFr2bn. Euro Disney added FFr1.50 to FFr161.50, just below its all-time high of FFr162, as the company's publicity machine went into top speed ahead of the theme park's opening in April. The stock is being bought by index-linked funds ahead of its inclusion in the CAC-40 index on March 19. Elf recovered from last week's weakness, adding FFr4.80 to FFr369.90. After the close, the government priced its sale of 2.3 per cent in Elf at FFr360 a share, in line with expectations. Friday's court ruling that Exor's voting rights in Perrier must be frozen for two years lifted the stock in the mineral water company by FFr37 to FFr1,605. Dealers said that the court's decision gave Nestle a better chance in the takeover battle for Perrier. LVMH, the luxury goods and drinks company linked with the brewer, Guinness, rose FFr60 to FFr4,745 in decent volume of 16,760 shares. There was speculation that the Salomon chairman Mr Warren Buffett, rumoured to be building a stake in Guinness, might also be attracted to LVMH. MILAN saw selling of Sip and weakness in Generali also weighed on the market. The Comit index fell 2.11 to 512.76 in turnover estimated at L85bn after Friday's L93bn. Sip fell L23.50 or 1.7 per cent to L1,331.50 with a heavy 3m shares traded as the market recognised that Sip would have to face more competition following last week's ruling against it by Italy's anti-trust authorities. Industrials resisted the downtrend, with Pirelli gaining L36 or 3.3 per cent to L1,115 and Montedison putting on L20 to L1,393. Benetton added L121 to L12,621. Consob yesterday re-admitted Bonifiche Siele, Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura (BNA), and Interbanca after a controversy over ownership was cleared up. BNA fell to L5,380 from L5,600 on February 25. AMSTERDAM eased ahead of this week's batch of 1991 results. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.1 to 127.9 in light turnover of Fl 414.2m. DSM added Fl 4.40 after announcing better-than-expected 1991 net profits. But the stock ended just 20 cents up at Fl 112.50 in the day's heaviest trading as investors took heed of the company's cautious comments. The brewer Grolsch, expected to release its 1991 results tomorrow, gained Fl 2.50 to Fl 198.50 after Heineken's pleasing results last week. STOCKHOLM focused on SCA which sold its power subsidiary, Bakab, for SKr11.45bn. SCA's B closed SKr7 higher at SKr114; B shares in its fellow forestry group, Modo, jumped SKr15 to SKr240 on rumours that SCA will use the sale proceeds to bid for it. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.1 to 989.3, a new 1992 high, in volume of SKr405m after SKr533m. LISBON built on last week's 6.7 per cent gain, the BTA index closing up 31.2 at 2,072.3. Investors have been encouraged by pleasing provisional 1991 results. BRUSSELS was broadly lower but the holding company, SGB, bucked the trend. The Bel-20 Index fell 13.18 or 1.1 per cent to 1,201.84. SGB rose BFr15 to BFr2,205 while its non-ferrous metals and mining unit, ACEC-Union Miniere, rose BFr25 to BFr2,450. COPENHAGEN saw DDL, part-owner of SAS, rise another DKr190 to DKr3,020 on SAS's planned sale of its stake in the Inter-Continental hotels chain. The CSE index rose 0.91 to 344.92. VIENNA tumbled to its lowest level in nearly four weeks, the ATX index dropping 22.62, or 2.1 per cent to 1,039.45. Last week's arrest of an Austrian banker in the US on money-laundering charges weighed on the market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm    2 pm     3 pm     close 1159.16  1159.99  1161.75  1162.41  1163.01 1163.72  1164.63  1165.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1165.65    Day's Low  1159.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 6      Mar 5     Mar 4    Mar 3     Mar 2 1162.10   1169.56  1176.33   1176.44   1169.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

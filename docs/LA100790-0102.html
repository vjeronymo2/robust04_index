			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON IS DOING BETTER BUT STILL LOSES TO LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton continued its five-week string of futility, losing to  Nevada Las Vegas, 29-10, Saturday night before 13,791 in the Silver Bowl.  </P> <P> The Titans, 1-5 overall and 0-2 in the Big West Conference, committed only one  turnover Saturday night as opposed to 16 in the last three games.  </P> <P> But Fullerton's turnover was crucial, and the Titans made two other mistakes on  punt plays that helped the Rebels (3-3, 2-1) score a touchdown and a field goal  in the first half.  </P> <P> Trailing, 23-10, in the fourth quarter, Fullerton drove from the Rebel 44-yard  line to the 20, where quarterback Paul Schulte passed over the middle to  Richard Harrison. Harrison appeared headed for the end zone but ran into a  teammate, lineman Tim Drevno, and fell at the four.  </P> <P> On the next play, Schulte fumbled the snap -- the Titan quarterback lost two  fumbles on snaps inside the Fresno State 12-yard line in last week's 38-3 loss  -- and Jody Reinoehl recovered for the Rebels with 9:56 to play. Fullerton was  not able to mount a scoring threat the rest of the way.  </P> <P> In the first half, Titan punter Phil Nevin attempted a fake but was sacked by  Raymond Walters at the Rebel 20. Two plays later, Hunkie Cooper scored on an  18-yard run for a 14-3 Las Vegas lead.  </P> <P> On Fullerton's next possession, Nevin, in punt formation, bobbled a low snap  and was tackled by Walters at the UNLV 19, resulting in Todd Amrein's 39-yard  field goal and a 17-3 lead.  </P> <P> The Rebels drove 80 yards in 15 plays, Derek Black scoring on a one-yard run,  to take a 23-3 lead late in the second quarter, but Fullerton cut it to 23-10  on Schulte's five-yard touchdown pass to J.J. Celestine with 5:26 left in the  third quarter.  </P></p>

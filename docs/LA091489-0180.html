			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORLD PREMIERE OF NEIL SIMON'S 'JAKE'S WOMEN' SET IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The Old Globe Theatre will present "Jake's Women," its second world premiere of  a Neil Simon play in two years, March 8 to April 15. Ron Link, known in Los  Angeles for his kinetic stagings of "Bouncers" and "Stand-Up Tragedy," will  direct.  </P> <P> The Simon play is one of six productions announced for the winter/spring season  at the Old Globe.  </P> <P> Preceding "Jake's Women" on the main stage Jan. 11 to Feb. 18 will be Chekhov's  "Uncle Vanya," directed by Jack O'Brien, the Old Globe's artistic director.  Following "Jake's Women" will be the West Coast premiere of Lee Blessing's  "Cobb," about baseball great Ty Cobb, tentatively slated for May 3 to June 10.  A co-production with the Yale Repertory Theatre, "Cobb" will be directed by  Yale's Lloyd Richards.  </P> <P> The season at the 225-seat Cassius Carter Centre Stage will open Jan. 6 with  Roberto M. Cossa's "The Granny," a black comedy about a family in depressed  Argentina, playing through Feb. 18. It went through a workshop earlier this  year in the Latino Play Discovery Series, a project of the Old Globe's Teatro  Meta.  </P> <P> The West Coast premiere of Mark Lee's "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," about two  arrogant journalists in an African region torn with violence, will be March 3  to April 15 on the smaller stage. It will be followed by Lanie Robertson's  "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," April 28 to June 10. This show, about  singer Billie Holiday, was seen in 1987 at the Hollywood Playhouse.  </P> <P> Simon's "Jake's Women" continues the semi-autobiographical tradition of the  playwright's "Chapter 2" and the trilogy of "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi  Blues" and "Broadway Bound" with the story of a middle-aged writer and six of  the most important women in his life -- his analyst, his sister, his daughter,  his wife, his ex-wife and a friend. It was supposed to be Simon's first world  premiere at the Old Globe last year, but when the show wasn't ready, Simon's  farce "Rumors" was substituted. "Rumors" went from San Diego to Broadway.  </P></p>

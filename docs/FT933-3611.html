			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Investment in airline not aid Sir, You quote the chairman of British Airways ('BA presses for curb on European subsidies', September 10) as saying that 'some Dollars 3bn have been pumped into three European airlines in the last three years' and, further on, Paul Betts writes that these Dollars 3bn are 'state support to Air France, Sabena and Iberia'. This is not true. Air France has not received any 'state aid' in the past years. In 1991 we launched a FFr2bn rights issue and the French state, our main shareholder, subscribed as any private shareholder would have done to help finance major investment. The European Commission screened this rights issue and publicly concluded, in July 1992, that it was not state aid. Francois Eldin, vice-president, corporate communications, Groupe Air France, 1 Square Max Hyams, Paris, France</p>

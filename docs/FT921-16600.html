			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News: Harsh winter for Canada's forestry industry - FCC's shift in strategy as it adjusts to the recession Discomfort has turned to agony in Canada's embattled forestry industry. Instead of the gradual recovery which pulp, paper and timber producers were hoping for in late 1991, many companies are girding themselves for the heaviest losses of the year in the fourth quarter. The sombre reality is sinking in that this pillar of the Canadian economy not only faces the rigours of an unexpectedly deep recession, but must also move more quickly to adjust to some severe structural handicaps. Canada's declining competitiveness in commodity pulp and newsprint grades, its distance from supplies of paper for recycling, high labour costs and strict environmental laws are among the factors forcing changes well beyond a simple tightening of corporate belts. Among the companies taking the most drastic action is Fletcher Challenge Canada (FCC), 72 per cent owned by New Zealand's biggest company. Vancouver-based FCC is cutting its product range, moving away from low-margin commodity grades and wood products, to more specialised, value-added businesses. It is selling some assets and seeking foreign partners - preferably customers - for others. Last, but not least, it is putting the squeeze on costs. The shift in strategy will cut FCC's virgin newsprint capacity to 446,000 tonnes in 1992, less than half its 1989 output. Similarly, its equity share of market pulp will slide from 931,000 tonnes to 585,000 tonnes. On the other hand, it expects to add almost 300,000 tonnes of capacity in recycled and special-grade newsprint, as well as expand a pioneering  - and profitable - venture at its Elk Falls mill on Vancouver Island which makes pulp from sawdust. A common thread running through the shake-up is a profound disquiet with the business environment in Canada. While FCC will remain one of western Canada's biggest forestry companies, its centre of gravity is moving unmistakably southward. Mr Doug Whitehead, FCC's chief operating officer, notes that the government of British Columbia, which owns the province's forests, has made no fewer than 23 changes in tree-cutting rules in the past five years. On the other side of the country, Quebec's eagerness to increase local ownership helped persuade FCC to sell its 45 per cent stake in Donohue St Felicien, which runs a softwood pulp mill and four sawmills. By contrast, FCC is broadening its business south of the border. It is already the biggest newsprint supplier to California, and is negotiating a partnership to build a recycled newsprint plant in the US. FCC has also bought a 50 per cent stake in a corrugated packaging company in Washington state. The forestry business was Fletcher Challenge's first big investment in North America. The New Zealand company bought Crown Forest Industries and 72 per cent of British Columbia Forest Products in quick succession in the mid-1980s. The two companies are managed as one, but, as a legal entity, FCC consists only of the former BCFP. Crown Forest is held through the New Zealand parent. The combined operations contribute almost two thirds of Fletcher Challenge's pulp and paper revenues, which in turn made up 28 per cent of its total 1990 turnover. The presence in the US and Canada has had another important benefit in helping to broaden its access to capital. Last year alone, Fletcher Challenge raised over USDollars 600m in debt from US and Canadian financial institutions. About 18 per cent of its voting equity is now held in North America. But the operating performance of the North American forestry interests has become a serious concern. FCC - the former BCFP alone - lost CDollars 43.5m in the first nine months of the year. The loss for the year as a whole is likely to be well over CDollars 60m. The company declines to disclose losses inclusive of operations of the former Crown Forest. Singling out Canadian pulp, paper and wood products as the biggest drain on the parent's earnings, Mr Hugh Fletcher, the New Zealand group's chief executive, said last summer 'the decline in competitiveness and in product prices has been much more severe than we envisaged. We need fundamental change of both the macro settings and our overall involvement'. FCC is moving on several fronts. It has sold or closed several sawmills as well as plywood and panel factories in British Columbia. The sale of its interest in Quebec's Donohue St Felicien in late December raised CDollars 85m (USDollars 73.9m)in cash plus a CDollars 35m promissory note. It is seeking a buyer for up to half the flagship Crofton complex on Vancouver Island, which is one of North America's biggest newsprint and kraft pulp mills. Similarly, FCC is talking to a Japanese customer about taking a stake in - or buying outright - two wood-products plants in the British Columbia interior. A CDollars 300m modernisation at Crofton, now in its final stages, paves the way for production of a wider variety of special pulps blended from hemlock, fir and cedar chips. FCC claims the mill will be among the cleanest in the world. One consolation for FCC is that it is not alone in its plight. Mr Ross Hay-Roe, analyst at Research Capital in Vancouver, expects almost all Canada's leading forestry companies to report higher fourth quarter losses. Newsprint prices have continued to slide. North American pulp producers raised their prices on December 1, but this will not compensate for lower returns in October and November. One of the few bright spots in recent weeks has been a sudden drop in the Canadian dollar, which has helped push up the share prices of most Canadian forestry companies. Mr Whitehead's predictions include a spate of mergers and takeovers, the closure of several more newsprint machines and mounting pressure on trade unions and governments to ease the industry's weighty cost and regulatory burden. FCC has lagged behind its rivals in persuading customers to become equity partners in newsprint and pulp mills. But in other respects, Mr Whitehead is confident the company is 'at least a year ahead of everyone else' in adjusting to a climate which is turning out to be as harsh as a Canadian winter. DSF owns a low-cost bleached softwood kraft pulp mill, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, north of Quebec City. It also operates four sawmills in Quebec. Fletcher Challenge's sale of its interest in DSF is part of a wider disposal of assets aimed a shifting the main focus of the company's North American forestry operations from Canada to the US and reducing its exposure to low margin lumber. Fletcher considered buying Donohue's interest in DSF, whose pulp mill is one of the most efficient in Canada. But Mr Whitehead said the Quebec government was keen to keep control of the company in Quebec hands.</p>

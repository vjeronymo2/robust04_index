Nazarbayev.    According to State Counselor K. Suleymenov, there are fewer  burglars, thiefs, and muggers in the republic now, but  more...call girls and racketeers. Crime has become an economy  and a business. Passive work on the part of the internal affairs  organs, the state counselor believes, is the main reason why  organized forms of crime have started to flourish in the  republic. "Unfortunately, gangs have established a strong  foothold in our country."    In view of this Kazakhstan's president signed a decree on  stepping up the fight against crime. It provides for the  creation of special investigative groups comprising staffers  from the Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Committee  which will fight organized crime. Moreover, the president  adopted a decision to set up a tax militia. Henceforth in  Kazakhstan, instead of the notorious LTP's [occupational therapy  rehabilitation centers], LPU's -- preventive treatment  establishments -- will come into operation under the Ministry of  Health. Moreover, in view of the decline of moral standards, a  morals militia will come into being. Among other things, it will  deal with the morality of the press.</p>

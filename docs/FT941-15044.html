			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Aviation sector appeals to Bonn for subsidies Germany's crisis-hit aerospace industry yesterday called on the Bonn government to draw up an emergency subsidy programme to enable the sector to survive and compete with US and Asian manufacturers. At a meeting near Bonn, 300 industry leaders spelt out a string of demands for government support to stem the current spate of job losses. Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, the Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) director responsible for aerospace, whose company has announced 16,000 redundancies from its 80,000-strong workforce, said that if government and industry failed to agree a 'new priority' for aerospace, Germany would fall behind its competitors in the technology. He set out a 10-point programme, including direct research subsidies of up to DM340m (Pounds 132.8m) a year for new technologies, including helicopter and aerospace equipment - but not engine research. He also called for direct grants of DM25m per year to develop a new extra-large air freighter to replace the Transall. He urged the government to match the huge programme of indirect aerospace promotion conducted by the US government, through both Nasa, the space agency, and the military procurement programme. He said President Bill Clinton had given a new lease of life to the US industry, both through research promotion, and 'by not being too proud to act as a carpet-trader on behalf of Boeing products throughout the world'. The plight of the German industry has aroused widespread sympathy in the country. The industry is a big employer in the conservative states of Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, but also the Social Democrat-ruled states of Bremen, Hamburg and Lower Saxony in northern Germany. Mr Reinhard Gohner, the state secretary responsible for aerospace, who convened the meeting, said he hoped that more indirect research support could be made available.</p>

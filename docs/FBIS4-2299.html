			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Jeffrey Ku, chairman of  the Taipei-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank, was granted an  audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito Wednesday [6 April].    "I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his  Tokyo palace," Ku said Thursday upon his return from a five-day  visit to Japan.    Ku, also an unpaid advisor to Taiwan's Executive Yuan,  stressed that his visit to Japan was private.    Ku said Emperor Akihito expressed his goodwill and regard  for  Taiwan. "Akihito was interested in Taiwan's current  developments," he noted.    Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on Taiwan's economic  strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development.    "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on Asia of  the North American Free Trade Agreement and the prospects for  the formation of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus and the  Asian Free Trade Agreement," Ku said.    Ku was the first Taiwan businessman granted a formal  audience  with Akihito since the emperor took the throne in October 1989.  Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct].    Political observers said Jeffrey Ku's meeting with Akihito  would boost the development of substantive ties between Taiwan  and Japan, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual  leader and wields no political power.    Japan recognizes Beijing and has been reluctant to develop  any official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending communist  Chinese leaders.    Many countries, including the United States, France and  Germany, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan,  but Japan has not followed suit.</p>

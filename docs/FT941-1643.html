			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Observer: Pole position No great surprise that Jardine Matheson taipan Henry Keswick was a no-show at the company's press conference yesterday on the subject of delisting its shares in Hong Kong. The notion of sweeping out of the stock exchange in a huff was very much his own, but, like the Queen and the Pope, Keswick does not grant interviews. Normally based in London's Lombard Street, Jardine's eminence grise was indubitably present in the colony - Observer's man on the ground ran into his imposing self in the street. But he left the talking to Sir Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher's eminently plausible former adviser, who seems to have donned the mantle of the group's chief international fire-fighter. The whole thing must have seemed a doddle to Powell, who arrived hotfoot from a couple of days in Malaysia with Mahathir Mohamad. His usual brimming confidence was no doubt further bolstered by the fact that Gammon, the construction company owned jointly by Jardine and Trafalgar House, is now safely off the list of British firms proscribed from bidding for Malaysian government contracts.</p>

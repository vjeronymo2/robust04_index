			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / French banks raise loan rates French banks raised their base lending rates by three-tenths of a percentage point yesterday, passing this month's increase in money-market rates on to their customers. Societe Generale was the first to announce it would rise its base rate to 8.25 per cent from 7.95 per cent with effect from today. Credit Lyonnais and the CIC banking unit of insurer GAN followed suit. Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit du Nord said they would increase their rates next Tuesday. Most other French banks are expected to follow suit.</p>

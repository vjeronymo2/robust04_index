			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / TGV link approval FRANCE has given the go-ahead for a high-speed TGV railway link from Paris to the German border, after years of delay caused by financing problems, Reuter reports from Paris. The prime minister's office said the cost of the project would be cut to less than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.43bn), from earlier estimates of FFr35bn. The construction schedule will be released next month. The new railway, completing a network of 160-190mph trains running south, west and north from Paris, should put Strasbourg less than two hours from Paris by the end of the century and eventually extend towards northern and eastern Europe. The European Community is to provide some financing.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Hindalco prices global offering Hindalco, India's largest private-sector producer of aluminium, has priced its Dollars 100m offering of global depositary receipts (GDRs). The Hindalco GDRs were priced at Dollars 24, compared with a local closing price on Thursday of Rs825 (Dollars 26.26), which represents a discount of 8.5 per cent. The GDRs are currently trading at Dollars 25, according to lead manager Lehman Brothers. The deal is one of a handful of offerings by Indian companies to have been completed since the Indian government was forced in May to postpone a planned Dollars 1bn issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-controlled telecommunications monopoly, when investors balked at the proposed pricing. Since then, most deals have been priced at a discount of 5 to 15 per cent below the market rate. Also in the pipeline is a Dollars 100m issue of GDRs plus warrants for Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), via CS First Boston. A number of other deals are planned, but dealers said that only specialist fund managers are currently buying paper. The National Stock Exchange, which opened for business in Bombay last week, has given a new lease of life to the Indian debt market, writes Naazneen Karmali in Bombay. Since its launch, the NSE has recorded transactions worth Rs300m, a rather insignificant amount compared with the Rs2bn of deals traded daily by stockbrokers over the telephone. However, Dr RH Patil, NSE's managing director, estimates that daily volume will be in the region of Rs5bn by year-end. Set up at a cost of Rs250m, the NSE has been promoted by a consortium of insurance companies, financial institutions and commercial banks.</p>

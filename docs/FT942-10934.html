			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Travel: Naked in Slovenia The sweet, melancholy sounds of a folk song echo down the corridor, its words incomprehensible except for the last of each verse - 'Maria'. I am waiting alone, naked and apprehensive. The melody changes to the major mode, the pace livens, and then the singer comes in smiling, wheeling a trolley. She is pretty, plump and lip-sticked. I understand nothing of what she says, but I give myself up completely. She places a great lump of steaming mud on the bed I am standing beside, and in her seductive language she tells me to lie on top of it. She takes more armfuls of mud and pins me down so that I am immobilised. It covers my abdomen, my shoulders and my arms with a great fiery weight. Then she wraps me first in a cotton sheet and after that she swaddles me in a thick blanket, all the while murmuring babytalk. She has set the timer for 20 minutes of this exquisite torture, and every so often she breaks off her song and tenderly wipes the sweat from my brow. When the allotted time has elapsed she offers a further five minutes - which I decline - and then a welcome shower. Then she brings strong, sweet coffee prepared in the Turkish manner, and a bottle of slivovka, the fiery spirit of the country. A visit to the Slovenian spa of Zrece seemed a must after a week of gourmandising in country farmhouses. First we had the water massage, when we were immersed in enormous computer-controlled baths heavily scented with sweetly aromatic oils. Then the medicinal bentonite mud treatment, and after that an agreeable swim in the naturally warm thermal waters of Zrece, this most recently discovered of all Slovenian spas. It was immensely relaxing. Spas in Slovenia were highly developed under the old communist regime, and they are remarkably sophisticated. Technology is advanced and the treatments extremely varied. Slovenian patients are referred by doctors for treatment after operations or injuries, or for many varied complaints ranging from rheumatism to diseases of the peripheral nervous system and psychiatric stresses. But for fit, healthy people, too, the spas offer considerable benefits at prices which are incredibly cheap by western standards. It is the same with Slovenian farmhouse accommodation. In this tiny but diverse and very beautiful country you can discover tastes and sensations that are all but forgotten in the west. Processed, industrialised food is practically unknown in Slovenia, and in the country you find meat which is produced on the farm, milk and cream straight from the cow, home-made salamis and prosciutti, cheeses, pickles and preserves, salads, vegetables and fruits from the garden, or from the woods (strawberries, raspberries and bilberries), and excellent wine. If western tourists have been shunning these delights in the belief that Slovenia is war-torn, Italians - and bears - know better. Bears have been making their way north from Croatia in search of a haven, to the consternation of farmers, if not hunters. Many of the latter are Italians. But mainly, Italians go to Slovenia to sample the delights of a peasant cuisine similar to that of north-east Italy but which (unlike theirs) is preserved intact, at least for now. Information about farmhouse holidays, as well as spas, can be had from Slovenia Pursuits: Brummells, Guilden Morden, Royston, Hertfordshire SG8 OJP, tel: 0763-852646. There are flights from Heathrow and Manchester to Ljubljana, with Adria Airways.

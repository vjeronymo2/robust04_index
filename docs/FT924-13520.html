			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: Move over, Come Dancing] - Cinema STRICTLY BALLROOM (PG) Odeon West End, Renoir, Screen on the Hill THUNDERHEART (15) MGMs West End SPOTSWOOD (PG) Plaza WUTHERING HEIGHTS (U) Empire LONDON FILM FESTIVAL National Film Theatre from Nov 5 The dance competition has been a staple of modern movie musicals ever since Saturday Night Fever. But in Strictly Ballroom they have opened the staple door and the horse has bolted. Urged on by first-time writer-director Baz Luhrmann, the spirit of snorting pastiche bounds through this delightful sequins-and-tinsel musical comedy from Australia, scattering cliches as it goes. Will handsome Scott (Paul Mercurio) win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix, Australian ballroom dancing's answer to the Olympics? If he does, will he stay true to his and his Dad's cherished notions of artistic freedom? (Floor-slides and pirouettes, feet-stompings and jetes). And whom will he choose for partner - the plain Hispano-Australian girl from the wrong side of the tracks (literally: her shanty home's backyard is inches from the passing freight trains) or the snooty Tina Sparkle, demon queen of the dance-room. Strictly Ballroom was the dark horse at Cannes this year, sprinting past the favourites and going prizeless only because it was shown out of competition. One would call the movie camp if it seemed remotely selfconscious about its hyperboles. But it begins as straightfaced baroque, shifts up into rococo and ends as a roaring essay in comical-romantic glitz. Adapting his own hit stage show, Luhrmann has deftly reconciled cinema with theatre. The minor characters - Bill Hunter's scheming Dance Federation boss, Barry Otto and Pat Thomson as our hero's parents - make their bow as all-singing, all-dancing caricatures. But they are soon fished out and individualised by close-up lenses, just as Mercurio and Miss Morice begin generically as ill-matched lovers but soon stamp (literally, this being the Latin branch of ballroom dancing) their heelprints on the roles. The comic coups abound. Barry Otto as Dad executes endearingly insane gyrations in a flashbacked glimpse of his youthful glory. (Nothing fancy from the make-up department: the same actor topped with a Liberace-ish wig). Morice's parents are casually revealed as Pasa Doble experts, stomping nightly to the tune of the passing trains. And the film's finale takes every trope of the dance-contest movie and wrings it for both comedy and a defiant romantic elan. See and delight. Come Dancing will never seem the same again. Would that the week could match it. Thunderheart, directed by Britain's Michael Apted, should be subtitled Bury My Brain At Wounded Knee. It starts as a murder thriller in an exotic setting, it ends up a stupefying slab of political piety about America's treatment of the Indian. A killing in a South Dakota reservation; an FBI agent sent thither who tries to disown his own quarter-Sioux bloodline (Val Kilmer); and a Hollywood welcoming committee of crooked white administrators, virtuous Indians and proverb-spouting Old Chiefs. These are variously played by Sam Shepard, Graham Greene (of Dances With Wolves) and the picturesquely named Chief Ted Thin Elk. As we are guided to the inevitable revelation that the local palefaces are doing the dirty on the native Americans, I kept consulting my watch. I felt I was watching a lecture on Indian culture interspersed with murders and bits of mysticism. John Fusco's script alternates the banal ('This whole place is a tinder-box') with the self-important ('I flew in here from a place called the 20th century'), while Apted and photographer Roger Deakins keep helicoptering over the white-ribbed mountain scenery as if a few spectacular views will make up for the vistas of pious emptiness in the story. The film is Robert De Niro's first producing-only venture, baptising his Tribeca production company. The signs are not good. As with Kevin Costner, Robert Redford, Tim Robbins and company, it seems that once you let a good actor behind the camera he is smitten forever by right-on politics and the desire to belabour audiences with them. The Australian comedy Spotswood is also right-on politically but fails, somehow, to bore us. One reason is Anthony Hopkins, here resembling a noddy toy wired for sound. Bobbing his head and convoying his consonants, he is the time-and-motion expert sent to drag a small-town moccasin factory into the 20th century. The moccasin factory, conscious of jobs and handcrafting traditions, virtuously resists. The film's second anti-boredom factor is the script by Max Dann and Andrew Knight, which weaves enchantingly wry subplots of love and jealousy, sex and slot-car racing from the lives of the factory hands. Instead of a selfconsciously healing comedy we have an unselfconsciously Ealing comedy: small dreams and small dramas made large by the magnifying glass of an ironic affection. Max Joffe is the first-time director: may it be the first of many. Wuthering Heights is likewise a first, but also virtually a last. A product of 'Paramount British Pictures', it marks the Hollywood studio's brief sojourn of hope in these isles. Planned as a European bridgehead, PBP soon sank into financial uncertainty and cultural Euro-muddle. Witness this Emily-Bronte-straddles-the-Channel offering. French actress Juliette Binoche plays Cathy (mere et fille), nervously lobbing her English accent at Ralph Fiennes' brooding Heathcliff, who flat-rackets it back with staring eyes and ee-bah-gum vowels. This pair generates as much excitement as a washed-out day at Wimbledon. But then whose fault is that in a movie scripted by Anne Devlin as if she had picked up Cold Comfort Farm instead of the Bronte novel, and directed by a Peter Kosminsky (former Yorkshire TV documentarist) vacillating between irreconcilable styles. While the moors are a plausible, pleasant wash of greens and browns and rocky greys, Wuthering Heights itself might have strayed in from a 1960s Edgar Allan Poe film: a crenellated carbuncle teetering over a comic-book chasm. No wonder moments of high romantic intensity alternate with searing bathos. When Heathcliff strides onto the moors after his latest tantrum  - there he stands silhouetted by two rocky pinnacles - it is but a moment before Hareton turns up saying 'Come back and finish your dinner.' After 108 minutes of watching Emily Bronte reduced to rubble, the only fertile mystery left is what happened to the author's own screen appearances. Miss Bronte, says the press hand-out, is played by Sinead O'Connor and 'appears in several scenes.' I think I spotted one. But perhaps there was more sense in the Wuthering Heights cutting room than ever appears in Wuthering Heights the movie. There is always the London Film Festival, beginning three weeks hence and booking now. The usual Noah's flood of new films - over 300 large and small  -will move up the Thames to the National Film Theatre, spilling over into Leicester Square for special screenings (Blade Runner - The Director's Version, Hellraiser III, Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act). Elsewhere, please put your oar in the water and hope for the best. My Top Five recommendations: Zhang Yimou's Venice prize-winning peasant fable The Story Of Qiu Ju; Stacy Cochran's My New Gun, a black comedy about trigger-happy suburbia, USA; Daniel Bergman's Sunday's Children, another gleaming chunk of memory from scriptwriter father Ingmar; Jean-Claude Lauzon's likewise autobiographical Leolo, a sort of Canadian Amarcord; and actor John Turturro's writing-directing Mac, Best First Film winner at Cannes and a fighting, funny tale of domestic life based - yes, once again - on the film-maker's own family. If the 1990s prove to be the decade of self-portraiture in the cinema, remember where you read it first.</p>

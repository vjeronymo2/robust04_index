			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Spanish minister steps down over land deals SPAIN'S health minister, Mr Julian Garcia Valverde, resigned last night amid a scandal over land deals by the state railway company Renfe which he chaired in the 1980s, Reuter reports from Madrid. The scandal centred on land speculation in the Madrid suburbs of San Sebastian de los Reyes and Alcobendas in 1988. Budget shortfalls to finance a new rail link into the capital prompted the dealing, in which Renfe paid a grossly inflated price for land it had intended to sell to pay for the project. Mr Garcia Valverde said: 'If there were any irregularities in the land deals, I want to make clear this was without my knowledge and was an abuse of my confidence.' He was due to appear before the high court tomorrow, the first of 71 people called to give evidence before a parliamentary commission.</p>

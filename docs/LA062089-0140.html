			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIBBS CHOSEN TO REPLACE SWITZER  </P> <P> University of Oklahoma officials today chose defensive coordinator Gary Gibbs  to replace Barry Switzer, who resigned Monday as football coach at Oklahoma.  </P> <P> The university's regents will vote on the selection Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Gary Gibbs is one of the outstanding young coaches in the United States  today," interim President David Swank said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Played on Sooners Team  </P> <P> Swank said Gibbs, who played for the Sooners in college, also understands that  the university's mission is to educate the athletes.  </P> <P> Gibbs, 36, appeared confident about taking on a job he said he had always  desired. He brushed off questions about the pressure involved in following  Switzer, the most successful coach in Oklahoma's history.  </P> <P> "I'm Gary Gibbs. I know what I can do," Gibbs said. "Your comparison is your  comparison. We're going to go forward and make this thing happen."  </P> <P> Swank recommended Gibbs over two other assistant coaches -- Merv Johnson and  Jim Donnan. He said the choice was difficult to make.  </P> <P> Gibbs said he would evaluate his options before deciding what changes will be  made in the coaching staff.  </P> <P> "I will be in complete control of the football program," Gibbs told the news  conference.  </P> <P> "We will once again make people proud to associate with the University of  Oklahoma," Gibbs said.  </P> <P> Gibbs noted the problems that have plagued the football program in recent  months, including the arrest of five players on a variety of charges and the  NCAA probation imposed in December.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Remove That Cloud'  </P> <P> "We've got to remove that cloud," Gibbs said. "If we perform the way we're  capable, if we do those things . . . we're going to be fine."  </P> <P> Switzer had recommended that the next coach be promoted from within.  </P> <P> Gibbs' only college experience -- as a player and a coach -- has been at  Oklahoma. He played linebacker on the 1974 national championship team and has  moved his way through the ranks as an assistant coach, becoming defensive  coordinator in 1981.  </P> <P> "OU has a history of young coaches rising to the top," Athletic Director Donnie  Duncan said. "In the years to come you'll understand why I made the  recommendation to name Gary Gibbs as head football coach."  </P></p>

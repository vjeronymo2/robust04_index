			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euphoric response to Italian budget A DEGREE of euphoria in Italy was one of the main features yesterday, as bourses waited for the result of the French Maastricht referendum on Sunday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN welcomed the L93,000bn of deficit-cutting measures presented in Rome late on Thursday. The Comit index rose another 8.36 to 375.51, up 2.3 per cent on the day, and by the same figure on a week which saw drops of 3.3, 1.6 and 4.9 per cent on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Most leading blue chips rose, with Montedison up 6.7 per cent following the merger of its polypropylene operations with Royal Dutch/Shell. Mr John Stewart of Pastorino &amp; Partners said that the deal put together Montedison's technical expertise with Shell's raw materials, that the high debt of Montedison's Hiomont subsidiary might be subsumed in this venture and that the deal could have a significant effect on Montedison earnings in 1993. Pastorino were worried, however, by the budget's provision to tax corporate net assets by 0.75 per cent per annum, pointing out that this could cost Fiat, for example, 10 per cent of 1991's L1,114bn earnings. FRANKFURT extended current share price themes as the DAX index rose 10.66 to 1,589.33, up 4 per cent on the week but well below its intraday high of 1,598.23. Traders said that futures-related buying from the Deutsche Terminbourse (DTB) had pushed prices higher, but that selling pressure from abroad more than negated that. The expiry of index and futures contracts pushed turnover up from DM5.9bn to DM9.7bn. Banks and insurance shares continued to outpace the market, lifted by interest rate cuts, the prospect of them and the rise in bond values reflected in a fall in the average bond yield from 8.21 to 7.76 per cent this week. In carmakers, conditions continued to favour BMW, up DM7 to DM551.50, against Volkswagen which rose only 30 pfg to DM321.10 in a week marred by the currency threat to VW's overseas profit margins, and what economic austerity might to to its sales in the home market. Constructions rose on hopes of lower interest rates, Bilfinger &amp; Berger by DM,40 to DM900, and Holzmann by DM33 marks to DM925. PARIS, quietly confident of a Yes vote in tomorrow's Maastricht referendum, closed at its highest level since the beginning of July. Assuming a positive result, a cut in interest rates is anticipated, and has been reflected this week in the rise of financial and bank stocks. The CAC-40 index closed 30.20 up at 1,882.94, 4.5 per cent better on the week. Turnover swelled to FFr4bn. Peugeot went against the market after some analysts downgraded the stock following a meeting with the company in Paris yesterday. It was reported that Peugeot sales will suffer in the depressed European car market and lower full year profits are forecast. The shares dipped FFr39, or 6 per cent to FFr595. Axa was another loser, down FFr28 or 3 per cent at FFr800 although it denied rumours that talks were being held with Aegon of the Netherlands on a possible merger. AMSTERDAM had a good day in spite of a profits downgrade by Philips, which saw its shares lose Fl 1.80 to Fl 22.80. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.0 to 113.6, a 4 per cent advance over the week. BRUSSELS eased in late trading as the Bel-20 index slipped 1.32 to 1,130.24, up 4.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was BFr1.2bn. Delhaize retreated just before the close as its US division forecast disappointing third quarter earnings. Its shares fell BFr70 or 4.1 per cent to BFr1,640. STOCKHOLM rallied on hopes that talks between the government and opposition parties would lead to a package of measures to reduce the budget deficit. The Affarsvarlden general index closed 23.4 higher at 758.7, up 5.3 per cent on the week. While most sectors performed well, one of the day's losers was Skanska, the construction group, which said that it faced increased financing costs of SKr100m a day because of the 500 per cent marginal lending rate. Its free shares slipped SKr7, or 12.5 per cent to SKr49. OSLO's advance was assisted by the stronger dollar and the composite index gained 11.97 to 336.15, a 7.2 per cent rise on the week. The industry index put on 20.97 to 594.30. Among the day's active issues Kvaerner free shares gained NKr11 to NKr146 on news that it was to take over an east German shipyard. VIENNA, which has been outperforming many European bourses in recent days, closed the week in positive mood. The ATX index gained 29.69 to 835.70, up 12 per cent on the week. Austrian Airlines was actively traded, advancing Sch110 or 5.8 per cent to Sch2,010.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 18                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm    2 pm      3 pm     close 1062.82  1066.71  1066.40  1066.45  1068.20  1068.51  1069.10  1070.95                    Day's High  1071.42    Day's Low  1062.57        Sep 17      Sep 16       Sep 15       Sep 14      Sep 11       1058.13      1053.63     1051.69       1073.79     1033.57  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

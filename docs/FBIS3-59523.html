			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Claude Desama, president of the European </F> Parliament commission on energy, research, and technology, by  Framboisette Jassogne; place and date not given: "Desama Favors  European Aeronautical Research"]    [Text]    [Jassogne] You are in the process of examining the European  Commission proposal for the fourth Community research framework  program. What is your objective?    [Desama] In the field of European research policy, the  European Parliament plays a strategic role, as it does in  budgetary affairs. The Parliament is more and more influential,  thanks to the new codecision procedure established by the  Maastricht Treaty. Thus our objective is to wield as much clout  as we can on decisions, to exert real influence on the European  Commission, and be able to apply either carrot or stick in our  constant battles with the Council of Ministers. The carrot means  optimizing our negotiating capacities; the stick means pounding  our fist on the table when necessary and not being intimidated  by confrontation.    [Jassogne] The European Commission proposes to earmark  appropriations for generic technologies while reaffirming its  commitment to support projects that target specific sectors such  as aeronautics or the automotive industry. Isn't this  inconsistent?    [Desama] No, because the menu of programs can be designed  both to support generic technologies -- technologies that may  have ramifications in multiple sectors -- and to stimulate  specific sectors where industrial competitiveness basically  depends on technological prowess. This is the case in the data  processing industry, taken in the broadest sense. It's also true  in the aeronautics industry, another area where technology is  the name of the game. It's true in the space sector too, with  respect to launchers. And increasingly in the automotive  industry, which has to operate efficiently to compete against  the Japanese, even though its technology may be more advanced.  In addition, it will have to apply itself to the enormous  environmental problems it is going to face.    [Jassogne] But on close inspection of the Commission  document, one doesn't find these targeted pillars...    [Desama] It's true that the vertical axes are not very  clearly identified. But the document is pitched at the level of  a general framework for the research program. The place where  you find that sort of emphasis is at the level of specific  programs. I won't try to hide the fact, as we see it, that this  type of emphasis can only be put into the research program to  the extent that an industrial policy exists downstream. It  serves no purpose to do research in critical areas if the effort  is not supported by industrial policies: The Japanese and  Americans will just pluck the fruits of our technology for their  own benefit. For the moment, there is no industrial policy.  After much contention, the idea was rejected at the Edinburgh  Summit in December 1992. So we're just going to have to see what  the Belgian presidency is going to do. I think it has the  capacity to give impetus to the European growth initiative, to  give a shot in the arm to the losers of the Edinburgh battle. If  Belgium gives substance to this initiative and to the impulses  in these sectors, I think it will be able to set in motion the  beginnings of an eventual Community industrial policy.    [Jassogne] How much priority does the Parliament want  research to have?    [Desama] Our objective is still to meet the goal set at the  Milan Summit in 1985, i.e. 6 percent of the total Community  budget: enough for research to be the third largest item in the  Community budget, after agriculture and structural funds. We're  currently spending between 4 and 4.5 percent. If we adopt the  European Commission proposal for the fourth framework program,  we will be able to maintain the present level of research. Even  that may be difficult to achieve, due to current conditions and  budgetary problems.    We support the Commission proposal. I sense that the member  states, with perhaps one or two exceptions, are moving in the  same direction. But there are some hesitations on the part of  Germany and the United Kingdom. Even France is less than totally  enthusiastic. Still, it may well be that the positions of France  and the United Kingdom are only negotiating ploys. Germany is  the more worrisome and more dismal case. In the past it was  always the driving force. Today, the Germans are in a phase of  retreat in this domain. This means the battle in the coming  weeks is going to be tough. But the Parliament has one important  weapon: co-decision. Because of it, the decision can't be made  without us and against us. And I don't think any of the member  states is going to decide to eviscerate the fourth framework  program, since their own laboratories and industries also depend  on it. At any rate, if all goes well we should be able under the  Belgian presidency to reach political agreement on the fourth  framework program.    [Jassogne] What about research in aeronautics?    [Desama] It's not out of the question that a line of  "aeronautical research" might emerge. Of course, it will not  appear as such in the framework program, but in the form of a  specific program -- why not? Under the rubric of "industrial  technologies," for example. I'm all in favor, so long as it's  paired with the beginnings of an industrial policy. Otherwise  it's just casting pearls before swine.</p>

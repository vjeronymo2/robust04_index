			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 23, 1991, EPA once again extended the compliance deadline for the Category IV group (small marketers with fewer than 13 tanks at more than one facility or fewer than 100 tanks at a single facility as well as non-marketers with net worth less than $20 million) to December 31, 1993 (56 FR 66369). EPA based the extension on its understanding that more members of this compliance group than the Agency had originally projected must rely on state assurance funds, rather than on insurance, to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements. EPA believed that, in order for owners and operators to rely on state assurance funds as compliance mechanisms, states must have more time to submit their state assurance funds to EPA for approval. Currently, 31 state assurance funds have been approved by EPA and an additional eight state assurance funds have been submitted to EPA for approval. (It is important to note that upon submission of a state assurance fund to the EPA Regional Administrator, the fund is considered to be approved unless and until EPA disapproves it.) Additionally, the extension provided states with more time to develop and implement financial assistance programs (e.g., direct loan programs, loan guarantee programs, grant programs) which help owners and operators (especially small businesses) pay for technical requirements such as tank upgrading. These technical improvements, in turn, help USTs meet insurers' underwriting criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency, however, continued to be concerned about the effects of its regulations on the regulated community. By analyzing the costs of the requirements, EPA found that the affordability of financial responsibility compliance is often tied to early compliance with technical requirements such as tank upgrading, since, for example, private insurance companies may refuse to provide coverage unless they are certain that a site does not pose a high risk of leaking. EPA believed that the costs associated with the technical requirements are an important factor underlying the inability of some small owners and operators to meet the financial responsibility requirements. These costs coupled with the lack of a state assurance fund, grant, or loan program could force some gas stations to close their tanks when the 1993 financial responsibility compliance date fell. EPA believed that tank closure could be particularly problematic when those tanks provide essential services to rural communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this concern about the availability of fuel in rural areas, EPA proposed a December 31, 1998 compliance date for certain petroleum marketers, local governments, and Indian tribes, that meet Federally-determined criteria (58 FR 43770). The objective of the August 17, 1993 proposed rule was to obtain data on whether an additional extension of the financial responsibility requirements was needed, and for whom. The Agency intended to limit any additional extension to, at most, a small sub-group of marketers currently in Category IV, as well as certain local governments and Indian tribes; EPA did not want to change compliance dates for all Category IV marketers or local governments on the belief that most of these tank owners were already in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements due to the existence of state assurance funds and reliance on self-insurance mechanisms. The August 17, 1993 proposed rule included eligibility criteria limiting the proposed 1998 compliance group to rural petroleum marketers that met a hardship criterion of annual profit on gasoline sales of $15,000 or less, rural local governments that use tanks for essential services such as police and fire departments, and Indian tribes. (The definition of rural was obtained from the Farmers Home Administration within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.) In addition, all owners in the new 1998 compliance group would have to ensure that their tanks were in compliance with applicable technical requirements, such as leak detection. The technical compliance criterion was included to protect human health and the environment regardless of a change in the financial responsibility deadline. EPA also stressed the fact that any change in the financial responsibility compliance date would not remove the liability on the part of the owner or operator to clean-up a leak.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

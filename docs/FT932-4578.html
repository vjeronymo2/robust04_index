			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News in Brief: Oshawa Group OSHAWA Group, one of Canada's top three food wholesalers and retailers, says first quarter net profit rose 33 per cent to CDollars 7.6m (USDollars 5.98m), or 21 cents a share, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The upturn was due mostly to acquisitions completed in 1992. Sales for the quarter increased 24 per cent to CDollars 1.27bn. Oshawa expects improving results through the rest of this year as acquisitions in western Canada and in Quebec are fully absorbed. These have reduced reliance on the central Ontario market. The network now totals 900 corporate and franchised supermarkets nationally. Oshawa earned CDollars 41.8m, or CDollars 1.14 a share, in 1992, up 19 per cent, on a revenue gain of 8.5 per cent to CDollars 5.01bn. The company is seeking more regional acquisitions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- During its convention on 29 May in  Brasilia, the Party for the Redefinition of the National Order  [PRONA] officially appointed Dr. Eneas Ferreira Carneiro its  presidential candidate. He was unanimously appointed by the 28  candidates. The party's vice presidential candidate is Rio de  Janeiro-born Rear Admiral Roberto Gama e Silva, who was  president of the Low Amazonas Studies Group [Grupo de Estudos do  Baixo Amazonas -- Gebam] during Joao Figueiredo's administration.    The main banner of PRONA's program, which is still being  drafted, is a strong government. Carneiro believes that only by  intervening in the macroeconomic structure can the government  ensure high-quality public schools and health programs. With his  rights to 60 seconds of free television propaganda time -- three  times longer than what he had in the last elections -- Carneiro  plans to attract "two-thirds of the voters who still are  undecided."    In the 1989 election, PRONA had 360,000 votes. This is  equivalent to 0.5 percent of the total number of votes. In this  year's elections, the party has its position in the presidential  race ensured by the representation of Deputy Regina Gordilho  (Rio de Janeiro) in Congress and has gubernatorial candidates in  at least 15 states. Carneiro said: "We are not joking. Our party  is the only serious thing that exists in the country nowadays."</p>

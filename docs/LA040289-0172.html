			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DON'T GIVE RAPPERS BAD RAP  </P> <P> Los Angeles area law enforcement officials are uncomfortable with some of the  gangbanger sentiments expressed by N.W.A, but don't view the rap group as a  threat.  </P> <P> "It's not very welcome," said Lt. Joe Flores, adjutant to the Compton chief of  police. "But it's a fad and I don't think it's going to have an adverse effect  on the community. . . ."  </P> <P> Representatives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department familiar with  the Compton and South-Central Los Angeles gang situation also saw little reason  for concern.  </P> <P> "If you're attributing rap music to escalating gang activity, I haven't seen  it," said Lt. Art Herrera of the Sheriff's Department gang unit.  </P> <P> However, Leon Watkins, head of a private agency that works with parents of  youths involved with drugs and gangs, believes the music is exploitative of a  volatile situation and that "nothing good" can come from it.  </P> <P> "I don't condone that kind of thing," said Watkins, former regional director of  the Los Angeles County Probation Department's youth gang services office and  now head of his own South-Central Los Angeles Family Hotline. "The minds of our  young people are too impressionable for groups to be coming out with stuff like  that."  </P> <P> Watkins noted that he has been active in bringing such rap acts as Run-D.M.C.  together with L.A. gang representatives to serve as positive role models. "Most  of the rap groups I deal with are positive, anti-gang and anti-drugs. But N.W.A  sounds like it's using the record industry to glamorize crime, and that's a  hindrance. . . ."  </P> <P> Still, Watkins accepts N.W.A's contention that it is just reporting what  happens on the streets of Compton.  </P> <P> "What they're trying to do is sell records, and they're taking a situation  that's already prevalent and using that frustration to sell records," Watkins  said. "But when you put certain things to people who are already frustrated,  that's what I worry about. . . . They've got a volatile situation and they're  taking advantage of it."  </P> <P> And Watkins does not think songs such as "---- Tha Police" can serve as the  spark to ignite the volatility into something bigger.  </P> <P> "The music won't touch off something violent," he said. "In my experience it's  not the music, but something like a shooting that sets things off, and then the  music becomes a battle cry later."  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Articulated truck v articulate Arthur: Kieran Cooke returns to old Dublin haunts and has a close encounter with a master raconteur The Japanese have a quaint habit of proclaiming various venerable personages living treasures - to be cared for and looked after much in the same way as the British list their buildings or the Americans preserve their redwoods. If Ireland were to adopt the Japanese system - instead of waiting until anyone is well and truly dead before proclaiming him or her 'a great character and a credit to the nation' - my friend Arthur McCoy would be a prime candidate. Nothing like settling back in the warm seat of a Dublin bar after a long absence from the country and listening to Arthur ('The Real') wind himself up to tell a story. Arthur is to the meat trade what Coco Chanel was to fashion or Henry Ford to the motor car. Arthur knows every meat mart and abattoir in Europe. He knows the trade's every wrinkle. Arthur was once hired as a meat detective, tracking down container loads of beef that had gone missing under mysterious circumstances. 'Once I saw a wagon going the wrong way on the Autobahn in Germany. Instead of heading for Syria it was going to Finland. When I finally caught up with it there was one rump steak left in it. Driver had met up with a girl in Hamburg and done a runner. 'I had to go down to his mother's house in Kerry looking for him. She starts crying saying she didn't for the life of her know what had happened to her Shane. I says to her that while I sympathised with her I didn't know what had happened to my container load of meat either.' As every raconteur knows, it is not just the story, it's the way of telling it. Arthur had a serious car accident recently. He stands to tell the tale, a large vodka and red lemonade in one hand, a cigarette in the other - waved round like a conductor's baton at moments of particular emphasis. 'Wait till I tell you now,' he says in that Dublin growl similar to sandpaper being scraped across the bottom of a bird cage. Your knee is tapped to ensure full attention. Arthur clears his throat and casts a masterly eye over his audience in an effort to achieve some degree of quiet. 'The first thing I admit was that I was stupid. There I was happily belting along the motorway in Northern Ireland, not a care in the world. Next thing I know the car is entered for the 3.30 at Cheltenham and is leaping up over the barrier, doing a somersault. 'Out through the front window I go and I'm sliding along the other side of the road. Now while all this is going on I'm thinking that I'm going to ruin my suit. Funny what comes to mind at such times.' A gulp of the drink followed by a deep puff of cigarette - removed from the lips with all the flourish of Pavarotti using his handkerchief. 'An articulated truck is coming the other way. I can hear the tsuk, tsuk of the brakes.' (Arthur is bent down, imitating a container truck. He is pulling on handles and pressing brakes. The vodka red tosses about in the glass but not a drop is spilled.) 'I see the smoke coming from the tyres and the radiator with the word Volvo getting bigger all the time . . . next thing I know I'm in an ambulance with an Ulsterman asking am I all right. For a second there I wondered which place I was in. I introduce myself and say that I never felt better.' 'Anyway,' (another tap on the knee just in case your attention is not entirely on the matter at hand) 'they have me up in court. Now I was cute about it.' (A knowing wink and slight inclination of the head here.) 'I used my full name - Arthur Lesley McCoy. You see the Lesley is very important in Northern Ireland. It shows them I have a foot in both camps so to speak. They can't really decide whether I'm one of them or one of us.' (Coughs, choking laughter. Drinks all round.) 'Come here while I tell you. The magistrate asks what I have to say for myself.' 'Well, your worship, sir, nothing.' 'Nothing Mr McCoy?' says he, raising a quizzical eye over his half glasses. 'Well, your lordship, I'm guilty. You have me fair and square. Carelessness. Foolishness. I was going too fast. Daydreaming. Lost control and over she went. I'm very sorry. 'The magistrate takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.' Arthur, taking a gulp of his drink, does the same, massaging his palm round a couple of bloodshot sockets. 'Mr McCoy,' says your man. 'By all accounts you had a very close shave with death. 'I would describe it as more like a photo finish your honour,' says I. 'With that the whole place was laughing. A Pounds 100 fine and I was out.'</p>

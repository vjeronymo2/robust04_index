			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: Japanese companies squeeze their white collar workers - The tradition of jobs for life is forcing Japan's bosses to look at novel ways of getting more out of their office workers In Europe and the US companies simply cut staff. But in Japan - where the tradition of lifetime employment remains deeply ingrained - the inexorable global trend towards flatter corporate hier-archies is posing an awkward chal-lenge. So far, the restructuring of Japan's business sector has focused mainly on cutting production lines and paring manufacturing costs. But during the past few months attention has switched, as it has elsewhere in the world, to the difficult issue of how to reduce the many layers of white collar workers. The methods chosen by the Japanese have been necessarily different from those employed by western counterparts. Some of Japan's blue chip companies have been forced to announce sackings and early retirement plans. But the public outcry has been so great that others are now trying to find new ways to increase the efficiency of their existing white collar staff without getting rid of them. Some companies, for example, have tried to deal with the problem by shifting unwanted employees to subsidiaries or to smaller client companies. Others, such as the leading consumer electronics company Sony, are trying to introduce a more Japanese solution through comprehensive re-organisation schemes. 'For the first time in decades, Japanese businesses must rethink their functional priorities,' says Shintaro Hori, director of Bain &amp; Company Japan, the management consultancy. Sony's plan, announced in March, is intended to tackle a bureaucracy which appears to have been seriously hampering the company's decision making. The company has therefore reorganised its 27 departments and sales divisions into eight internal 'companies' and cut the number of subdivisions and departments from 580 to 450. Sony believes this move will help to speed up internal communications and avoid duplication of projects in separate divisions. Sony is typical of Japanese companies which concentrated on manufacturing efficiency while allowing executive grades to spiral out of control during the 1980s. For instance, the consumer electronics company's manufacturing headcount increased by just 6 per cent during the eight years to 1992, but the ranks of its white collar personnel swelled by 139 per cent over the same period. Matsushita Electric Industrial, another large Japanese consumer electronics company, cut the size of its blue collar workforce by 24 per cent in this time, while its white collar staff rose by 47 per cent. However, given the continued decline in corporate earnings and the lack of further room to cut production costs, companies are now finding that their bloated management bureaucracies are proving an unacceptable burden. The competitive disadvantage was illustrated by a Japan Productivity Centre survey in 1992, which found that Japanese manufacturing companies would have to eliminate 39 per cent of their head count to reach overall US productivity levels per employee. Moreover, until recently, Japanese consumers indirectly subsidised low white collar productivity through higher prices for goods and services. However, the recent pressure on prices, arising from the slump in consumer confidence and new attitudes among shoppers towards discount retailing, have squeezed profit margins, thereby eliminating the 'fat' which effectively subsidised inefficient performance. Matsushita, which also implemented its corporate reorganisation last February, will move 300 administrative staff to its sales divisions, and reduce its 48 business divisions to 10. Susumu Ishihara, director of Matsushita, says the layers of administrative managers had caused the company to misread the market and to miss profit opportunities. To measure its rise in productivity, the company has pledged to increase its ratio of pre-tax profits to sales from the current 1.4 per cent to 5 per cent over the next three years. Similarly, Sony is also pushing its managers for more efficient use of capital. 'Each company president will be responsible for not only the profits and losses, but also for the balance sheets of the organisation, including the return on equity,' says Tamotsu Iba, Sony's executive deputy president who masterminded the company's reorganisation plan. While some companies are trying to raise white collar productivity through structural changes, some are placing stricter quality requirements on their managers. Honda, the automobile maker, recently announced that it would place a time limit on managerial posts. Starting from June, if a manager fails to be promoted within 12 years, he or she will be forced to a non-managerial post without subordinate staff. The plan has provoked criticism among the Japanese media and business analysts, but Honda says that it is trying to provide more opportunities for its younger staff and to improve the productivity of its older managers. According to the company: 'It's tough on the older workers but the younger employees are welcoming the move.' Spurred by this productivity drive, more and more Japanese companies and employees realise that the old definition of office work is no longer valid. Tasks such as writing reports and filling forms have been traditionally regarded as office work, but the concept of white collar workers actually adding value to products or services has been absent. Hori points out that Japan's business leaders have first to define what they mean by productivity of office work, set targets for improving it, and try to add value through strategic planning by companies and industries. Ultimately, business leaders will need to set new ground rules for employees, as the traditional social contract breaks down. In the past companies guaranteed workers a path up the corporate hierarchy in return for loyalty and service. In situations where 'bucho' or division managers find themselves losing their titles and becoming ordinary staff, companies need to map out a new direction for them. In the meantime, more companies may have to face up to the inevitable - the reduction of overhead costs, western style. While many leading Japanese companies will continue to resist the concept of sacking staff, they may not achieve successful results without wielding the white collar axe. 'The magnitude of excess is too large,' says Hori. 'With too much organisational slack, bringing in new values is impossible to achieve in the short term.'</p>

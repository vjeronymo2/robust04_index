			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SMALL SCHOOLS / PREVIEW 1990-91;  </P> <P> IT'S ANYBODY'S TITLE IN THE OLYMPIC LEAGUE  </P> <P> Confusion reigns in Olympic League boys' basketball. Ask any coach for a  favorite to win the league, and you'll get one of four answers: Brethren  Christian, Whittier Christian, Orange Lutheran or Valley Christian.  </P> <P> Brethren has size and depth. Valley Christian has several key players back from  last season's league champion. Whittier Christian features one of the Olympic's  best players in Ruben Oronoz and Orange Lutheran has two starters back.  </P> <P> "The league title will be up for grabs this season," Orange Lutheran Coach Matt  Hansen said. "At least four or five teams could challenge for the top spot."  </P> <P> St. Margaret's shouldn't have much trouble repeating as the Academy League  champion. The Tartans return center Ryan Westendorf, who led Orange County in  rebounding last season with a 19.6 average.  </P> <P> After playing a free-lance schedule last season, Calvary Chapel joins the  Arrowhead League, in which Southern California Christian is the defending  champion.  </P> <P> A closer look at the county's small schools:  </P> <P> </P> <P> BRETHREN CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Coach: Richard Thomas (seventh year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 20-10, 8-6 in Olympic League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Five.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returners: Frank Brady (G, 5-10, Sr.); Chris Fry (C, 7-0, Jr.); Chiron Hart  (F, 6-3, Jr.); Tim Nichol (F, 6-3, Sr.); Brandon Stott (G, 6-1, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jermaine Forge (G, 6-0, Sr.); Ernest Henderson (G, 5-9, Sr.);  Aaron Neilsen (F, 6-3, Sr.); Tim Osborn (F, 6-2, Jr.); Scott Thomas (F, 6-2,  Soph.).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Warriors return five of their top eight players, and Thomas has  promoted several players from last season's league-champion junior varsity. The  Warriors have two strong outside shooters in Stott and Hart, who are both  returning starters. But lack of an inside scorer and a playmaker could keep the  Warriors from unseating defending champion Valley Christian.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALVARY CHAPEL  </P> <P> Coach: Steve Middleton (second year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 7-13 free-lance schedule (First year in Arrowhead League).  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Six.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three. Top returners: Brian Arrowood (G, 6-0, Jr.); Jason  Vanderburg (C, 6-3, Soph.); Jon Winterkorn (F, 6-0, Jr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Darrell Coloma (G, 5-11, Soph.); Chase Lubbock (G, 5-11, Soph.);  John O'Brien (F, 6-4, Jr.); Allen Tate (G, 5-10, Sr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Middleton is hoping for help from three transfers: O'Brien, who  averaged 19 points a game last season at Newport Christian; Tate, who  transferred from Saddleback after sitting out last year, and Lubbock, who  played on the freshman team last year at Garden Grove. Calvary, in its third  year of existence, joins the Arrowhead League this season after struggling with  an all-underclassmen lineup last season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Coach: Art Jenkins (first year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 7-23, 2-12 in Olympic League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: One.  </P> <P> Returning starters: One.  </P> <P> Top returners: Nathan Owen (F, 6-3, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jeff Bishop (G, 6-0, Sr.); Jeremiah Bodnar (G, 6-0, Sr.); Chuck  Carlsen (C, 6-3, Soph.); Mark Chapman (F, 6-1, Sr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Jenkins has no choice but to rely on Owen and the four newcomers.  That's his entire team. With only five varsity players and five on the junior  varsity, Jenkins expects to have many problems, especially in league. "I don't  see any strengths at this time," Jenkins said. "Our weaknesses could be stated  as obvious."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE LUTHERAN  </P> <P> Coach: Matt Hansen (first year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 16-11, 9-5 in Olympic League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returners: Brian Bedord (C, 6-3, Sr.); Matt Bode (G, 6-1, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Cory Fleming (G, 5-10, Jr.); Lenny Gavin (G, 5-11, Jr.); Chad  Mihr (F, 6-3, Jr.); Chad Reed (F, 6-4, Soph.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Hansen begins his first year as head coach, replacing Jerry Simmons,  who retired. He has two solid returners to work with in Bode and Bedord. Bode  averaged eight points and four assists last season and Bedord averaged 10  points and seven rebounds. Hansen predicted a fourth-place finish for the  Lancers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ST. MARGARET'S  </P> <P> Coach: Rick Bauer (third year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 21-6, 10-0 in Academy League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returners: Mike Baksic (G, 5-10, Sr.); Geoff Hanzlik (F, 6-3, Jr.); Ravi  Mruthyunjaya (G, 5-6, Soph.); Ryan Westendorf (C, 6-7, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Lupe Rodriguez (G, 5-7, Fr.); Aaron Wright (C, 6-6, Sr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Westendorf is the key. He averaged 26.2 points and led the county in  rebounding last season with a 19.6 average. He was the league's most valuable  player and led the Tartans to the Southern Section small school final, where  they lost to Ribet Academy, 68-60. The only other returning starter is  Mruthyunjaya, the point guard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Coach: John Diebold (first year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 13-8, 10-0 in Arrowhead League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three.  </P> <P> Top returners: Ben Carlson (F, 6-4, Sr.); Toby Dembowski (F, 6-4, Sr.); Chris  Ludlow (G, 6-3, Sr.); Scott Williams (G, 6-3, Jr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Paul Lange (F, 6-4, Sr.); Mike Hatcher (C, 6-6, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Diebold, who coached Newport Christian until the school folded this  year, begins his first season at Southern California Christian. He compared his  team with the Newport Christian squad he coached to the 1989 Southern Section  finals. "That team went 22-3," he said. "We have the capability to do that with  this team."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Coach: Bob Brown (third year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 14-12, 9-5 in Olympic League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: One.  </P> <P> Top returners: Ruben Oronoz (F, 6-5, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Mark Berokoff (F, 6-2, Jr.); Jacob Cuccia (G, 5-10, Soph.);  Kerry Houser (F, 6-2, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Whittier Christian features one of the most consistent players in the  league in Oronoz. The Heralds, who won the Southern Section 2-AA title two  years ago, also have one of the quickest teams in the league, Brown said. But  lack of a center and inexperience could keep them from challenging for the  league title.  </P></p>

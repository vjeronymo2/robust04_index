			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Banco Santander begins to reap Banesto benefits Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year after the Pta281bn (Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain late last year. Santander's profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn, after including Banesto, are the highest result ever posted by a Spanish banking group for this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits were Pta100.5bn, 5.9 per cent up on the same period last year. The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank, raised Santander's average total assets from Pta9,270bn to Pta16,827bn, outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the next biggest domestic banking group, by more than Pta4,000bn. Banesto was consolidated in August, after the formal completion of the acquisition. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, said the subsidiary bank's performance over the past two months had 'confirmed the favourable forecasts of Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy designed to consolidate a wide and solid client base in the Spanish market'. Santander's figures indicated that it had so far been able to absorb Banesto without appreciably damaging its balance sheet. Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent excluding Banesto and at 19.73 per cent including it. The group's return on assets was 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped marginally to 0.98 per cent with Banesto. Non-performing loans as a percentage of banking group's total amounted to 6.37 per cent against 3.19 per cent if Banesto is not included in the consolidated results. Despite the higher figure resulting from Banesto's inclusion, coverage stood at 79.14 per cent and at 100.61 per cent if real guarantees are taken into account. Santander posted a net interest margin of Pta220bn including Banesto. Without Banesto, it was Pta188bn, 6 per cent higher than last year's third quarter. Without Banesto, Santander increased its operating profit by 10.8 per cent to Pta118bn. Banesto's addition to the consolidated account lifted the group's operating profit to Pta126bn. The high totals posted by Santander came in spite of strong losses in treasury operations. Income from fixed income and currency dealings fell from Pta74bn in the first nine months of 1993 to Pta7.5bn, including provisions of Pta13.5bn. Banesto was the object of a large rescue plan which included a Pta180bn capital injection, the purchase of Pta285bn worth of damaged assets by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a zero-interest loan of Pta315bn to offset current losses. Yesterday's results indicated that Banesto was already earning money for Santander. It added just over Pta9bn to the Santander group's third-quarter net profits of Pta80bn although the overwhelming proportion of this contribution was provided by Banesto's 25 per cent stake in the profitable Portuguese bank Totta &amp; Acores.</p>

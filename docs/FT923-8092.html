			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Row over refugees places UK presidency under fire A ROW over Britain's deportation of some refugees fleeing from the former Yugoslavia seems likely to add to irritation in other European capitals about UK policies during its EC presidency. Britain's Foreign Office yesterday admitted embarrassment over action by the Home Office, which handles immigration policy, to send back to other European countries this year 36 Yugoslavs seeking asylum in the UK. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees called on Britain yesterday to stop the deportations. British diplomats are worried that apparent insensitivity over Yugoslav refugees may hamper the UK's ability to give a lead in other EC policy areas. There is particular concern about adding to resentment in Germany - which is playing host to 200,000 refugees - about unequal sharing of burdens caused by the Yugoslav war. Baroness Chalker, UK overseas development minister, yesterday met Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister, to point out the diplomatic repercussions of the deportations. One UK official said there had been 'a fairly brisk exchange of words with the Home Office.' Mr Wardle did his best to play down the affair, pointing out that 2,000 Yugoslav applications for refugee status were under consideration. Only applicants who had spent considerable time in another country before coming to Britain would be removed, he said. Mr Wardle said the Dublin Convention required refugees to seek refuge in the first safe country they reach. 'We are interpreting that sympathetically,' he said. The Home Office added that, of the 36 deportations this year, only eight had taken place in July, instead of the 36 first reported. Austria and Hungary, the two countries most affected by refugees, yesterday intensified their calls for European solidarity. 'We want an equitable share of this problem. Hungary is already overstretched,' the foreign ministry in Budapest said. 'All European countries must take their share of the refugees,' an Austrian foreign ministry official said, expressing surprise at Britain's treatment of refugees. Signs of general vexation over Britain's handling of the EC presidency have appeared above all in the German press. Recent articles have complained about UK determination to give priority to British interests. Bonn, however, has distanced itself from the criticisms. France, which has also come under fire from Germany for its relative inactivity over Yugoslav refugees, has not joined in any noticable anti-British sniping. Members of the European parliament were fiercely critical of the British presidency at their meeting on the Yugoslav crisis on Monday, asking if the British government was up to the task it had been set. But British diplomats point out that the EC presidency will always have difficulty in reconciling the conflicting demands of presidential impartiality and national interest. One senior British diplomat pointed out yesterday that the presidency's ability to change the course of Community affairs was limited: 'A presidency can move the boat within the stream, and in that case it has some influence over the direction of the boat. But if it goes out of the mainstream, as the Dutch did this time last year (with unpopular proposals on political union), then it runs aground. I don't think we've run aground.' The EC is stepping up efforts to make sure that the embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro is tightly enforced, Andrew Hills reports from Brussels. The Commission yesterday tabled a plan to ensure that EC exports to other former Yugoslav republics reach their destinations and are not diverted to the two republics under embargo. Under the plan EC exports to ex-Yugoslav republics will be subject to a triple control. Exporters will not receive the usual export licence, unless they have an import licence and a commitment from the local authorities to check that the goods are delivered. If they cannot provide proof of delivery then new export licences will not be granted. It is hoped the rules will come into force on Monday.  ------------------------------------- REFUGEE CRISIS  -------------------------------------                 Number of                 refugees  ------------------------------------- Austria          50,000 Belgium             870 Czechoslovakia    4,000 Denmark           1,637 Finland             982 France            1,108 Germany         200,000* Greece                7 Hungary          50,000 Italy             7,000 Iceland               3 Luxembourg        1,000 Netherlands       6,300 Norway            2,331 Poland            1,500 Spain               120 Sweden           55,000 Switzerland      17,573 Turkey           15,000 UK                1,300 Others           30,000 TOTAL           445,731  ------------------------------------- * including 65,000 unregistered  -------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------                                        From Present                 From          Bosnia- location              Croatia       Hercegovina     Total  ------------------------------------------------------------- Croatia               266,500         333,000      599,500** UN protected areas     69,000            -          69,000 Serbia                163,000         224,500      387,500 Bosnia-Hercegovina     93,000         588,000      681,000 Montenegro              7,000          44,000       51,000 Slovenia                3,000          67,000       70,000 Macedonia               2,500          28,500       31,000 TOTAL                 604,000       1,285,000    1,889,000  ------------------------------------------------------------- ** Plus 19,000 from Vojvodina &amp; 12,000 from Kosovo  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

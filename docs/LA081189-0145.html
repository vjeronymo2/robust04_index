			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> OUT OF THIS WORLD;  </P> <P> EUROPEAN SATELLITE IN FAULTY ORBIT  </P> <P> Space scientists struggled today to try to correct the orbit of a $316-million  European satellite launched earlier this week after the engine that adjusts its  height refused to fire for the third time.  </P> <P> A spokesman for satellite builders Matra said the Hipparcos's apogee engine had  failed this morning. Technicians were working to locate the problem, and  another two attempts would be made this weekend.  </P> <P> Hipparcos, the result of 20 years work by the European Space Agency, is  designed to measure distance between stars and provide astronomers with  invaluable information about the structure of the universe.  </P> <P> An Ariane space rocket launched the satellite into elliptical orbit Tuesday,  but to function properly it needs to move into an elliptical orbit well away  from Earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> A Matra spokesman said that if the apogee engine could not be repaired, a  weaker motor meant for minute adjustments to the satellite's position in space  would be activated.  </P></p>

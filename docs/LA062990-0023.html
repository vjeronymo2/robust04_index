			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SHIFTING GEARS' ON BICYCLES, MOTORCYCLES  </P> <P> Not many people are up to making a long commute by bicycle; few people work  close enough to home to walk to work, and roller skating is an amusing idea but  not likely to make much of a dent in the problem. However, with proper  training, a person in average condition can become a safe, defensive motorcycle  driver.  </P> <P> An average motorcycle gets approximately 50 miles per gallon, so commuting by  motorcycle saves as much gas as two or three people car-pooling in an average  car. Two people sharing a cycle commute doubles the fuel savings. Cycles also  take up much less space on roads and in parking lots than do cars.  </P> <P> Although I don't own a motorcycle, I have several friends who use them as their  primary means of transportation, including commuting to professional jobs. And  I feel much less vulnerable as a passenger on a motorcycle than I would trying  to make my way through hostile, rush hour traffic on a 10-speed.  </P> <P> IRENE STRUTHERS  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

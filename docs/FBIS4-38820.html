			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Kopnov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- In two years' time, Russia, by  all appearances, will not prolong the treaty of friendship,  cooperation and mutual help signed by the former USSR and  People's Democratic Republic of Korea in 1961 for another five  years, a high-ranking official quoted Russian President Boris  Yeltsin as saying at a meeting with South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam.    In accordance with generally recognized norms, the treaty  may  be denounced at one year's notice, the source quoted Yeltsin as  saying.    The treaty does exist so far. However, Russia interprets its  first article, which provides for offering North Korea military  help automatically, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula,  in a somewhat different way. This provision is actually  ineffective, Yeltsin said.</p>

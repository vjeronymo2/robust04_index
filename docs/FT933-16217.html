			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: US economy While June's US employment report was unexpectedly weak, jobs grew strongly in the second quarter taken as a whole. And if the last four years are any guide the June figures may have to be be revised up in July. Thus Friday's employment figure may be an aberration. But other indicators such as the purchasing managers' data suggest a further slowdown. Economic growth may have been below 2 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter. These cross-currents make it difficult to determine an underlying trend in the US economy. One of the few things which is clear is that the improvement in productivity at the end of 1992, with strong growth but few gains in employment, is now being unwound. The small increase in inflation in the first quarter and rising precious metal prices are also a worry. Such signals may deter the Federal Reserve from altering its bias towards raising interest rates. Certainly there is little prospect of an early rate cut. With momentum slowing, interest rates stuck, and other leading economies mired in recession, strong economic growth in the second half of the year is a fading hope. Further pressure will come if Congress can agree a deficit reduction package during the summer. Higher taxes while the debt deflation process is still in train will do little for consumer confidence. Hence Mr Clinton's apparent enthusiasm for co-ordinated growth strategies in the run-up to the G7 summit. Given the improbability of such a deal, however, it seems increasingly hard to justify the optimistic rating of US equities.</p>

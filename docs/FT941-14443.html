			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury to buy French chocolatier for Pounds 18m Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks company, yesterday announced the acquisition of Bouquet D'Or for FFr160m (Pounds 18.4m). The consideration includes acquired debt and can be adjusted according to the balance sheet at completion. The cash payment will be met from Cadbury's resources. Bouquet D'Or, based in Villeneuve d'Asq, to the north of Paris, is a privately owned company which was founded in 1851 as a family business. It specialises in boxes of chocolate assortments, particularly praline products, and had sales in the year to April 30 1993 of FFr257m. Following the acquisition, the company will be managed by Chocolat Poulain, a subsidiary of the UK group. Mr Thierry Bouteil, managing director of Poulain, said that Bouquet D'Or products would continue to be marketed under their own brand. 'We have not bought the company to eat its brand but to develop it', he stated. Mr Bouteil said the combined sales of Poulain and Bouquet D'Or would represent about 13 per cent of the seasonal assortments sector of the French chocolate market and put Cadbury Schweppes in third place in terms of market share, behind Nestle and Lindt of Switzerland. The French chocolate market has resisted the effects of recession, increasing by about 2 per cent last year. Le Syndicat de la Confiserie, the French association of confectionery producers, estimates the size of the French chocolate market at about FFr11bn.</p>

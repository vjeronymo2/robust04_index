			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Tradecraft of the frequent flyer - Michael Holman instructs a friend in the art of getting on an overbooked aircraft Were it not for me, Tubby Fanshawe might to this day be languishing in Lagos, the victim of an overbooked flight. Tubby, an accountant on a three-year posting to Nigeria, had joined me at the check-in queue for the British Airways flight out of Lagos, the modern-day equivalent of being evacuated from Dunkirk. As Tubby banged on about this and that, I snapped. 'Tubby,' I said, 'I cannot talk, I'm concentrating.' 'What on earth do you mean?' he asked. I told him that the explanation would have to wait until we were on the aircraft. An hour later, gin-and-tonic in hand, I introduced Tubby to the tradecraft of the serious traveller. The wiles and ruses cover everything from getting upgraded and cheap tickets to keeping the adjoining seat vacant. But the six-hour flight to London allowed time for only one subject, perhaps the most important skill of all: securing a seat on an overbooked flight. Tubby had broken all the rules, and it had taken all my cunning to get him on the flight. 'Let me ask you a couple of questions,' I said, in between mouthfuls of those tasty, coated peanuts that make BA's club-class service so enjoyable. 'When you were standing in the queue distracting me, did you notice that chappie lurking near the desk?' Tubby nodded: 'The bod who looked like a cross between a maitre d' and a Heathrow baggage handler?' 'Right,' I said. 'And what's his job?' 'Haven't a clue.' 'BA station manager,' I told him. 'Did anything strike you about the chap who checked you in?' 'No,' said Tubby. 'Frankly all BA staff look the same to me.' 'He was the one you got shirty with at the city office. You hit the roof when he told you your name was not on the passenger list.' Tubby looked thoughtful. 'I wondered why you were so oily with him - commiserating about the difficult conditions they had to work under, power cuts and all that.' He drank deeply of his G&amp;T. 'Certainly helped at the check-in desk,' he admitted, adding: 'I expect my membership of BA's frequent-flyer club helped get me on the flight. That must count for something if the aircraft is full.' 'Certainly does,' I said. 'I noticed you have a blue card. Very embarrassing. Lowest in the pecking order. Deduct one point. Far better to play the experienced maverick who scorns Air Miles - score one point. Silver card, now that's a very different matter. Add two points. As for gold-card holders, they've nothing to worry about.' I warmed to my theme. 'You had luggage to check in. Deduct two points. And while we are on the subject, your performance at the hotel check-out counter this morning didn't help.' Tubby defended himself vigorously. 'That chap in front of me was taking ages.' I sympathised. 'Sure as eggs, Tubby, the chap in front of you who is taking an interminable time examining his hotel bill is a member of the cabin crew. One of life's mysteries. But it did not go down well with Captain Tyrell when you asked him to get a move on because you had a flight to catch.' 'How did you know who it was?' asked Tubby. 'Asked the clerk,' I told him. 'It's another card you can play. 'Is Ken Tyrell the captain on tonight's flight?' you inquire casually at the check-in counter. They cannot be certain, but you have introduced the possibility that you know the captain. You're less likely to be bumped off the flight list.' Tubby was getting cross. 'At least I had a book to read in the queue.' 'Mark of the amateur,' I countered. 'You miss the tell-tale signs of an overbooked flight. Body language changes, tense whispers into the mobile phones . . . seconds can count.' 'But when word got out, and they formed a scrum round the desk, you told me to sit tight.' 'I'd read the signs, Tubby. While you were engrossed in that pulp novel, I was chatting to the station manager.' 'What about?' 'I was asking if first class was full. I had my credit card in my hand, thus making it clear I was expecting to pay and not some cheapskate seeking an upgrade.' 'But what if there were first-class seats available?' asked Tubby. 'I knew it was chock-a-block, thanks to a precautionary phone call to BA reservations this morning. But it's not the first-class seat I'm after. I want to establish myself as a serious traveller. I ask the station manager to put me on the wait list, and it's an excuse to give him my card.' Tubby suddenly remembered something. 'But I saw you reading a paperback later]' he said. 'Paperback, yes. Novel, no. Contingency planning. I was consulting my Official Airline Guide. Never travel without it. Gives all direct scheduled flights within Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Just in case, I booked us on this evening's flight to Addis, with connecting flight to London. Got the last two seats.' Tubby was getting ratty. 'At least I dressed sensibly for the flight,' he said, his lurid track-suit outfit comfortably accommodating his paunch. 'Lightweight suit and tie for me,' I told him. 'Better chance of being upgraded.' Tubby's eyes lit up. 'Tell me how . . .' The timing was perfect. 'Mr Holman?' said the steward. 'Would you care to move to the front of the plane?'</p>

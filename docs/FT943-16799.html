			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Religion: converging and diverging with science Sir, Dr Denis Alexander's reply (Letters, June 25/26) to Professor John Postgate's article ('Religion: are we better off without it?', June 18/19) seems odd to an outsider. While observation shows that people may be both scientific and religious, logic suggests that religion and science themselves have little in common. They work in different ways; both make claims, but religious dogma can be neither verified nor falsified, whereas science is based on the verification and falsification of its hypotheses. They have different patterns; they both change, but religious creeds tend to diverge, whereas scientific paradigms tend to converge. They have different results; both offer answers to difficult questions, but religious doctrines explain nothing, while scientific research has explained more problems than anything else. It is true that religion and science are similar in some ways. Religious people and scientists, like clever people and artists, tend to make exaggerated claims about themselves. In fact no such group seems to behave better (or worse) than any other, and the only distinction may be that religious (and political) fanatics demand and justify atrocities, whereas scientists and technicians do the dirty work. But the fact remains that the religious method leads to myth and muddle whereas the scientific method leads to knowledge and understanding. Religion once claimed superiority over science, but was defeated in an open contest. It now claims equality with science, but it will be defeated again. Theology is no more a science than astrology or scientology. And continuing attempts to import theism into popular science have more to do with fashion and marketing than with serious science. In the end religion will be judged by science and science will be judged by ethics. Nicolas Walter, Rationalist Press Association, 88 Islington High Street, London N1 8EW</p>

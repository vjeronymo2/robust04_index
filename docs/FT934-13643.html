			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Industrial output up strongly in France FRENCH industrial production rose strongly in July and August, increasing by 1.3 per cent over June, according to figures from Insee, the national statistics institute. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per cent during the period. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said the figures were encouraging and supported his forecasts of a stabilisation in economic activity in the current quarter and a return to growth in 1994. Private sector economists and Insee, however, expressed caution. Insee described the statistics as 'fragile', adding that data for the summer period were less reliable than for other months. Industrial output in July and August, lumped together because of the summer holidays, was still 2.9 per cent down on the same period last year. 'The numbers are higher than expected,' said one Paris-based economist, who had forecast a rise of 0.3 per cent in July-August. 'But there is a relatively important margin of error. They signal a stabilisation of the situation rather than a recovery from recession.' Several economists believe France could suffer a 'double-dip' recession, with a contraction in the fourth quarter after recovery in the third. The government itself remains cautious about the performance of the economy. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister, said this week that gross domestic product was likely to contract by 1 per cent this year, instead of the 0.8 per cent decline forecast last month at the launch of next year's budget. He maintained the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in GDP next year. French industrialists also expect recovery in 1994, but at a slower pace. A forecast by the CNPF employers' organisation, based on a large-scale survey of member companies estimates growth of 1 per cent in 1994. The industrialists in the survey said they expected recovery would be slow and difficult. The CPNF said that a reduction in short-term interest rates to between 5 and 6 per cent, from their current level of about 7 per cent, was possible and necessary for economic recovery next year.</p>

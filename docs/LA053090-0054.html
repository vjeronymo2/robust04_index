			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISTER FRISKY DOUBTFUL FOR THE BELMONT  </P> <P> Mister Frisky has developed a respiratory problem that probably will keep him  out of the Belmont Stakes June 9, trainer Laz Barrera said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky, who went into the Kentucky Derby unbeaten, ran eighth to  Unbridled as odds-on choice and then ran third to Summer Squall as third choice  in the Preakness.  </P> <P> "He's had a temperature and he's been sick over the weekend," Barrera said.  "We're going to bring in a specialist in respiratory problems to look at him  tomorrow.  </P> <P> "But I don't think he could run in the Belmont even if he's OK tomorrow. He's  been treated with medication that has Procaine in it and that stays in a  horse's system sometimes for 15 days."  </P> <P> It is illegal for a horse to race with such medication in its system.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky, whose winning streak had included the Santa Anita Derby,  probably will go to California for a rest, Barrera said.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky was expected to be one of three starters in the Belmont with  eligibility to earn a $1 million bonus for the best performance in the Triple  Crown. But with Mister Frisky apparently sidelined, that means only Unbridled  and Land Rush could earn the bonus, which is decided on a 5-3-1 point basis.  Unbridled needs only to start and finish to earn the prize. For Land Rush to  earn it, he would have to finish third to earn at least one point and Unbridled  would have to skip the race.  </P> <P> Land Rush, seventh in the Derby and sixth in the Preakness, probably will be  the only Belmont Stakes starter for trainer Wayne Lukas, who is on a winning  streak.  </P> <P> Lukas won major races on both coasts Memorial Day. His son, Jeff, saddled  Criminal Type to win the $595,000 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park over  Housebuster and Easy Goer, and Lukas himself was with Steinlen, who won the  $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap over Hawkster at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> So far in 1990, Lukas-trained horses have earned $6.7 million. He is on a pace  to beat his record of $17.8 million, set in 1988. Lukas has led the nation's  trainers, based on money earned by their horses, for the past seven years.  </P> <P> Horses trained by Lukas have earned $2.6 million in May alone.  </P></p>

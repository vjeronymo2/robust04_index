			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Trusts offer the best way in For most investors, the only practical way of investing in emerging markets will be through a unit or investment trust, write Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton. Arguably, unit trusts have a potential disadvantage compared with investment trusts. Since a unit trust is an open-ended fund, the manager may find himself having to sell holdings quickly to meet redemptions if performance falters and investors want to liquidate their holdings. But this could be tricky in emerging markets which are relatively illiquid. Investment trusts do not have this problem. Instead, the trust might fall to a deep discount if the fund or the countries in which it invests become unpopular. Unit trusts for the global emerging markets are to be found in the crowded international equity growth sector. The top performer over three and five years to March 1 is an emerging markets fund: Prosperity Emerging Markets. This has returned growth of 293 per cent over the five-year period. City of London Emerging Markets is another in the top four funds for the same periods (HSW: offer to bid, net income re-invested). Investors preferring an investment trust have seven general emerging market funds to choose from: Abtrust, Beta, Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Govett, Kleinwort, and Templeton. A few months ago, most were looking very expensive, with shares standing at substantial premiums to net asset value. But the reversals in many emerging markets, and a change in sentiment in the UK, have made them more affordable. Willing risk-takers may be interested in the handful of single country funds, and regional funds for the Pacific rim and Latin America. But for anyone preferring a more cautious approach, many emerging markets investment and unit trusts have savings schemes which allow you to put in a fixed monthly amount. Nigel Sidebottom, a private client fund manager who specialises in investment trusts with stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, picks Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets as his favoured buy at the moment. This week's assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate hit F&amp;C's share price, like other funds with large exposures to that country, but Sidebottom says this could be viewed as a buying opportunity for anybody prepared to sit out short-term volatility. The F&amp;C fund does not have a long record under its present name and management. Formerly the New Frontiers Development trust, it started life as a US venture capital fund before mutating into an emerging markets fund under the management of Ivory &amp; Sime. F&amp;C took over the management only last September but Sidebottom says he has confidence in the team, which has wide experience in the various markets. Templeton, a longer-established and extremely popular trust in the sector, is raising new capital with a conversion share issue at present. Investments in the Templeton fund grew by more than 270 per cent over the three years to March 1 (source: HSW). While such spectacular returns cannot be guaranteed for the future, the fund's main manager, Mark Mobius, has a good track record.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television A group of some of South Africa's less charming citizens is the subject of Cutting Edge's investigation, Soweto Flying Squad (C4, 9.00). Here is the stuff of late-20th century heroics. The squad is made up of young men, single, white, and heavily armed. They patrol the violent streets of Soweto, shooting and being shot, in a nightmarish world of urban violence in which the niceties of legal procedure can have no place. The advance of capitalism in China, partly overt and partly by stealth, is the subject of two films in tonight's edition of South (C4, 11.00), the documentary series which screens the work of film-makers from the southern hemisphere. A film about Hong Kong focuses on the powerful alliance between leading figures in the colony's business life and the Communist hierarchy on the mainland, and the problems this poses for governor Chris Patten. Does Robert Redford, now pushing 60, still deserve to be called one of the best-looking men in the world? In Film 93 Special (BBC 1, 10.10) he talks to Barry Norman.</p>

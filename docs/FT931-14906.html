			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad accused of poor pricing and confused marketing AIRTOURS ACCUSED rival holiday group, Owners Abroad, of having a confused marketing strategy and poor pricing judgment which had led to a disappointing financial performance. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, called Owners Abroad's proposed link with Thomas Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, 'a poison pill' which was ill-conceived. It was liable to lead to an erosion of value for Owners Abroad's holders. In the offer document, posted to shareholders yesterday, Mr Crossland said an investor who bought Pounds 1,000 of Airtours shares five years ago would have had an investment worth Pounds 16,500 just before the Pounds 215.4m bid was launched on January 5. A similar investment in Owners Abroad would have been worth only Pounds 2,035. Owners Abroad said it saw little in the Airtours document that it had not already addressed but it would make a detailed rebuttal today. The company added that a Pounds 1,000 investment in Airtours on January 5 would now be worth Pounds 903. Airtours said that in the 1980s Owners Abroad had embarked upon a 'misguided policy of brand proliferation' which was now being reversed. Owners Abroad had 34 brands against Airtours' 16 and the three 'serious' brands sold by Thomson, the market leader. Mr Harry Coe, Airtours finance director, said the lack of focus was exemplified on the Greek Island of Kos where Owners Abroad was selling eight different holiday brands. An Owners Abroad adviser said that the company was not over-represented, rather Airtours was under-represented. Airtours said that Owners Abroad's recent increase in the capacity of its Air 2000 charter airline left it financially vulnerable to swings in market demand. A combined group would be able to absorb a significant amount of the surplus.</p>

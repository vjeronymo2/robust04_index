			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Russia boosts weapons exports Russia yesterday announced a big boost to its arms trade, with measures to support the increased export of weapons. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said Russia had earned Dollars 2.5bn from the sale of arms in the past year but was looking for a bigger market - up to Dollars 9bn a year - in coming years. Mr Shokhin is embroiled in a struggle for power with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy premier for finance, over who represents the government in relations with the international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF. Mr Shokhin said Russia would use export credits to finance the sale of arms, and would establish an export-import bank dedicated to the arms trade. 'If the international community supports the transformations going on in this country it should understand our desire to see Russia as an equal partner in this area and eliminate discriminatory barriers. This means changing legislation in countries which describes Russia as a communist state,' he said. Mr Shokhin was speaking after a trip by senior Russian officials to the United Arab Emirates, during which contracts were signed for arms exports, including the newest armoured personnel carriers. He said that 'we hope for billions of dollars of business' from Gulf states. Noting that Russia is owed Dollars 5bn by Iraq, Mr Shokhin said that 'if you can cool the heat of the ambitions of the Iraqi leadership', sanctions against the country could be lifted. Russia would then demand repayment of its debt in oil as the only means of payment available to Iraq. The deputy premier's optimism over arms sales has been echoed recently by other senior officials, including Mr Mikhail Maley, chairman of the interdepartmental commission of the Securities Council, who said that a 'new concept' was being worked out which would mean a sharp increase in the sale of arms abroad, largely aimed at achieving partial self-financing in the military industries - hard hit over the past two years by government cuts. Among areas considering arms purchases, Mr Shokhin listed the US, where the vertical take-off Yak101 is being tested; Sweden, testing the T72 tank; and Turkey, looking at helicopter purchases. Russia has postponed privatisation of half the Lada car plant due to disputes between its management and the government over where share auctions should be held, Reuter reports from Moscow.</p>

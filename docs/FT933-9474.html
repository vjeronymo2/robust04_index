			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Hill Samuel to advise DoT on Channel rail link THE DEPARTMENT of Transport has appointed Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, as its adviser on the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link in succession to Samuel Montagu. The move, the result of a re-tendering process which lasted several weeks, follows consultations by the department with private-sector companies on how the rail link could proceed as a joint project. This led to a change in the department's remit requiring more active work with the private sector. A large part of Hill Samuel's brief will be 'to generate interest in the private sector and go out more proactively'. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said: 'The rail link is now moving into a new phase. Public consultations on the route will have finished and it will have been safeguarded for planning purposes by the end of this year.' He added: 'The government has committed itself to making a substantial contribution towards the cost of the rail link, and we want to transfer the project to the private sector as soon as possible so that it can go forward as a joint venture between the public and private sectors.' The department said it was happy with the work completed by Samuel Montagu. It added: 'Because our concept of the brief had changed we thought it was only fair to start another tendering process. There is no implied criticism of Samuel Montagu, and the work they have already completed is very much the basis of how we go forward from here.' Hill Samuel said the project would involve mainly its corporate finance and project work arms. The rail link was the biggest public-sector project it had accepted, although it had previously taken on infrastructure financing overseas. Consultation with the private sector began on May 25. The department had originally hoped that conclusions on private-sector involvement would be reached by the beginning of July. Private-sector interest in the project has come from several companies, including Eurorail, a grouping which includes General Electric Company; Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotel group; and BICC, the engineering and construction company. Eurorail is chaired by Lord Parkinson, a former transport secretary, and its emergence was regarded as a strong indicator of enthusiasm for the government's attempts to attract private funding into public infrastructure. Arthur D. Little, the international firm of management and technology consultants, has been appointed an external professional adviser to the Department of Transport and the British Railways Board. It is to examine the structure of BR's engineering research and development division at Derby and arrangements for railway research and development in advance of the industry's privatisation. The consultancy will report on the best options to achieve a 'viable and competitive R&amp;D structure' within the industry and on funding arrangements. It has been asked to report by mid-December.</p>

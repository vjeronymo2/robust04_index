			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REZONING PUTS WRECKING CREWS AT THEIR DOORSTEPS  </P> <P> Not long after carpenter Steve Hunter finished remodeling the interior of his  home on a quiet, shady street in Hollywood, a neighbor knocked at his door with  the bad news.  </P> <P> It came in the form of a legal notice, tucked away in a newspaper's classified  ads, announcing plans by a developer to demolish the house just two doors away  from his.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ethnically Diverse  </P> <P> But the part that troubled Hunter most was that the property -- indeed, his  entire neighborhood -- had been approved for rezoning from residential to light  industrial.  </P> <P> "I was shocked. We've lived here for seven years and this was the first I'd  heard of it," said Hunter, who says that none of his Tamarind Avenue neighbors  were aware of the plan, either.  </P> <P> Yet city planners and officials of the Community Redevelopment Agency say that  plans for the ethnically diverse neighborhood, sandwiched between Sunset-Gower  Studios and the studios of KTLA television south of Sunset Boulevard, were no  secret.  </P> <P> They say the area, bordered by Sunset Boulevard, Bronson and Fountain avenues  and Gordon Street, where an estimated 1,000 people live, has been targeted for  limited industrial use since 1973, when the Los Angeles City Council adopted a  community plan for Hollywood as part of the city's general plan.  </P> <P> Since then, they say, at least three public hearings have addressed the issue,  including one in 1986, when the area was included in the CRA's Hollywood  redevelopment district, and another in 1987, when the City Council began  considering the zoning change. They say residents were mailed notices of each  of the hearings.  </P> <P> The council approved the rezoning last December and needs only to incorporate  the decision into an ordinance to make it official.  </P> <P> As part of the rezoning, the area of neat houses and small apartment buildings  will become home to what city officials envision as a cluster of sound labs,  film processors and other small companies serving the television and motion  picture industries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Comfort  </P> <P> But that is no consolation to Hunter and his neighbors, who accuse city  officials and those of the CRA of plotting the destruction of their residential  neighborhood without giving them an adequate chance to defend themselves.  </P> <P> "They can talk about public hearings all they want, but if nobody knew about  them -- and nobody I know of did -- then what kind of justice is that?" said  Hunter, who has joined dozens of his neighbors to oppose the rezoning.  </P> <P> They have organized a vigil to prevent the first of two planned demolitions of  houses in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century bungalow at 1433 Tamarind  that is said to have once been the home of the late actor Jay Silverheels, who  played Tonto in the TV series, "The Lone Ranger."  </P> <P> However, Hunter acknowledges there is probably little the group can do to save  the vacant house from the wrecking crew.  </P> <P> A developer last week received CRA approval to tear down the house and build a  4,000-square-foot rectangular industrial building with parking in what is now  the front yard. Neptune Development Co. of Santa Monica still needs final  approval from the Department of Building and Safety.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another developer intends to raze a house across the street and  build a three-story, 8,000-square-foot building with an eye toward attracting a  variety of entertainment-related tenants.  </P> <P> "They're gonna come in here and pick us off one house at a time, until there's  nothing left," said Eddie Gevoglanian, who has lived in the neighborhood for 12  years.  </P> <P> "Our property values will be shot down the tubes. Who's gonna want to live next  to a machine shop? . . . There are people here whose equity in their homes is  the only security they have, and this threatens to blow it all away."  </P> <P> New residential construction has been prohibited in the area for three years,  ever since the neighborhood was included by the CRA in the redevelopment  district, city planner Michael Davies said. Once existing homes are sold and  demolished, they may only be replaced with buildings approved for industrial  use, he said.  </P> <P> Jose and Mirna Rosales, who last year decided to add a bath and enlarge the  master bedroom of their Tamarind Avenue home after living there for five years,  apparently are the exception to the 3-year-old residential construction ban.  That was because the Department of Building and Safety mistakenly issued  permits for the work without first requiring the couple to obtain CRA approval,  a CRA spokesman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nobody Told Us'  </P> <P> However, the couple consider themselves anything but lucky.  </P> <P> "We spent $50,000 on our house, and we sure wouldn't have if we knew (the  neighborhood) was going to be industrial," Mirna Rosales said. "We didn't get  anything in the mail and nobody told us anything."  </P> <P> Hank Iiyama, 68, who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life except for a  year in a Japanese-American internment camp and two years in the Army during  World War II, has a similar complaint.  </P> <P> "Being retired, I make it my business to know what's going on with people in  this neighborhood," said Iiyama, who said he found out about the rezoning two  months ago, about the same time as Hunter. "Nobody I know was told anything  about it."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Alija Izetbegovic by Amir Hodzic </F> in Sarajevo on 3 February; monitored in progress -- live]    [Text] [Hodzic] ...the two aforementioned prominent ladies  [Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller] would like the situation concerning the  delivery of humanitarian aid to our country to improve. I think  that the reopening of Tuzla airport would to a great extent  improve the humanitarian situation. After the talks at NATO  headquarters in Brussels, let us recall, you said that the West  was close to a decision on taking military action to open Tuzla  airport and carry out the replacement of Canadian troops in  Srebrenica. However, Butrus-Ghali is still opposed to the use  of force, and this has not been done to the day.    [Izetbegovic] This has not been done, but I think that  regardless of how much Butrus-Ghali and others oppose it, I  think that Tuzla airport will be reopened at the end. Things  are moving in this direction. I think that these things are now  almost impossible to stop. There will still be some haggling  over this, but I think that Tuzla airport will be opened by hook  or crook. I think that the Serbian side will realize that they  should not run the risk of being attacked from the air and that  it will agree to this under certain conditions.    [Hodzic] They are obstructing it. In the past few days, the  shelling by the Serbian aggressor has intensified in the area  around the airport.    [Izetbegovic] Yes.    [Hodzic] They are doing this to show the international  community that the airport is not safe.    [Izetbegovic] I visited this airport about a month ago.  They are threatening the airport from some Crna Planina, Crni  Vrh, or whatever it is called. I think this is the name of the  hill where their artillery is. The hill from which they are  controlling the airport is approximately 5 km away, as the crow  flies. They know very well that if they put up resistance, this  position would probably be bombed, silenced, and neutralized. I  think that they will have to (?agree) to the opening of the  airport. Regarding the replacement of the Canadian battalion in  Srebrenica with the one from the Netherlands, I think that this  will also be accomplished in approximately 15-20 days.    [Hodzic] Mr. President, regarding the humanitarian  situation, the possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] and the UNHCR is frequently mentioned. What should be  done in this situation, if it arises?    [Izetbegovic] First, I would like to say that this is a kind  of blackmail at the time of negotiations. This is a kind of  unfair blackmail, a blackmail through food with starvation. Our  resistance is obviously resting on two factors -- arms and food.  Both of these factors, as you can see, are only partly in our  hands. Only a small part of it is in our hands. Food is hardly  in our hands altogether. We totally depend on humanitarian aid  for food. This is something that is unfortunately in someone  else's hands, in their hands. They are now trying to blackmail  us through this food to force us to accept something that we  should perhaps not accept.    However, we told them that in case they do decide to  withdraw  the troops, there would be no reason whatsoever for the embargo  to remain in force. We demand and will demand that in case this  decision is made, the arms embargo be lifted on the same day so  that we can defend ourselves and they can go their own way.    However, assessing the future course of events, it does  appears that they will stay here for some time. Therefore, in  my view UNPROFOR will not be withdrawing soon, in the  foreseeable future. I think that the situation will continue to  develop more or less in the same way as it has been developing  up to now. Food will be arriving in Bosnia-Herzegovina with a  varying degree of difficulties. There has recently been some  mention of a possibility of military helicopters escorting  relief convoys. I think that this will come about. They would  be able to remove the difficulties that could possibly (?arise).  We recently sent our soldiers, our army, a letter in which we  told them how important it was that we ourselves do not create  any difficulties.    As you known, there was an attack near Zenica, the murder of  a Englishman. This was actually supposed... this could only  have been done by someone totally blind, deliberately (?blind),  someone who is (?deliberately) working for someone else's  interests.    [Hodzic] This second reason is more likely.    [Izetbegovic] This second is very likely to have been the  case, because this was a direct attack on our main interest,  namely to secure a normal supply of food. Some forces in the  world were waiting for this to happen to raise the question of  UNPROFOR's withdrawal, to use this as an argument.    We acted swiftly and we found those responsible.  Unfortunately we cannot establish their motives [words  indistinct] all three kidnappers [words indistinct] stopped.  However, I think that there will be fewer difficulties in this  respect in the future.    [Hodzic] The Presidency of our state recently proposed that  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro recognize each  other. Would this be a fresh contribution toward the settlement  of the crisis of the former Yugoslavia?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, this would certainly be a step forward if  such mutual recognition did take place. We made that move but  are not convinced that they will accept this. Of course, we are  making a political point because we are showing that we do not  want war here. It is their turn now. They could accept it.  That would be a step forward. They could reject it. This  would then show that they have (?extreme) intentions concerning  Bosnia-Herzegovina. If they really want peace, they ought to  recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina and we will recognize them. We  could then negotiate [words indistinct] Bosnia-Herzegovina, as  we are negotiating now, but this would then be done from the  position in which our borders are mutually recognized. I do not  believe that they will respond positively to our move.    [Hodzic] Talking of Serbia and Montenegro, the two  aggressor states against Bosnia-Herzegovina, many international  agencies have recently written about the arrest of the Muslims  and the leaders of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in  Serbia and Montenegro. Do you have any more detailed  information about what is really going on there? What do we  want when it comes to Sandzak? Should the issue of Sandzak have  been stressed more vigorously in the international negotiations?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, we have been trying to do that, but our  words have always fallen upon deaf ears in that respect. We  have been demanding that the representatives of Sandzak  participate in the negotiations and are involved in the  negotiations, but that has been rejected. We keep repeating  this demand, and we will reiterate it at the next round of  talks, that the Sandzak delegation be allowed to participate in  the talks about the future of Bosnia- Herzegovina as an  interested party. As for this court trial, it is meant to  worsen the position of the Muslim people in Sandzak, both in its  Montenegrin part and the Serbian part. The SDA members have  been persecuted in both parts.    Two nights ago Montenegrin television showed pictures of a  group of 12 people who had been arrested, and who were said to  have had 13 rifles in their possession, as if they were going to  undermine Montenegro and Serbia with these 13 rifles. That can  convince no one. However, it can do something else. This is an  extraordinary political exploitation of a case in which the  entire Muslim nation has been accused of working against the  state, of being one disloyal part of it, which should then be  put against the wall. They have managed to do that. I think  that the position of the Muslims in Montenegro and Serbia is  very difficult. It was difficult even before, but now it has  deteriorated so that no one feels any security [words  indistinct] 12 people as far as I know, and the court trial  [word indistinct], while over 50 people here [words indistinct].    We have lodged protests from here, to no effect most likely,  but we have to draw the attention of the world to the very  difficult position of a part of our nation in Serbia and  Montenegro. This is an attempt to satanize a nation, to make  other people revolt against it, and make life and existence  impossible for the nation there. The trial that is in progress  in Serbia and the one that is being prepared in Montenegro have  that as the aim.    [Hodzic] Serbian mobilization has increased recently,  particularly of Serbian refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in  Serbia. They have been forcefully mobilized and returned to the  fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What does that mean?    [Izetbegovic] You see, they have problems -- we know that;  their military might is suffering from a shortage of people and  weapons. They have not had vast problems as far as weapons go,  since they had stocks of arms. For 40 years the Yugoslav Army  amassed arms in a paranoid way, spent huge amounts of money, and  stockpiled arms for 40 years. Just in the region of Sarajevo --  and I only established that later when I got here to this  building -- there were six or seven barracks just in the  Sarajevo region, and barracks and warehouses of arms throughout  the former Yugoslavia.    So they have never had problems with arms, but they have  always had problems with the other element, manpower, and with  the morale of that manpower. I think that this mobilization is  an attempt to improve the situation in that respect, to find new  youngsters to fight in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that has more of  a psychological aim -- to raise the poor morale a bit. I do not  think that this will significantly affect the balance of power  [words indistinct].    [Hodzic] Let us go back now to our western neighbor, the  Republic of Croatia, which -- after overwhelming evidence of its  open military deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has officially  been proclaimed the aggressor on our country. Mr. President,  you have had a chance to get to know the Croatian politicians  well. How can you explain this policy of theirs, a policy that  has led to open armed intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] How to explain it? That is an interesting  question, and the answer will be long in coming. But I would  like to give you my private view here. Tudjman is obsessed  about creating a Croatia with borders [words indistinct]. He is  a historian, by the way, and one that not only studies the past  but also lives in it. He cannot understand that this is not  1939, the eve of the World War II. If you remember, if you  recall, that was the climate in which Bosnia-Herzegovina was so  infamously partitioned, and this was on the eve of World War II.  Fascism ruled in Europe. But democracy rules in Europe now, so  the situation is completely different. In the old Yugoslavia  there was a different balance of power, and the Muslims did not  even exist as a political factor. Bosnia, as they say, fell  silently then. But not this time. We are putting up a  tremendous fight, and Bosnia is not falling.    Tudjman does not understand that, and he keeps pushing for  this partition of Bosnia. We would have defended ourselves from  the main culprit in the partition of Bosnia had it not been for  this stab in the back from the west. After all, this has also  damaged Croatia, since -- from the Serbian aggression on  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- this diversion by the HVO and Croatia  turned the conflict into some kind of civil war with three  warring factions, which in essence it is not. So the picture of  this war has been distorted, and the international public has  been confused about the character of the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. So the result of one vision from the past,  of one obsession to create a Croatia with certain borders [words  indistinct] thanks to such a balance of power, and generally the  constellation of the powers in the world, which today cannot be  established. Tudjman does not seem to want to see that. He is  pushing for partition, and at the same time signing agreements  with us, which we can see are not sincere, or is offering new  arrangements. Meanwhile he is negotiating something else with  Milosevic, something completely the opposite. We know that.    The Croatian Convention will be held here in two days, and  I think that it will steer things in another direction, or at  least we hope so. We know that the mood of the Bosnian Croats  is not for such an option, nor is the mood of a large part of  the Croatian public. Opposition parties and forces are against  such a policy. Changes are probably ahead. We will follow this  closely.    [Hodzic] Has President Tudjman perhaps stressed 1939 in your  talks? I think it is important to point out that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not exist then, and also that the  existence of the Muslim nation was neglected in 1939. Now we  have a completely different situation.    [Izetbegovic] Exactly. I have said so to Tudjman,  particularly when he told me that we were faced with the threat  of a bipartite partition of Bosnia. He said that what is on  offer now is a tripartite partition of Bosnia, and we are being  given a large part, the best part of Bosnia, and so on, but, he  said, if you reject that, you are risking the danger of Bosnia  being divided in two, just like in 1939. I told him that we did  not have 200,000 soldiers then, that the Muslim nation was  organized now, that this was the case now, and of course that  plan will not wash.    [Hodzic] Tudjman's recent proposal for a union of Croatia  and the Bosnian republic was rejected. If that proposal had  referred to the two internationally recognized states,  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, would it have been accepted?    [Izetbegovic] To tell you the truth, this is an issue of  great importance. None of us would have been authorized to  accept that definitely. We would have probably turned to our  Assembly and our public to decide whether that suited us. One  kind of link with Croatia would certainly suit us, a firm link,  because we are turned toward the West because we are driven in  that direction in our development. We would have a link with  the Western countries through Croatia. A sincere relationship  based on equality and mutual respect would suit us, if such a  relationship could be established. The public would probably be  in favor of such a firm link with Croatia. The problem is  obviously not between the nations but in the regimes. I do not  know whether it is possible to arrange something with the  current Croatian regime [words indistinct] a hypocritical  policy. We have to be very cautious about every arrangement.    [Hodzic] After everything that the Serbian and Croatian  aggressors have done to Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly to the  Muslim Bosniak people, will it be possible to preserve the  multinational Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] That is a very hard question. I would say  very briefly: We would have to have a bad case of amnesia for  that. You know what that means [words indistinct] to forget, to  forget many things, to wipe many things from the memory.  Whether one case of amnesia or more would be needed, I do not  know, but we will need to forget. Whether the people will be  able to forget is another question.    [Hodzic] Could you briefly sum up the work of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government led by Dr. Haris Silajdzic? You  know how busy the government is, particularly as far as the  humanitarian needs of the population are concerned. We spoke  about that earlier. How do you assess the results of the work of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government?    [Izetbegovic] I think we should wait a few more days for  that. The government will then have been in office for 100 days,  and it is common practice [words indistinct], after 100 days the  government normally comes out in front of the Assembly or the  public and reports on the results of its work. I think that the  prime minister will come out with a report to the Assembly on 7  February. He will report on his results. Let us wait for that.  Then we will see how realistic the results are. What can be  seen now is that the government has finally started functioning,  because we practically had no government [words indistinct] you  could not have called that a government. That was more of a  [word indistinct] body, which was paralyzed [word indistinct].  This government is without a doubt putting in a sincere effort  to do something, and under very hard conditions, too [passage  indistinct].    There is a division of duty, according to our laws. The  division of authority is not so strict, but it is known that the  Presidency has the final say in the field of foreign policy, the  army, and interior affairs. So the foreign affairs, interior  affairs, and the army are within the authority of the  Presidency, the body that I chair. All other things are more or  less within the authority of the government. The three fields,  probably the most important ones [words indistinct] are within  the authority of the Presidency. I think that the government  has no problems when it comes to support; it has our full  support. Everything it has proposed has been accepted without  serious problems [words indistinct] nor will it have any in  future, I hope [words indistinct].    [Hodzic] Mr. President, at the end of this program, I  would like you to answer some questions that every so often tend  to confuse the public. I am referring to the support of the  Muslim countries to Bosnia-Herzegovina. How do you see this  support, and is it sufficient?    [Izetbegovic] Regarding the support of the people, this  support is general. This support is total and we are completely  satisfied. Therefore, the Muslim people support  Bosnia-Herzegovina and are profoundly interested in what is  going on here.    Regarding the governments, the situation is not the same.  Some governments do not support Bosnia-Herzegovina at all,  while some are indifferent. These countries are in the  minority. Some governments strongly support Bosnia-Herzegovina,  although this number is not so great either. Some countries are  extending support, (?limited) political and material support.  Therefore, to be brief, there is a general support from the  people and fairly selective support by the governments.    Nevertheless, one should say that this support is important  and has perhaps been crucial for Bosnia-Herzegovina in all  respects. We (?have) friends all over the world. We also have  many friends outside the Muslim countries. However, the support  from this category of countries, the Muslim countries, has  indeed been crucial and decisive. I think that this support  will continue. The Muslim world, which is an enormous world of  a billion people, could have perhaps done more.    The prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, two very  important countries, were here yesterday. I suppose Turkey will  become a small giant in this part of the world. Turkey today  has approximately 60 million people, and its national income is  over $100 billion. This is a strong economic power whose  strength is on the rise. This also applies to Pakistan. These  two countries have over 200 million people alone. These two  countries, for instance... Saudi Arabia must also be mentioned  as a country that is helping Bosnia-Herzegovina; Iran, too,  [words indistinct] then Malaysia is very important country, even  though it is very far away, several thousand kilometers. We are  in opposite time zones, so you can see how geographically far  away this world is and yet it is very interested in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ordinary citizens there know quite a bit  about our situation. Their government is very interested.  Indonesia is a very large country that is just beginning to  display an interest in our problem. This is a big country with  almost 200 million people; it has very strong potentials. All  this is something that is of great importance (?for our country)  right now and in the future.    [Hodzic] It is claimed that the support and help from these  countries is more concrete than the declarative support of the  countries in the West.    [Izetbegovic] We must not forget one thing regarding  humanitarian aid. The help from the West is not negligible.  For instance, regarding the sending of UNPROFOR troops, you  must know that France is well represented, as is Britain. The  Netherlands has also become well represented, while Canada used  to be. I am sorry that the United States is not among them.  This would then be a decisive factor.    So, we cannot ignore the help from the Western countries.  This help is, of course, selective and is precisely worked out  to maintain a balance, a situation in which they can dictate a  political solution. They are not letting us significantly gain  in strength so that we may set our own conditions. All in all,  we are managing to somehow coordinate this help, to use this  support for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and prolong the  resistance, to strengthen the defense.    [Hodzic] Mr. President, our program Open Studio is coming to  an end. I would like to ask you whether, at the end of our  program, you perhaps have a message for the people and the  defenders of our country.    [Izetbegovic] Yes. I would like to say to our people and  our defenders to keep going. I would like to express gratitude  on the part of the government and the people for what they have  done in the defense of the country. My message to the people is  not to lose hope, for things will improve, that we are not alone  in the world, and that, as you can see from what I said earlier,  we have many friends, and that the cause for which we are  fighting cannot be defeated.    [Hodzic] Mr. President, thank you very much for being a  guest of Open Studio of the Radio of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

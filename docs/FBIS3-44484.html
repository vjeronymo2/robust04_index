"This year the production of offshore and inland  fish-farming  has for the first time outstripped marine-fishery output," said  Zhuo Youzhan, Director-General of the Ministry's Department of  Fishery.    Aquatic output from fresh water and offshore fish-farms has  grown steadily over the past decade, Zhuo added, and this year  will account for some 52 percent total fishery production.    Offshore fish-farm output increased 350,000 tons, a 24.6  percent jump, while freshwater farm output grew 690,000 tons, up  15.7 percent through November. Total aquatic production is  expected to reach 17 million tons.    Nonetheless, the decline of marine resources hampered  further  increase in overseas fishing output, with this year's catch  expected to total 530,000 tons, up only 9 percent from last  year, Zhuo said.    He attributed the steady growth of aquatic production to the  expansion of fish farms, the improved breeding of fries and  fingerlings and the introduction of advanced skills and  technologies in the fishery sector.    Fresh water fish-farm acreage benefiting from exploitation  of  low-lying and waterlogged lands has reached 4.2 million hectares  in 1993, about 140,000 more than last year.    Thanks to an increased demand for more sophisticated species  in light of raised living standards, Zhuo predicted that total  aquatic production would top 18 million tons in 1994--the target  set for 2000.    He warned, however, that a chain reaction caused by the  skyrocketing price of diesel oil has seriously hindered the  development of the seawater catching industry.    Many high-power ships have had to stop fishing prompting  increasing use of small low-power ships and aggravating the  overkill of already dwindling resources in shallower waters.    Insuffcient management of frie [as published] and fingerling  importation, aquicultural water administration and monitoring of  environmental conditions have spread some fish-depleting  diseases this year Zhuo said.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S OBSTACLES TO MOVIES ABOUT AIDS  </P> <P> As any recent traveler to West Africa will attest, the truly ignored victims of  AIDS are not homosexuals, intravenous drug users or even hemophiliacs. By far  the largest bloc of AIDS sufferers are ordinary African men and women who are  dying by the millions in conditions we in America can barely imagine.  </P> <P> These people far outnumber those unfortunate upscale homosexuals whose life  styles are depicted in "Longtime Companion" (the subject of David J. Fox's May  13 article, "They Found Out How Tough a Sell AIDS Really Is").  </P> <P> Can we hope that a sympathetic screenplay is even now on a producer's desk  somewhere in Hollywood? Perhaps. But how many African-American producers are  there who would have sufficient clout to lobby for such a movie to be made?  </P> <P> PAUL L. G. WARE  </P> <P> Tujunga  </P></p>

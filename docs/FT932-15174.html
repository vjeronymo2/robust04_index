			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Rabin and Mubarak meet in bid to put peace talks on schedule ARAB delegations to the Middle East peace talks will wait until Saturday before deciding whether to attend the next round of negotiations scheduled for Washington on Tuesday. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the last effort at conciliation yesterday when he met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, in Ismaliya on the Suez Canal. The talks were the final stage of a series of contacts involving the US, Israel, Egypt, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon. Senior representatives from the four Arab delegations will meet in Damascus tomorrow and Saturday to make their decision. Mr Mubarak said there were 'very great hopes' that peace negotiations would resume on schedule but neither he nor Mr Rabin offered any details on the substance of their talks. While Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to proceed with negotiations, the Palestinians have demanded that Israel should pledge not to repeat the December deportation of more than 400 men from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel has indicated that it may be prepared to take back some Palestinians who had been deported over the past several years and also allow Palestinians from east Jerusalem to become members of its negotiating team. Mr Rabin confirmed yesterday that Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who comes from east Jerusalem and is the leading Palestinian in the West Bank, could in future head the Palestinian delegation. It might indicate some easing of Israel's previous insistence that it would not discuss the status of east Jerusalem, which it annexed after the 1967 war. At a news conference later the Israeli leader reassured Palestinians that their two peoples would ultimately settle their conflict based on a swap of land for peace.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentator article: "The Existing Problems With the </F> Quality of Imported Grain Need Attention"]    [Text] From January 1993 to March 1994, the port of  Dalian imported grain from overseas and Hong Kong in three  varieties and 3,715 batches, for an overall volume of  1.371486518 tons, of which 2,041 batches were up to standard,  involving 1.031657668 tons, or 75 percent, while 674 batches  were substandard, involving substandard grain imports of  348,828.85 tons, or 25 percent of the delivered volume. The  inspection and appraisal of grain imports by Liaoning's  Commercial Inspection Bureau at the port of Dalian show that  imported grain is subject mainly to the following quality  problems:    1. Substandard product imports make up quite a large  percentage. From January 1993 to March 1994, the port of Dalian  imported 3,715 batches of grain, for a gross volume of  1.371486518 tons. Through strict and legal inspection by  Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau, it was discovered that  674 of these batches were substandard grain imports, involving  substandard grain imports of 348,828.85 tons which, calculated  by quantity, meant a substandard grain-import rate of 25  percent.    2. Certain batches have even more severe quality  problems. For instance, from January 1993 to March 1994, we  imported from the U.S. 984 batches of wheat, for a gross volume  of 495,120.894 tons, of which Liaoning's Commercial Inspection  Bureau found 671 batches to be substandard, for a total  substandard volume of 348,016.85 tons, or 70.29 percent of all  wheat imported from the United States. Meanwhile, we imported  from Mongolia two batches of barley, for a volume totaling 560  tons. Inspection by Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau  found that both batches of barley imported from Mongolia were  substandard products. The reasons for this were: 1) the  germination percentage did not conform to contract provisions;  2) the inner quality was worse than the outward appearance. For  both of these substandard grain imports, the Liaoning Commercial  Inspection Bureau promptly signed and issued documents stating  that they were substandard, turning them over to the concerned  parties for foreign damage claims. As to the existing quality  problems in grain imports at the port of Dalian, the Liaoning  Commercial Inspection Bureau has made the following suggestions:    1. For grain imports, concerned departments must  present damage claims as quickly as possible to overseas firms  based on the damage-claim documents signed and issued by the  commercial inspection sector, retrieving the Chinese side's  economic losses as soon as possible, to protect the Chiness  side's legitimate rights and interests.    2. All departments in charge of grain imports, when  signing contracts with overseas firms for grain imports, must  act in line with international practice, by setting forth  clearly and in detail grain-import variety, grade, volume  (weight), quality, packaging, and inspection damage-claim terms.  The terms must be set forth clearly and in detail, with no  ambiguity, and inspection terms having clear inspection grounds,  as well as reasonable damage-claim validity periods and quality  guarantees.    3. All grain-import consignment and user units, when  receiving overseas grain imports from now on, must take the  initiative to promptly submit them for inspection to  commercial-inspection organs at the stipulated times and sites,  being allowed to sell and use them only after the  commercial-inspection sector has inspected and signed and issued  documents certifying that they are up to standard. If they are  sold or used without being inspected by the commodity-inspection  sector, when quality problems are discovered, and the  claim-damage periods have expired, there is no way to claim  damages from foreign firms, which is bound to create unnecessary  economic losses for the consignment and user units, as well as  for the broad masses of consumers.    These suggestions by the Liaoning Commodity-Inspection  Bureau should be brought to the attention of all concerned  parties which, just like the business commodity-inspection  sector, should combine management with inspection to do a strict  job of guaranteeing grain-import quality.</p>

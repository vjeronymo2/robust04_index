			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]    The prize of the Institute for East-West Studies (IEWS)  jointly awarded to the Slovak and Hungarian presidents, Michal  Kovac and Arpad Goncz, is, in fact, an open call for the two  countries' responsible politicians to start dealing at last with  the idea of a historical compromise, the independent NARODNA  OBRODA says.    "Kovac and Goncz are actually only symbolic proponents and  creators of this objectively inevitable process although symbols  are irreplaceable and very necessary," the daily notes.    Realistic people on both banks of the Danube River are fully  aware that what had happened between French and Germans or  Austrians and Italians must happen between Slovaks and  Hungarians as well, the paper states.    Afterwards, the Slovak-Hungarian compromise could serve as a  model for the rest of the postcommunist world, including  Hungary's other neighbors. "It is in Slovaks' and Hungarians'  own interest not to postpone the process," the daily adds.    "The framework has been created, there is willingness and  courage. If the process is halted, or something worse occurs,  the present and future generations could curse their fathers and  grand- fathers for not having used the offered historical  chance. And it is here, indeed," the paper concludes.</p>

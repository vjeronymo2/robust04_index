			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Boris Yeltsin: Russians Take a Long </F> Time Getting Ready, But Then Move Quickly. Meeting Between  Leaders of Top World Companies and Russian Government Ends in  Moscow"]    [Text] A meeting between Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin and a group of leading foreign entrepreneurs was  held in the Kremlin yesterday. Russian Federation Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin also took part in it.    The president's press service reported that Boris Yeltsin  noted that the widespread opinion among foreign investors that  Russia is a country with a high level of political risk is  already outdated. The political situation has stabilized over  the past few months, which creates a favorable climate for the  investment process. "Russians take a long time getting ready,  but then move quickly," Boris Yeltsin stated. "We are ready.  Now we will move more quickly."    Around half of all the edicts on economic reform signed  since  23 May this year are devoted to normalizing the production and  investment processes, the president pointed out. There have  also been successes in the fight against inflation, and the  prerequisites for reviving the investment process are in  evidence.    The president supported and made a high assessment of the  idea of setting up the Russian Federation Government  Consultative Council on Foreign Investment.    The main result of the Moscow meeting between the top  leaders  of world companies and the Russian Government has been the  setting up of the Consultative Council on Foreign Investment in  Russia, Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  stated. He was speaking yesterday at a press conference devoted  to the conclusion of the two-day sessions the the President  Hotel, during which Russian ministers and the top leaders of 14  multinational corporations and banks from the Western countries  and Japan conducted a direct dialogue on the problems of capital  investment in the Russian economy.    Summing up the meeting's results, Viktor Chernomyrdin  announced that henceforth the government will resolve questions  of improving Russian legislation in the sphere of investment,  changes to the tax system, and, in general, the formation of  economic and legal conditions to encourage investors in  conjunction with its Western partners. "A qualitatively new  structure has emerged," Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed -- "the  Consultative Council on Foreign Investment, which represents the  `organized interest' of major foreign investors implementing  their plans in the Russian business sphere and moving toward a  free market."    The Russian Government is already proposing dozens of ready  projects in heavy and light industry, and in conversion sectors,  but these are hard to implement owing to the disorganized state  of legislative and fiscal mechanisms, the Russian prime minister  stressed. As he put it, the participants in the President Hotel  meeting put forward a lot of fair criticism of the vague nature  of Russian normative acts and the inconsistency of their  implementation and of the lack of coordination between the  actions of federal and local authorities. We will strengthen  executive discipline at all levels of Russian power and we  guarantee to Western investors that all acts of legislation in  the foreign investment sphere will be observed, Viktor  Chernomyrdin stated. The activity of the three standing working  groups that have been set up will be devoted to solving specific  problems, he said.    Viktor Chernomyrdin particularly stressed that foreign  investment makes it possible to prevent unemployment from  "sweeping" Russia as a result of bankruptcies and the  liquidation of loss-making enterprises. By investing capital,  investors primarily create jobs.    The participants in the President Hotel meeting made a high  assessment of the level of interest and openness shown during  the meeting, the joint communique on the results of the sessions  says. They expressed confidence that the active participation of  all council members in its work will be the guarantee that  Western capital's participation in developing the Russian  economy will be galvanized. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  will coordinate the activity of the Council on Foreign  Investment. Its next session will be held sometime this  November.</p>

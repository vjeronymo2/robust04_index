Danilov-Danilyan, minister </F> of environmental protection and natural resources, by  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov under the rubric  "Opinion. ZELENYY MIR Files"; place and date not given: "Russia  in an Ecological Zugzwang"]    [Text] Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan told  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov: "We and the West  alike need Western aid."    Danilov-Danilyan: ...Dozens of cities in Russia  have absolutely impermissible indicators of air pollution. If we  omit the word "absolutely," the number of such cities will  come...to 110. These are not some kind of provincial towns but  rather large industrial and administrative centers, including  the capital city. In many places, pollutants are superimposed  over one another in a way: transportation generates nitrogen  oxide and carbon monoxide, the iron and steel industry generates  sulfur dioxide and benzopyrene; the chemical industry generates  formaldehyde, phenol, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The cumulative  effect of this cocktail is menacing, and the residents of cities  such as Kemerovo, Nizhniy Tagil, Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk,  and Saratov suffer incredibly because of this.    Most bodies of water are in an impermissible condition. The  Volga is no longer a great Russian river but, by analogy with  the Danube, which is called "Europe's cesspool," it fully merits  the name of "Russia's cesspool." The Ladoga, Omega, Neva, North  Dvina, and virtually all rivers of the Urals are polluted....  The Bering and Kara Seas have become a cemetery for  decommissioned nuclear reactors; a favorable situation in regard  to radiation is out of the question there. In general,  radioactive contamination is our worst ecological problem: There  are Chernobyl, Kyshtym, and dozens of oblasts with poorly  controlled storage facilities.    Frolov: It would appear that the list of our  ecological troubles could go on forever. As you see it, what  kind of resources will be needed in order to contain, if not  eliminate all of this?    Danilov-Danilyan: If monetary terms are at issue,  it is very hard to make this assessment. For example, how can we  appraise the extinction of a biological species or the damage  done to a genetic pool? Of course, it is possible to count the  dead forests, sick leave, and losses caused by the corrosion of  metal. However, the result will be far from the truth.    As far as containment is concerned, this is a major problem  indeed, because we are increasingly posing a danger to our  neighbors. This is not necessarily a catastrophe on the scale of  Chernobyl during which dozens of foreign radiation control  stations recorded a leap in the radiation background. For  example, our Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines are the main  source of air pollution with sulfur dioxide in Scandinavia which  affects Norway, Finland, and to a lesser degree Sweden. There is  a draft to retrofit the combines by the Finnish company  Outokumpo which will cost $640 million. Of this, Finland and  Norway are prepared to pay $100 million and to extend credit for  the rest which will be repaid with the products of the combine.  Economic calculations have shown that the combine will not be  recouped on such terms either. I raised the issue of looking for  additional sources of financing with the ministers of ecology of  these countries, and by all signs, they are prepared to do it.    Frolov: Therefore, previously it was customary to  refer to international ecological cooperation, whereas at  present it makes sense to talk about Western ecological aid.  What could it be about?    Danilov-Danilyan: First of all, investment,  technology, and know-how, and, to a lesser degree, consultation  and training. Most unfortunately, everything happens the other  way around.    At present, Russia lacks money rather than brains. Large  investment into major transformations at a multitude of  enterprises is needed to improve the situation because  expenditures at the early stages of technological processes are  the most effective.    It is necessary for ecological programs to cooperate with  other commercial activities of foreign companies in our  territory. We should grant all manner of preferences if they are  prepared to finance such programs, and not at their own facility  which is simply mandatory under the contracts, but in other  areas not directly associated with the facility.    Not only we, but the West itself needs for us to receive  Western aid. At present, they are discussing in earnest, and  justifiably so, the prospects of global warming which does not  promise humanity anything good. It develops because of the  accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily  carbonic acid which is generated in the process of combustion of  energy resources. It turns out that it is profitable for all  developed countries to invest funds in...planting forests in  Russia rather than retrofitting their quite clean industry.  Forests are a powerful drain on carbonic acid. One hectare will  eliminate an amount of it which could not be cut back by  investing the same funds in retrofitting any of the worst  enterprises in any developed country. Besides, there is nowhere  else to plant forests but in Russia....    Frolov: Will we be able to rescue our ecosphere  ourselves if aid is not provided for one reason or another?    Danilov-Danilyan: All data obtained in recent  years prompt me to respond in the negative: Perhaps, we will not  be able to. Irreversible changes in natural systems and the gene  pool will occur faster than the economy developing without  Western aid can become strong enough to restore nature. Nature  cannot wait, and if things develop at the same pace, one  generation from now there just will not be anyone to pull this  weight. We have faced an ecological zugzwang, and have been  dealt a blow which is the hardest to deflect from a direction  that we have thought about the least.</p>

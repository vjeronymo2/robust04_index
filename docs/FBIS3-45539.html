Salih stated: Despite a series of changes which have taken  place in the international situation, Sudanese-Chinese relations  are still enjoying healthy development. This is a result of  upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence in their  foreign policies.    Salih added: The forthcoming visit to Sudan by Chinese State  Council Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will more  effectively promote the development of friendly relations  between the two countries. The Sudanese people are proud of  their friendship with China.    He pointed out: Sudanese-Chinese friendly relations have a  long history. Sudan was among one of the earliest countries to  support China's participation in the United Nations. The two  countries established diplomatic relations as early as 1959. He  added: The Sudanese people will never forget the Chinese  people's assistance. In the past, China provided Sudan with  eight loans which played an important role in Sudan's economic  development.    Salih also stressed that China has consistently supported  the  stand of the Third World in international affairs and has won  the respect of the world's public opinion as well as that of the  Third World.</p>

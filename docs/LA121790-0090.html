			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSES LOSE IN CLEANUPS;  </P> <P> LAWYER ADVISES COMPANIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS;  </P> <P> QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS  </P> <P> Last month, President Bush signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1990, which  some experts have touted as the most comprehensive legislation ever enacted to  protect the environment. The law requires nearly every major industry to  drastically cut its emissions of pollutants by the year 2000.  </P> <P>  The law also strengthens regulations regarding land and water pollution. The  message to business is clear -- clean up your act. The small- and medium-sized  business person thinking this call to action applies only to oil refineries and  car manufacturers is in for a rude awakening. Those polluting the environment  are receiving record fines and even prison sentences if prosecutors can prove  criminal negligence.  </P> <P>  Robert Stewart has served as an environmental lawyer since the late 1970s. He  briefly worked as a chemical engineer at Union Carbide Corp. before attending  law school at the University of Michigan. After graduation, he went to work for  the law firm of Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue. He has worked at the firm's  offices in Cleveland, Dallas, Austin, Tex., and, most recently, in Irvine.  </P> <P>  The firm represents General Motors plants in California, Texas, Louisiana and  Massachusetts. Texas Instruments is another client. Stewart and his colleagues  have litigated cases in all 10 regions of the Environmental Protection Agency  involving more than 100 waste cleanup matters, helping companies arrive at the  most cost-effective solution. Because one company can be held liable for  cleaning up an entire waste dump, environmental lawyers are employed to make  sure no parties pay more than their fair share of the damage. Stewart, 39,  recently sat down to talk about what companies need to know about environmental  laws with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch.  </P> <P> Q. What are the major pieces of legislation that apply to Orange County  businesses, both federally and locally?  </P> <P> A. The major federal and state legislation tend to parallel each other because  both governments need to deal with the same issues in the environment.  Generally there would be both a state and federal Clean Air Act that would  regulate any kind of emissions of pollutants or contaminants that go into what  we call the ambient air -- outside air. Then there are the statutes that  regulate waste materials -- what results after the manufacturing process --  known as the Resource Conservation Recovery Act. The federal regulations in  that area have historically focused on hazardous waste whereas the state  regulations have historically been broader to focus on both hazardous waste and  non-hazardous waste. What we've learned over the years is that non-hazardous  waste has a lot of very hazardous things in it. And then there are laws about  messes made in the past. The principal statute there is something we call  Superfund, which imposes strict liability for past disposal of waste and  requires companies or individual owners of property to clean up the mess.  Finally, there are the Clean Water Acts, both federal and state. Those would  regulate discharge of pollution into our waters.  </P> <P> Q. Anything else?  </P> <P> A. Those are the real highlights and there are a lot of laws filling in the  gaps. For instance, there's a federal law called the Toxic Substance Control  Act that is designed to regulate anybody who is inventing new chemicals to make  sure we're not producing some more toxic substances.  </P> <P> Q. How do these laws affect relatively pollution-free businesses, such as a  travel agency or an insurance firm?  </P> <P> A. Perhaps the biggest impact is in the area of real estate. Everyone must  ensure that the property they are purchasing for their business isn't  contaminated in any way because, if it is, they might be held liable for some  of the cleanup even if they weren't responsible for the mess.  </P> <P> Q. You read in the newspaper about somebody getting fined by the EPA or the  state for something as seemingly innocuous as dumping a can of motor oil. Why?  </P> <P> A. Perhaps they change the oil in a delivery truck. The engine oil in  particular has some very toxic chemicals. They are created during the  combustion process in the engine so that the engine oil that you take out of  your car is more toxic than regular oil. It has a lot of chlorinated  hydrocarbons in it. There has been plenty of effort at the state and local  level to set up recycling programs at the local gas stations where people can  take their used motor oil and deliver it.  </P> <P> Q. How do regulators know someone has dumped some oil?  </P> <P> A. Typically there are reporting requirements. If you spill hazardous materials  on the ground, you need to report that to the local fire department or the  local county agency, depending on whether you're in a city or a county  jurisdiction. Probably a lot of small-business owners don't know about those  requirements so they might get caught because a disgruntled employee knows that  some dumping went on in the past. But I don't want to underemphasize the  difficulty in enforcement. It's very difficult to catch.  </P> <P> Q. What common types of pollution emanate from typical businesses?  </P> <P> A. I think we'd be surprised at the number of businesses that do have air  (pollution) emissions. For instance, utility boilers used to regulate the  temperature in a building. The South Coast Air Quality Management District  regulations cover very specific types of sources whether they are furniture  builders or printing plants.  </P> <P> Q. Can you think of a business we might not ordinarily suspect of being a  polluter?  </P> <P> A. Bakeries have some air emissions. And restaurants have a lot of grease  disposal.  </P> <P> Q. Let's say you're a bakery. How do you make sure your air emissions are  within the limits set by law? Do you have to ask an environmental attorney?  </P> <P> A. The best thing for the very small business to do would be to try to attend  one of the South Coast District's public workshops to become familiar with  their rules, just like you might learn about new fire codes affecting your  business. I think more small businesses have to realize that the environmental  laws are going to be with them forever. Fire codes didn't exist years ago.  People don't run out and hire an attorney every time there's a new fire code;  they call the fire department. Tell the district what your emissions are and  they will tell you the designated amount allowed.  </P> <P> Q. What if your emissions exceed what's allowed?  </P> <P> A. Hire an air-quality engineer or a land specialist or an expert in whatever  area you're talking about.  </P> <P> Q. So where do environmental lawyers come into the picture?  </P> <P> A. If you get a notice of violation, I think that would be an indication to  call an environmental attorney.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think that most small businesses, such as dry cleaners and furniture  manufacturers, realize that they need to comply with all of these regulations?  </P> <P> A. I think that they're still very much in a reactive mode. Rather than  developing a relationship with the South Coast district like they have with  other regulators, they are simply reacting to another regulation. The  regulators aren't typically as attuned to what a business can and can't do as  the business itself. So getting involved with the agencies will serve two  purposes. It will make the regulations more reasonable and increase awareness  of those regulations. People become aware of these now in a very roundabout way  and at a very late stage. Some become aware of it when they get a notice of  violation.  </P> <P> Q. The clean air regulations must be several thousand pages from the looks of  your books. Is it becoming prohibitive for manufacturers to do business in  Orange County?  </P> <P> A. I know of at least one furniture manufacturer who used to do all its  production here. Now, the company uses outside contractors for most of its  coating, painting and foam manufacturing. It simply assembles the product here  in Orange County. Unfortunately, this is one area where other areas of the  country may have an advantage over Orange County because they don't have the  ozone pollution problem. Because there will be no more difficult place than  Orange County to do business in terms of air quality regulations, you might see  these operations moving to other parts of the United States or to Mexico.  </P> <P> Q. Regarding land pollution, what kind of problems do companies encounter  trying to figure out just how much they need to contribute to the cleanup of a  dump?  </P> <P> A. As soon as you get a notice that you're involved with property that has been  contaminated, I think you need to get an environmental lawyer involved unless  it's extremely minor contamination. What happens is that the EPA or the state  will eventually get around to notifying the companies that sent waste there.  These companies are called "potentially responsible parties" or PRPs. The  earlier in the process you have a lawyer, the better. One person could be held  liable for the whole amount. So you need to be in there talking about the  allocation process. Some of these clean-ups can cost $50 million, $100 million  or $300 million.  </P> <P> Q. What can a lawyer do in such a situation?  </P> <P> A. The first step is to study the contamination and determine the best way to  clean it up. Generally, this involves looking at different options and the  feasibility of those options. The lawyer's role in that phase of the situation  is to be sure that the matter is not simply approached as an academic or  scientific exercise. You want somebody who understands the importance of this  matter to you and your company, particularly if you're talking about millions  of dollars. Because when you're comparing one remedy that might cost $100  million and another costing $30 million, you want a good practical analysis of  what that $70 million is going to buy you.  </P> <P> Q. So you assume that you may be held responsible for cleaning up the whole  thing and you want to find out how much that's going to cost?  </P> <P> A. Right. What you try to do is coalesce a group of similarly situated parties.  Everybody has to understand that today we don't know exactly who's going to pay  for what or how much. What we do know, however, is that it's in everybody's  interest to make sure this is a technically competent investigation that can  lead to not only an environmentally sound result, but a cost-effective result.  So that's the early stage. As it moves along, you'll get more involved in who  sent what and are we going to divide this cleanup cost based on volume.  </P> <P> Q. Is the majority of your work representing companies who contributed to an  industrial dump?  </P> <P> A. Only some. For air pollution, we represent any factory, like an automobile  manufacturing plant, a refinery, a chemical plant or petrochemical plant. For  land pollution, we work with real estate developers who are having to buy and  sell land, and financial institutions who are lending money for real estate.  And then there's a range of clients, such as plastics manufacturers and  refineries, that have water discharge, processed water that needs to be treated  and discharged or sent to a municipal sewage plant for similar treatment.  </P> <P> Q. Besides large corporations weaving their way through this maze of  environmental law, are most of the people who come to you in trouble?  </P> <P> A. Yes. For the smaller or mid-sized business, it's usually the people that  have bumped into a problem, receiving a PRP letter from the government that  says they were a contributor to a dump or a notice of violation. Another thing  that's occurring quite a bit now is the leaking of underground storage tanks.  These are underground tanks that held gasoline or diesel or waste oil and are  located at some pretty small businesses like gas stations or equipment and  truck rental firms. These steel tanks begin leaking in five years if the soil  around them is very moist. If the soil conditions are pretty good, you might  get 20 years out of a tank. But a lot of these tanks have been in the ground  since 1950 and are leaking like sieves. Many smaller businesses don't know  about the leaks. The major refiners now have a leak-detection program and have  actually pulled most of their old tanks and replaced them with fiberglass or  steel tanks with corrosion protection.  </P> <P> Q. Is it true that surrounding businesses might be harmed by these leaking  tanks?  </P> <P> A. Definitely. What you've got then is a piece of property that's not worth as  much because nobody is going to want to buy a contaminated property. You're  going to need to try to get that responsible tank owner-operator to clean up  your property.  </P> <P> Q. Besides environmental damage, what is the fallout from all this pollution  for a small business? How high are the chances of having to endure a lengthy  trial?  </P> <P> A. They usually don't go to trial because the cases settle once everybody  realizes what the facts are and the lawyers have analyzed the evidence and  advised their clients. In an environmental problem, there simply is no winner;  everybody is a loser. It's just a question of how much are you going to pay to  do an environmentally sound remedy. So it's not typical litigation in which  somebody walks away with millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Q. What are some of the range of fines you've seen?  </P> <P> A. I think to date it's still true that the cleanup costs on the waste side and  the cost of installation and maintenance of controls for air and water  pollution far exceed any penalties. But penalties and containment costs are  rapidly increasing. Typically, with a small business -- because of the direct  involvement of the officers and directors or stockholders -- there can be some  personal liability.  </P> <P> Q. What is the range of fines or penalties?  </P> <P> A. Typically, it's $25,000 a day per violation. Under the Clean Air Act, those  have added up to as much as $6 million in one case.  </P> <P> Q. What is the range of cleanup costs?  </P> <P> A. They can range up to hundreds of millions of dollars if you have a large  site with a lot of contamination.  </P> <P> Q. What about criminal charges? How often are those filed against company  officials?  </P> <P> A. Prosecutors need to show company officials were aware of the pollution. I  would think a CEO, who has taken steps to employ a competent, honest  environmental manager, wouldn't have to worry. But the environmental manager  might get charged with a crime if there was pollution. Right now the emphasis  is on higher fines and actually getting some people in jail. They're focusing  on the very egregious cases of what we call midnight dumping -- someone who  just goes out and indiscriminately dumps things -- or repeated violators.  </P> <P> Q. Is there any insurance available to pay for a cleanup?  </P> <P> A. Insurance is something the small-business person should keep in mind. Many  businesses carry what we call comprehensive general liability policies. If you  have a cleanup you're paying for or a problem with underground storage tanks,  you should always contact your broker and file a claim under your insurance  policy. If you ask your broker or the insurance company, a lot of times they'll  say there's no coverage. But if the dollars are big enough, it may be worth  talking to a lawyer who has expertise in filing environmental claims on general  liability insurance policies.  </P> <P> Q. Besides insurance, are there any additional places a company can seek funds  for a cleanup?  </P> <P> A. The state of California is setting up a fund for the cleanup of leaks from  underground storage tanks. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any money in  the fund yet, and I know there are no regulations about how you get the money.  The majority of states have this fund and you simply have to fill out the  applications and be able to verify your expenses. You can get all your cleanup  costs repaid.  </P></p>

Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions of the UN, the  decisions of the North Atlantic Alliance most recently  reiterated at the NATO summit of 11 January, and the recent  request of the UN Secretary-General, it supports a very early  meeting of the North Atlantic Council. In concert with the UN  Secretary-General, the aim should be to bring about the  immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means  necessary including the use of air power.    The measures taken would be the first step in the  implementation of the action plan of the European Union. The  European Union reiterates its support for the efforts of the  co-chairmen to place the administration of Sarajevo under the  authority of the UN.</p>

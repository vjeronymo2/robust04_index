			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Democratic  Forum (MDF) has received fewer votes than expected, and must  accept the result of the elections, Hungarian Prime Minister and  MDF Deputy Chairman Peter Boross told a news conference tonight.  He said he hoped no one would doubt that the Hungarian  elections were free and democratic.    "The Hungarian Socialist Party has made a push forward. The  vote expressed the will of the people and should be accepted  with a bow," Boross said. "In the spirit of its ideals, the MDF  will continue to take part in the country's political life," the  prime minister said. Boross expressed the hope that his party  would fare much better in the second round of the elections.</p>

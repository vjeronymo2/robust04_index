			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] GENEVA, Jan 12 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali asked his special envoy in former Yugoslavia  Wednesday [12 January] to study the feasibility of air strikes  in Bosnia, amid doubts both within and outside ex-Yugoslavia  that NATO planes would intervene. Butrus-Ghali called on  Yasushi Akashi to carry out a "preparatory study" in response to  a renewed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation warning of air  strikes, a United Nations spokesman said here. The study will  cover the military and civilian implications of possible attacks  by NATO planes, the spokesman added.    The decision to use air strikes if deemed necessary -- and  if  approved by Butrus-Ghali -- was taken at the 16-nation NATO  summit in Brussels which ended Tuesday. Alliance leaders warned  they might call for air strikes against Bosnian Serb troops to  end the 21-month siege of Sarajevo, and force the reopening of  Tuzla airport and of the road link to the Moslem enclave of  Srebrenica.    Earlier Wednesday THE WASHINGTON POST reported Butrus-Ghali  sharply rebuked the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, General  Jean Cot, for saying in a French newspaper interview he had  repeatedly asked the UN chief for authority to order airstrikes.    Meanwhile leaders of the international community and  ex-Yugoslavia's warring parties remained sceptical about the use  of air strikes and over any peace benefits that might accrue  from such an intervention. In Prague US president Bill Clinton  said prospects for peace in Bosnia had diminished as "for the  first time all three parties seem to believe they have something  to gain by fighting," and that a political settlement was  currently "difficult" to envisage.    In Paris French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  Butrus-Ghali has promised that planned actions by UN troops in  Tuzla and Srebrenica would proceed "as quickly as possible."  But Juppe added "It is not a matter of launching air raids  against Tuzla or Srebrenica," but primarily of ensuring the  safety of troops in those areas.    The countries contributing troops for these missions --  Britain, Canada and Denmark -- were divided Wednesday over the  issue of air strikes. British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  told BBC radio London was "unenthusiastic" about air strikes and  wanted NATO to show great caution before resorting to that  option. Rifkind said: "One has to be very cautious indeed  about the use of air power, precisely because... we have forces  on the ground." The Canadians had also expressed great caution,  he added. And British Prime Minister John Major told MPs he  declined to extend Britain's commitment of troops to help with  UN humanitarian aid in Bosnia until their security could be  guaranteed.    But in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen  said Danish UN troops were "ready for Serb attacks in case of  NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia." And a  Danish Defence Ministry official told AFP that 10 Danish tanks  and 36 Swedish armoured vehicles blocked by Bosnian Serb forces  in Pancevo, Serbia -- along with 300 Danish and Swedish soldiers  -- since October were ready to proceed to Tuzla, their final  destination, by "indirect routes."    Meanwhile in Sarajevo, where at least seven civilians were  killed and 49 wounded Tuesday, Ejup Ganic, the nominal vice  president of Bosnia, told AFP the NATO declaration contained  "certain aspects which lead us to think things will go better"  for the Moslem-dominated Bosnian side. But he added that he  failed to see "when and under which circumstances" air strikes  could be carried out.    The city's OSLOBODJENJE daily said the city's mainly Moslem  population was sceptical, and that the mainly Moslem Bosnian  Army "would suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO  threat." The scepticism was echoed in Belgrade, where Colonel  Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, a spokesman for the army of rump  Yugoslavia -- comprising Serbia and Montenegro -- told the  Bosnian Serb SRNA agency that air strikes were not very likely  because no accord exists on how they should be carrried out."  He added that any foreign intervention would only "exacerbate  the war."    Butrus-Ghali had admitted Wednesday in an interview with  French daily LE FIGARO that he had "no idea" how NATO air  strikes could be put into effect.</p>

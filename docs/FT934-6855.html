			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Ballet Imperial - Dance We hear those first grand, declamatory chords of Tchaikovsky's second piano concerto. The Opera House curtains part, and there is the Eugene Berman front-cloth: a balustrade, the basin of a fountain frozen in winter's grip, a distant dome. Then through the gauze we see the double-headed eagle, the flambeaux and pillars, and in front of them the facing diagonals of dancers, who are the courtiers in the ritual that is to follow. They make formal bows to each other, and this vision of St. Petersburg as a symbol of imperial power and imperial art casts its spell. We are in some great gallery of the Winter Palace; and outside, the sublime city gleams in the frozen northern light. George Balanchine made Ballet Imperial in 1941 as a comment on the old repertory - and the old world - in which he had been reared as a student in Petersburg, and, I would venture, as testimony to his belief in its continuing significance. (The occasion was a wartime tour designed to take American classic ballet to South America: it is ironic that the piece showed American dancers performing an essentially Russian work. Concerto Barocco, the other creation for the tour, was truly American, in exposing Balanchine's New World classicism). The choreography is an exhilaratingly beautiful realisation of the score. The diamond flash of the pianism defines the ballerina role, with its parure of brilliant-cut entries, as, too, the joyous bravura demanded of the subsidiary trio of a second ballerina and two men. The elegiac slow movement shows the leading danseur as a prince to whom the ballerina appears as a vision (it is resonant of Sleeping Beauty's second act). The final allegro is marked con fuoco, and Balanchine calls for fire in step to match Tchaikovsky's blaze of notes. The piece is a marvel, as we have known ever since Balanchine mounted it at Covent Garden in 1950, when it was given the superbly evocative Berman designs, happily restored last season. It has, in the past, also been danced with the combination of stunning prowess and classic authority that is the key to its identity. Moira Shearer, Nadia Nerina, Antoinette Sibley, and Michael Somes and David Blair in the cavalier's role, have led tremendous casts. On Saturday afternoon it returned to the stage: I think it a work so vital for the Royal Ballet's health, so challenging and rewarding, that it ought never to be long absent from the repertory. With a sense of charity proper at this time of year, I must assume that what we saw was a singularly dismal dress rehearsal. The corps de ballet looked ragged, undisciplined, with lines erratic, and such positions as attitudes entirely at odds in a group of four danseuses. Patterns were cramped, and this in a ballet where the interplay of lines is vital. The principals seemed to me unsuited or unprepared for their tasks: what should have been grandiloquent, elegantly brilliant, was inexact or anxious. Only Sarah Wildor, as one of the two demi-soloists in green, showed what the ballet could be: her aristocracy of manner, the distinction of every step, were ideal. And I record with pleasure that certain niceties of the choreographic text, which were overlooked at last season's revival, have been restored. This programme also brings back Tales of Beatrix Potter. A large number of tots and their minders were audibly enraptured by what they saw. It is, I reluctantly suppose, decent enough entertainment for infants. I cannot believe that adults should be expected to spend 70 minutes watching pork chops on the hoof and assorted vermin scampering about the Opera House stage, masked, padded, in the throes of rampant cuteness. It is, of course, a money-spinner for Covent Garden - and no worse indictment can there be of current funding than that such tosh be seen in an Opera House. In future, let the Royal Ballet take a theatre every Yuletide and engage any jobbing dancers who may be around, to appear in it as a cash-raising exercise. (It would probably run as long as The Mousetrap. They might call it Claptrap.) It is unworthy of the Royal Ballet, and of Covent Garden.</p>

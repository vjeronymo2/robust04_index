			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The Qiandao incident,  involving the murder of 32 people from Taiwan and the mainland,  should not adversely affect the normal development of relations  across the Taiwan Straits, a senior official said here today.    The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang  Province on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat  and the robbery and murder of 32 victims. Of the dead, 24 were  tourists from Taiwan.    Wang, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that the incident should  not be used by a few people with ulterior motives as an excuse  to oppose the mainland, halt exchanges across the Taiwan Straits  and advocate Taiwan "independence".    "Both sides of the Taiwan Straits should view, with a good  sense and in a calm and objective manner, the incident and  various questions arising in the course of handling the  incident, as well as draw a lesson from it," he said.    He promised that the mainland will continue to tighten  security administration in an effort to ensure the security of  Taiwan compatriots in their visits to the mainland.    Wang, who is inspecting Zhejiang Province, said that the  incident was an unexpected, unfortunate tragedy in the course of  expanding across-straits exchanges and economic cooperation.    He expressed the hope that ARATS and its Taiwan counterpart,  the Straits Exchange Foundation, will try to increase contacts  and dialogue at high level, eliminate misunderstandings, resolve  differences and promote cooperation.</p>

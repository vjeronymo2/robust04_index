			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Brazil scandal opens door to opportunity: The possible spin-off from corruption allegations IT IS already being called 'Collor 2'. What began as wild allegations from a former government official have ignited Brazil's biggest corruption scandal since last year's resignation in disgrace of President Fernando Collor. The scandal broke when the magazine Veja] published an interview with Mr Jose Carlos dos Santos, until last year a senior official in the government's budget department. Mr Santos claimed 29 politicians - including four senators, three state governors and five former and acting government ministers - were involved in the corruption scheme. This allegedly channelled 'fees' from construction companies to scheme members, many of whom sat on the congressional budget committee, in return for their approving building projects in the annual budget. The allegations were seized on by Brazil's press, which has adopted a campaigning and moral tone since playing a leading role in Mr Collor's downfall. In Braslia the ensuing furore led to two days of confusion in the government. A special parliamentary inquiry, which started work yesterday, has 45 days to probe the claims. It can call any witnesses and gain access to private bank accounts. The problem of political corruption is deep-rooted in Brazil. Because the party system is weak, individual politicians, often with strong links to sectors such as the construction industry, are expected to spend, or promise spending, in order to win election. The country's legal system is also seen as too ineffective to pursue corrupt individuals through the courts. Congress has yet to show it can tackle its own weaknesses and admit any of its members are corrupt. The scandal has broken at a crucial time for Brazil, which started a constitutional review two weeks ago. Political leaders say the inquiry can run in parallel with the review, but several congressmen admit privately that the review is threatened. 'With so many problems, I don't think Congress will have the necessary will to proceed,' one said. This raises a problem for the government, which hoped the review would allow important economic changes to Brazil's 1988 nationalist constitution, with its barriers to foreign investment in key sectors. But it also presents an opportunity. According to government officials, one constitutional weakness is that Congress has too much power and the executive is often helpless to implement policy. With Congress weakened by the corruption allegations, and worried about further tarnishing to its public image, some analysts say the government can take the initiative. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, is due to meet President Itamar Franco today and seek permission to make use of this opportunity. Mr Cardoso hopes to announce a new phase in the country's privatisation programme, already delayed by several weeks, and combine it with a package of fiscal measures. He wants to try to eliminate this year's budget deficit of Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) and balance next year's budget, which otherwise could be Dollars 25bn in deficit. A big budget deficit would prolong Brazil's inflation agony; annualised price increases now run at nearly 2,000 per cent. Mr Cardoso is thought to be seeking a new upper tax bracket of 35 per cent, a widening of the tax on financial transactions and quicker collection of taxes on tobacco and alcohol. This package is likely to raise only about Dollars 6bn in 1994 and business groups in Brazil, as well as the country's foreign creditors, will be looking for widespread spending cuts too. After listening to Mr Cardoso's promises of firm action since he took office in June, the groups are impatient for change.</p>

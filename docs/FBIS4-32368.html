			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 21 -- Irish President Mary Robinson met  with President Lech Walesa at the start of her official visit to  Poland on Tuesday.    Robinson, the first Irish president to visit Poland, was  greeted in front of the Belvedere presidential palace by Walesa,  the Sejm and Senate speakers, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and  Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski.    During his talks with the Irish president, Walesa presented  problems faced by Poland in the course of economic and political  transformations and pointed to the need to intensify the process  of integration between central European states and the European  Union.    Walesa told Irish journalists after the meeting that he is  impatient with a slow pace of Poland's integration with the  European Union [EU]. He said Poland and other countries in  eastern Europe have huge potentials, which have yet to be used.    Mary Robinson pointed out that Ireland was the first country  to have ratified the agreement on Poland's association with the  EU. She contended that she is aware of Polish aspirations to  become a member of the EU but stressed this will not be a fast  process.    After the wreath-laying ceremonies at the tomb of the  unknown  soldier and at the monument to the Warsaw uprising, Mary  Robinson visited Warsaw's museum of literature.    Later in the day, the Irish guest was awarded the John Field  medal during a ceremony at the Frederic Chopin Society for her  contribution to the development of Polish-Irish cultural  contacts.    The situation of the European Union, the question of  Poland's  coming closer to west European structures and bilateral  Polish-Irish relations constituted the main topics of talks held  by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and Irish Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring.    Spring recognized Irish relations with Poland as a priority  in the process of establishing ties between the European Union  and central and east European countries.    Olechowski presented to Spring Poland's position on its  integration with the European Union before the EU summit to be  held on the Greek island of Corfu June 24-25. He pointed to the  necessity of an unequivocal decision on the part of the European  union related to Poland's future membership of the EU.</p>

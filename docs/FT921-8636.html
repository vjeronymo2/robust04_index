			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Weapons job cuts spark Israeli protest THOUSANDS of workers yesterday shut down production at Israel Military Industries (IMI), one of the country's biggest state-owned weapons exporters, with a one-day strike and staged an angry demonstration outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office to protest at plans for heavy lay-offs at the loss-making company. The unrest at IMI, best known for producing the Uzi sub-machine gun, follows a steep decline in the fortunes of Israel's military manufacturers, contributing to a 2 per cent fall in overall exports last year. It is also an uncomfortable sign for Mr Shamir's government, which faces a general election in June, of growing unease over unemployment, which has climbed to more than 10 per cent of the workforce under the strain of mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. Mr Shamir and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, held an unscheduled meeting with the IMI workers' leaders after some 7,000 demonstrators forced their way through police lines up to the door of the Prime Ministry, injuring three policemen and damaging several cars in the process. The two ministers agreed to seek ways of preventing the implementation of plans by IMI - which exports 60 per cent of production - to dismiss up to 1,500 of its 9,000-strong workforce. The defence ministry has already backtracked on plans to buy two types of ammunition overseas because of high prices at IMI. IMI has slimmed down from 15,000 workers in 1985. In 1991, projected losses of Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.1m) turned into actual losses of Dollars 400m as sales slid by one sixth to Dollars 500m. Exports to the US were halved to Dollars 70m.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> (900) NEW KIDS: A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed lawsuits filed by the  pop group New Kids on the Block against USA Today and a tabloid magazine,  ruling that the band's image can be used by the publications to promote  900-line telephone polls. In dismissing the lawsuits on Monday, U.S. District  Judge William Rea found that, as news-gathering organizations, USA Today and  the Star magazine are permitted to use the group's trademarks to conduct polls  and surveys. The publications are protected under the First Amendment from the  group's claims of trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair  competition. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

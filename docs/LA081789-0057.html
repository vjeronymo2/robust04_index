			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWNEY PICKS CUDAHY CHIEF AS CITY MANAGER;  </P> <P> GERALD CATON SAYS HE WILL FOCUS ON SHOPPING CENTER EXPANSION, SEARCH FOR NEW  POLICE CHIEF  </P> <P> City officials Tuesday chose Cudahy City Manager Gerald M. Caton to replace  retiring Downey City Manager Don Davis.  </P> <P> Caton, 38, was unanimously selected to replace Davis, who has been Downey city  manager since June, 1985. Davis, 53, will retire Monday.  </P> <P> Downey Administrative Services Director Lee Powell will be acting city manager  until Caton comes aboard in October.  </P> <P> In his new post, Caton said he will receive an annual salary of $105,000, which  is an increase of about $25,000 above his current pay.  </P> <P> "It's a very good opportunity," Caton said Tuesday night. "Downey is the  premier city in the southeast county."  </P> <P> Caton will be leaving Cudahy, a densely populated and predominantly Latino  community of 21,000, for a mostly white middle-and-upper-income community of  more than 86,000.  </P> <P> Cudahy's general operating budget for fiscal year 1989-90 is about $5.2  million, while Downey's general operating budget is nearly $50 million.  </P> <P> Caton was one of three finalists from among 40 candidates for the post, Downey  Mayor Randall R. Barb said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Manager Praised  </P> <P> Barb said Caton has two urgent goals: to continue the city's redevelopment  efforts and to keep gang and drug problems under control. Caton, he said, fits  the needs of Downey with his experience in Cudahy and his ability to make  decisions.  </P> <P> "He has brought the city of Cudahy through serious financial problems and was  able to get federal grants," Barb said. "Also, he was successful as the  director of the redevelopment program there."  </P> <P> When he arrives at Downey, Caton said he will have many priorities: "One of the  things internally is the police chief will be retiring. I will be working on  the selection for police chief.  </P> <P> "Also, the Stonewood shopping center is very important for the economic life of  the community, so I want to make sure that it gets accomplished in a timely  manner."  </P> <P> Downey is planning a major expansion for the Stonewood shopping center, which  is viewed as key to the city's efforts to modernize the Firestone Boulevard  commercial corridor and increase its tax base.  </P> <P> Caton has been Cudahy's city manager since 1982, injecting new life into the  city's redevelopment projects, Mayor Tom Thurman said.  </P> <P> Caton revitalized redevelopment projects, including a $14-million shopping  center and the community's first supermarket, Thurman said.  </P> <P> "I wish he wasn't going, but he would be a fool to pass up an opportunity like  this," he said.  </P> <P> Thurman said he expected his City Council to name Jack Joseph, assistant city  manager, acting city manager while officials search for a replacement for  Caton.  </P> <P> Caton said that in the last year and a half he has also been offered three  other city manager jobs in the Southland: Hermosa Beach, Cathedral City and San  Clemente.  </P> <P> Thurman said that city officials knew that Caton "had been looking around" and  that his council had included a $5,000 bonus in this year's budget "as sort of  a carrot" to try to keep him.  </P> <P> "But Downey made him an offer he couldn't refuse," Thurman added.  </P> <P> Caton's seven-year stint at Cudahy was interrupted by an eight-month hiatus  that began in September, 1985, when he resigned during a controversy over a the  casino planned for the city. The casino is now being built and is projected to  open at the end of the year.  </P> <P> "The main controversy was that the City Council wished to hire a finance  director who would oversee the casino and had no background in local  government," Caton said. Caton was rehired by the city in April, 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Several Degrees  </P> <P> Caton was also assistant city manager for in Signal Hill for five years and  assisted the planning department and the administration of federal and state  grants for Garden Grove, he said.  </P> <P> Caton has a degree in history from Cal State Long Beach and a master's degree  from USC's School for Public Administration.  </P> <P> Davis will step down after four years as city manager. He had also worked 27  years with the city's Fire Department, eight as fire chief.  </P> <P> He said that when he took the city manager's job, he told the council that he  would stay for just four years.  </P> <P> He said he has no definite retirement plans but may work with developers on  projects, consult in the public sector or work on a family venture.  </P></p>

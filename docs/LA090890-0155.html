			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DECOR;  </P> <P> PICTURE THE POSSIBILITIES OF BAY WINDOWS, EXPERTS ADVISE;  </P> <P> ON THE OUTSIDE, THEY ADD DIMENSION AND ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST TO A HOME; ON THE  INSIDE, THEY ACT TO EXTEND THE LIVING AREA OUTWARD.  </P> <P> Thanks to paradise-perfect days, Californians just can't get enough of a view.  For some, the ideal home is a cantilevered A-frame with a view of the Pacific.  For others, it's a sprawling ranch model, where walls of glass look out on  sun-dappled patios surrounded by flower-filled gardens.  </P> <P> Whether your dream home is a chateau or a condo, chances are it features  fascinating windows. But the trend is more mellow than modern, as Californians  rediscover the charm of the old-fashioned bay window.  </P> <P> "A window is just a window," says psychotherapist Rhea Vogt. "Even a whole bank  of windows or sliding glass doors -- which give us the feeling of free-flowing  space -- are still only two-dimensional.  </P> <P> "What's so special about bay windows is their three-dimensionality, which  creates the illusion of the indoors and outdoors coming together.  </P> <P> "The prime virtue of a bay window is that it's like a little extra room, a room  that's all yours. We're such a frenzied, harassed society. We have less and  less personal space because of overcrowding. Bay windows are intimate, special  places where people feel secure. It's your little space -- that's something  that you can't get from a two-dimensional sliding glass door, which gives us a  view, but not the intimacy and warmth we crave."  </P> <P> Besides their emotional appeal, bay windows are practical -- and aesthetically  captivating. From the outside, bay windows add dimension and architectural  interest to a home. On the inside, bays act to extend the living area outward,  increasing the spatial dimensions of the interior and broadening the view.  </P> <P> Bay windows come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. The largest -- and  perhaps the most elegant -- is the walk-in bay, with inviting floor-to-ceiling  open space contained between the angles of the windows.  </P> <P> A pair of oversized, walk-in bays crowned with a circle-head window enhance one  of the turrets in a large custom home in Fullerton. On the other side of the  Tudor-style house is another turret, inset with a bay window at ground level  and a balcony above.  </P> <P> The bay window in the living room embraces a space large enough for a pair of  wing-backed chairs with a reading table and lamp placed between them. The other  downstairs bay holds an efficient and attractive bar in the family room. The  upstairs bay, which contains a writing area, frames a treetop view of the  grounds.  </P> <P> Because the homeowners wanted to preserve lovely garden views, designer Lisa  Weber kept draperies to a minimum: soft swags of fabric and cloud valances add  a touch of color and tie the area in with each room's decor.  </P> <P> For many homeowners, one of the most appealing features of a bay window is the  many ways the space between the windows can be utilized. Traditionally, bay  windows are associated with cozy, built-in seating areas where you can enjoy  the wonders of nature while surrounded by the comfort of your home. Many bays  are still used that way, with downy cushions covering window seats that conceal  a handy, hidden area for storage.  </P> <P> When space is at a premium, bay windows are the perfect spots for built-in  bookcases, cabinets, desks and countertops. One of Lisa Weber's clients, who  enjoys seasonal decorating, had a countertop built into a bay window that faced  the sidewalk in front of her home. "Her gift to the neighborhood is the  charming holiday displays she sets up for passers-by," Weber says.  </P> <P> In some cases, it's not exactly the view but the illusion of a view that makes  a bay window intriguing.  </P> <P> Perhaps one of the most ingenious ways to use a bay window is to put it  "inside" the home. When an architect placed a bay window -- instead of a wall  -- at one end of a long narrow kitchen, a family gained a charming breakfast  nook with a pretty view of the entry beyond.  </P> <P> Designer Linda Barth designed a booth, made up of a table and a curving  built-in window seat, to fit snugly inside the bay and custom-designed leaded  glass panes that repeat patterns used in adjoining areas of the home. "There's  so many things you can do with bay windows," says Barth, "the possibilities  seem endless."  </P> <P> Because they are so adaptable, every room of the house is a candidate for a bay  window. When used in a small bedroom, they "open up" the area because of the  additional space and light they bring to the room. And, unless plumbing  interferes, kitchens and bathrooms can be updated dramatically by adding bay  windows.  </P> <P> Designer Naomi Mason used a bay window to surround a spa tub. To ensure  privacy, Mason covered the window with a balloon shade, a luxurious window  treatment that adds to the ambience of the setting.  </P> <P> "There's something appealing about bay windows," Mason says, "they're cozy and  romantic." To create an aura of romance in a master bedroom, Mason suggests  embellishing the window with lace curtains and placing a sofa or a chaise  within the curve of the bay.  </P> <P> By incorporating the latest types of energy-saving features into the windows  themselves, problems such as heat loss and fading can be overcome. Specially  treated glass is available, as well as double-paned windows, which contain air  space that conserves heat and muffles sound.  </P></p>

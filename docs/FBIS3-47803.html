			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Fascist Oppressive </F> Maneuvers Under the Pretext of Eliminating Crime"]    [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet  police on 13 January held an expanded meeting attended by  chiefs of the crime prevention sections of police offices in  cities and provinces throughout South Korea and formulated a  so-called detailed plan to prevent crimes in connection with the  second 180-day cleanup operation.    On 12 January, the puppet Ministry of Home Affairs set the  period from 12 January to 11 July as the second planning period  to ensure the stabilization of public welfare and ordered the  police offices in cities and provinces throughout South Korea to  keep intensive control over violent crimes.    During the 13 January meeting, the puppet police decided to  maintain an emergency duty system by mobilizing 65 percent of  police forces and, at the same time, decided to crack down on  crime by conducting surprise operations once every three or five  days, thus babbling about the so-called perfect crime prevention  system.    Also, they have decided to arrest criminals by establishing  a  special task force against four major crimes, such as organized  violent groups and robbers, and to take strong steps against  commanding officers in charge of areas where violent crimes take  place frequently by removing them from their posts, thus  applying the regional responsibility system.    South Korea seems to have taken steps to root out crimes,  but, actually, it intends to suppress more brutally the just  struggles of South Korean youth, students, and people who aspire  for independence, democracy, and reunification under the pretext  of rooting out crime. This has been clearly proven in the  180-day operation to root out crime, which the puppet Kim  Yong-sam clique started last year after he took office.    The Kim Yong-sam clique set the period from 1 April to  September 1993 as the 180-day operation period to cleanup crime  and oppress the people, thus loudly talking about the operation  as if it would remove crime from South Korea.    The rate of crime has not decreased, but rather further  increased. Also, more vicious methods have been employed in  crime.    The South Korean paper TONG-A ILBO reported some time ago  that murder, rape, robbery with violence, violence, and theft,  which are called the five major crimes in South Korea, are being  committed every 125 seconds; fraud, which is called an economic  crime, every 296 seconds; embezzlement, every 18 minutes and 36  seconds; and traffic crime every 64 seconds. It also reported  that robbery and rape cases in South Korea have increased by 500  times over the past ten years, which is a world record.    Despite the Kim Yong-sam ring's raving about crime  eradication operations, the crime rate has been rising  continuously in South Korea because they used their suppressive  force to suppress the people's struggle for independence,  democracy, and reunification under the pretext of such  operations.    Last year as well, the Kim Yong-sam ring mobilized all their  suppressive force to suppress the South Korean people's just  struggle -- such as the struggle calling for the clarification  of the truth of the Kwangju massacre and the punishment of its  main culprits, which was waged on the occasion of the 13th  anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising,and the meeting to  launch the Korean Federation of University Student Councils and  the struggle to realize the 12 June North-South student talks in  Panmunjom. On 20 July, the Kim Yong-sam ring even exercised the  right of emergency coordination, which the preceding dictators  dared not mobilize, and brutally suppressed the labor dispute of  the Hyundai Motor Company workers.    Thus, the Kim Yong-sam ring did not use the police force to  crack down on crime, but mobilized it to suppress the people's  just struggle, thus allowing a steady increase of crime in South  Korea. The crime eradication they rave about is after all an  excuse to suppress the South Korean people's just struggle. The  Kim Yong-sam ring has been conducting a 180-day campaign for the  eradication of crime since early this new year in an attempt to  block the South Korean people's intensifying struggle for the  country's reunification and to suppress the South Korean  students' antigovernment struggle, which will be stepped up this  spring.    Through the Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist terrorist rule for  nearly one year, the South Korean people have become aware that  as long as the ring remains in power, it is impossible to  realize the country's reunification or the democratization and  independence of South Korean society. They, therefore, are  launching themselves into the antigovernment struggle against  the ring. In particular, the traitorous act of the traitor Kim  Yong-sam, who opened up the rice market, breaking his promise  not to open up the rice market under any circumstances, is  causing surging indignation among the South Korean people.    At the same time, it is expected that the South Korean  students and people will further step up their antigovernment  struggle on the anniversaries of the April popular uprising and  the Kwangju popular uprising. Hence, the Kim Yong-sam ring set  aside the period from 12 January to 11 July as a 180-day crime  eradication campaign period and is frantically engaged in  fascist suppression of the people.    However, fascist suppression cannot be a measure for their  survival. Rather, it will hasten their own ruin. The Kim  Yong-sam ring, which claimed to be a civilian regime, is walking  along the way of fascist suppression in open cooperation with  his predecessor military fascist dictators. This is a  last-ditch effort of one who is destined to meet with his doomed  end. The Kim Yong-sam ring should squarely see the developments  in South Korea, act with discretion, and step down from power  without delay as demanded by the people.</p>

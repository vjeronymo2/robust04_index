			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Serbian Radical Party of </F> Montenegro -- `Real Leaders of the Serbian People Think  Differently'"]    [Text] "We harshly condemn the unmeasured statement by FRY  President Lilic. It is clear to everybody who has read the text  that the leader mentioned there must be in the Srpska republic  as it is at war," it is said in the statement by the Serbian  Radical Party of Montenegro.    ``Is it possible that the Yugoslav president does not know  the reasons for the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  reasons for not ending the war and for not establishing peace?  He clumsily expressed his annoyance, as well as the annoyance  of millions of Yugoslavs, with the fact that the civil war in  Bosnia, because of which people are still being killed and  suffering, is still going on.    ``When it is known what the world wants from the Serbs in  general and particularly from those in the Srpska republic, it  is particularly inappropriate that the head of the Yugoslav  federation directly accuses heroic Serbian leaders, saying that  the war continues due their leadership ambitions. An insult to  them is also an insult to the suffering and decimated people of  the Srpska republic.    "Serbian leaders can immediately decide to end the war,  albeit to do so means accepting the blackmail and giving  Bosnia-Herzegovina over to Alija Izetbegovic. The sanctions on  Yugoslavia would then be lifted, but the Serbian people would  also end the centuries-old dream of a joint state, which has  already been created. However, the Serbian people would also be  left without respect and dignity, and the future generations of  Serbs would be ashamed of our generation for deciding on a road  of humiliation out of selfishness. We hope that this was only a  momentary weakness of Mr. Lilic's and that the real leaders of  the Serbian people think differently," the Montenegrin Radicals  point out.</p>

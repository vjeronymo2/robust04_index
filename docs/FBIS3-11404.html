During a lunch with the Costa Rican Union of Private  Enterprise Chambers and Associations (UCCAEP), the man who will  be governing Costa Rica beginning 8 May warned in his  administration he will seek a "true commercial opening."    "We have opened the economy, but we need greater vitality to  compete more intelligently with greater courage, not with lower  wages," Figures said, adding he will strengthen and improve the  quality of social programs.    He promised businessmen, however, he will respect  "macroeconomic balances" by lowering the fiscal and commercial  deficits and will promote tax reform not to impose more taxes  but to improve the collection of existing ones.    UCCAEP President Marco Vinicio Ruiz said "the key of  success"  for Costa Rican society depends fundamentally on achieving a  successful and high quality incorporation into the world economy.    "This can only be attained if the country advances in  congruence with improving competitiveness and Costa Ricans'  quality of life," the business group leader said.</p>

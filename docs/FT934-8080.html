			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / BAA rises thanks to retailing strength RETAILING has become the largest single source of income for BAA, the privatised British Airports Authority, which yesterday reported an 8.7 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 237m, from Pounds 218m. Apart from a 10 per cent increase in retail income, the higher earnings reflected healthy growth in air travel, especially in the UK, and the company's continuing drive to control costs. Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the company was seeking to expand its international airport activities in the US, Europe and Asia through consultancy contracts, joint ventures and equity stakes. With a 70 per cent share of the UK airport business already, BAA was not interested in investing in new British ventures following the government's proposals to privatise local authority airports. Sir John confirmed that BAA was interested in proposals to privatise Rome's Fumicino airport, adding that the company had been approached by numerous authorities involving 20-30 airports to discuss co-operation and partnership ventures. 'Many foreign governments are interested in bringing private capital in their airports systems and they are looking at our successful example,' he said. He has been the architect of BAA's drive into retailing which accounted for Pounds 250m of the company's total first-half revenues of Pounds 627m, up 16.5 per cent. The contribution from retailing was higher than the Pounds 244m income earned from aircraft landing charges. In spite of a 4.6 per cent increase in passenger numbers, income from aircraft landing charges fell 0.7 per cent because of the current regulatory pricing formula. Sir John said BAA had added nearly 50 new airport shops in the past six months bringing the total at its UK airports to just over 400. BAA's latest traffic forecasts for its seven UK airports saw growth at a rate of 3.8 per cent a year to the end of the century. The seven were expected to handle 86m passengers by 1995 and 104m passengers by 2000 compared with 77m last year. The interim dividend goes up 8 per cent to 6.75p. Earnings per share were 5.9 per cent higher at 34.2p, reflecting a higher tax charge. Lex, Page 26 Market, Page 58</p>

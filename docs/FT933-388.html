			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Auditors warning on Isosceles AUDITORS OF Isosceles, the leveraged parent of the Gateway food retail group, warned 'there is significant doubt as to the eventual repayment of the Isosceles debt in full, since any repayments are wholly dependent upon the future results of Gateway Group'. The statement came in Ernst &amp; Young's report on the accounts for the year to April 24, which have been prepared on a 'going concern' basis and took into account the financial restructuring completed in July. This created net worth of Pounds 305m for Gateway, Isosceles' subsidiary, compared to Isosceles' deficit of Pounds 643m at the year end. Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman, said trading conditions had worsened in the second half, but there were now some grounds for optimism. In the year, the group made an operating profit of Pounds 103.6m (Pounds 187.4m), before exceptional items of Pounds 191.9m (Pounds 9.7m) and interest payable of Pounds 169.2m (Pounds 159.7m). The net loss was Pounds 346.6m (Pounds 146.2m). The accounts showed Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.91m) had been paid in compensation to directors whose contracts were terminated.</p>

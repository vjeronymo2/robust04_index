			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T LOWER $5-MILLION BAIL FOR CHARLES KEATING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H.  Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being  indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors,  regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around."  </P> <P> The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating -- a once-wealthy real estate  developer, lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to  pin-striped suits -- will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los  Angeles County Jail.  </P> <P> At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from  the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the  former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary,  Lincoln.  </P> <P> Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was  lowered to $200,000. Bail for Robin S. Symes, 37, and Ray C. Fidel, 32, both  former Lincoln presidents, was cut to $100,000. Wischer posted bail Friday and  was expected to be released during the night.  </P> <P> The four are charged with wrongdoing in the sale of more than $200 million in  American Continental bonds to thousands of mostly elderly Southern California  investors. The bonds were sold through Lincoln branches, allegedly as safe and  insured investments.  </P> <P> The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy in  April, 1989. The next day Lincoln was declared insolvent and seized by federal  regulators. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.  </P> <P> Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated that he would appeal Klausner's  ruling. Keating will not flee and intends to fight to clear his name, Neal  said. But the decision denies Keating access to his attorneys and to records so  he can mount a defense effectively, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> "We think (the decision) is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced  this week," Neal said.  </P> <P> Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be  paid by his family, Neal said.  </P> <P> Neal argued that Keating, who three years ago had a net worth of nearly $40  million, is broke. Keating's former accountant testified that his debts exceed  his assets by $5.2 million.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice  in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce  Keating's bail.  </P> <P> "Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said  in a press conference after the hearing. "For many of them, it was their life  savings. And whether somebody wears an expensive suit or a cheap mask, stealing  is stealing and both of them ought to be treated the same."  </P> <P> The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the  first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and  Phoenix-based American Continental.  </P> <P> Keating, unshaven and looking tired, sat impassively in the prisoners' block as  the judge announced his decision. His co-defendants also showed little emotion  as they were whisked away by court deputies after the hearing.  </P> <P> Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner  for their handling of the bail hearing.  </P> <P> "The most talked-about event in the last several weeks has been the Iraqi  invasion," Smaltz said. "The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the  front page was Charles Keating, and Reiner's milking that for all it's worth."  </P> <P> He also struck out at the judge, saying, "He's never going to get arrested for  flashing his Phi Beta Kappa key. Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's  appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford."  </P> <P> Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has  equivocated on the bail issue.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, when the indictments were unsealed, prosecutors did not object to  releasing all the defendants on their own recognizance. On Wednesday,  prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1  million for Keating and $50,000 for the others. Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul  W. Turley argued against reducing the bail at all.  </P> <P> Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper  bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing  were the most important in this case.  </P> <P> Throughout the hearing, defense attorneys brought witnesses and other evidence  to court to show that their clients were destitute or nearly so. They argued  that the defendants would return to court for trial to fight for their  vindication, as they had stayed to fight the massive civil litigation filed  against them.  </P></p>

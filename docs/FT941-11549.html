			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No bids for Peruvian refinery In a surprise development, there were no bids at yesterday's auction of the state-owned copper refinery in Peru's southern port of Ilo. The US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer of two-thirds of all Peru's copper, had been widely tipped to become the new proprietor. The base price had been set at USDollars 75m, with an additional Dollars 20m to be invested over the next three years. 'Obviously, considerable interest has been shown in the refinery by potential bidders,' said Mr Raul Otero, president of the privatisation committee. 'It can therefore only be assumed that the base price was fixed too high.' There might be a second auction attempt at a lower base price, Mr Otero said. Alternatively Mineroperu might continue to operate the refinery. SPCC had been considered the 'natural buyer' for Ilo, but Japan's Mitsui (which was associated in the refinery's planning and construction between 1973 and 1975) and Marubeni also of Japan had shown interest. Both Japanese companies yesterday presented sealed envelopes declining to bid. The Ilo refinery was constructed and has existed for nearly 20 years exclusively to refine blister copper from SPCC under a tolling agreement. The electrolytic plant - which cost USDollars 56m to build - was designed to produce 150,000 tonnes a year of 99.9 per cent pure cathode copper. Later modifications carried out on a shoestring by permanently cash-strapped Mineroperu have since pushed output up by 20 per cent. It was reasoned that purchasing the refinery would allow SPCC sharply to reduce production costs for its refined copper. Mineroperu charged USDollars 300 a tonne to refine but that could easily be cut by USDollars 50. Additionally, the new proprietor would benefit from the 2m ounces or so of silver produced annually as a by-product, which had previously remained with Mineroperu. An official in the privatisation committee for state mining and refining giant Centromin said in Lima yesterday that the base price for the company would be Dollars 280m in cash plus at least Dollars 60m in debt paper and minimum investment of Dollars 240m over three years. The sale is scheduled for late March.</p>

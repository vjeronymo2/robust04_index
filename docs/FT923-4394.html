			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Survey of Reinsurance (7): Storm warning for insurers / Examining the rising trend in catastrophe losses KLAUS CONRAD, a member of Munich Re's board of management, advises insurers: 'Beware of a catastrophe reinsurer who asks no questions . . . who does not ask to be paid a fair price for his goods and services; they may turn out to be worthless.' This is sound advice: many reinsurers who did not ask questions or a fair price have in recent years been hit by the rising trend in catastrophe losses. The compact but intense Hurricane Andrew, the first big storm of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season, is one more example of nature's destructive potential. In its recent review of 1991 catastrophe losses the large international reinsurer Swiss Re argues that 'the last five years have shown a loss burden above the long-term trend, both in the natural catastrophe and major man-made loss sectors. If this development continues, the world insurance system will face a huge challenge.' A similar review of natural catastrophes from Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, 'confirms a continuation in 1991 of the trend that has been observed for more than 30 years: natural disasters are becoming more and more costly,' in terms of overall economic loss and insured loss. Since the mid-1980s insured damage from natural catastrophes have far outstripped significant man-made losses. Typhoon Mireille which swept Japan for two days in September 1991 caused insured damage of Dollars 5.2bn - the largest insured loss from a single storm. For the third year a wind storm produced a Dollars 4bn plus loss, following Hurricane Hugo in September 1989, and the storm Daria in western Europe in January 1990. Insured wind storm damage throughout North America totalled more than Dollars 3bn in 1991, while a bush fire in California in October 1991 caused an insured loss of Dollars 1.2bn. Looking at man-made catastrophe losses the trend is similar: more losses costing more money. Swiss Re's survey argues that in totalling more than Dollars 3.2bn in 1991 'man-made insured damage is still clearly above the long-term average'. The biggest losses in this category were the sinking of the Sleipner A gas platform while still in Grandafjord off Stavanger, Norway (insured loss Dollars 334.5m), and the fire during construction of the London Underwriting Centre (Dollars 290m). The latter highlighted the increasing risk of construction site losses developed countries. According to Munich Re, insurers' real claims burdens from natural disasters in the decade to 1991 were eight times heavier than during the 1960s. Figures from Swiss Re, show that total insured damage from natural disasters and large man-made losses together bounced around between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 6bn (at 1991 prices) between 1970 and 1985. Since then the yearly totals have been sharply higher: reaching Dollars 14bn in 1889, Dollars 18bn in 1990, Dollars 15bn in 1991. These figures are small in comparison with the overall Dollars 1,200bn taken in premiums each year by insurers world-wide. However, the recent trend in frequency and value of catastrophe losses is of concern because of its uncertainty. Is the trend going to be the norm for future years? And how far will the figures rise? Piper Alpha was an old platform (169 people died in the 1988 disaster and the insured loss was Dollars 1.4bn) - the newer North Sea platforms are multi-billion dollar structures. Insurance market estimates of possible future natural catastrophe incidents make grim reading. A large earthquake in Tokyo or San Francisco could lead to a Dollars 50-Dollars 100bn dollar loss. If a Hugo-intensity storm had landed farther north up the US east coast in New York, the loss could have been twice that actually suffered. According to Andrew Dlugolecki, chief manager operations at General Accident, there are many factors driving these trends of rising cost and frequency. One significant factor may be that the weather trends of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were milder than the long-term trend, and recent storm developments are a return towards that longer-term trend. Other factors raising catastrophe losses include: Increasing concentration of values: industries have tended to build increasingly expensive plant, of higher output, with greater product inventory on site. Increasing business interruption (B/I): more businesses are buying B/I insurance cover, and B/I insured losses are rising at a faster rate than property losses. Larger, higher output plant take longer to rebuild in the event of a disaster. New business practices: the development of just-in-time (jit) techniques is one facet of increasing dependencies between suppliers and customers. In recognition of this more supplier/customer B/I extensions to cover are being purchased. New construction techniques: fast track and unitary methods mean a higher percentage of high value finished fixtures and fittings are on site during earlier stages of building construction, possibly a time of raised risk from fire. Increasing population density: cities are becoming larger and, on average, richer. If a natural disaster hits, losses are increased. Much of the loss from a large wind storm is accounted for by many, relatively small claims from householders. New geographical areas: both industry and populations are moving into increasingly risky areas, especially coastal regions more susceptible to storms, storm surges, tsunamis (huge sea waves). Increasing insurance density: greater demand from customers has led to more insurance purchasing. It was easy to sell wind storm cover in Europe after the 1987 and 1990 storms. A corresponding push from insurers selling cheaply in a soft market added to the trend. Changes in climate: natural variation in climate alters the propensity for climatic events. The jury is still out on global warming, but scientists argue that if the troposphere is warming, the earth's weather system will contain more energy leading to greater intensity of climatic events. What is to be done? Mr Conrad argues that 'private fortunes gathered over generations, were lost by Lloyd's names, reinsurers mobilised their emergency reserves, retrocessionaires started selling their nest eggs. (Premiums) apparently had been too low, otherwise one would not have lost in five years, what it had taken 50 to collect'. His solution is simple: a return to insurance basics; premiums rates commensurate with risk, appropriate levels of deductibles, proper calculation of probable and possible catastrophe scenarios, proper loss prevention, loss mitigation, and accumulation control.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi bank creditors approve rescue scheme Bank creditors representing more than 85 per cent of the total borrowings of Italy's Ferruzzi group yesterday gave their approval to a controversial rescue plan drawn up by leading Italian lenders. Reaching the 85 per cent level means shareholders' meetings to approve the recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, will go ahead today and tomorrow. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank behind the scheme and Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin chairman, had stressed the plan could be put at risk if the level was not reached. Securing the agreement of enough creditors became a virtual certainty yesterday after Deutsche Bank, one of the main critics of the plan, broke ranks with other foreign creditors and accepted the proposal. Credit Suisse said efforts to prepare an alternative scheme would continue, in spite of Deutsche Bank's decision to resign from the committee of five foreign banks. The other banks are Barclays, Union Bank of Switzerland and Citibank. The four remaining banks repeated their refusal to be railroaded into a settlement, saying 'such a complex plan cannot be the object of careful revisions and consideration within the very short time requested by Ferruzzi'. Credit Suisse said the foreign banks would meet on Wednesday and hoped to share its conclusions with other foreign creditors before Christmas. The Mediobanca plan calls for moratoria and below-market rates on interest payments on Ferruzzi group borrowings, as well as reschedulings of most debts. Ferfin had net borrowings of L22,600bn (Dollars 13.4bn) at the end of June. Last week, Mediobanca issued an 'updated plan' which went some way to meeting foreign banks' criticisms by removing a number of companies, to which foreign banks were most exposed, from the rescheduling proposals. Ferfin and Montedison shareholders will be also asked to approve legal action against Price Waterhouse, which audited the two companies. The boards of Ferfin and Montedison say the firm failed to spot financial irregularities which allegedly arose under the previous management.</p>

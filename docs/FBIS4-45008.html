			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Jamal 'Attabi: "Study Concerning </F> Expansion of Power Stations in Mecca and Medina"]    [Text] Engineer 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, the Saudi minister  of industry and electricity, told AL-HAYAH that he is currently  conducting a study concerning expansion of the two power  stations in Mecca and Medina which will cost 600 million riyals  [SR] ($160 million).    He added that the total amount spent by the United Saudi  Electricity Company in the Western Region on electricity for the  holy pilgrimage shrines in Mecca, in order to add new stations  and to reinforce and expand new services for subscribers and  pilgrims going to the Holy Mosque in Mecca, has been more than  SR400 million ($106.6 million).    After making an inspection tour yesterday of the holy  pilgrimage shrines in Muna, 'Arafat, and al-Muzdalifah and  familiarizing himself with the electrical services provided by  the Western Region and its preparations for the pilgrimage  season, al-Zamil demanded that, in return for these generous  expenditures, citizens should make a constant effort to conserve  electricity. He said that preparations for the pilgrimage season  are being completed and are being done by a [single] unified  office in Muna. In less than 10 hours, orders are received and  processed concerning tents and services for pilgrims, and  maintenance teams always stand by ready to help.    Concerning the inauguration of the new Ajyad electric  transformer station in Mecca yesterday (Tuesday), al-Zamil said  that it constitutes basic support for the holy pilgrimage  shrines as well as reinforcement for the region's sources of  electric power for providing electric services.    Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the province of  Mecca, yesterday inaugurated the Ajyad station in Mecca, which  was completed at the beginning of this month, and those  attending included Minister al-Zamil, Engineer Mahmud Tibah,  head of the administrative council of the electricity authority  of the Western Region, Dr. Bakr Hamzah Khushaym, director  general of electricity for the Western Region, and Dr. Rabi'  Sadiq Dahlan, deputy governor of the province of Mecca.    It should be mentioned that the United Saudi Electricity  Company in the Western Region put up the Ajyad transformer  station at a total cost of SR157 million ($21.8 million), and  implementation of the project took 15 months. This was in  addition to implementation of the project dealing with  construction of the al-Shubaykah transformer station, which has  the purpose of providing a principal source of power for the  area including the Holy Mosque in Mecca, which has a heavy  demand for electricity. The cost of this project was SR118  million ($31.4 million), and it was completed in 18 months.  Furthermore, the company implemented the project for expansion  of the Muna transformer station at a cost of SR18 million, the  project involving laying out the electrical cable between the  Holy Mosque transformer station and al-Misfalah [name as  transliterated] at a total cost of about 54 million riyals, and  the project involving straightening out the path of the  above-ground electricity line from the Jabal al-Nur transformer  station to the 'Arafat transformer station at a cost of SR6  million, the implementation of which took six months.    Right now the Umm al-Qura University transformer station is  being put up, at a total cost of SR118 million, and work on this  project will come to an end at the beginning of next year.</p>

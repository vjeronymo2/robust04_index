			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: S Lyles edges ahead to Pounds 113,000 Despite continuing difficult trading conditions and problems in securing 'adequate' margins, pre-tax profits at S Lyles, the carpet yarn manufacturer, edged ahead to Pounds 113,000 in the half year to December 31. The rise from the comparable Pounds 102,000 came on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 6.71m). Mr John Lyles, chairman, said the sales increase reflected changes in the product mix and pressure of selling prices. He added, however, that the first-half had ended on an encouraging note  - particularly in domestic markets - and the improvement has so far been carried over into the second half. Earnings per share emerged at 1.14p (1.02p). The interim dividend is cut from 1.55p to 1p, although the company intends to at least maintain the full-year total at 3.3p 'if justified by the eventual results and other considerations'.</p>

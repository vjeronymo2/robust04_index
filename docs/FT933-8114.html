			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Romania gives rail strikers ultimatum THE Romanian prime minister, Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, yesterday gave striking train drivers an ultimatum to get back to work or face instant dismissal and replacement by pensioners. Mr Vacaroiu's announcement came at the end of an emergency meeting of the minority left-wing government which he called to take 'exceptional measures' against the week-old pay strike. The strikers have already ignored appeals by President Ion Iliescu and their own union to end the strike which is taking place in defiance of an 80-day supreme court ban on work stoppages. President Iliescu chided the train drivers by saying they were already a privileged group of workers with an average wage higher than the country's university professors, surgeons and airline pilots. The cabinet claimed the stoppage had caused losses to the country equivalent to Dollars 317m (Pounds 212m). A government statement said extra police and gendarmes would be posted to guard stations and depots in case of disturbances and would be used to remove strikers from railway property if necessary. 'We urge retired train drivers who wish to help the country in this difficult moment to go to railway offices to register for work,' the statement added. The drivers are seeking a 20-30 per cent wage rise and new pay differentials.</p>

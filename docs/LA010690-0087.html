			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICAN TELLS HOPE FOR TIES TO EAST EUROPE AFTER HUNGARY TRIP  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, back from his first trip to Eastern  Europe, said Friday that his government hopes to establish diplomatic relations  with Hungary and possibly other long-hostile Warsaw Pact countries.  </P> <P> Botha also said his government wants to attract Eastern Europeans to South  Africa to ease a labor shortage in skilled jobs.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid groups have denounced the recruitment campaign, saying the  government should be training blacks rather than wooing white immigrants.  </P> <P> In Budapest, Botha met Thursday with Hungarian Foreign Minister Guyla Horn.  Hungary's national MTI news agency reported afterward: "Both sides expressed  their intention to gradually establish official relations."  </P> <P> The African National Congress, which for decades has received Soviet Bloc  backing for its guerrilla campaign against white-minority-led rule, accused  Hungary of betraying South Africa's black majority and forming "a racist  partnership with apartheid."  </P> <P> Alfred Nzo, the group's secretary general, said Hungary's decision to receive  Botha demonstrated "bad faith and a cynical disregard for international  agreements."  </P> <P> "Only 10 days ago, representatives of the Hungarian government assured the ANC  that they have no contact with the apartheid regime," he said.  </P> <P> However, Botha told reporters before leaving Budapest that "no agreements were  concluded" with Hungary. And Horn reminded Botha that Hungary "opposes any kind  of racial, national or ethnic discrimination, and condemns all manifestations  of apartheid," MTI said.  </P> <P> At a news conference Friday at Johannesburg's airport, Botha said the two  countries will investigate possible cooperation in trade, industrial  development and tourism.  </P> <P> Asked about the prospect of formal ties with other Eastern European countries,  Botha replied: "There is already contact, and we are talking."  </P> <P> Botha's two-day stay was the first known visit by a senior South African  official to a Warsaw Pact country.  </P></p>

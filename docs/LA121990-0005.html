			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SKIPPER PERISHES WHEN BOAT CAPSIZES  </P> <P> One man was killed and another fell into the ocean when a fishing boat headed  for New Zealand capsized Monday about 980 miles southwest of San Diego, a Coast  Guard spokesman said.  </P> <P> The skipper of the Viva, Richard Ennis, 53, of Morro Bay, was lost after he  became trapped aboard the 47-foot boat when it capsized about 1 p.m., said  Timothy Rowe, a Coast Guard spokesman.  </P> <P> Before his death, Ennis warned crewman Terry Groat, 26, of Crescent City to  abandon ship. "Apparently (Groat) was sleeping, and the ship's master went in  and woke him up," Rowe said.  </P> <P> Groat was reportedly thrown from the vessel but rescued by the crew of the  Billie Marie, a fishing vessel traveling with the Viva. Both vessels list Morro  Bay, about 350 miles north of San Diego, as their home port, Rowe said.  </P> <P> The cause of the capsizing is under investigation.  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Slight fall in repossessions HOME repossessions in England and Wales fell slightly in the three months to the end of September, according to figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's office. Mr Tony Baldry, housing minister, said the figures showed a 'welcome decline' and added: 'Mortgage counselling for those in difficulties is now widespread and shows that lenders want to help people out of their difficulties.' The Building Societies Association was more cautious in its welcome for the figures. It said the fall was caused by a widespread policy of 'forbearance' by lenders, rather than by any reduction in the scale of mortgage arrears. The figures do not include voluntary repossessions - where occupants surrender the keys to their home without a contest - and so are only a preliminary indication. In the third quarter of this year 34,474 repossession actions were entered, down 32 per cent from 51,037 in the same quarter last year, and 30,661 repossession orders were made, 23 per cent down from the corresponding period last year. Repossession orders for the first nine months of the year, at 99,592, show a 6 per cent fall from the corresponding period last year. Shelter, the housing group, urged the Lord Chancellor to recommend that lenders were not granted possession orders unless debt counselling had been offered. It said long-term mortgage arrears had more than doubled by the end of July compared with the same point last year.</p>

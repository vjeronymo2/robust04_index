			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: IMI suffers 7% fall to Pounds 68m IMI, the international engineering group, held the decline in its profits before tax for the 1992 year to 7 per cent. The pre-tax outcome of Pounds 68m compared with Pounds 73.2m last time. Earnings were 13.6p (15p) and the total dividend is maintained for the third year running at 10p via a final of 5.8p. The stock market viewed the figures benignly enough to push the shares up 11p to 270p, checking the decline of last week when the shares dipped some 6 per cent. Turnover advanced from Pounds 968m to Pounds 1.01bn, producing operating profits down on margin pressure to Pounds 75.6m (Pounds 78.1m). Interest payments increased from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 8.4m, reflecting both an increase in gearing over the year to 26 per cent (22 per cent) and, more significantly, foreign exchange variations towards the end of the year. The group is now nearing the end of recession-induced rationalisation. 'Major job losses: we think that is now behind us in 1992,' said Mr Gary Allen, chief executive, noting that the net loss of jobs during 1992 was 1,100, taking the total payroll at the end of the year to 17,500. 'The high level of capital spending we have undertaken in recent years puts us in a good position to recover quickly in any general upturn in activity,' said Sir Eric Pountain, chairman. In the last financial year, IMI spent Pounds 54m on fixed capital investments and Pounds 20m on acquisitions. Over the three years of recession its capital expenditure - Pounds 160m - has been running at 1.5 times the rate of depreciation and its acquisition spending has reached Pounds 120m. Of the main operating divisions, drinks dispense and fluid power were the strongest, underpinning operating profits. Earnings were lower in the fluid power and special engineering divisions, the last containing the troublesome titanium operations which continued to lose money. COMMENT Given a flat UK economy, divining IMI's immediate future is the art of balancing the brightening US economic prospect against the darkening continental European market. The group has helped itself to the extent that it has now, after heavy investment, sorted out its copper tube operations and is gaining market share. Titanium should stop losing money this year as the market firms, but fluid power remains a worry in Europe and the best year for selling building products in Germany has passed. Small wonder it is looking for expansion in the Far East. Still, drinks dispense looks strong and recent capital investment will flow through to the bottom line this year making 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 75m look feasible. That would produce earnings per share of 15.5p, giving the shares a prospective p/e of 17.4, high enough until the European clouds lighten.</p>

President  Rawlings received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at the  Presidential Palace. During the meeting, Rawlings said that his  government still has much to do for Cuba because we must, in  some way, thank Cuba for what it has done for Africa. Ghana has  never hidden its appreciation for all that the Cuban Government  has done for us, President Rawlings told Foreign Minister  Robaina who has just concluded a two-day visit to Ghana. The  Ghanaian president also expressed his appreciation to the Cuban  authorities for sending a medical brigade to help control an  outbreak of Buruli ulcer. Rawlings also expressed his  willingness to develop bilateral cooperation in the field of  health.    At the conclusion of his two-day trip to Accra, Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina thanked Ghana for its support of the  island at international fora, particularly at the United  Nations. The head of Cuban diplomacy also thanked Ghana for its  position on issues such as the economic blockade imposed by the  U.S. Government more than 30 years ago. After describing 1993  as the most difficult year for the Cuban Revolution, Robaina  predicted that 1994 will represent the beginning of an ascending  curve for his people. Robaina said that among Cuba's foreign  policy priorities are the democratization of the United Nations  and the strengthening of the role played by the nonaligned  countries.</p>

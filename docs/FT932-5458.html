			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (3): Government has retreated - Economic reforms WHILE the new administration of President Kim Young-sam has moved rapidly to introduce political reforms, it has made a slower start on promised economic reforms. That emphasis on priorities reflects the Mr Kim's personal preference for politics instead of economics, a subject about which he readily confesses he knows little. Nonetheless, the new president has surrounded himself with economic reformers who want to reduce government control over the highly centralised economy and replace it with a structure based on autonomy and market forces. The current system, which was once praised as a model for developing countries, is now criticised as outdated for Korea's mature economy. The government no longer appears able to guide industrial development efficiently. Instead, the bureaucracy's taste for micro-management is hindering a necessary restructuring of industry. Mr Kim's administration initially appeared ready to make rapid changes when it announced in March that most lending rates would be deregulated this spring, while the practice of holding financial accounts under pseudonyms would be banned in an effort to combat tax evasion. But the government almost immediately retreated from these promises, explaining that the measures would exacerbate the country's economic problems. Deregulation would drive interest rates higher, while the requirement to use real names in financial transactions would cause a flight of capital abroad that could result in a credit squeeze, officials said. Similar arguments have been used by previous administrations in justifying the postponement of deregulation. The new government's reversal on these key reforms provoked doubts about whether it is committed to a radical restructuring of the economy. Mr Suh Sang-mok, an influential ruling party MP, blamed administrative confusion among new policymakers for the stumbling start on economic policy. 'Economic reform is a critical issue. The Korean economy will be in disastrous shape if reform is postponed any further. The new government is committed to change,' he said. The true test of the government's commitment is its ability to fulfil the extensive list of reforms contained in the draft of its five-year (1993-1997) economic plan, which was released last month. The guidelines cover three main areas: Fiscal policy. The government wants to promote economic equality by increasing the share of the public paying income taxes from the current level of 46 per cent, while raising tax revenues from 19.4 per cent of GNP in 1992 to 22 per cent by 1997. It believes it can achieve this, while lowering actual income tax rates. Instead, it will crack down on widespread tax cheating and close tax loopholes. It plans to curb speculation in property and securities by imposing tougher land taxes and introducing a capital gains tax. However, the fate of the 'real name' financial transaction system, which is considered instrumental in reducing tax evasion and eliminating insider share trading, remains vague. The government only promises to 'create an environment conducive' to its introduction and plans to propose an action plan for its implementation. The government, meanwhile, will cut its personnel costs and shift its budget priority from defence to improving the nation's infrastructure, which is now considered a bottleneck to industrial development. Spending will rise for roads, railroads, harbours, airports, storage facilities and water treatment. Financial reform, which includes easing state controls on the banking sector and reducing the government's role in credit allocation. Most lending rates will be liberalised later this year, while almost all interest rates will be deregulated by 1996. Restrictions on foreign exchange transactions will be eased, while regulations on overseas investment, foreign borrowings and local financing will be simplified or abolished. The central bank will be granted more independence to control the money supply. The proposed reforms, however, threaten the survival of the banking industry, which carries a heavy burden of bad loans. The bad loans are the result of prior government policy requiring banks to give loans at low rates to strategic industries. The reforms will force a reorganisation of the banking industry. Korea's 23 commercial banks will be encouraged to merge into bigger units and will be allowed to expand into other financial sectors to broaden their earnings base. Banks will also be granted more autonomy in managing their assets - and their presidents will no longer be appointed by the state. Industrial policy. The government has two main goals in industrial restructuring. One is to reduce the economic dominance of the nation's large conglomerates, or chaebol, while promoting the growth of small and medium-sized companies. The other is to boost research and development spending because Korea lacks strength in advanced manufacturing industries that offer export potential. Credit controls on the chaebol will be abolished as part of financial liberalisation. But they will be replaced by tougher anti-trust laws to force the chaebol to concentrate on a few core businesses instead of operating a wide range of diversified activities. Institutional investors will be encouraged to increase their shareholdings in the chaebol to reduce the influence of the family owners that now dominate them. Restrictions on individual chaebol will be eased if the group has a wide shareholder base. The government will cease targeting industrial sectors for support and protection, but will provide incentives for companies to increase R&amp;D spending and conclude technical alliances with foreign partners to acquire technology. These broad proposals, however, are already subject to modifications as the various government ministries negotiate in preparing a detailed blueprint for the plan that is due by the end of June. There is concern that the reforms could still fall foul of entrenched interest groups and other political factors that have stymied previous attempts at change. 'The new government has difficult economic problems because previous governments have deferred decisions on introducing reform,' says Mr Sakong Il, a former finance minister and the current chairman of the Seoul-based Institute for Global Economics. 'The one advantage this government has is that the environment to take tough decisions has improved because it has strong public support.'</p>

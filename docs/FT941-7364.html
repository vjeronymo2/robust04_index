			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / PM to challenge tax 'mythology' The prime minister and the chancellor are to launch an onslaught on what they call the 'mythology' of Tory tax rises in the next few days, as Labour continues to accuse the government of disguising the impact of tax increases. Mr John Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke are determined to counter Labour's claim that the level of taxation under the Conservatives is greater than it was under Labour. Mr Major will emphasise in a speech at the Conservatives' local government conference on Saturday that tax rises imposed in the last Budget were intended to reduce the government's budget deficit, while taxation under Labour simply promoted bigger spending plans. He will say that the effect of the November Budget will be to take less cash out of the economy than Labour claims. The speeches follow a fresh Labour attack on the Budget. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday that government figures had shown a fall in real disposable income of the poorest social groups in the past 15 years.</p>

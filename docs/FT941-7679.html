			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ICI sells 44.6% interest in Westralian Sands for Pounds 35m Imperial Chemical Industries has sold its 44.6 per cent stake in Westralian Sands, an Australian producer of raw materials for the manufacture of titanium dioxide, widely used in paint and paper production. Proceeds of the sale amounted to Pounds 35m, and 'approaching Pounds 10m' profit should be recorded in ICI's first quarter figures because the price was higher than the book valuation. Although the business was profitable, its disposal will have 'negligible' impact on earnings, the company said. The sale, by ICI's Tioxide subsidiary, appears to run counter to its strategy of strengthening its position in the titanium dioxide market. Last year it agreed a Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m) joint venture in North America with Kronos, a subsidiary of NL Industries of Houston, Texas. ICI said it sold the Westralian stake partly because it did not want to be in mineral extraction and partly because the raw materials supplied by Westralian were better suited to the obsolescent sulphate method of titanium dioxide manufacture. The rival chloride method is increasingly popular with manufacturers largely because it is less polluting. Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Tioxide's Japanese partner, has also sold its 18.5 per cent shareholding in Westralian. Mr Ken Court, Westralian chairman, said that although Tioxide and Ishihara would no longer have a stake in his company, both had large long-term contracts to buy titanium minerals from Westralian.</p>

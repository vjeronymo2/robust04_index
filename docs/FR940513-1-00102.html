			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the Department's view that Child Labor Reg. 5 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer necessary. The procedures set out in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation are not substantively different from the APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements which control DOL rulemaking, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of HOs. While the optional steps identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation are matters which the Department may choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to undertake in the promulgation of particular HOs, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps_involving study, drafting, examination, and review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of options and standards_are integral parts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's deliberative, policy-making process and, thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they need not and should not be set out in detail in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Further, it is the Department's view that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation potentially creates confusion in that the Child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labor Reg. 5 procedures may be viewed incorrectly as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory steps for promulgation of HOs. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeal of Child Labor Reg. 5 will eliminate the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also proposing a technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification in the regulations that is considered necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and appropriate in connection with the Work Experience and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Career Exploration Program (WECEP) to facilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for certification under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 570.35a of the regulations provides for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in a State-approved,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program (WECEP). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  A condition for approval of such programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is that they provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employment will not interfere with the schooling of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minors or with their health and well-being. Enrollees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved WECEPs may be employed for up to 23 hours in school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupations other than: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Twelve States have Departmental approval to operate WECEP programs in the 1992&hyph;94 school years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Those in manufacturing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mining;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Those declared to be hazardous for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment of minors under 18 years of age (set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E of the regulations); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Those declared to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous for employment of minors below the age of 16 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agriculture (set forth in subpart E&hyph;1 of the regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations at &sect;570.35a(c)(3) allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to approve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance from the prohibited occupations in individual cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or classes of cases after notice to interested parties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an opportunity to furnish views. In State Educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency applications for WECEP program approval and requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for variances from the Reg. 3 occupations restrictions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those programs pursuant to &sect;570.35a(c)(3), the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has consistently approved variances for particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities which, within the operation of programs that meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the WECEP criteria, have been determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department not to interfere with the health and well-being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in the programs. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide pertinent guidance to the State Educational Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other interested parties, the Department proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend the WECEP regulations to specify that the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities will be ordinarily considered to be acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for participants in approved WECEP programs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Using a deep fryer or cooking at a grill with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum temperature of 375 degrees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Operating power-driven mowers, weed-eaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trimmers and whips with nylon string only;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Retrieving and/or placing food in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coolers/freezers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Loading and unloading goods weighing up to 30 lbs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that such work does not exceed 30 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the minor's weekly hours worked; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

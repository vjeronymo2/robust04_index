			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Government assumption for council tax values faulty Sir, John Willman ('Town Hall 2', August 24) has misunderstood the nature of the Local Government Information Unit's analysis. This is hardly surprising, since he has not seen the relevant work. Our analysis looked at the gap between the government's original estimates of the 1991 values and the actual valuations that are now becoming known. But it did not conclude 'that average tax bills would be Pounds 61 higher than predicted'. The LGIU recently carried out a survey of a number of local authorities to find out how the properties in their area had been valued and banded. The information collected does demonstrate that the actual valuations are lower overall than the estimates on which the government's illustrative council tax figures were based. Our figures are based on the Inland Revenue's valuations. They are supported by similar research done by one of the local authority associations. The analysis shows how the government's initial overestimates of values will lead to higher bills than the illustrative figures, unless additional funding from central government is forthcoming. Our conclusion is that these errors in estimating property values have reduced the overall tax base for council tax. To make sense of how we reached this conclusion, it is necessary to understand how the tax for each band is to be calc-ulated. Council tax will be set for band D which covers properties worth between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 in England, the values for Wales and Scotland being slightly different. Ratios then determine the tax for the other bands. For example, the tax for band H will be exactly double band D. The income which the government assumes a local authority will receive from council tax depends on the number of 'band D equivalent' properties. The basis for the illustrative figures produced by the DoE in 1991 was that councils would 'raise revenue of Pounds 6.8bn from the council tax' and, on their estimates of the number of band D equivalents, this would require a council tax for band D of Pounds 400. Our figures suggest that the actual number of band D equivalents resulting from the valuations is 13.3 per cent below the DoE's original estimates. This means that band D tax in England would have to rise to Pounds 461 in order to raise the same amount of revenue. This is obviously where the Pounds 61 in the article comes from. But our figures have nothing to do with 'average bills'. Each band is affected differently by any rise in band D tax, as the figures of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy quoted in the article show. For example, on our figures, a band D tax of Pounds 461 would increase band H from Pounds 800 to Pounds 923; band A from Pounds 267 to Pounds 308. These figures were not plucked out of thin air, nor can they be said to be misleading. They simply result from taking the government's illustrative council tax figures - using exactly the same assumptions as the DoE in 1991, with one exception. We adjusted the distribution of properties between the bands in line with the results of our survey. In fact, our estimate of the potential tax increase in each band is very modest compared with those quoted from Cipfa, which showed band D tax going up by Pounds 139 and band H by Pounds 278.

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The bodies of two Southern California men have been recovered from the wreckage  of a private plane that crashed Aug. 6 south of Mammoth Lakes. Fresno County  sheriff's deputies were notified by two hikers over the weekend that they had  found the wreckage of the single-engine Piper Cherokee in the Pioneer Basin  area north of Edison Lake. The bodies of the pilot, Redwan Abouhamed, 29, of  Hawthorne, and a passenger, John Lazar, 29, of Inglewood, were found in the  burned wreckage. Authorities said it appeared that Abouhamed took the wrong  corridor through the mountains and was attempting an emergency landing when the  plane clipped a boulder, crashed and burst into flames.  </P></p>

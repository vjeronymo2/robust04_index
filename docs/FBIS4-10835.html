			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 15 Apr (PL) -- The electricity deficit  facing Cuba has no short-term solution, Basic Industry Minister  Marcos Portal announced today. He maintained that the country  will only be able to generate electricity at 60 percent of its  capacity by December.    Speaking on television to a panel of journalists, the  minister described the prolonged cuts as one of the gravest  problems facing the country.    There may be solutions but there can be no miracles, Portal  said. He added that there is currently no stable generation of  electricity due to a lack of spare parts [aseguramiento  material] for the thermoelectric plants.    The minister said that 66 percent of the electricity is  generated in plants from the former Soviet Union and former  Czechoslovakia, which disintegrated, and this led to an  interruption in the procurement of spare parts in the past three  years.    Portal also cited a lack of foreign currency, due to the  current economic crisis, among the factors that have worsened  the situation in this sector.    He reported that $3 million were allocated to the purchase  of  spare parts for the thermoelectric plants and $7 million to the  generation of electricity in 1994.    Two small plants will be operational by end of year, one in  eastern Cuban and the other near the capital, the minister added.    Portal said that limitations in this sector will not impede  further implementation of development plans promoted by Cuba to  overcome the serious economic problems currently facing it.    We have a new and powerful electricity system, he said,  after  pointing out that most Cuban plants were installed less than 25  years ago.    Portal thinks that the use of national petroleum, a heavy  crude with high sulfur content, is not the cause for breaks  [roturas] at the hydroelectric plants, because its use only  causes problems with the gas pipelines.    The use of national petroleum will save about $360 million  this year. This represents 30 percent of total electricity  consumption.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, says conditions  in Kashmir are favorable for initiating a political process.  Speaking to newspersons in Bombay yesterday, he said the  antimilitancy drive in the valley has received a good response.  Mr. Chavan said the people now realize that the activities of  the militants have nothing to do with religion. Meanwhile, the  CPI [Communist Party of India] has demanded immediate  consultations by the national and the state parties to initiate  a political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a letter to the  prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, the party general secretary,  Mr. Inderjit Gupta, said the government is relying mainly on  administrative measures to tackle the serious problem. The CPI  is opposed to this approach. The Janata Dal leader, Mr. George  Fernandes, has urged the militants in Jammu and Kashmir to give  up the path of violence and come to the negotiating table.  Talking to newsmen in Jammu yesterday, he said this will help  in restoring democratic process in the state.    In Jammu and Kashmir, 11 police personnel have been  dismissed  from service for dereliction of duty. They were found wanting  in preventing militants from setting ablaze a bridge in Anantnag  District. They did not put up resistance expected from them to  avert the militants. The state government had announced earlier  that stringent action will be taken against the defaulting  police personnel. It also said the police personnel who show  courage to thwart the militants action will be rewarded. As  reported 20 policemen were dismissed last year on this account.</p>

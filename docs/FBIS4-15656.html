			<p>BFN     [Text] We have learned that Russian Culture Minister  Yevgeniy Sidorov has acquired a new deputy. Vyacheslav Bragin  began his new duties on 6 April. Thus, the former chairman of  Ostankino TV and radio company has been farmed out to culture.  Maybe culture will be luckier than Ostankino.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and </F> Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by correspondent Hezi Makhlev on  9 April; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Makhlev] This evening, the foreign minister  commented on PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh's demand to  immediately start negotiations over the permanent status of the  territories instead of holding talks over autonomy in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho.    [Peres] I do not accept his view. There is an agreement that  must be implemented. This is what we will do. Anyone  attempting to achieve permanent peace today might only create a  permanent dispute by bringing up unresolvable issues.    [Makhlev] Sir, PLO circles are demanding immediate  negotiations over the permanent status in the territories  instead of holding talks on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho.    [Peres] I do not know what you mean by circles. We are  conducting negotiations with the PLO leadership and with Mr.  'Arafat. We are holding talks with him and have not heard any  such demands at the negotiating table.    [Makhlev] Do you plan to meet Mr. 'Arafat after Independence  Day in order to clarify these issues?    [Peres] If necessary, I will meet with him, but nothing has  been scheduled yet.    [Makhlev] Meretz is demanding to limit the closure and to be  generous in issuing work permits. What is your reaction to this?    [Peres] My response is that the place to discuss this issue  is within the framework of the cabinet.    [Makhlev] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, some of your  colleagues in Meretz are requesting to ease the closure and to  be more generous in issuing work permits to laborers from the  territories.    [Sarid] First of all, I would like to say that I support the  closure; however, I do not think that the government should tie  its hands now by making definitive decisions on the duration of  the closure. We know that closures have their limitations which  we have to take into account. There are humanitarian needs of  the first degree, and there is no need to make far-reaching  decisions only to later backtrack from them. Therefore, the  government should tomorrow evaluate the closure, which I  support, and examine its duration and limitations.</p>

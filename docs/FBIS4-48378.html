			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwandan refugees who had fled to Tanzania are  returning home in large numbers following the restoration of  peace and security in the Prefecture of Kibungo by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF]. In the last three days, the RPF near  Rusumo has received many returnees including 86 orphans who had  fled to Tanzania. Some returnees are accommodated in temporary  camps for some of them have feared going back to their homes  believing that the Republican National Movement for Democracy  and Development [MRND] youthwingers are still operating in the  countryside. But some returnees have been escorted to their  homes and, after ensuring that they are safe, they have stayed  in their homes.    Life is returning to normal in Prefecture Kibungo. The  returnees are calling upon their relatives, neighbors, and  friends who are still in refugee camps in Tanzania to take the  first opportunity available and come home. They should ignore  the malicious propaganda that the RPF is committing atrocities  in Kibungo. These rumors, this propaganda is being spread by  MRND's militia who are haunted by the massacres they have been  carrying out. The MRND's youthwingers are spreading the rumors  of atrocities by the RPF so as to discourage the refugees from  returning home. For if the refugees were to return home, it  would be easy to conduct investigations into the atrocities by  the youthwingers and the criminals would be easily exposed. But  the delay is not a solution. These criminals will eventually be  charged, whether in Rwanda or in Tanzania, for they have been  committing crimes against humanity.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / PM and Patten hold talks MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, (right) and Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday discussed strategy in the face of fierce opposition from China to Mr Patten's proposals for broader democracy in the territory. The two friends had talks and a private lunch. Mr Patten called for 'calm and constructive and rational discussions'. The vehemence of Beijing's objections upset Hong Kong's stock market, which has fallen 7 per cent in the past two days. Mr Patten said: 'We are very happy to have discussions about positive proposals for the way forward with anyone, at any time, anywhere.' HK airport funding, Page 6</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.3.1&blank;In-house Research Staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Runzheimer research personnel at its corporate headquarters in Rochester, Wisconsin, played a major role in all data-collection activities. These professionals:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contacted manufacturers, trade associations, governmental agencies, and retail establishments to ensure that suitable items were selected and priced;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contacted professionals in the real estate business in each of the costed locations to obtain general information as well as specific rental rates and home market values;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Conducted pricing surveys on site and by telephone for many items;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Served as a liaison for field researchers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Performed hundreds of quality control checks in conformance with editing rules communicated by Runzheimer to OPM once the data had been collected (these checks often involved verification of the survey data through telephone calls as well as comparing current data-gathering results with those from the 1992&hyph;1993 survey); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Analyzed and computed the category, component and total comparative cost indexes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.3.2&blank;Field Researchers_``Research Associates''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Collection of most price data was best accomplished through personal visits to retail outlets (e.g., grocery, clothing, automobiles). For these activities, Runzheimer hired residents of each allowance area as independent contractors (``research associates''). For years, when measuring living costs for its clients, Runzheimer has applied this approach to data collection in over 80 countries worldwide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest, Runzheimer did not hire persons as research associates who were either employees of the Federal Government, or who had immediate family who were employees of the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.3.3&blank;On-site Visits by Runzheimer Research Personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Full-time Runzheimer research professionals travelled to selected allowance areas to supervise data-collection activities and perform various quality-control checks on the data as necessary. Each such visit occurred during the pricing period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The researchers visited living communities within the allowance areas to look at housing accommodations personally and to talk with local real estate professionals. They also visited numerous retail outlets to verify item quality, selection and price levels in general.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, these researchers met with Runzheimer's research associate(s) to answer any data-collection questions and to provide any additional training and instruction as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.4&blank;Editing and Quality Control Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Runzheimer's experience in measuring living-cost differences enabled us to establish editing and quality-control procedures at all stages of collecting and analyzing data. All data provided by research associates were manually reviewed by analysts prior to being entered into Runzheimer's computer system. Data elements were subsequently checked through software programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal regulations in section 591.205(b)(1)(i), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, state that, ``Whenever possible, exact brands and models are priced in each location.'' Every effort was made to satisfy this objective. (See section 3.3 for a discussion of brand and model selection.) Nevertheless, in a number of the allowance areas, the exact brands and models were either not readily available or not available at all. In these instances, editing decisions and substitutions were needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer defines ``editing'' as the removal and/or replacement of a price quote based on consistent and logical criteria. In all areas, Runzheimer was concerned that items of lesser (or greater) quality than the item specified might inadvertently be included in the analysis and bias the results. Therefore, any price quote that varied significantly from other price quotes for the item was flagged, verified, and, if necessary, eliminated from the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removing an item from a location analysis causes redistribution of its weight to other items in its subcategory (or category when no subcategory exists). Consequently, whenever possible, Runzheimer avoided removing an unpriced item from a location analysis. When the review process revealed a missing price for an item, Runzheimer resurveyed to obtain a price wherever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.5&blank;Pricing Surveys in Nome, Alaska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> There are four allowance areas in Alaska: Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, and the Rest of the State of Alaska. As was done in previous surveys, Runzheimer surveyed living costs in Nome, Alaska to represent living costs in the Rest of the State of Alaska allowance area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM selected Nome for survey beginning with the 1991/1992 surveys. According to OPM, Federal civilian employment in Alaska is concentrated in the three main cities, and Federal employment outside these three cities is not concentrated in any particular town or region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM believed that living-cost surveys in multiple places outside the major cities would not be practical. Therefore, Nome was chosen because of its remote location, relative population size, and relative number of Federal civilian employees in that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.6&blank;Surveying the Washington, D.C., Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OPM defined the Washington, D.C., area in the federal regulations as the Washington DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Because federal employees who work in this area reside in Virginia, in Maryland, and in the District of Columbia, Runzheimer selected retail outlets and living communities from all three. Runzheimer's model gave equal weight to the average prices in each geographic area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the size and diversity of the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer conducted substantially more pricing surveys there than in other areas. For the Goods &amp; Services component, Runzheimer generally surveyed to obtain six times as many price quotes in the Washington, D.C., area as in the typical allowance area. For the Housing, Transportation and Miscellaneous Expense components, data collection was generally triple that of the typical allowance area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

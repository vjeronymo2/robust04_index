			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Acknowledging the growth factor - In a Nutshell A total of 11,600 companies with a combined turnover of Pounds 17.8bn make use of factoring and invoice discounting in the UK, according to a new survey.* But the potential market may be as much as 10 times as big, according to Michael Bickers, a financial adviser. There are 36 active factoring companies and three which are financing existing clients but no longer taking on new business. The industry continues to be dominated by the 11 members of the Association of British Factors and Discounters which represent 90 per cent of the total. Members of the Association of Invoice Factors account for just under 2 per cent and non-association factors for more than 8 per cent. *Part of a larger report entitled Factoring in the UK to be published shortly. From BCR Publishing, 108 College Road, Bromley, Kent BR1 3PF. Tel 081 466 6987. Available in two versions: Pounds 195 or Pounds 285.</p>

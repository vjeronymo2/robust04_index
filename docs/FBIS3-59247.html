NATO has its Partnership for  Peace; the EU is now offering a "stability pact." The thinking  behind these two grand proposals is almost identical: an  assumption that the West remains stable while the East is  "unstable," coupled with a desire to do everything--except what  really matters. Instead of membership of NATO, the East  Europeans have "partnerships" and, instead of entry to the EU,  they are supposed to be content with a new pact. Like NATO's  "partnerships," the EU's pacts could be a prelude to substantial  Western involvement, but only if the West Europeans are prepared  to follow words with deeds.    The stability pact was originally concocted by the French  prime minister, Edouard Balladur, more than a year ago. At the  beginning, it was just a half-baked device which allowed a new  right-wing French administration to put its stamp on the  country's foreign policy, hitherto assumed to be the exclusive  preserve of its Socialist president. Mr Balladur's initial plan  was based on the simple observation that former Communist states  are beset by potential ethnic and territorial disputes and that,  although most have expressed an interest in joining the European  Union, their readiness to co-operate among themselves was  noticeable by its absence. In an attempt to dissociate the  Union from the Yugoslav debacle, the Balladur plan suggested  establishing a network of treaties between the East Europeans,  all intended to settle their bilateral problems and thereby  prevent future violence. So far, so good, but hardly profound  or even convincing.    The French had a credibility problem in East Europe which  the  Balladur plan did little to dispel. Widely perceived to be  against a continued American military presence on the Continent  and opposed to the speedy eastward expansion of either the Union  or NATO, the French lost one diplomatic battle after another in  the dying days of their former Socialist administration.  President Mitterrand's proposal for a European "confederation,"  a recycled Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe,  was greeted with irritation and a highly embarrassing public  rebuke from the Czech president, Vaclav Havel.    But there was worse. Balladur's original proposal envisaged  the possibility of "minor" frontier adjustments, a horrifying  prospect for many East European states and an idea which,  interestingly, was also rejected by the Hungarians, the nation  traditionally thought to have most to gain from any border  revisions. Furthermore, the French were initially vague about  U.S. participation in the plan, so heightening suspicions that  their main aim was still to drive a wedge between Washington and  the Europeans. Finally, the implication that, once the East  Europeans had concluded bilateral treaties, these could be  upheld by Brussels raised the spectre of security guarantees of  the worst kind: ones given by an institution--the EU--that still  has none of the necessary military instruments.    Much of the criticism was unfair. Balladur did not advocate  territorial revision; he merely wanted the possibility of  frontier adjustments kept under review, should it be  contemplated by the negotiating parties themselves--a principle  that already exists in international law. Moreover, the French  never suggested that, in return for signing stability treaties,  the East Europeans would be offered security guarantees.  Nevertheless, the mere mention of this possibility elicited  universal criticism, an indication of just how little the French  thought through the implications of their ideas.    Unabashed, however, Balladur applied the approach that has  by  now become his trademark: dogged determination, coupled with  occasional pragmatism. And he was helped by the British who,  though harbouring grave reservations about the proposal, did  everything possible to accommodate him. A team comprising the  brighter bureaucrats in the European Commission in Brussels  ultimately ironed out the differences and the Americans were  kept informed. The result was the stability pact, adopted by  the Union weeks before NATO's summit stole the limelight.    Gone are all implicit references to the possibility of  territorial revision, security guarantees, or conditions for  eventual EU membership. Instead, the pact envisages a process of  consultation, bilateral and multilateral, starting with a summit  in Paris this April. After the initial meeting, individual East  European governments will be expected to discuss their problems  with each other, with the Union standing ready to help when  required. Further, since the process is an exercise in  preventing future, not existing wars, the republics of former  Yugoslavia are to be excluded.    Although no final list of countries concerned has been  provided, it is clear that the process will involve primarily  the six countries of Central and East Europe that have signed a  treaty of association with the Union, but it will also involve  some neighbouring countries, the Baltic republics, the U.S. and  international institutions with a direct stake in the  proceedings. The loose supervision of the treaties that may  ensue will be left to the Conference on Security and  Co-operation in Europe, so avoiding the need to create new  institutions. So far, so good, but hardly relevant.    Despite all protestations to the contrary, the plan still  regards East Europeans as novices, people who must be taught how  to eat with a knife and fork at a Western table. The Paris  conference does not intend to discuss Northern Ireland, the  Basque country or Corsica; all these problems are supposedly of  a different order from the difficulties of the Slovaks,  Hungarians, Romanians or Bulgarians. For years, France has  scuppered all attempts to define an international system to  protect ethnic minorities; only last November four Muslim French  girls who dared arrive for school wearing headscarves were  suspended from classes until they abandoned their religious  custom, an event that would have been roundly condemned in any  East European country. The East Europeans are therefore  expected to discuss minority protection and rights for special  groups that few Western countries are willing to accept.    In one aspect, too, the planned Paris conference is  reinventing the wheel: most of those participating from the  East already have friendship treaties with all their neighbours,  and not every East European state has the same problem: Poland  and the Czech Republic, for instance, are relatively homogenous  states, while Hungary's ethnic difficulty is with its kinsmen  abroad.    In keeping with its bureaucratic traditions, the European  Union decreed that it should have a common foreign and security  policy before anyone ascertained whether its members actually  had joint foreign and security interests. The stability pact is  now touted as evidence of how the EU can act in unison. In  practice, it will result in just another set of anodyne  statements distinguished only by their irrelevance.    The biggest contribution that the EU could make is not to  help the East Europeans to draft new treaties or "identify"  problems that everyone already knows exist, but to open up its  markets to East European products, thereby giving them a  realistic prospect of full membership of the Union.    But nothing of the kind is happening. The East Europeans,  for instance, have reduced their steel production by half over  the last 10 years, while the EU members have increased theirs by  20 per cent. Yet the East Europeans are now accused of "dumping"  steel on EU markets and have incurred punitive tariffs. While  the forthcoming Paris conference is to discuss high principles,  the bureaucrats in Brussels continue with their quotas on apples  or beans. Never mind the facts; just feel the vision: this is  the European Union message. Nevertheless, the mood is changing.  NATO's latest summit opened up the possibility of military  action by European states, using the assets of the alliance  without direct U.S. involvement on each occasion. Many details  still have to be defined, but this would give France the  opportunity to draw closer to NATO and defuse the demarcation  disputes that have paralysed Europe since the end of the Cold  War.    The meeting which took place in London yesterday between the  French, German and British defence ministers is one step in this  direction. Once the West's internal disputes abate, it would be  possible to take a serious look at East Europe's wider security  needs as well. Paradoxically, the stability pact that Balladur  originally launched in order to gain some control over President  Mitterrand's foreign policy has now become an irrelevance, a  diversion that Mitterrand can host while serious decisions about  the Continent are taken elsewhere.    And the EU's foreign and security policy? It is, as the  bureaucrats say, still "evolving."</p>

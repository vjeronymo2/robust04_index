			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 17 Jan (PL) -- Alexander Watson, the U.S.  under secretary of state for inter-American affairs, today was  called a buffoon and a vote grabber who is working the streets  of Miami by Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a regular Cuban columnist.    In an article that appeared in the TRABAJADORES weekly, Leon  Cotayo based his appraisal on Watson's statements during recent  meetings with a sector of the Cuban community in Miami.    The columnist referred specifically to the 6 January meeting  which was called by the high-ranking State Department official  "to render accounts to a Cuban group on the U.S. Government's  policies regarding the island."    In this respect, Leon Cotayo asserted, Watson defended the  continuation of the blockade; supported the so-called Torricelli  Law, which intensifies the blockade; and conditioned the  cessation of this policy on a change in the Cuban political and  economic system.    The columnist added that Watson had predicted the collapse  of  the revolution in the Caribbean nation as if such predictions  had not been made since the blockade was intensified in 1990.    In Leon Cotayo's opinion, "it was another demonstration of  Watson's commitment to the right-wing representatives of the  Cuban community established in Miami."    It showed, the Cuban columnist added, Watson's inclination  to  back "the most varied, loud, and illusory conservative demands  presented by this group and to handle the issue not as a foreign  policy issue, but as an internal U.S. affair."    According to Watson's logic, Leon Cotayo indicated, if Cuba  is basically an internal problem, it is not unrelated to the  electoral process, and, therefore, the positions of the Cuban  groups must be taken into account, especially the positions of  those with more financial resources, political influence, and a  clear loyalty to Washington's interests.    Nevertheless, it is still surprising that "high-ranking  officials of a government that wants to systematically hold the  reins of the world are, somewhat abjectly, willing to travel to  a southern community in their extensive country to explain their  policies to frustrated annexationist groups."    Leon Cotayo concludes: "Watson must assume the sad image  which mixes a buffoon -- and, indeed, a buffoon of a town rather  than a court -- with a vulgar vote grabber who is working the  streets of Miami."</p>

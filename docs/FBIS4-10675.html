			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose A. Puertas] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 12 Apr (AFP) -- The new  Venezuelan Government has designed an economic program that will  help overcome fiscal and financial difficulties in the short run  and establish the bases for a sustainable growth with decreasing  inflation, Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said  on Tuesday in Guadalajara.    Speaking to the 35th Annual Assembly of the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) which is being held in this Mexican city,  the Venezuelan minister assured that his government will only  apply "the most orthodox mechanism of healthy macroeconomic  management, that is, it will finance the deficit through higher  domestic taxing and expense reduction."    Sosa's speech generated great expectations among the  representatives of the international financial community who are  attending the IDB assembly, because of the uncertainty, created  by the inflation and fiscal deficit, that President Rafael  Caldera found when he was inaugurated in February. Several  bankers described his speech as "positive" and "encouraging."    Sosa Rodriguez listed five guidelines for his strategy:  adequate macroeconomic management, comprehensive tax reform, an  economic stabilization program, promotion of domestic and  foreign investment, and continuation of economic opening through  free exchange agreements with its commercial partners.    The effort will be supported by reaching a consensus with  the  labor and business sectors in order to voluntarily restrain  price increases during the transition to the economic structure  proposed by the government. He described it as "a competitive  economy with social justice."    As for the assembly's agenda, Sosa Rodriguez said that he  was  pleased with the $40 billion increase in IDB capital, but  complained about a lack of generosity on the part of  non-borrowing members reflected by their contributions to  concessionary [concesionales] funds used to assist countries  that have lower revenues. He pointed out that although there  was an agreement to reduce their contributions [participacion  accionaria] to non-regional countries, Latin America and the  Caribbean have had to bear a higher financial burden in its  contributions to the bank. "[Word indistinct] the financial  difficulties of non-borrowing countries, but they cannot be  compared to the fiscal restrictions facing other countries of  the region," the Venezuelan minister added.    He made it clear that Venezuela does not support one of the  commitments included in the agreement to increase resources,  that is, the capitalization of various funds through the  transfer of net revenues produced by regular capital. This  mechanism will increase financial charges on loans and will  recycle resources within the region rather than channel  additional resources into it, he pointed out.</p>

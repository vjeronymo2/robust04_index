			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / European Diary - France: Paris cinemas fear new wave of competition - The expansion of French cinema chains is posing a threat to the independents FOR THE past few weeks the film buffs of Paris have been queueing patiently  -and not so patiently - on the Place d'Italie to visit the Gaumont Grand Ecran, the city's newest cinema and the biggest single screen in the French capital. There will be yet another brand new cinema to try out from tomorrow when Le Dome Imax opens its doors at La Defense in western Paris. At a time when the Hollywood studios are struggling and the British film industry is on its knees, the launch of not one but two new screens in Paris could be seen as a symbol of French cinema's success. But the expansion of the big French cinema chains, notably Gaumont, the Grand Ecran's owner, poses a growing threat to the dozens of tiny independent cinemas that have turned Paris into one of the world's liveliest film centres. The Grand Ecran's opening could come to be seen not as a success symbol, but as a milestone in French cinema's decline. Anyone glancing at this week's Paris film listings could be forgiven for thinking that decline is a long way off. Paris is still a dream city for any cineaste, with a wider choice of films than anywhere else in the world. The city is plastered with posters for the latest Hollywood blockbusters showing at the big commercial chains. Night after night the dozens of tiny independent cinemas in the Latin Quarter play crackly prints of esoteric art films to packed houses. This summer's retrospective of the films of John Cassavetes, the US director, is the most successful revival ever in Paris. The reason why there are so many films is simple - Paris has lots of cinemas, 450 to be precise. The proliferation of independents means that even the most obscure new movies usually open on at least three screens. The purist film fiends rarely stray from the Latin Quarter art houses. The less ascetic are tempted away to more exotic screens such as La Pagode, a Japanese pagoda imported to France in the 1890s and converted into a cinema in the 1930s, or Le Grand Rex on Boulevard Poissoniere, where images of clouds are projected on to the star-spangled ceiling. For years the art houses have co-existed comfortably with the big commercial chains, thanks to the support of the sympathetic Socialist government, whose long-serving arts minister, Mr Jack Lang, is an ardent cinema fan. Mr Lang has long believed that it is impossible to have a healthy domestic film industry without an adequate distribution system. One of his first initiatives as arts minister in 1982 was to split up GIE, then France's biggest single cinema chain, into two networks, Gaumont and Pathe. The two new chains, together with UGC, the other big French network, have since been forced to compete for films. Given that there is only a limited number of Hollywood movies to go round, this competition has created more room for independent productions on the commercial chains and has alleviated the pressure on the art houses. But earlier this year Gaumont struck a deal to swap a string of its provincial cinemas for the Paris screens owned by Pathe. This means that Gaumont, which now has 19 cinemas with 79 screens in the capital, is once again the dominant chain in the capital, with UGC as its only serious rival. The cynics in French film circles claim that Gaumont's growth has already had an effect. Gaumont and UGC, they say, are allocating too many screens to Hollywood blockbusters. The most widely distributed films in Paris this week, Basic Instinct and Beethoven, are both from the US and both showing on almost 20 screens. There are fears that this situation will worsen next year when Gaumont starts to act as the exclusive French distributor for Disney, the US film studio. Another concern is that distribution is becoming increasingly difficult for independent film makers. Mr Serge Toubiana, editor of Cahiers du Cinema, the film magazine, recently wrote an article in Liberation newspaper describing the problems faced by Mr Daniele Dubroux, a young French director, in finding a cinema to show Borderline, his latest film. Mr Lang's Arts Ministry has voiced its concern, as has the French film producers' association. Mr Michael Sapin, the finance minister, last week took action by referring the Gaumont/Pathe deal to the Conseil de la Concurrence, the competition authority, for retrospective investigation. He also warned that he would be keeping a sharp eye on similar transactions in the future. Meanwhile, the big French cinema chains are intent on becoming even bigger. UGC is now building the capital's first multi-screen cinema complex. Gaumont is renovating four of its Paris cinemas as part of a Pounds 20m programme. For better or worse, the era of the Grand Ecran has begun in Paris cinema.</p>

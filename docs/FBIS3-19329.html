			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christiane Goetz: "The Most Expensive Scrap of </F> the GDR"]    [Text] A total of 1.5 million German marks [DM] per day --  this is how much the German taxpayer has to pay for the heritage  of the GDR's National People's Army (NVA). Norbert Holla,  spokesman for the Armament Section in the Defense Ministry, told  FOCUS that this is the sum needed for guarding, destroying, and  disposing of old NVA weapons and equipment.    In 1993, scrapping GDR war materiel cost DM290 million, this  year it will cost DM530 million. To meet the timetable for  getting rid of the materiel, ever higher sums from the defense  budget have to be spent on the elimination of the NVA heritage.  By the end of 1995, the legacy of the GDR Army should be  dissolved completely.    Yet, some experts regard this timetable as utopian. "We will  have to struggle with this problem for several more decades,"  predicts Hans-Joachim Schmidt, arms control expert of the Hesse  Peace and Conflict Research Foundation. Enormous amounts of  poisonous military scrap and ammunition are still buried in the  new laender. The deputy chairman of the Defense Committee in  the German Bundestag, Heinz-Alfred Steiner, of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], has even claimed that "NVA  materiel is still straying in the Bundeswehr." So far the  stocktaking of the remains of the GDR Army, which was beaten  without combat, has not even been concluded.    Vera Wollenberger, defense policy spokeswoman for the  Alliance 90/Greens, also suspects a huge looming "cost  avalanche." The lady from Thuringia refers to her information  as a member of the defense committee of the last GDR People's  Chamber: Based on detailed calculations regarding the  dissolution of the NVA, the committee assumed that the scrapping  of the ammunition alone would take at least 10 years.    Any delay increases the cost even further: While prices for  the technologically expensive disposal are rising, the arms  arsenals have to be guarded at great cost. No fewer than 1,500  guards are needed, because the facilities at which the  ammunition and arms have been concentrated are regarded as  bearing an extreme security risk. The positive side: The 11  facilities in the new laender, where the enormous amounts of  ammunition are being scrapped, have at least provided 2,000 safe  jobs -- which, for Walter Kolbow, the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] defense policy spokesman, constitutes a "major  job-creation program" that actually should not be funded from  the defense budget.    All in all, scrapping and guarding NVA arms and ammunition  has cost DM900 million since unification -- and the billion-mark  threshold will be exceeded by the end of the year. The hopes  that one could even make money from the GDR legacy have not been  fulfilled: Not more than one-third of the expenses have been  returned so far to the state's pocket through the sale of  individual units of equipment and contracts at government level.    Still, it is not only NATO countries that have been among  the  recipient countries: A total of 39 ships went to Indonesia at a  time when international organizations complained about human  rights violations in East Timor.    According to Gerald Rotter of the Federal Office for  Armament  Technology and Procurement in Koblenz, ammunition has also been  shipped to Indonesia, as well as to Finland and Sweden. Tankers  were sold to Kuwait and Egypt, while trucks were even sold to  Vietnam and Ecuador.    Experts suspect that, via dealers, stocks even reached the  international arms trade -- thus reaching conflict areas such as  Bosnia. According to former Minister Christian  Schwarz-Schilling (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], the  civil-war-stricken area in the Balkans would at least be a  rewarding destination for arms supplies. "Instead of destroying  them here at enormous cost, using them there would at least make  sense."    The Bundeswehr received a total of 150 ships, including 90  larger ones, from NVA stocks. Selected vessels went to the  Verwertungsgesellschaft fuer Besatzungsgueter mbH (Vebeg)  [Exploitation Corporation for Military Equipment] in  Frankfurt/Main, which sells off discarded NVA and Bundeswehr  materiel on behalf of the Federal Government.    The Vebeg, meanwhile, has been able to sell most of its Navy  and Air Force stocks. Long-distance aircraft provided the  highest return -- up to DM1.5 million per unit. Three went to  Egypt, three were bought by a German businessman who managed to  resell one in Russia, and one was given away to Estonia (which  is said to have led to irritation with Russia). Some 50 combat  aircraft of the former GDR were donated to German museums.    Of the more than 60,000 NVA vehicles, from Trabant cars to  large Russian vehicles, Vebeg has sold about 33,000 in the past  three years. One major item went to the United Nations as  humanitarian aid.    In Germany, Vebeg mainly sold motorcycles and passenger  cars,  mostly to small businesses and farmers. Yet, a total of 6,000  vehicles could only be sold at scrap value. Another 15,000 cars  are still stored in seven facilities in eastern Germany where  they can be bought at auctions.    More than 110,000 tonnes of the 300,000 tonnes of ammunition  that have so far been found still have to be disposed of. Most  large-caliber stuff has meanwhile been almost completely  destroyed: Hartmut Krone, manager of the Buckinpar GmbH in  Pinnow (Brandenburg), has said that his company will complete  the scrapping of all NVA missiles -- 360,000 units altogether --  by May.    The deputy chairman of the Bundestag Defense Committee,  Steiner, has meanwhile called for "conceptual restructuring."  To speed up the dissolution, entire stocks should be sold in  the future in "one package." Karsten Voigt, security policy  spokesman for the SPD, however, would prefer that arms exports  be stopped altogether in the future: "I would rather scrap  everything, even if it were to cost more."</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Fiat and Ford clinch joint deal FIAT AND FORD, the Italian and US automotive groups, have completed an agreement that combines their worldwide tractor, farm and earthmoving equipment operations. The joint venture will be one of the world's top three agricultural machinery suppliers. Although signed in December, the agreement was announced last July. The delay, Fiat said yesterday, was due mainly to two regulatory factors in the US and Europe. Last week, Fiat agreed to loosen its hold on tractor dealerships in Italy, ending its exclusive supply arrangements with a national grouping of farmers' co-operatives. That followed last month's sale of its Hesston hay-making equipment division in the US to allay Federal anti-trust concerns. As a result of the Ford/Fiat agreement, the Italian company is forming a new Netherlands-incorporated holding company, N. H. Geotech, into which Ford's New Holland subsidiaries and Fiat's Geotech Group are being merged. N. H. Geotech will be based in London, with Fiat owning 80 per cent of the equity and Ford the remainder. The new company would have had sales of more than Dollars 5bn last year. N. H. Geotech's chairman and chief executive will be Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat SpA. Mr Giancarlo Vezzalini from Geotech will be vice-chairman. There will also be three executive vice-presidents: Mr Robert Gerrity, chief executive of Ford New Holland; Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, chief executive of Fiat Geotech; and Mr Vincenzo Morelli, formerly with General Electric of the US.</p>

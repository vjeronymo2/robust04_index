			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Palarya and Sergey </F> Ostanin]    [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- U.N. military commanders in  the former Yugoslavia have allocated several positions for  Russian officers who will take them up this autumn, according to  airborne troop commander Colonel-General Vladimir Podkolozin.    Podkolozin said on Wednesday that at first U.N. commanders  offered Russian officers six secondary positions. "This could  not satisfy us. We insisted on one key position -- deputy  sector commander and received a positive answer. Russian  officers will take up the posts this autumn," he said.    Podkolozin said that the 1,500-strong Russian contingent in  the former Yugoslavia will be replaced by a new one in October.  Under the contract, soldiers can stay in the war zone not  longer than six months, officers -- a year. They may prolong  their contracts for another six months if they wish so.    Podkolozin also said that Russia paid off its 1.5 billion  U.S. dollar debt to the United Nations by participating in U.N.  peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Russian  peace-keepers oversee cease-fire, prevent illegal arms exports  and control troop movement.    Over two years of participation in the U.N. contingent in  the  former Yugoslavia five Russian soldiers were killed and 17  wounded.    Russian soldiers in Yugoslavia receive 833 dollars a month,  warrant officers 874-877 dollars and officers 915-1,008 dollars.</p>

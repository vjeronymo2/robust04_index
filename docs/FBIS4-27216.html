			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's task  force suggests that the government should set aside greater  public works funds for improving the nation's social  infrastructure to cope with a rapidly graying society.    The outline of the report, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE  Sunday, also says the government should consider making it  mandatory to discontinue subsidies five or 10 years after they  started to be given if no measures are taken to extend them.    The proposals are contained in a report worked out by a  working group on public works projects and subsidies of the  ruling coalition's Tax Reform Council.    The report is to be formally published early next month.    The panel is one of the four working groups the ruling  coalition has created within its administrative and fiscal  reform subcommittee.    The task force has since studied ways to slash public works  spending and subsidies on the assumption that indirect tax rates  will be raised to cope with a rapidly aging society.    On public works spending, the panel proposes that the  government allocate greater funds to projects aimed primarily at  improving social infrastructure, notably the quality of life.    In order to identify such projects, the coalition's  committee  on social infrastructure should come up with clear-cut policies,  the panel says.    During discussions conducted so far, some members of the  working group suggested that three government ministries and as  many agencies be integrated into a public-works ministry.    The three ministries are the construction, agriculture,  forestry and fisheries, and transport ministries while the three  agencies are the national land, Hokkaido development and Okinawa  development agencies.    The panel, however, failed to bring the matter to a  conclusion because the proposal met with opposition from some  members who maintained that efficiency would lower at such a  large government ministry.</p>

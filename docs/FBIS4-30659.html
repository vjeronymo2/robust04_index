			<p>BFN     [Text] The Marines today captured the center of Abu  Sayyaf's camp in Sampinid, Basilan. The Abu Sayyaf group was  forced to flee Hill 734, their biggest camp in Sampinid, after  an intensive military operation. Here is Arnold Clavio's report  from Basilan:    [Begin Clavio recording] Government troops have overrun at 3  AM today Hill 734 in Sampinid complex, the center of the Abu  Sayyaf camp. The military had been in an offensive position  since last night, prepared to finally capture the reputed  kingdom of Barhama Sali.    When the camp was captured, the military immediately named  it  Camp (Gadjuli), in recognition of the heroism of Lieutenant  Colonel (Johnson Gadjuli), who had earlier planned the capture  of the Sampinid complex, but was unfortunately shot in the head  by an Abu Sayyaf sniper.    At present, the military is continuing its mop up operation  and its pursuit of Sali's group in Sampinid. Colonel Edgardo  Espinosa, commander of the 3d Marine Brigade, said they are  carefully scouring the complex for possible land mines buried by  fleeing bandits. Espinosa added that they are scheduled to  exhume the bodies of Abu Sayyaf members killed, and excavate the  group's arms cache.    According to Espinosa, once they have totally cleared the  perimeters of Sampinid complex, they will immediately establish  a permanent battalion of Marines in the area. The 445th  Engineering Battalion will also join and undertake  reconstruction of houses.    Meanwhile, the bodies of three Marines who were earlier  reported missing were found today. The bodies of Sergeant Edgar  Escobidal, Sgt. Vicente Kaplanan, and Private First Class  Romarico Espijo were flown to Zamboanga City. The number of  casualties on the military side has reached nine, while 41 Abu  Sayyaf members have been killed. [end recording]</p>

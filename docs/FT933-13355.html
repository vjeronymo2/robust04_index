			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs condemn move to limit education bill debate LABOUR leaders kept MPs trooping through the lobbies in the Commons last night in a series of divisions as a protest against action taken by the government to limit debate on 580 Lords amendments to the education bill. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, justified the voting manoeuvre on the grounds that the government had failed to provide adequate time for changes made to the bill by the Lords to be properly scrutinised. She said: 'We may be gagged but we can use our votes.' Earlier the government secured a majority of 66 (288-222) for a guillotine motion limiting debate on the Lords amendments to a total of 8 1/2 hours. Defending the move, Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, stressed that MPs had already spent 150 hours discussing the bill. The government, he said, wanted the bill to secure royal assent by the end of the month so that it could become operative with the start of the new school year in September. Mr Forth insisted the reforms provided by the bill - including opportunities for more schools to attain grant-maintained status so they were no longer subject to control by local education authorities - should not be further delayed. He said: 'For too long too many schools have simply shrugged their shoulders at the problems which are clearly besetting them and causing them to fail to give their pupils an acceptable standard of education.' He emphasised that rather more than half of the Lords amendments were of a technical or 'tidying-up' character. Mrs Taylor protested that by restricting debate on the Lords amendments to about 8 1/2 hours the government was reducing the proceedings in the Commons 'to a farce'. She said: 'It is totally outrageous and unacceptable to have a timetable of this kind imposed at this stage.' Accusing ministers of arrogance, she stressed some amendments could become law without a word being spoken on them in the Commons. The limited time available for debating the amendments was also criticised by Mr Alan Howarth, Tory MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, a former education minister. Mr Howarth said the move to limit debate was 'particularly unsatisfactory' because of the 'enormously important' proposals on sex education. 'It seems inevitable that we shall not have a chance to debate or to vote separately on this extremely important issue and I do regard that as extraordinary.'</p>

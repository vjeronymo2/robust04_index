Even if the negotiations take a few months, we  will not change our minds. What we are telling the PLO is  simple: We have put together a very original package for you.  What we proposed in Oslo contained a territorial element which  did not come up in the Washington talks. In Washington,  discussions were held about principles, but principles alone  cannot bring us to an accord. We are telling the Palestinians:  We gave you a plan, and you must decide on the timetable. If  you decide to slow down, we, too, will not be in a hurry. If  you hurry, we, too, will hurry. For some reason, the  Palestinians are under the impression that we cannot wait, that  we have to finish the thing. We are in no rush." These remarks  were made yesterday by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres during a  meeting with Labor's Ef'al circle, which convened in Ramat Ef'al.    For over an hour, Peres replied to poignant questions posed  by members of the Ef'al circle, which is seen as a hawkish Labor  forum. It is headed by Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, and its activities  are directed by reserves Major General Shay Erez, a former head  of the Civil Administration in Judaea and Samaria. In reply to  questions reflecting the circle members' anxieties and  uncertainty with respect to the arrangement with the PLO and the  future arrangement with Syria, Peres delivered an optimistic and  visionary speech about a changing world and a new Middle East.  "Not only has our region undergone a dramatic change, but the  changes we anticipate will be even more dramatic than anything  we have witnessed so far," Peres said. The real enemy  threatening the Arab world is not Zionist but rather  fundamentalist. "I do not think Labor's political adversary is  the Likud; it lies within our midst. We are unable to sever  ourselves from the past," Peres said, directing his barbs at the  hawkish Labor forum members who are not entirely at ease with  the government moves.    He maintained that the Gaza Strip arrangement will be  nothing  like the one in Judaea and Samaria and that the latter will not  resemble the arrangement on the Golan Heights. "Netzarim does  not resemble the 'Etzyon Bloc," Peres said. He added that the  Sinai precedent does not have to dictate the Judaea and Samaria  arrangement, because there was no Palestinian rule in Judaea and  Samaria when Israel conquered the area and because of the  problem of Jerusalem and the settlements. Peres refrained from  stating explicitly that the peace arrangement with Syria calls  for Israel to withdraw from all of the Golan, as his cabinet  colleagues, Ministers Shulamit Aloni and Yosi Sarid, have said  and his deputy, Yosi Beilin, has implied. "I see no point in  starting the negotiations with Syria with offers of concessions  on the Heights. I do not endorse the Syrian stand, but I do not  intend to commit myself now to moves on which I may be unable to  carry through. We are negotiating with Syria, not with  ourselves," Peres said, stressing that any peace agreement with  Syria will entail painful concessions. "We will have to choose  between two conflicting aspirations: the desire to attain a  peace agreement with Syria and the desire to hold on to all or  most of the Golan. The question that will have to be answered is  whether our unwillingness to give up the Golan may not force us  to give up the peace agreement," Peres said. He did not voice  his view on the referendum idea, and he was not asked about it.    Peres added that before reaching an agreement with Syria,  the  government will seek to attain an agreement with Jordan. In his  opinion, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement will be completed in  the course of 1994. We will attain peaceful relations (though  not necessarily a formal peace agreement) with Jordan that will  include, among other things, regional economic cooperation  accords on issues such as projects along the Jordan River and in  the 'Arava. Peres' list of arrangements anticipated in 1994 did  not include a peace agreement with Syria.    The foreign minister attacked Meretz faction members, as  well  as Labor figures, "whose hatred for the ultra-Orthodox has  pushed SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Yisra'el to  the right." In his opinion, the government will have difficulty  reaching political resolutions without the  religious-ultra-Orthodox bloc. "I know that I have been accused  of staging the `foul maneuver' [which toppled the government in  March 1990], but what the ultra-Orthodox wanted -- education  budgets -- was their legitimate due. We are not losing the  religious public because of a budget but because some of us  radiate contempt and hatred toward them." [passage omitted]</p>

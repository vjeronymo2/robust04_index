This is what Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov said in  an interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. He emphasized that the  draft agreement on the peaceful settlement proposed by the  Russian diplomat drew a mixed reaction from the Baku  authorities. According to the Azerbaijani minister, the draft  does not include provisions on the immediate and unconditional  withdrawal of Armenian troops from all occupied territories, on  which Baku has been insisting. Instead, the two sides were  invited to sit down at a negotiating table to discuss all  contentious matters. Gasan Gasanov asked the Russian diplomat  to make substantial adjustments to the peaceful settlement  draft. "Azerbaijan insists on a phased solution to the  question," he told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We  will give security guarantees to the Armenian population of  Nagorno-Karabakh, but in exchange the Armenian side must create  all requisite conditions for a return of more than a million  Azerbaijani refugees to the areas of their permanent residence."  When asked by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent about  Baku's attitude to Moscow's proposal for the Iranian-Azerbaijani  border to be protected jointly, the Azerbaijani minister said:  "This proposal may be a matter of discussion after Azerbaijan  and Iran sign a treaty "On the Regime of the Azerbaijani-Iranian  Border." During my visit to Tehran we reached agreement on  setting up a working group for drawing up this document."</p>

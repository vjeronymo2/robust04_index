			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Jobs: Executives' guide to powerful politicking - US professor spells out lessons on a branch of management that management schools rarely teach SUPPOSE you've just been made a senior manager, and can choose the location of your office on the palatial top floor of group headquarters. Which of the following pair would you pick? A - A big one at the outside of the building, whose windows command a glorious view of the surrounding city and countryside. B - A smaller one opening on to a corridor directly opposite the door to the executive lavatories. As a general rule, American management professor Jeffrey Pfeffer would pick the second. That was where he had his room at the University of California's Berkeley business school before his elevation to its more famous counterpart at Stanford. The site of the office meant that every day everyone in the building who mattered, 'except those with very strong kidneys', would pass his door. He always kept it open of course. 'People who are well placed in the communication network also tend to be the central players in terms of power and influence,' he observes in his latest book. Called Managing with Power*, it's the best guide to organisational politicking that the Jobs column has ever read. * Harvard Business School Press (Boston, MA 02163). Dollars 24.95 Mind you, he would not advise the same choice of site in all cases. Much depends on the style of the organisation. In the hierarchical sort with power concentrated at the top - General Motors is his example - the big office with breath-taking vista is usually the cannier option. The smaller one with leak-taking ambience is more likely to be advantageous in less formally structured outfits, such as Apple Computer. But there are many other factors that will determine which choice is best in any given set of circumstances. Indeed, the fact that politicking is a subtle and demanding craft is the book's main message. In a text of 345 pages, I could find only one specific, universally applicable rule: if you have two proposals to put before a decisive meeting, present the stronger second. The professor nevertheless argues that all of us must learn the craft if we want to succeed, and often even survive, as executives. '. . .to get things done, you need power - more power than those whose opposition you must overcome - and thus it is imperative to understand where power comes from and how these sources of power can be developed,' he says. Other imperatives, once it is acquired, are the know-how to hang onto it, and the will as well as the technical finesse to use it. That is so even though most people find the idea of politicking distasteful, believing that 'if we do our best, work hard, be nice, and so forth, things will work out for the best.' Alas, experience shows they usually won't. So the watchword should be: whenever you're not using power in your own favour, someone else will be using it all the more effectively against you. Jeffrey Pfeffer divides the process of acquiring the craft into steps, starting with the recognition that there are varying interests in virtually every organisation. 'This suggests that one of the first things we need to do is to diagnose the political landscape and figure out what the relevant interests are, and what important political subdivisions characterise the organization . . . .' For instance, if you are un-expectedly offered an important job high in a company, don't take it as proof of your personal brilliance. Before accepting, mull over the likely motives of those making the offer. They may well have a hidden agenda; if so, there'll be pitfalls that need investigating. Nor is it enough just to identify the motives and perspectives of the clusters of allied and opposing interests. Successful politicking also requires analysis to find why the different factions hold their particular attitudes. The ego must not be allowed to colour the analysis. 'It is all too easy to assume that those with a different perspective are somehow not as smart as we are, not as informed, not as perceptive.' That sort of pride most often goes before a fall, the professor says . One of the prime traits of effective power-wielders is 'the ability to submerge one's ego in the effort to get something accomplished', not least because the 'real secret of success in organizations is the ability to get those who differ from us, and whom we don't necessarily like, to do what needs to be done.' After the outfit's political dynamics have been identified, he recommends a seven-stage process of personal review. It goes: 1 - Decide what your goals are, what you are trying to accomplish. 2 - Diagnose patterns of dependence and interdependence; what individuals are influential and important to achieving your goal? 3 - What are their points of view likely to be? How will they feel about what you are trying to do? 4 - What are their power bases. Which of them is more influential in the decision? 5 - What are your bases of power and influence? What bases of influence can you develop to gain more control over the situation? 6 - Which of the various strategies and tactics for exercising power seem most appropriate and are likely to be effective, given the situation you confront? 7 - Based on the above, choose a course of action to get something done. As for the strategies and tactics, to judge from the numerous cases that Jeffrey Pfeffer cites to support his thesis, he takes an exceedingly broad view. It is that, provided you can satisfy your own conscience that your goal is of over-riding importance, any means that work to the said end will do. Blatant toadying is one example, although research suggests that it is most extravagant in outfits under little or no pressure of competition. In General Motors' heyday, for instance, one of its top men went to visit a plant whose own chiefs were eager for his favour. Knowing he liked late-night snacks, they sent a refrigerator full of delicacies to his hotel room, but it was too big to go through the door. So they had a crew with a crane remove the window, hoist in the goodies, and replace the pane. Such little gestures of affection, however, are not always enough to turn the trick. At the opposite extreme, there will be occasions when the only way forward is to gain means of forcing dissenters to toe the line on pain of ejection. In which case, it seems that serious operators don't hesitate to hit their opponents when they're down. The book cites an ambitious Wall Street manager who, after long temporising with his main rival, suddenly decided the time was ripe to drive him out. The reason was that the competitor had just been through surgery for a brain tumour that had come on top of a painful and public divorce. As the professor says, successful politicking rarely coincides with a yen to be universally liked. Even so, it is wise to stop short of becoming an absolute tyrant - a condition which, in the Jobs column's experience, tends to lead to blindness to the politics seething below. Over the years, several company despots have sworn to me that no such activity exists in their organisation, on the lines of the ancient tyrant who, when advised on his death bed to forgive his enemies, replied: 'There aren't any. I hanged them all.' My impression that the most dangerous politics are the unseen variety is confirmed by Jeffrey Pfeffer. However long you've ruled unchallenged, he says: 'Never underestimate your opponents. If you prepare too carefully, and take too many precautions, you may waste some effort. But if you underestimate what you are up against, you can lose, and losing even one battle may signal the decline of your power.'</p>

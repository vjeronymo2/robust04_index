			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Israel plans structural reforms THE first budget by Israel's Labour-led government will contain no radical departures from the policies of the previous coalition ousted in the June election. But the finance ministry said it was drawing up an extensive accompanying package of structural reforms which, with the 1993 budget plans, could help produce the long-term growth promised by Labour. The ministry's Shk98bn (Pounds 20.4bn) budget proposal, in 1992 prices, is almost Shk5bn less than expected this year, thanks mainly to a sharp fall in Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, an associated cut in housing plans - including Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - and lower debt servicing costs. Labour's promise to channel greater investment to development projects is reflected in a 26 per cent increase in infrastructural spending to Shk1.45bn. But the plan avoids cuts in social and defence spending which together account for more than Shk40bn. The budget deficit is projected at 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Details of the reform package have not been released, but officials said it would include tax reforms, liberalisation of the capital markets, breaking existing monopolies in telecommunications, transport and agricultural marketing, loosening the state's grip on land sales and extending import liberalisation.</p>

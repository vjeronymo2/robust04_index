			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia urges rationalisation of cocoa output MALAYSIA HAS called on cocoa producing countries to rationalise output as part of a collective effort to shore up world prices. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's primary industries minister, speaking at meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance in the Malaysian capital, said measures must be taken to bring down world cocoa stocks, which at present stand at 1.4m tonnes, equivalent to about seven months' consumption. 'Based on Malaysia's experience in natural rubber and tin, and now in cocoa, it is evident that we cannot rely on the consumers to support prices,' said Mr Lim. 'We have to tighten our belts.' Mr Lim said stocks should be brought down to around 600,000 tonnes. The CPA groups 13 countries together accounting for more than 90 per cent of world cocoa output. Weak demand and high stock levels have caused world cocoa prices to drop from about Dollars 2,222 a tonne 10 years ago to less than Dollars 1,000 a tonne now. Mr Lim said that cocoa production in Malaysia, the world's fourth largest producer, had been falling in recent years because of low prices. Mr Lim said the present supply surplus problem could be solved if there was goodwill and determination among all cocoa producers. Malaysian claims that the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria had already voiced support for cutting back on output could not be confirmed. The CPA meeting here is a preliminary to further talks in Geneva next month between cocoa producers and consumers on a new International Cocoa Agreement.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. BURTON ON ERADICATING COCA CROPS IN SOUTH AMERICA  </P> <P> What arrogance Burton displays! To suggest that the United States should  undertake to wipe out the coca fields in South America "with or without the  cooperation of its (elected) leaders," reveals a contempt for democracy.  </P> <P> How would Americans feel if some self-righteous foreign nation undertook to  wipe out our tobacco fields "with or without" the consent of the American  people?  </P> <P> Why do the impoverished people of South America grow coca? During the last few  decades, the United States applied strong economic pressures for countries like  Bolivia to adopt economic policies that would encourage "export crops" like  sugar and, yes, bananas.  </P> <P> As a result, the U.S.-backed governments pushed the poverty-stricken people off  the good land where they could raise their own potatoes, then pushed them off  the land where they could survive on corn, and on and on until they found  themselves on land where they couldn't grow food very well. What grows well  there? Coca.  </P> <P> Burton expects "hostility by the international community." How astute you are,  Mr. Burton, especially given the results of previous U.S. plans. He wants to  destroy the ecology of Latin American in a harebrained scheme to wipe out a  robust native plant. Trying to eradicate coca in South America would be about  as successful as trying to wipe out crabgrass in Washington.  </P> <P> MIGUEL MUNOZ  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

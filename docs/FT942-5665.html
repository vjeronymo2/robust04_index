			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Colourful check on sensitive products To monitor products sensitive to time and temperature, Bowater of the UK has developed labels, called Reactt, which change colour according to varying conditions. They can be used on foods that must be kept chilled and eaten within a certain number of days or to label pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines. Reactt labels, containing dye and binder chemicals, are in two parts: the first, the indicator, contains a blue dye which indicates temperature change by turning red; the second, the activator, is a catalyst. Both are inert until they are joined when the chemicals merge into each other, the speed determined by temperature and time. Bowater: UK, 061 9412113.</p>

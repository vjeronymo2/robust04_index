			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Could 18 Trillions Be Found?"] </F>   [Text] An expanded sitting of the State Duma Defense  Committee chaired by Sergey Yushenkov on Thursday was devoted to  the upcoming second reading of the draft law "On The 1994  Federal Budget." While the spotlight was certainly on the  defense budget, the main question was -- what can and should be  done to add the needed 18 trillion rubles [R] to the budget.    Vyacheslav Mozgalev, spokesman for the Ministry of the  Economy, put it straight that given the planned defense  appropriations (R37 trillion) Russia could have no defense as  such as early as by August. That is to say there is also a  clear realization in the government quarters (something one  could have hardly doubted) that the defense appropriations in  the draft law are absolutely inadequate. The Finance Ministry,  that eternal opponent of the Defense Ministry, in the shape of  its spokesman Andrey Astakhov generally agreed that it is hard  to maintain the army with this money.    Attempts were made at the session to pry open some "hidden  reserves." By hiking the tax on super-profits? It was  instantly recognized as being naive because only the lazy do not  conceal the real profits of their enterprises today. What about  levying a tax on paychecks, not those in publicly financed  organizations but those in the "private" sector that exceed one  million and more? What else? To levy an additional (defense)  tax on commercial banks and, of course, to wring out the  greatest possible amount from privatizing state property?    All agreed that the planned privatization revenues in the  draft budget are absurdly low. Some other suggestions were  voiced and accepted for discussion. Still it was obvious to  everyone that an increase of the budget deficit through  additional state appropriations is inevitable....    The Finance Ministry spokesman tried to accuse the military  of slowing reforms, as if suggesting that this is the crux of  the matter. This was objected to by First Deputy Defense  Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff.  They gave facts, too. The general truth that "reforms are  costly" was illustrated in particular by the following example.  The lack of funds for converting and recycling arms and  military equipment makes it necessary to preserve the subunits  and units to maintain these arms and equipment. For example,  some 1,500 sailors serve on obsolete nuclear submarines of the  Northern Fleet. Clearly, you cannot leave a nuclear reactor  untended. But this is no longer either armed forces or defense.  This is a security threat in a sense. As is the 40,000 tonnes  of chemical weapons for whose destruction not a brass copper has  been earmarked yet. Or take such a question as discharge of  100,000 officers under the forces reduction plan. This means  paying each 20 monthly salaries, discharge money, providing  housing.... There is no money for all that, although that is no  compensation for the great number of those wishing to accuse the  army of lacking reform.    Generally, one could hear at the session so many depressing  facts and statistics that someone unprepared and of vulnerable  mind would be better off not knowing them. Recognizing that it  is important to probe at the reasons for why we have ended up in  such a fix, Sergey Yushenkov still urged the audience to think  about short-term prospects, about what should be done.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Speculation mounts on Sprint mobile deal Three US telephone companies yesterday declined to comment on a press report that they were planning to merge their mobile telephone businesses into a grouping that would be even larger than the one being formed through AT&amp;T's Dollars 12.6bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications. One of the companies, Sprint, is a long-distance carrier, and the other two, Bell Atlantic and Nynex, are Baby Bell regional telephone companies. According to the Wall Street Journal, the three companies are close to reaching agreement on a deal under which their cellular telephone businesses would be merged and marketed under the Sprint name. The combined operation would serve more than 3m existing cellular subscribers and almost 76m potential customers. Last month AT&amp;T, the biggest long distance carrier in the US, won federal court approval to proceed with a takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications. That deal will produce an organisation with slightly fewer than 3m existing subscribers and fewer than 74m potential subscribers. The regional telephone companies are concerned that a nationwide cellular service sold under the well-known AT&amp;T name could lure away their local customers. Bell Atlantic and Nynex had sought to block the AT&amp;T-McCaw deal on anti-trust grounds, but a federal judge this week denied their request for an injunction. Bell Atlantic and Nynex announced earlier this year that they had agreed to merge their cellular businesses. However, a partnership with Sprint would enable them to compete much more strongly with AT&amp;T-McCaw.</p>

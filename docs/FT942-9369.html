			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Split proposed for Russian state electricity company RAO, the Russian state-controlled electricity company, would be split up and its power stations restructured into a series of competing companies under proposals being considered by the Russian government. KPMG Management Consulting of the UK, which drew up the proposals as part of a European Union-sponsored study, acknowledges that the system would lead to price rises for consumers. This is in part because it would enable subsidies to be eliminated. However, the proposed structure would help reduce costs and stimulate investment needed as power demand increases later in the decade, it says. It could also provide a framework for the industry's full privatisation, although KPMG believes that is not essential. So far about 20 per cent of RAO's shares have been offered to workers and private individuals. The country's 72 local distribution companies, or energos, which also generate some power themselves, have been established as joint stock companies with some shares distributed to the private sector. However, RAO still owns majority stakes in most of them. As well as its stakes in the energos, RAO also runs the country's largest power stations and the despatch system which selects which of them operate. KPMG's system, which draws heavily on the UK electricity industry structure, says RAO's large power stations should be formed into independent generating companies. In a draft report, KPMG suggests a system in which each generating company would bid in production offers daily. High-priced generators would not be chosen to operate if demand did not require it. The energos, which operate smaller generation plants, would be required to sell all of their energy, including their own needs, into the despatch market and buy back their requirements from it. Energos would also be required to maintain separate accounting records for generation, distribution and other activities. This would prevent cross-subsidisation. Most of the changes are similar to reforms being proposed in the European Union. The report says transitional arrangements would be needed during the implementation of the system over several years. The market should continue to be regulated at both a federal and regional level, it says.</p>

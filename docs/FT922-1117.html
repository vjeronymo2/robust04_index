			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / ITV chief attacks BBC over BSkyB soccer deal MR Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, last night accused the BBC of being little more than Mr Rupert Murdoch's poodle in the Pounds 300m Premier League football deal. Mr Dyke said that Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, and Sir Michael Checkland, director-general, had both contacted the Football Association to say they would only do a deal for recorded highlights with British Sky Broadcasting, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake. 'Instantly they took more than Pounds 20m out of our bid and, in effect, it was the BBC who decided that live Premier League football would not be universally available,' the London Weekend Television chief executive told the Royal Television Society. 'It was the BBC who made certain that anyone wanting to watch live Premier League football next year would have to buy a dish and pay Pounds 5 a month,' he added. 'BSkyB so needed the BBC they should be paying the BBC to carry the football, certainly not the other way around,' added Mr Dyke. The corporation's behaviour would make it difficult to argue that it supported universality when re-negotiating its Royal Charter. Mr Dyke said it was also time to review cross media ownership in the UK. If nothing were done by the late 1990s Mr Murdoch could have 40 per cent of Britain's national press and possibly the most profitable broadcasting organisation.</p>

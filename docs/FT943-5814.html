			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / VAT savings elude Germans German companies and financial authorities have not benefited from the expected savings following the abolition of VAT after the creation of the European internal market in 1992, according to a government report. The new VAT law which applies during the present transition period has created 'an almost incomprehensible amount' of extra work, according to companies and tax advisers. Government brochures, explaining the new regulations, were not available soon enough, the report said. Companies, especially smaller and medium-sized ones which were expected to benefit most from the single market, complained about the extra work resulting from new reporting requirements and more complicated searches for business partners' VAT identification numbers. Financial and personnel savings had not been possible, the report added, and differing legal and tax systems in the 12 EU member countries meant that computer software programmes needed to be constantly updated.</p>

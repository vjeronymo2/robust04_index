Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> NBC WINS MAY NETWORK SWEEPS  </P> <P> NBC won the May television sweeps, matching its own record for the widest  margin of victory ever, it was announced today. CBS came in second and ABC was  third.  </P> <P> The TV sweeps, during which the ratings companies measure viewing in about 200  local markets, form the basis for local advertising rates and to a lesser  degree influence network prices. NBC had a 24% margin of victory over CBS and  28% over ABC, matching its own record margin over the second-place contender a  year ago, said Gerry Jaffe, NBC vice president for research.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> NEW LAW TARGETS PUBLIC DRINKING  </P> <P> The City Council has passed an ordinance prohibiting drinking alcohol in  public, augmenting a state law that has been difficult to enforce, police say.  </P> <P> The new law will be a law-enforcement tool to deter groups from drinking in  parking lots and near apartment houses by allowing police to arrest such  people, even if they're not drunk.  </P> <P> Police Capt. John Savage said the state law applies only to those who are  drunk, "and oftentimes that's too late."  </P> <P> "They're out of control by that time," he said. "You have fights, sometimes  with severe injuries. It will give us a tool to help us move in before we have  serious disturbance."  </P> <P> Violation of the ordinance, which goes into effect in December, is a  misdemeanor.  </P></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Whirlpool makes further moves in eastern Europe WHIRLPOOL, the largest US white goods producer, is extending its expansion into eastern Europe by creating a wholly-owned Hungarian subsidiary to sell and service its products under the Bauknecht, Philips and Whirlpool brand names. The move comes four months after Whirlpool made its first significant foray into eastern Europe by forming a joint company in Czechoslovakia to manufacture and sell washing machines and market other domestic appliances. Whirlpool, through its Whirlpool International unit, is keen to use its European presence, acquired through the acquisition of the former Philips domestic appliances businesses, to develop more markets in eastern Europe. It also plans to manufacture for export to neighbouring countries and the former Soviet Union - at least in the case of the Czech venture, with the local Tatramat company. The Hungarian subsidiary, Whirlpool Hungarian Trading, will launch early this month an advertising campaign to promote Whirlpool as a global brand name, featuring commercials drawn from the US company's pan-European campaign. Mr William Marohn, president and chief executive of Whirlpool International, said Hungary's recent Association Agreement with the European Community 'reinforces our confidence in Hungary's future and our opportunity to address the rising expectations of Hungarian consumers'.</p>

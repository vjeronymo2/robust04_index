			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy </F> Vostok" program]    [Text] Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces stated last Wednesday that,  Russia was ready to launch the first spaceship from the missile  complex located in Svobodnyy-18 town, Amursk Oblast in 1996; and  would carry out manned flights in the future. A spokesman of  the military space forces of the Ministry of Defense told an  INTERFAX correspondent that the decision to create a new Russian  space port in Amur Oblast would probably not be adopted until  the end of this year. Experts believe that the launch of the  first Far East spaceship, scheduled for 1996, is quite feasible,  but this is only a blueprint. Today, the only work conducted in  Svobodnyy-18 is aimed at maintaining the town's infrastructure  and keeping the missile complex's existing technical equipment  in shape.

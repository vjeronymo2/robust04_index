			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> PLAYING GIANTS BRINGS OUT HIS BEST  </P> <P> The Rams have beaten the New York Giants three times in a row heading into  Sunday's game. Quarterback Jim Everett was asked how they did it.  </P> <P> "I don't know," he said. "I couldn't get into the theory part. I just enjoy it,  I enjoy the high of playing the New York Giants."  </P> <P> With national attention centering on a possible 11-0 vs. 11-0 matchup between  the Giants and the San Francisco 49ers Dec. 3, it seems to be assumed that the  Rams, who play both teams before that date, won't throw a wrench into the  plans.  </P> <P> "That's OK," Ram cornerback Jerry Gray said, "because I think it's kind of good  for us, especially if they do overlook us and we come in, and they're 10-1  apiece."  </P> <P> Coach Bill Parcells said it's not hard to motivate his Giants, even though they  are 8-0 and three games ahead of Washington, its nearest foe in the NFC East.  </P> <P> "I just don't think the two (other strong) teams in our division, Philadelphia  and Washington, are going to go away," Parcells said.

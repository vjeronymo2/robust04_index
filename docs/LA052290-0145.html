			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WARNER IN CAMP; BELL ON TRADING BLOCK;  </P> <P> RAMS: FORMER SEAHAWK GETS ACQUAINTED WITH NEW SITUATION. ROBINSON SAYS THE CLUB  INTENDS TO DEAL BELL, AS EARLY AS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> Running back Curt Warner was in Ram Park Monday. Running back Greg Bell wasn't.  And it appears the same probably could be said about the Rams' starting lineup  on opening day: Warner in; Bell out.  </P> <P> Bell, who rushed for 2,349 yards and 31 touchdowns the past two seasons, became  the odd man out when the Rams acquired Warner as a Plan B free agent March 30.  Ram Coach John Robinson said Bell had been excused from attending the team's  four-day mini-camp, which began Monday.  </P> <P> "Our intention is to trade him," Robinson said.  </P> <P> That could happen as early as this week, during the NFL owners' meetings  Wednesday and Thursday in Dallas. Bell was out of town and unavailable for  comment, but, according to his agent, Steve Feldman, a quick deal would suit  Bell just fine.  </P> <P> "We had two conversations with the Rams last week and they're definitely going  into the meetings looking to make a trade," Feldman said. "They may not get the  kind of compensation they want right away, but at some point, they have to  realize it's time to let him go. He's anxious to get into a new situation as  soon as possible."  </P> <P> Warner is getting well-acquainted with new situations. Saturday, he was married  in Seattle and Monday, he was running out of a new backfield, wearing a new  uniform and a new number (21). He wore No. 28 with the Seahawks.  </P> <P> "First, I'd like to thank the Ram organization and Coach Robinson for giving me  this opportunity," he said. "I'm especially thankful because things up in  Seattle were kind of a blur, but that's all I'll say about that situation."  </P> <P> A year ago, Seahawks president Mike McCormack said he was not "interested in  trading Curt unless we could get a blockbuster deal." He described a  blockbuster as a trade which involved two No. 1 draft choices or an impact  defensive player such as Philadelphia's Reggie White.  </P> <P> Warner, who holds every Seattle career rushing record and is a three-time Pro  Bowl starter, led the Seahawks in rushing in 1989 with 631 yards, but he took a  mighty fall from grace. He averaged just 3.3 yards a carry, was being  supplanted by fullback John L. Williams as the focus of the Seahawks' rushing  attack and suddenly became expendable.  </P> <P> Warner, who has undergone two knee surgeries -- the latest an arthroscopic  procedure in 1988 -- and three ankle operations, says he feels fine, if a bit  disoriented.  </P> <P> "Everything feels a little strange here," he said. "Physically, I feel great.  Mentally, there's a lot going on and I'm just sorting things out. Things here  are very regimented, very structured. You do what you have to get done, you go  hard and then go home."  </P> <P> Warner figures to be battling Cleveland Gary for playing time at tailback, but  he says he doesn't mind the competition.  </P> <P> "Once a tailback, always a tailback," Warner said, smiling. "I'm down here to  play, but it's up to Coach Robinson to decide how much. I'll do whatever I have  to do. If I get to carry the ball a lot, great. If not, I'll do whatever it  takes to try and help this team win. That's my primary objective."  </P> <P> After five years as a safety-turned-cornerback, Jerry Gray began his conversion  back to free safety Monday. The Rams are hoping the acquisition of Bobby  Humphery from the Jets and the maturation of second-year players Darryl Henley  and Alfred Jackson will fill the void at cornerback.  </P> <P> "We think Jerry can be a great free safety and he's going to play there through  the summer and the exhibition season," Robinson said. "If we don't feel  confident at corner, though, then we'll have to be prepared to make the move  back."  </P> <P> Gray is taking a wait-and-see approach, but admits he likes the view from the  free safety position.  </P> <P> "It's going to be interesting (playing safety) in our defensive philosophy," he  said. "Having the freedom to roam will be the biggest adjustment.  </P> <P> "I spent the last five years trying to learn to just watch my man and not the  quarterback, and I think I've finally mastered it. Now, I'm going back to  watching the quarterback again."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Tight end Pete Holohan, an unsigned conditional free agent, was in camp Monday,  but he wasn't risking injury. "I'm staying away from any contact," he said.  "Basically, I'm just running my patterns against air." Holohan said he was not  concerned about his contract status. "We're not even negotiating, but it's very  early," he said. "There's no pressure or anxiety at all." Also in camp but not  signed were linebacker Brett Faryniarz and defensive tackle Doug Reed.  Linebacker Kevin Greene, nose tackle Alvin Wright and tight end Damon Johnson,  also unsigned, elected to stay away this week.  </P> <P> Quarterback Chuck Long was also missing. He returned to Detroit to be with his  wife, Lisa, who is expecting the couple's second child. . . . Latin Berry, the  Rams' third-round selection from Oregon, made his debut at cornerback Monday.  The 5-foot-10, 196-pounder played running back in college. "He looked like he'd  been playing cornerback for, oh, 50 minutes," Coach John Robinson said. "But  seriously, he looks like an athlete and a competitor and we're excited about  the person." . . . Best new name on the Ram roster: General Brown, a 6-foot-4,  270-pound defensive tackle from Savannah State.  </P></p>

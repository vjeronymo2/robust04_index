Retsinas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary's Designee to the Finance Board, the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks conducted public forums in August and September of 1994 to seek comment on three topics: (1) The contribution of the System and its members to housing and community development lending; (2) the capacity for the System to support community lenders and community-based lending; and, (3) appropriate System governance structure. Each FHLBank public forum discussed several related questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) How can the System facilitate housing and community development lending through the existing network of community-based lenders?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) How should the community development mission of the System be defined with regard to the types of lending and collateral requirements compatible with the safety and soundness requirements of the System?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) How is the changing membership base affecting the System?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Building on the success of the Affordable Housing and the Community Investment programs, how can we demonstrate the contribution that member institutions make through the regular advances program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) What type of System governance structure would enable the System to better realize its public purpose potential, while ensuring continued safety and soundness?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Finance Board is interested in the views of System members, community groups, trade associations, government sponsored enterprises, federal and state agencies and others on the topics addressed in the 12 FHLBank forums. To assist interested persons in responding, summaries of the sessions held by the FHLBanks will be made available prior to the public hearing. Requests for this material may be made by writing or calling (refer to the information listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of this notice). Most of these issues were also addressed in five reports on the FHLBank System submitted to Congress pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Congressionally-mandated reports were submitted by the Finance Board, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office and a FHLBank Shareholder Study Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: USAir pilots ballot on strike action in US The labour union representing 390 pilots at a subsidiary of USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways has a minority stake, yesterday began balloting members on possible strike action after talks on a new employment contract reached deadlock. The subsidiary is Piedmont Airlines, one of three smaller airlines owned by USAir. These and six independent airlines fly under the USAir Express banner, operating small turbo-prop aircraft that connect with mainstream USAir services. Talks with Piedmont pilots have stumbled over the pilots' requests for improvements in working conditions that would bring them more closely into line with those of the larger carriers. The Air Line Pilots Association argues that pilots at small airlines like Piedmont accepted inferior conditions in the past because they quickly moved on to larger airlines, but the contraction of the larger carriers has made employment at small airlines a long-term career. USAir and the pilot's union said they hoped a resumption of talks would prevent a strike. But USAir, which is the most heavily loss-making airline in the US, will find it difficult to give ground at a time when it is trying to cut costs and increase productivity in the face of intense competition from lower-cost rivals.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second step in the permitting decision process occurs after the regulatory agency completes review of the permit application. At this point, the regulatory agency decides either to tentatively deny the permit application or to prepare a draft permit for the facility. The third step occurs once the regulatory agency makes its preliminary decision about the permit application. Under the existing regulations, the public has its first formal participation opportunities in this step. If the permitting agency prepares a draft permit, it must give a formal public notice that the draft permit is available for public review and comment. In addition, the permitting authority must formally notify the public if it plans to deny a permit application. In both cases, the permitting agency must place the notice in a major local newspaper, broadcast it over local radio stations, and send it to all persons on the mailing list. A 45-day public comment period on the draft permit or notice of intent to deny the permit follows the publication of the notice. The comment period provides the public with an opportunity to comment, in writing, on conditions contained in the draft permit or notice of intent to deny. The regulatory agency may re-open or extend the comment period if, during the comment period, it receives substantial new questions or issues concerning the draft permit decision. In addition, the public may request that the permitting agency hold a public hearing on the draft permit decision. If the regulatory agency holds a public hearing, it must give the public a 30-day advance notice of the time and place of the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final permit decision is the fourth step in the permitting decision process. After the public comment period closes, the regulatory agency reviews and evaluates all written and oral comments and, then, issues a final permit decision. At this time, the regulatory agency must send a notice of decision, together with a written response to all significant comments, to all persons who submitted public comments or requested notice of the final permit decision (in accordance with &sect;124.17). The response to comments summarizes all significant comments received during the public comment period and explains how the permitting authority addressed or rejected the comments in the final permit decision. The permitting agency must place the written response to comments in the Administrative Record established at the regulatory agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Summary of Proposed Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. EPA's approach to public participation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's amendments introduce provisions for new public notices and meetings in the permit process. Through this approach, EPA intends to open opportunities for public participation earlier in the permit process. Through earlier public involvement and improved public awareness, today's requirements will result in more meaningful and interactive public participation. At the same time, these amendments are flexible and allow permitting agencies and facilities to tailor public participation activities according to facility-specific circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By expanding public involvement opportunities, the proposed rule should streamline the permitting process, since public issues will be raised and addressed earlier in the process. At present, formal public involvement in the permitting process does not begin until the draft permit stage. By this point in the process, the permitting authority and the applicant already have discussed crucial parts of the Part B application; thus, the public often feels that most major decisions on the permit are made before public input. Under today's proposed requirements, the permitting authority will be focusing discussion and dialogue on the permit application earlier in the permitting process. EPA wishes to encourage the public to participate in these earlier and expanded opportunities for involvement, fully raising issues and concerns early so they may be evaluated and responded to. Such early and meaningful dialogue should result in an expeditious permit decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The earlier public involvement opportunities proposed today allow the public the opportunity to raise issues before many decisions are made. This then allows the applicant and the permitting authority to address citizen concerns. The idea of promoting earlier public involvement in the permitting process is also consistent with recommendations put forth by the RCRA Implementation Study and a number of outside sources (e.g., the Keystone Center, environmental groups, and business trade associations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considered a variety of approaches in developing today's proposal. After careful evaluation, EPA believes that the proposed requirements will meet the Agency's goal of providing increased opportunity for public involvement. Today's proposed requirements would not, of course, preclude additional public involvement activities beyond the regulations, where appropriate on a facility-specific basis, such as alternative public outreach activities, supplementary meetings, or fact sheets. At RCRA locations, in fact, permitting agencies and facilities have implemented a variety of public involvement activities that have helped affected communities to understand and participate in permit decision-making. EPA has published a practical how-to guidance for regional permit writers and public involvement staff, entitled the RCRA Public Involvement Manual (September 1993/ EPA 530&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;006). In the guidance, EPA recommends public involvement activities to encourage productive public participation in a variety of community and facility situations. Additional examples of ways to expand public involvement, beyond what is required by today's proposed regulations, are included in section 5.a: General Requirements for Providing Public Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before drafting this proposal, the Agency contacted a variety of interested parties involved in public outreach activities. EPA had discussions with a range of groups, including: Public interest groups, industry, state and local government, Indian tribal representatives, trade associations, and public involvement specialists from EPA regions and Headquarters. These groups submitted valuable comments and suggestions to the Agency on how to expand and enhance public involvement. The Agency also held an informal meeting on October 13, 1993, with a small, yet diverse group of stakeholders to receive their input and to facilitate the exchange of information concerning greater opportunities for public participation. This meeting was a starting point for efforts to improve public involvement in the permitting process; EPA would like to continue these discussions beyond this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

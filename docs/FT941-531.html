			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Turkey shaken by Islamic party's wins Turkey's Islamic-based Refah party (RP) yesterday delivered a decisive challenge to the country's mainstream secular parties, with widespread gains in the weekend's municipal elections, including dramatic wins in both Istanbul, the biggest city, and Ankara, the capital. The RP, campaigning on a anti-corruption platform, had last night won 28 of the country's 76 municipalities, with almost all the votes counted. The party had taken 18 per cent of the national vote, twice the votes won in local elections in 1989. Mr Necmettin Erbakan, the RP leader, claimed yesterday the result meant that 66 per cent of Turkey's 60m population was now ruled by RP local administration. Westernised Turks have always maintained that RP's brand of radical Islamic policies would never win broad appeal. The RP was helped in part by the continuing split in Turkey's traditional conservative parties. However, the result has clearly shaken the secularist establishment. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister - whose True Path party narrowly won the national vote with 22 per cent - immediately called for a new alliance of the right, signalling the growing alarm in Ankara at the Islamic vote. According to one expert, the support for the RP, if repeated in a general election, would give the party at least 100 seats in the 450-seat parliament. The RP currently has 40 MPs in Ankara. In an Istanbul office lined with books on American government, Mr Abdullah Gul, a senior adviser to Mr Erbakan, projected the RP leader yesterday as the model of reasonableness. 'We are something like the Christian Democrats in Europe,' he says. This week, for the first time, Turks will have a chance to test this claim. As the map on the front page of the daily Hurriyet newspaper graphically illustrated yesterday, the party controls a swathe of city halls all the way from Istanbul to Erzerum on the old Soviet border. For radical Moslems, Istanbul is a particularly intoxicating prize. The city is an Islamic holyplace. It is ingrained with Christian history - almost a byword for the western decadence and spiritual sterility which fanatics say was unleashed when Kemal Ataturk created the secular Turkish republic in the 1920s. Among Istanbul's residents yesterday RP's victory was just sinking in. Would the mayor ban alcohol? Would the RP be able to close cinemas and clubs in the interest of public morality? Would international funding for the city's badly needed infrastructure projects dry up? Mr Tayyip Erdogan, the victorious mayoral candidate, promised to build a mosque in Taksim Square, the city's main shopping district. He said he would close the city brothels, and create the world's biggest conference centre. Nationally, the RP's vote was distorted somewhat by the withdrawal of the radical Kurdish-based Democracy party, which allowed the RP a free run in the Kurdish-speaking south-east. However, the party has made sweeping advances in other areas. In Trabzon, for example, the RP is said to have won over local women by promising to send home the so-called 'Natashas', the Russian and Georgian prostitutes who have turned the ancient port city into the Bangkok of the Black Sea. Deliberately courting the moderate Islamic constituency, the party was often fronted by attractive, unveiled women dentists and other professionals on an anti-corruption platform. But while some RP leaders have been prominent in Turkish politics since the 1960s, the party remains largely untested in government. It is anti-Zionist, anti-Nato and opposes Turkey's efforts to join the European Union. In many ways, Mr Erbakan hardly fits the ogre that most secular Turks conjure up when they think of Islamic extremists. But the RP's real advantage is that it is the only grassroots party in the country. The other parties are all centred on figureheads. Mr Erbakan has tasted power before. In the late 1970s, he was deputy prime minister in a number of disastrous national governments which eventually led to the military's intervention in 1980. Everyone is waiting now to see how the RP grapples with the gargantuan problems of running Istanbul. As the former social democrat administration discovered after a series of corruption scandals, the city is a graveyard for political reputations. Many secular Turks, who still believe that they are Turkey's silent majority, are hoping the RP will also fail.</p>

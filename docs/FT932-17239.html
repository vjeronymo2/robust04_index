			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Renong earnings climb to MDollars 95.4m at halfway THE RENONG group, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, has reported pre-tax profits of MDollars 95.4m (USDollars 36.7m) in the six months to December 31 1992. This compares with a pre-tax profit of MDollars 70.7m in the same period in 1991. Renong is controlled by interests within the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) Malaysia's main political party. Renong's interests range from banking and stockbroking to the property sector, construction - including some of the country's biggest infrastructure projects - and light industrials. While the group described its six-month performance as satisfactory, analysts say Renong still has considerable structural problems following a number of company reorganisations over the past two years. Earlier this year, Renong announced it was selling its entire media interests, including controlling stakes in The New Straits Times Press (NSTP), Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group, and in TV3, the country's only privately-owned TV channel, for MDollars 800m. Both NSTP and TV3 are believed to have made significant contributions to Renong's overall performance last year. United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), a listed company within the Renong group, has announced pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1992 of MDollars 200.3m. This compares with pre tax profits of 170m in 1991.</p>

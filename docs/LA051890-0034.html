			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD OFFICER HAS EMPATHIC EAR FOR CRIME VICTIMS  </P> <P> Oxnard Police Officer Glenn McIntyre was off duty five years ago when his  motorcycle slid into a drunk driver who tried to make a U-turn in front of him.  </P> <P> The impact of the collision broke McIntyre's back in 17 places and left him  paralyzed from the ribs down.  </P> <P> McIntyre was a 23-year-old patrol officer and had been out of the police  academy for only 18 months when the accident left him in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> But McIntyre and the Oxnard Police Department have both made the best of the  tragic accident. Although the department lost a good beat cop, it gained a desk  officer with a particular sensitivity to victims of crimes and accidents.  </P> <P> Before McIntyre was injured, the department was considering creating a desk job  for injured officers who could soothe crime victims, fill out reports and  answer questions about the law. The position was a perfect fit.  </P> <P> "It was advantageous for him and the department," said Lt. Stan Myers,  McIntyre's supervising officer. "It provided us with somebody with experience  and knowledge. And, boy, he's contributed a lot."  </P> <P> Myers said that many times police officers on the street don't have enough time  to listen to victims or residents with a concern. But McIntyre "has the time to  listen," he said.  </P> <P> McIntyre agrees. He said that because he was a victim of an accident and a  crime, he can now better sympathize with the victims he comforts at the police  station.  </P> <P> "I can relate to them being disabled or I can relate to them as victims," he  said. "I tell them if you didn't end up with a permanent injury or you didn't  lose something that you can't replace, that money can't buy, then you're doing  all right."  </P> <P> Police Chief Robert Owens said he offered McIntyre the position of answering  phone calls from victims because "we knew he was a good man, a good officer."  </P> <P> Because McIntyre's accident occurred while off duty, he was not eligible for  many of the Police Department's insurance benefits, Owens said. To aid their  disabled colleague, several police officers donated their sick leave so that  McIntyre wouldn't lose his regular paycheck, he said.  </P> <P> "We are like a family," he said. "We try to support each other."  </P> <P> Although he said he tries to be encouraging to victims, McIntyre has had to  struggle in his own life.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people that have bounced back better than I, and there are  some who haven't bounced back as well," he said.  </P> <P> McIntyre said it took him five months to learn how to dress himself and 10  months to learn how to use the bathroom without any help. And then there is the  constant pain, which he said is "like someone digging their knuckles into your  back."  </P> <P> Although the struggle to fight off depression and frustration continues every  day, McIntyre said, things are looking up.  </P> <P> In 1986, he bought a two-bedroom house in Oxnard, which he has renovated for  wheelchair access. He installed a Jacuzzi specially designed so he can get in  and out without help.  </P> <P> Last year, he married Hellmi Chavez, a young records clerk he met at work.  Merlin, a black Labrador service dog who spends almost 24 hours a day at his  master's side, carried the rings in a basket during the wedding ceremony.  </P> <P> McIntyre, a blond, blue-eyed native of Laguna Beach, competes in tennis  tournaments for the handicapped and lectures schoolchildren about the  capabilities of the disabled. St. John's Regional Medical Center has sponsored  McIntyre in the tournaments.  </P> <P> "I don't like being in a chair," he said. "I hate being in a chair. I want to  change my own light bulbs and I want to paint my own house and do my own  gardening. But I wouldn't change what I have with my wife and my dog and the  Police Department and the community of Oxnard."  </P> <P> When asked, he does not hesitate to recount the events involving the motorcycle  accident that so drastically altered his life.  </P> <P> On the night of April 5, 1985, McIntyre was headed north on Pacific Coast  Highway in Laguna Beach, returning from Palm Springs with a woman friend on the  back of his bike, when a Ford Mustang suddenly cut in front of him, beginning a  U-turn.  </P> <P> McIntyre, who was riding at about 45 miles per hour, had just enough time to  apply the brakes and slide the motorcycle onto its side.  </P> <P> Although the impact of the crash broke his back and shattered his hip and five  ribs, McIntyre never lost consciousness. His friend suffered several broken  bones but recovered with no permanent injuries.  </P> <P> The driver of the car was not injured. However, police tests later showed that  the driver had a 0.18% blood-alcohol level and had used cocaine that day.  Several witnesses said they saw the man stagger into the Mustang just before  the accident but no one tried to stop him.  </P> <P> "I wasn't angry at the guy," McIntyre said. "I met him several months later in  court. He just cried and said he was sorry."  </P> <P> The driver was sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to pay $65,000 in  restitution to McIntyre. The drunk driver spent eight months in jail and has  yet to pay the restitution, McIntyre said.  </P> <P> McIntyre admits that the episode made him "a little frustrated with the whole  justice system," but he said he tries not to let it discourage him or affect  his work.  </P> <P> McIntyre underwent 14 hours of surgery before he was strapped face down onto a  special hospital bed that nurses rotated every two hours to keep him from  developing bedsores. He remained strapped to that bed for two weeks.  </P> <P> Initially, McIntyre said, he considered suicide to end the agonizing pain in  his back.  </P> <P> "They had a 24-hour watch on me for several weeks because it was so  depressing," he said. "The pain was unbearable. Sometimes you just lay there  and scream and cry for hours."  </P> <P> But he survived the eight months in the hospital with the support of his  parents and many friends.  </P> <P> Things were different when McIntyre returned to the police station. It bothered  him that his colleagues had to look down to meet his eyes. And although he  continues to be physically active, he said some officers began to greet him  with a feeble handshake.  </P> <P> "People should know that being in a chair you still have the same wants," he  said. "You want to do everything just like before and you really hate it when  someone looks at you differently."  </P> <P> Hellmi, his wife, said that even after McIntyre got out of the hospital and  returned to work, he was often depressed and frustrated. She said much of her  time with him has been spent motivating him to do such basic things as getting  dressed.  </P> <P> "To be married to someone who is in a chair can be a lot of work," she said.  "But when you are in love with someone it really doesn't matter."  </P></p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Silent Cossiga may yet return from the dead: It is too soon to write a political obituary IT WAS an unusually taciturn Mr Francesco Cossiga whom avid Roman journalists tailed through the city yesterday from Mass at 7am to lunch and beyond. Less than 24 hours after announcing his resignation to more than 5m television viewers, the Italian president maintained a silence more typical of his Sardinian origins than his past two years as president. He has become better known for his off-the-cuff remarks, often about his party colleagues and usually bathed in vitriol. But it is too soon to write Mr Cossiga's political obituary. Having plunged Italy into a political crisis unparalleled even by its rumbustious standards, Mr Cossiga may still see himself as a potential saviour. For among the list of potential candidates for his post, which includes Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, and Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, is probably Mr Cossiga himself. In his resignation speech, he made much of the need for a strong, newly-elected president, who would have the political and moral authority to knock heads together among party leaders, whom he accused of failing to recognise voters' call for change at the polls on April 5. Mr Cossiga's harsh political barbs have brought him few friends in political circles but his comments command wide public support. He has cast himself as the mouthpiece for Italians frustrated with a party political establishment which seems more intent on settling old scores than solving the country's problems. Yet Mr Cossiga has often been as much the culprit as others. His resignation speech was full of the emotional touches which have characterised many of his recent outbursts. He presented himself in the now familiar role of a lone fighter against an all-powerful political establishment. For all its high principles, Mr Cossiga's departure bore the marks of the bitter personal antagonisms that have marked his last two years in office. The Christian Democrats, still Italy's biggest political grouping, were his prime target. Mr Cossiga has been deeply angered by the party's unwillingess to bow to his wish for some new form of parliamentary order, in which he might play a guiding role.</p>

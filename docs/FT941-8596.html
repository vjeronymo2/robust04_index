			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sony pre-tax profits rise 6.8% A glimmer of hope that consumer confidence was on the upturn appeared in third-quarter results from Sony, the consumer electronics company which reported a 6.8 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits in the three months to last December. However, at the net level, profits plunged 38 per cent to Y16.8bn (Dollars 154m). Sony said a rise in demand for new electronics products had helped it to post better pre-tax profits of Y56.5bn compared with Y52.8bn in the previous third quarter in spite of sluggish markets in Japan and Europe. During an important quarter, when the company makes a large proportion of its sales, Sony saw increased demand from consumers for many of its new electronics products such as wide screen television, car navigation systems, CD-ROM drives and MiniDiscs. As a result, while overall sales were adversely affected by the strong rise of the yen, falling 3.7 per cent to Y1,067bn the company saw increases in unit sales of important products, including personal stereos, televisions and CD players. In Japan, Sony increased sales by 2.8 per cent as a result of greater demand for new audio products. Striking out currency fluctuations, Sony's consolidated sales would have increased by about Y132bn in the third quarter, or 8.2 per cent, the company said. US sales of electronics rose 15 per cent while that of music rose 46 per cent in dollar terms. However, its films division posted an 11 per cent decline in sales. Cost-cutting benefited Sony's operating profits, which rose 18.4 per cent to Y70.19bn against Y59.29bn. But pre-tax income was depressed by a Y131m foreign exchange loss as a result of the yen's weakening in the third quarter. Net income was 38 per cent down to Y16.8bn compared with Y27.1bn. Sony revised its consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March, up to Y100bn from a forecast Y87bn due to expected stronger electronic sales. However, net income is revised down to Y20bn from Y30bn. Pioneer, the audio-visual company, suffered a 16.5 per cent drop in consolidated sales for the third quarter to Y139.85bn, from Y167.48bn, largely as a result of depressed demand in Japan and the yen's rise against other currencies. Pre-tax profits plunged 74 per cent to Y2.99bn against Y11.43bn and operating profits were down 79 per cent to Y2.53bn. The company revised downwards its profits forecast for the year to March 1994. Pioneer expects parent sales to be Y328bn rather than Y349bn as forecast earlier and pre-tax profits to be Y1.4bn rather than Y7bn. Net profit is revised down to Y600m from Y4.7bn.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BAe brought to book Shareholders saw Pounds 917m of their funds evaporate from the British Aerospace balance sheet in 1992. So getting back Pounds 35m in dividends must feel like pretty thin gruel. Still, it is a reasonably cheap gesture by the board in the direction of its wounded investors. Since the company has dealt with its most immediate problems, and a measure of financial discipline has been imposed, some optimism seems in order. Earnings should recover this year to give decent dividend cover once more. The company has clearly come a long way from the depths of last September. However, the hole blown in the balance sheet is a constraint on the company's ability to rationalise its operations further. BAe's capital is now only 10 per cent more than that demanded by its banking covenants. It can scarcely afford another disaster. By the same token, progress on finding a partner for the turbo-prop division may be slow if BAe cannot afford the write-off involved in a joint venture. And the much-touted sale of Rover may not materialise given that the carmaker would probably not even fetch its book value. Weakness in the Airbus order book and doubts about some leases are also a source of unease. Indeed, putting the whole Airbus adventure on to a secure commercial footing is probably the main strategic challenge now facing the company. On top of that there will be a cash outflow this year and gearing may rise quite sharply. That may not matter too much, but the chairman, Mr John Cahill, has said that generation of strong and sustained cash flow is the acid test. By that measure the company still has some way to go.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares volatile ahead of retail data THE UK stock market looked increasingly apprehensive ahead of developments pending on both sides of the Atlantic and endured another volatile trading session yesterday. Although still firm at the close, the FT-SE 100 Index had lost much of a mid-afternoon gain of nearly 15 points after Wall Street turned back from a strong opening. Several leading securities houses, US investment banks in particular, appeared to be shifting to a bearish stance in both stocks and futures, at least for the short term. The Footsie 3,100 mark, which is proving increasingly elusive, was lost, regained and lost again before the index finished at 3,097.5 for a gain on the day of 4.2. After shedding more than 10 Footsie points in early trade, equities turned sharply better after a larger than expected reduction in German repos rates. This was seen as opening the way for a cut in Bundesbank rates, perhaps even tomorrow, and also for the Budget cut in UK base rates widely expected in the London stock market - some optimists even asked whether a two-point cut might be possible] Progress was fairly slow, however, and trading volume volatile as trading statements from several leading names of British industry left investors still cool on economic recovery prospects. Some help came from firmness in government bonds following satisfactory Public Sector Borrowing Requirement numbers for October. When Wall Street came in with an opening gain of 12 points on the Dow Average, London moved up quickly to reach the day's high of 3,108.1. But the UK market turned down again just as quickly when the early gain on the Dow melted away and was replaced by a minor fall at the close of UK trading hours. On the domestic front, attention focused on prospects for last month's UK Retail Price Index and retail sales, both expected at 9.30 today, and regarded as important influences on the Budget due on November 30 from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Most UK analysts expect annualised RPI to remain at 1.8 per cent but any move above this could unsettle market confidence that base rates will be cut by a full point around Budget time. Also, the market hopes that economic recovery will be reflected in higher retail sales in October. US houses were covering themselves in London ahead of tonight's Congress vote on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. NatWest Markets, the UK banking and securities house, warned yesterday of a significant chance that the vote could fail. 'The immediate economic impact will be negligible but sentiment in financial markets will be dealt a more serious blow,' said NatWest. At Salomon International, Mr Marcus Grubb suggested that investors seriously worried about the NAFTA vote might buy gold. Seaq volume, at 654.8m shares, jumped by nearly one third from the previous session, and dealers pointed to several bought deals as a sign of genuine investment activity. The bright spot was the renewed interest in second line stocks which lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 4.5 to 3,421. On Monday, retail business in equities fell to Pounds 1.05bn, a further indication of the cautious mood this week.</p>

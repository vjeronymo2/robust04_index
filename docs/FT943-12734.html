			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Stoppage hits France flights Dozens of flights were cancelled and hundreds of passengers stranded at airports yesterday as air traffic controllers in the Aix-en-Provence region of southern France began a three-day strike. The stoppage, which comes on one of the busiest weekends of the year for air travel at the start of the summer holiday season, involves some 100 controllers at the airports in Marseilles, Nice, Montpellier and Corsica. The strike was called following a breakdown in talks over pay and working conditions. Only 100 flights left Nice out of the usual 250. Some 1,000 passengers were stranded in Corsica because of cancellations and delays. Flights to and from airports outside the region were also disrupted because the Aix-en-Provence controllers cover the busy routes from northern Europe to North Africa, Spain and the Balearic Islands.</p>

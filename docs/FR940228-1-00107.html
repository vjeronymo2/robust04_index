			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to define a student attending an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution for the first time as a student who has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously attended at least one class at the institution. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who received a refund of 100 percent of his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would also be considered a first-time student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that a first-time student at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is a student who is attending that institution, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to any institution, for the first time. Therefore, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student has not previously attended at least one class at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific institution, the Secretary would consider the student to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be attending that institution for the first time. If a student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers to another institution, he or she would count as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first-time student at the new institution, if he or she has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously attended at least one class at the new institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a student attends an institution, withdraws from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution (and receives less than a 100 percent refund), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then returns to the same institution, the student would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as a first-time student for his or her second period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attendance. The Secretary believes that if a student has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously received a 100 percent refund at an institution, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this definition, the student should be treated as if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> he or she had not previously attended the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that a student should remain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first-time student until the student withdraws from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution after attending at least one class, or completes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever occurs first. Therefore, the shortest amount of time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student could remain a first-time student is the period until he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or she withdraws after attending one class. The longest amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time a student could remain a first-time student is the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until his or her completion of the period of enrollment for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> he or she has been charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to adopt for all the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs the requirement currently found in the FFEL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that an institution's payment to a lender of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of a refund allocable to a Title IV, HEA program cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be delayed because of a delay in the return of equipment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would apply to the portion of the refund due to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the actual calculation of a refund under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund provisions of section 484B of the HEA, the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund is based on ``the portion of the period of enrollment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the student has been charged that remains [after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student stopped attending].'' Under the law, ``the portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains'' in an educational program measured in credit hours is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by dividing the number of weeks that the student did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not complete by the total number of weeks in the program. For a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock-hour program, the determination is made by dividing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of clock hours not completed by the total number of clock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours. For a correspondence program, the determination is made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by dividing the number of lessons not completed by the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of lessons. The Secretary has merely repeated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language here. The Secretary would like to note that ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been charged that remains'' is used to calculate the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund to a student and is distinct from the determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student has been charged that is used to determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation is applicable. The definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the student has been charged'' was discussed earlier in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, the Secretary proposes to define ``the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' as the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for which an institution charges a student. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to establish a minimum period of enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the student has been charged to prevent institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from establishing very short periods to minimize the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges that would be subject to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds for first-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students. In the case of an educational program that is measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other academic terms, the minimum period would be the semester,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trimester, quarter, or other academic term. In the case of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum period would be the lesser of the length of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program or an academic year. This proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition is based on the current policy for the FFEL programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that sets minimum certification periods for loans. This policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was designed partly to prevent institutions from circumventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the refund provisions currently found in &sect;668.22. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comments on whether other safeguards are needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent institutions from circumventing the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

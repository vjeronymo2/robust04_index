			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: DTI audit proposal little better than nothing Sir, Mr L. D. McClements (Letters, June 4) - who believes the Department of Trade and Industry's proposal that companies below the VAT threshold should be exempted from compulsory audit requirements does not go far enough - is pushing at an open door so far as much of the auditing profession is concerned. But the government is leaning against the door to ensure it does no more than stay ajar. Certainly in this firm we feel strongly that the DTI's proposal, while better than nothing, is not much better than nothing. We believe (as did the majority of respondents to a consultative paper issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales) the level should be higher. We suggest that audit should not be mandated by law for companies which are defined as small, ie currently broadly those with turnover below Pounds 2.8m. While the directors of many companies with a lower turnover than this will want to have their accounts audited, because the directors believe it to be desirable or because shareholders or lenders believe it desirable, if none of these parties believes that an audit is necessary, we do not believe that the public interest is served by an audit. There is another point which we believe should be addressed. Why do wholly-owned subsidiaries require separate statutory audits for their accounts, even if their holding company (whose audited accounts are available at the Companies Registry) has guaranteed all their obligations or when there are no outside creditors? We believe the UK should follow available European legislation and relieve such companies of the compulsory audit requirement. Auditors should only be entitled to earn income from audits if the marketplace believes audits are worthwhile. We do not believe the public interest is served by forcible audits on small companies whose shareholders and loan creditors see no benefit in audit.

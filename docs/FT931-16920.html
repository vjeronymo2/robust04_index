			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / ITV 2 plans shelved PLANS for an ITV 2 channel on satellite television have been shelved, Raymond Snoddy writes. ITV started researching the project last year when the BBC and Thames Television announced plans to launch UK Gold, a satellite service, based mainly on the programme libraries of both organisations. UK Gold, which started at the beginning of November, has performed better than expected, although the number of viewers is still modest compared with conventional television. ITV's research suggested that ITV 2 might cost up to Pounds 60m in its first year. One ITV chief executive said the project is 'on the back burner'.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / N Korea faces punishment The US, South Korea and Japan are seeking ways to punish North Korea's obduracy, after the International Atomic Energy Agency declared Pyongyang had broken the continuity of nuclear safeguards inspections by unloading spent nuclear fuel from a reactor without supervision. As the 15-month dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme reached a critical phase, President Bill Clinton said in Rome he expected to discuss the crisis with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Hans Blix, IAEA chief, last night briefed members of the United Nations Security Council, which may next week consider imposing economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Mrs Madeleine Albright, US envoy to the UN, termed Mr Blix's report 'alarming'. She said US, Japanese and South Korean officials, who held talks in Washington yesterday, would hold further discussions at the weekend. The US would then begin consultations in the Security Council on 'timing, objectives and substance of a sanctions resolution in the near future'. The IAEA wanted to select and analyse the spent fuel rods to see whether North Korea had diverted plutonium from the reactor in 1989 to develop at least one atomic bomb, as claimed by US intelligence. It said it was no longer possible to verify independently if North Korea had diverted plutonium. Pyongyang has warned that sanctions will be considered 'an act of war' and threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), expanding its nuclear programme. But both China and Russia, which wield veto power in the Security Council, suggested yesterday they would not support immediate imposition of sanctions. Mr Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, said on a visit to Seoul that negotiations with North Korea must continue and sanctions 'may only complicate matters.' In Moscow Mr Yeltsin told visiting South Korean President Kim Young-sam that the Security Council must issue an explicit warning to North Korea before resorting to sanctions. But he said Russia would back sanctions if North Korea withdrew from the NPT. The US, Japan and South Korea are considering imposing their own economic embargo if China blocks a sanctions resolution in the UN. South Korea is preparing measures to wind down its trade with the North, which amounted to Dollars 180m (Pounds 120m) last year. Japan may try to shut off cash remittances by Korean-Japanese, Pyongyang's largest source of hard currency. The three countries will consult on increased defence measures in preparation for a possible conflict on the Korean peninsula.</p>

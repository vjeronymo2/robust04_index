			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Arts: Picasso unexplored - Television The Tate Gallery exhibition Picasso: Sculptor/Painter opens today and BBC2 is in the middle of a season of programmes designed to complement the event. This is remarkable for two reasons: first because there are few television channels in the world which would even consider such a season. Britain has two; it is easy to imagine Channel 4 doing something similar. Given the worldwide tendency for television to concentrate more and more on such derivative and childish trash as Don't Forget Your Toothbrush (which, ironically, was launched on Saturday by Channel 4), we in Britain should count ourselves fortunate indeed to have two channels still willing to treat the audience like grown ups. However, the season is remarkable secondly because there seems to be a vacuum at its centre. Picasso is the primary representative in the public imagination of 'Modern Art'; and 'Modern Art' is treated with suspicion, hostility or contempt by, I would guess, a considerable majority of the population. So, given the obsession with the 'mass' aspect of television as a mass medium, you might think that the controller of BBC2, Michael Jackson, and BBC television's head of music and arts, Kim Evans, would see the Tate exhibition and their own season as the occasion to take the bull - that one made out of a bicycle saddle and handlebars if you like - by the horns and take the Modern Art debate to the public. Instead they are behaving as though they are unaware that there ever was any controversy over Modernism. In this entire season, beginning on Saturday and spreading across two weeks, with 12 proper programmes and 20 amusing little 90-second inserts called Talking Picasso, there are just two occasions when the central debate might be heard. The first is Picasso v. Matisse which is transmitted tonight. The programme starts with the twee idea that there is only room in heaven for one more artist, and St Peter (black of course, though surprisingly not a woman) has to choose. Which should it be? Unfortunately, though it touches on the contrasts between Matisse as the decorative colourist and Picasso as the intellectual master of form, the programme rapidly reverts to the main preoccupation of this series: Picasso's sexuality and the role of his models and mistresses. But there is a moment when we are shown a painting of a cream rectangle against a dark background and the commentary remarks that after looking at this it is easier to go back and look at one of Matisse's late groups of dancers and ignore what the dancers are doing and instead see how they fill the space and how the paint fills them. In other words painting is not about dancing or sunshine or joy, it is merely about painting. This, surely, is where television should start the big debate. It is the concentration on just such closed-shop talk, full of internal references to the world of painting rather than the world of ordinary people's experience, which ordinary people find most pretentious about the world of Modern Art. To outsiders it looks like a comfy little world of artists reacting to one another's latest weird passions, dealers egging them on, a few people with more money than sense buying art in the hope that it will out-perform the Footsie 100, and an army of academics and critics arguing the toss over all this in a secret language. However, the opportunity is missed and the programme moves back to discuss Picasso's bafflement at Matisse's ability to paint from nude models since Picasso found that, faced with a naked woman, he invariably became more interested in going to bed with her than painting her. Hence his habit of painting the female form clothed or from memory. Apart from the last in the season, all the other programmes are devoted either to Picasso's life, as with the opening offering, Yo Picasso, a documentary which uneasily mixed conventional and drama techniques to tell the story of his female companions; to some highly detailed aspect of his work as in Sunday's Picasso In Concrete which showed how Carl Nesjar translated Picasso's cardboard maquettes into pre-stressed concrete; or to the specialised reactions in Talking Picasso where, for instance, greengrocers criticise the fruit in a Picasso still life and a plastic surgeon muses on the possibility of rebuilding the head of a woman in which both eyes appear on one side of the nose. Ho ho. It is healthy not always to take art too seriously, and practically all these programmes are entertaining, informative, and well made - though some of the foreground music in the Richardson On Picasso trio was irritating, and in Yo Picasso loud enough to drown the dialogue. Nor is this season free of television's most infuriating habit in the coverage of art: using the camera to comment on paintings in a way that expresses the TV producer's sensibilities at the cost of the artist's. No artist ever intended you to see his work by starting in big close-up on an eyebrow before zooming out to the whole canvas. Moreover, repeating Clouzot's Le Mystere Picasso this coming Friday risks embarrassing comparisons. Nearly 40 years old, this extraordinary exercise in which Picasso painted on glass as cameras filmed from the rear is the most powerful piece of work in the season. The main point remains, however: Picasso is the ideal artist to exemplify the debate about the Modern movement because he showed with the pictures in his early Blue and Rose Periods that he was capable of creating hugely impressive and popular work in conventional styles, yet he chose to move into cubism and other unconventional styles. Why? Occasionally we get a hint, as in John Richardson's Monday programme with its details about early analytic cubism in Picasso's sketches from a Spanish hotel window. But within the larger consideration of Modernism these are trifles. What you would never gather from this Picasso season is any sense that figurative and non-Modern art is now moving back into the vanguard, and that it begins to look as though the entire Modern movement will be seen with hindsight, perhaps quite soon, as an eccentric detour within the larger history of art. Of course there is still the last programme in the season which it has been impossible to preview: The Late Show on Thursday February 24. We are told that this will tackle such questions as Picasso's place in the Modern movement, and how far he can be held responsible for 'the alienating trends of the present' in the art world. However, it sounds as though the chief concern will be the position of sculpture in the work of the painter, precisely the point implied by the title of the Tate exhibition. Television arts departments in general, and The Late Show in particular, appear to believe unswervingly in Modernism and are thus out of kilter with non-metropolitan public opinion. So it would be astonishing if The Late Show did mount a debate which managed to stand outside the enchanted village of Modernism and seriously question its creed. Yet in the mass medium of television that, surely, is one of the most important things that any proper season on Picasso ought to do.</p>

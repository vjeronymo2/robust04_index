			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A forgettable unit trust birthday WEDNESDAY September 30 is an anniversary the unit trust industry and thousands of investors would probably rather forget. It will be five years to the day since Royal Life launched the 'Royal Event', three unit trusts, described in Pounds 6m worth of privatisation-strength advertising as 'an investment opportunity more exciting and versatile than any share issue.' Responding at four times the normal rate, 135,000 people put Pounds 240m into the three funds. For 60 per cent of them, this was a first unhappy venture into unit trusts. Royal Life invested rapidly, via brokers James Capel, and had Pounds 200m already invested by October 19, 1987 when world stock markets crashed. Five years later, Royal Life has about Pounds 100m of the Pounds 240m still under management and around 96,000 remaining investors, estimating that market movements had wiped off Pounds 50m, with the rest accounted for by investors cashing in, although an unknown number might have switched to other funds within the group. Individually, the five-year record, up to the beginning of this week, was an 18.5 per cent gain for the International Cautionary Trust, according to Micropal. This was far short of the building society return which earned between 25.5 per cent and 43.65 per cent in the same period. The International growth trust, which aimed to outperform the FTA World index, showed a 10.5 per cent loss against the FTA World's 5.9 per cent gain. Meanwhile, the risk-oriented International Speculative trust showed a 24 per cent loss. 'Looking back, it clearly was not a good time for people to invest in equities,' said Steve Atkins, associate director of unitised funds at Royal Insurance. 'But I am not sure there was really anybody about five years ago who would have said to you they thought equities were likely to be a poor investment. Our expectation then was that people would do quite well.' Atkins noted that the five-years since 1987 were unusual because equities had performed so poorly, particularly in relation to cash-type investments. 'The theory is people must get a better return from in investing in equities where prices are volatile or people would always gravitate to cash.' He said: 'At a theoretical level that stands over a genuine long period of time, but I am not sure five years is long enough.' However, as Atkins acknowledged, the Royal Event funds also performed badly by comparison with other unit trusts. For example, International Speculative trust was outperformed by around 90 per cent of competitor funds in the year to September 1. On average, across all Royal's unitised funds, the group was outperformed by about 35 per cent of competitor funds. 'In the early couple of years of these particular trusts, overall performance by most of the funds we were running was not good at all, he said, referring to the total of 11 unit trusts and 45 unitised funds run by the group, totalling Pounds 2bn under management. Royal took action by setting up a separate asset management company early in 1990 and had since seen a steady and considerable improvement in fund performance, he said. On an offer-to-offer basis, Atkins said, Cautionary Trust had outperformed building society accounts over the last two years. A unit holder who stayed with the trust over that period had done better than by selling in disgust and then depositing the money with a society.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Observer: Food for thought David James, fast becoming the banks' favourite Mr Fixit, has not wasted any time strengthening the non-executive members of the board of his latest client, Lep, the troubled freight forwarder. H Wynne Denman is an old Cayzer hand, and J Brian Smith, an ex-Rank Organisation group managing director, has worked on other David James rescue missions. Both men are in their 60s and James says that 'their skills, experience and advice will bring added strength' to the board of Lep and its subsidiaries. But then one could have said the same about Lep's previous non-executive directors. Bill Govett, a former chairman of John Govett &amp; Co and a director of Legal &amp; General, 3i and the National Coal Board pension fund, was a member of the board for eight years and his fund management firm was instrumental in bringing in John Read, the previous chairman, who is now suing the company for Pounds 1.7m for loss of his job. Peter Grant, chairman of Sun Life and a former deputy chairman of Lazard Brothers, was a director for four years and Philip Hampton, an ex-Lazards merchant banker who is now British Steel's finance director, sat on the board for two years. Lazards was Lep's financial adviser until last year and both Grant and Hampton had worked on Lep deals and should have known the company well. This is not to say that they are not extremely effective at their main jobs. It is just another reminder that non-executive jobs can test even the most distinguished executives.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: The word in the slips - Cricket Cricket has always been a noisy game in the Indian sub-continent and in the macho world of Australian competition. But now in England too, howls of annoyance or encouragement are shattering the traditional peace of cricket grounds. With the noise has come a crop of jargon that you will pick up at any professional match without listening particularly carefully. You might hear the wicketkeeper yelling 'get it up 'im' as a precocious batsman takes guard. Sledging has become so familiar that the word is incorporated in larger dictionaries. Other cricket vernacular is less well known. Here is a quick glossary, with one or two oblique references to England's current visitors, New Zealand. Aerosol bowler - usually a wayward paceman, literally someone who sprays it everywhere. The young New Zealand fast bowler Heath Davis, playing his first Test at Trent Bridge, is a good example. Batsmen actually dread these types because sprinkled in between the wides and long-hops will be the unplayable delivery. Bunsen (burner) - rhyming slang for a turning wicket. A 'raging bunsen' describes the sort of pitch occasionally found in India. There are few in county cricket. Boot Hill - short leg. The youngest member of the team usually fields here because he is the most expendable, but 41-year-old Graham Gooch stands there for England, presumably so that he does not have to run after the ball much. Cafeteria bowling - Downright rubbish so called because you can help yourself. You might see some when New Zealand take the field this series. Dribbly - New Zealand term for a slow medium bowler (including former captains Jeremy Coney and Bev Congden) who are lethal on their damp, mossy pitches. Grabbers - slip fielders. Graeme Hick seems to have regained his composure there for England after a winter of fallibility. Minefield - a raging bunsen that helps fast bowlers as well. Usually found in provincial areas of New Zealand or on council-run county grounds in England, more by accident than design. Nick - touch, allegedly too faint for the umpire to hear or see, so non-walking batsmen usually get away with them, particularly Australians, but nowadays more and more English ones as well. On 'Em - Loud reminder from the slip cordon that the batsman taking guard made nought in the first innings, and is therefore in danger of making a pair. Even the worst tail-enders dread that. Pongo - rapid scoring. Serious pongo indicates a run rate of about eight an over usually inflicted by one of the great players - Brian Lara for instance  -and a day when the bowlers do not want their analyses advertised in full on one of those new-fangled electronic sight screens. Pull a Pup - Derbyshire term for doing a muscle, and nothing to do with thieves at Battersea Dogs Home. Rabbit - A batsman with a career average of less than five, or someone who has taken more wickets over his career than he has scored runs. (I don't qualify]) Reverend - player who only plays regularly on Sundays. Essex, Somerset and Durham seem to have had a monopoly. Usually indicates a cricketer coming to the end of his career. Not many are religious. Sawn-off - given out by a cross-eyed or crooked umpire sometimes this is just a pure gripe by a player who was legitimately dismissed and some come out with extraordinary excuses such as being distracted by spectators flashing mirrors or bowlers wearing coloured sweat bands. Strangle - a wicket taken with an unlikely delivery, also sometimes described as a 'death'. The new England cap Craig White strangles a lot of batsmen with deliveries of varying quality. Up The Ladder - general term for a coward or a hypochondriac. Basically anyone who manages to get off the field because life is getting a bit rough. Waqared - term coined from Waqar Younis's prowess at producing inswinging yorkers which are usually both painful and terminal. Yorkshire's Darren Gough is developing the same ability, but getting 'Goughed' doesn't quite have the same ring. X's - Money given to county or international captains for rounds of drink after play . The strange thing is you never see these captains for dust afterwards. Zorro - Energetic swishing batsman - a flashing blade. This summer there may be a plague of them representing England tucking in to the rather friendly New Zealand bowling.</p>

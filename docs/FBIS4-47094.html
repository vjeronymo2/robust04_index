			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Meri Created a Strong </F> Position for Himself"]    [Text] Tallinn -- When independent Estonia approved a new  Constitution in a referendum in June 1992, the head of state,  the president, was given a rather weak position, compared with  Finland, for example.    The president appoints the one who forms the government, but  if the first two candidates are not approved by the Riigikogu  [parliament], it is parliament itself that appoints a candidate  for prime minister. The president can only dissolve parliament  and announce new elections under certain conditions.    It says expressly in the Constitution that the government  takes care of foreign policy, while in Finland it is the  president.    The first president elected according to the new  Constitution, Lennart Meri, has shown that he wants to exercise  power. It has been said that in his exercise of power he is  approaching the limits of legality.    The most spectacular conflict with the government occurred  last winter, when Mart Laar proposed a replacement of four  ministers. Meri opposed mainly the firing of the minister of  economics, Toomas Sildmae. Initially, he refused to agree to the  change in ministers and delayed the decision. Finally, he gave  in.    There was talk about a constitutional crisis. According to  the government's interpretation, it is the prime minister who  decides about the ministers. The president's task is only to  confirm the government's decision.    President Meri's legal advisor Vahus Glaase is of a  different  opinion and denies that it could have been a matter of a  constitutional crisis.    He refers to the fact that the Constitution expressly says  that changes in the government's composition "must be made by  the president of the Republic at the request of the prime  minister." It is thus the president who has the last word. If it  were the prime minister, why would the matter still be referred  to the president, he wonders.    When HUFVUDSTADSBLADET visits Vahus Glaase at the appointed  time in his official room in Kadriorg, he is not yet there. He  is with the president, we are told.    After 25 minutes he arrives in the company of a man.    "Pardon the delay, but 20 minutes ago the president  appointed  this man to be the new minister of justice, and I was forced to  be present," says Glaase.    The man is named Urmas Arumae, the successor to Kaido Kama,  who stepped down a few weeks ago. This time, President Meri thus  decided immediately to agree to the prime minister's proposal  for a new minister.  <H5>  Minute Scrutiny </H5>   The president also has greater influence over legislation  than is evident from a superficial reading of the Constitution.  Glaase quotes Article 107, which says that the president is to  sanction the laws and that he may refuse to sanction a law and  within two weeks send it back to parliament. If parliament still  refuses to change the law, the president must sanction it or ask  the constitutional court to declare that it violates the  Constitution.    President Meri appears to have taken this article seriously.  He and his legal advisor very carefully scrutinize every law.  Vahur Glaase points out that it does not primarily involve  exercising power but an obligation to see to it that the laws  agree with the Constitution.    Of the 300 laws that have been instituted during Meri's time  the president objected to 11. In six of the cases parliament  changed the laws in accordance with the president's wishes. In  one case the president was satisfied, although parliament did  not accede to his proposal for change. Three cases have gone to  the constitutional court and a fourth is on the way. Of the  three cases that have been decided, the president won two and  parliament one.    President Meri has been especially active in foreign policy,  which was evident most recently in connection with President  Martti Ahtisaari's state visit to Estonia. Nevertheless, the  Constitution does not give the president any role in foreign  policy.    Glaase motivates the president's foreign policy activity  with  the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which grants the  head of state a special position in handling international  relations.    He admits that the government should head the practical  application of the foreign policy. However, there has not been  any conflict with the government in these matters.</p>

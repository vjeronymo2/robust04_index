The abolishment of the  Post Service Research Institute, which is contained in the  ministry's reorganization plan, came amid renewed controversy  over the role of the institute. The institute had run dozens of  branch offices across the nation to conduct inspections of mail  at the request of the intelligence agencies and police.    Opposition lawmakers had demanded that the institute be  abolished, branding the agency a legacy from previous  authoritarian governments. The ministry has argued that mail  inspection is part of the government's counterintelligence  efforts.    Government inspectors currently handle, 1,500 letters and  other postal items a day, according to ministry figures. The  total volume of post inspected decreased from 584,000 items in  1990 to 542,400 items in 1992.    The ministry said the mail inspection is still needed for  security purposes, but that the operation will be handed over to  major post offices. The ministry's reorganization plan also  featured a government effort to cope with the increasing trend  in the international marketplace to tear down trade barriers  between countries.    A new Information and Telecommunications Cooperation Bureau  will be charged with gathering and analyzing overseas market  information and helping domestic firms sell more goods and  promote joint projects overseas, a spokesman said.</p>

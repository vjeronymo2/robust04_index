			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: KIO reduces holding in Sembawang IN A further move to cover large losses in Europe and meet domestic reconstruction costs following the Gulf War, the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) has sold a SDollars 60m (USDollars 37m) block of shares in the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore, writes Kieran Cooke in Singapore. The sale reduces the KIO's stake in Sembawang, one of Singapore's biggest shipyards, from 7.81 per cent to just under 5 per cent. Last December the KIO sold a 16 per cent stake in the Singapore Cycle &amp; Carriage company to Jardines of Hong Kong for SDollars 212.5m. Analysts say that the KIO still has about SDollars 1bn worth of shares in companies in Singapore and Malaysia, including a substantial stake in one of Singapore's most prestigious office buildings.</p>

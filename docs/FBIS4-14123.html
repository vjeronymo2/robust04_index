			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Surani Urges Escalation of </F> Confrontation With Israelis"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- PLO Executive Committee Member  Jamal al-Surani has reaffirmed "the need for the continuation of  the intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territory and for the  escalation of confrontational operations against the Israelis to  force them to speed up their withdrawal."    Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is  imminent, al-Surani, who is opposed to the Declaration of  Principles agreement, believes that "the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiation sessions have exposed Israel's lies about its desire  for peace and also exposed its continuing refusal to implement  the UN resolutions and its violation of the fourth Geneva  Convention."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Surani described the  agreement  between Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) as "a  step toward unification of the various Palestinian factions  within the framework of the PLO, the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people."    He accused the U.S. Administration of "appeasing" Israel. He  added that when the Palestinians "defend their rights they are  accused of terrorism but the Israeli repression and murders are  seen by them as security preccautions."</p>

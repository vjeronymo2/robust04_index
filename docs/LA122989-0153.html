			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OOPS;  </P> <P> TAPE TRAPS DRUG DEALING TEEN  </P> <P> A father hoping to surprise his children with a tape recorder for Christmas got  a surprise of his own -- the device contained a tape of conversations involving  drug dealing.  </P> <P> An Indianapolis man purchased the recorder at a Wal-Mart store on Dec. 23,  Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Stephen G. Golden said.  </P> <P> The man noticed the tape inside the player, listened to it and turned it over  to authorities.  </P> <P> The tape was made secretly by parents of a teen-ager who suspected their  daughter was dealing drugs, Golden said. The parents used a phone answering  tape device.  </P> <P> Investigators believe the girl learned of the recording and took the tape to  the store to play, leaving it in a display model, Golden said.  </P> <P> When the recorder was the only one left, employees boxed it and sold it to the  Indianapolis man.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Rome 'aware of BNL Iraq loans': CIA reports quoted in Atlanta court THE US federal judge presiding over the case of more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) yesterday revealed that three reports by the Central Intelligence Agency 'definitely' show that the bank's head office in Rome was aware of the Atlanta loans. Judge Marvin Shoob made the revelation, which was entered into the public records last night, during a conference in court with US prosecutors and the lawyer representing Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta branch manager who faces a jail sentence. The judge's disclosure marks the first time a US official has quoted secret CIA reports in court that show BNL's head office to have been involved in the Iraqi loans scandal. Two former BNL executives had previously told the FT it was untrue that Mr Drogoul acted without Rome's approval. The central premise of the US government's case against Mr Drogoul is that he was the sole orchestrator of the loans, which helped to finance President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects. Judge Shoob said in court yesterday that the CIA reports that he had read 'definitely do support the defendant's position that BNL Rome was aware of what he was doing, and they also undermine the government's position that this was a lone wolf type operation.' Earlier Mr Luigi Sardelli, former head of BNL's North American division, testified he had sent an auditor's report to the bank's Rome headquarters detailing irregularities in Atlanta in October 1988. Mr Sardelli said the report, mysteriously, was only brought to the attention of BNL executives in July 1989, just three weeks before US officials uncovered the illegal Iraqi loans made through the Atlanta branch. Mr Sardelli said his warnings were ignored by Mr Giacomo Pedde, former BNL chief executive. George Graham adds from Washington: Senator Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, yesterday launched a swingeing attack on what has stood as perhaps President Bush's proudest achievement - the Gulf war. Detailing loan guarantees and technology sales by the Reagan and Bush administrations that helped Iraq build up its military capability before its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Mr Gore attacked Mr Bush's foreign policy judgment: 'His poor judgment, moral blindness and bungling policies led directly to a war that should never have taken place.'</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Single-person households rise SINGLE people living alone will make up more than 30 per cent of all UK households by the end of the decade, the biggest growth being in single-male households. By the year 2000, 40 per cent of all British households will be either single-person or single-parent, according to a study published yesterday by Mintel, the international research agency. The UK now has 6m single-person households - 26 per cent of the total - compared with 12 per cent in 1961. Increased life expectancy, higher divorce rates and people marrying at a later age have put the notion of UK family life under pressure, Mintel says. The average life expectancy from birth is now 73 years for men and 78.5 years for women. The number of divorces has increased from 158,000 in 1981 to 170,000 last year. The mean age for first marriages has risen from 25.7 for men in 1983 to 27.2 last year, and from 23.5 to 25 for women in the same period. Mintel says those demographic shifts will mean that by the year 2000 a quarter of purchasing decisions will be made by a person living alone. Single Person Households 1992.

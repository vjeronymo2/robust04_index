			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Search for new SPD leader begins LEADERS of Germany's battered opposition Social Democrats yesterday met behind closed doors to discuss a successor to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the former party chief whose abrupt resignation last week threw the party into disarray. The 13 members of the SPD presidium have swiftly to find a new party leader and challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ensure the party's credibility ahead of state and national elections next year. The SPD is considering moving the annual party conference, due in autumn, to June to cut the time the party leadership is left vacant. It is also debating whether the next party chief will automatically become the rival candidate to Mr Kohl. Members of the presidium were meeting state party leaders last night. Discussions are due to continue today within the executive board of the SPD. Leading candidates for the post include Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, and Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister of the Rhineland Palatinate. Ms Renate Schmidt, vice-president of the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament and head of the SPD in Bavaria, also announced she would run for the chancellor's office. Opinion polls show popular support for the SPD is neck and neck with the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). While Mr Engholm's resignation has damaged the Social Democrats' standing in public opinion, a series of scandals within the CDU/CSU has dealt equally severe blows to the popularity of the ruling party.</p>

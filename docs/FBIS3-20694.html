			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["SSH Public Statement"] </F>   [Text] The SSH [Socialist Party of Croatia] leadership  distributed the following public statement at a news conference:    1) The Republic of Croatia must immediately and clearly,  without any reservations, declare its support for a unified  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which should not be divided on an ethnic  basis.    2) The Republic of Croatia must make a clear and unambiguous  statement that it will strive to protect, with all means except  military ones, those elements of the Croatian nation who live  outside the republic's borders.    3) The Croatian people -- a substantial part of whom gave  their votes of confidence to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Community] at the last elections -- did not vote for a policy of  war and military engagement in other countries. They must be  informed of all the relevant factors that have led to the  growing international isolation of Croatia and the threat of  international sanctions.    4) The introduction of sanctions against Croatia would be  counterproductive, as confirmed by the case of Serbia, and they  must be avoided in the interest of the majority of the  population which would be hardest hit.</p>

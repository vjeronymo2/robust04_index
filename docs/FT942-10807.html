			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Travel variations across Europe Hotels and airlines are busy promoting discount prices, but companies are under no illusions that travel still accounts for a big slice of their costs whatever is on offer. A study by market researchers Mori for travel agency Thomas Cook says that travel is the third biggest corporate expense in Europe after salaries and information technology. Almost half the 298 companies questioned had a firm policy to control corporate travel, but the details varied by country and business sector. Banking and finance companies are the most likely to impose a company-wide travel policy. The UK had the highest proportion, 59 per cent, of companies where travel policy was made at the corporate level, and the second highest, 25 per cent, with the individual traveller having the sole control. The remaining companies left decision-making to departments or a combination of individuals and departments. Germany, by contrast, relied on departmental rules more than other countries and had the second lowest level of control, 30 per cent, at the corporate level. Other national characteristics included French companies' enthusiasm for driving a hard bargain with the travel agency, while the Swiss and Swedes were least concerned about money. Four out of five Italian companies rated it important or very important for the agent to be nearby, a factor which was hardly relevant for Swiss, Swedish and Dutch companies. Swiss companies are keen on their travel agents taking a back seat in travel management, while the UK, Sweden and France want their agency to be 'proactive'.</p>

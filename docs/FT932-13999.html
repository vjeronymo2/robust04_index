			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Europe's pacemaker - UK builds more cars for export THE UK is set to be the fastest growing centre for car production in Europe during the 1990s supported by rapidly expanding exports. The awards for export achievements made to three of the leading car makers in the UK, Ford, Vauxhall and Nissan, reflect the resurgence in the fortunes of the motor industry in Britain, which is being driven both by the greatly improved quality and productivity of the traditional carmakers, and by the wave of inward investment that has come from leading Japanese carmakers. The industry is expected to wipe out its chronic trade deficit of the last 10 years and to move into surplus during the second half of the decade, helped too by the expansion of the automotive components sector, which has received a substantial boost from the arrival of the Japanese car operations. The export award to Caterham Cars, the small maker of the Super Seven two seater roadster (successor of the Lotus Seven), also illustrates the strength of the specialist and motor sport sector of the UK automotive industry, which has become a world leader in the development of racing cars. While the motor industry trade deficit has inevitably fallen during the recession, there have also been encouraging signs of a structural improvement in the UK motor industry's competitiveness. Car production has held up much more strongly during the last three years than might have been expected given the plunge in domestic demand. After the pain of the 1970s and the 1980s the motor industry in Britain is again producing cars at a quality level that is competitive with plants elsewhere in Europe, and UK automotive industry labour costs are the lowest among the leading car producing countries of west Europe. As a result car exports have risen strongly and UK output of 1.29m cars in 1992 was less than 1 per cent below the 1.3m level of 1989, despite the 31 per cent fall in new car sales in the same period. Car output for export markets accounted for 45.6 per cent of total UK car production in 1992 and for 48.9 per cent in 1991 compared with only 21.6 per cent in 1989. The three volume carmakers that win the Queen's award for export achievement in 1993 have all opened up significant new export paths in recent years. VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of Europe, only began to export vehicles again in significant volumes in 1990 after an absence of several years from foreign markets. By last year, however, exports were already accounting for 37 per cent of its total output of 301,857 cars and car-derived vans. The volume of exports rose by 8 per cent to 111,700. Vauxhall's two UK assembly plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, were both able to operate at full capacity last year thanks to the size of the export programmes. The outlook is less favourable for 1993, however. Despite improved demand in the UK, both plants have been forced to introduce short-time working in the face of the sharp downturn in demand in continental European markets. Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, warned recently that market conditions in Europe 'are worsening overall' and that there was 'little hope of being as productive and profitable' in 1993 as last year. The strength of its export performance helped Vauxhall to achieve record operating profits of Pounds 269.1m in 1992 despite the continuing weakness of the UK market. Productivity at Vauxhall rose by 8 per cent last year, and its two assembly plants currently have a cost advantage of more than 15 per cent against GM's continental European plants and are achieving the same quality levels. While its vehicle export volumes are set to fall this year Vauxhall will gain some compensation by the start-up of engine exports from its new Pounds 193m top-of-the-range V6 engine plant at Ellesmere Port, where it will have a capacity to produce 135,000 engines a year. Initial small volume production began late last year. Vauxhall still has a significant trade deficit in the UK, but the new engine plant is expected to cut the UK trade deficit by around Pounds 100m a year with 80 per cent of production being exported to GM assembly plants in continental Europe. NISSAN has come rapidly to the fore in the last couple of years to challenge Britain's traditional carmakers for the position of leading UK car exporter. At its Sunderland plant, the spearhead of the Japanese drive into the UK, where Nissan has invested more than Pounds 900m, production has expanded rapidly in the last 12 months, and there will soon be capacity to produce up to 300,000 cars a year across two product ranges. Output rose by 43.5 per cent last year to 179,000 from 124,700 in 1991, and the company is aiming to raise output by a further 51 per cent this year to 270,000 cars with around 84 per cent of production being exported. Nissan's car exports from the UK, which began modestly in 1988 at 11,080, have climbed sharply to reach 112,700 in 1991 and 157,234 in 1992. Exports accounted for 88 per cent of its UK production last year. With the addition of new products by Nissan at its Spanish subsidiary, Nissan Motor Iberica, the UK company has also begun to export petrol engines from Sunderland to Spain for assembly into the Barcelona-built Nissan Serena multi-purpose vehicle. Nissan first began to export left-hand drive cars to nine continental European markets in September 1988. It began to export cars from the UK to eastern Europe in 1991 and in the same year became the first Japanese carmaker to start shipping cars from Europe to Asia. It has planned to export around 10,000 cars a year from the Sunderland plant to Taiwan and to Japan. The big boost to Nissan's output came last August with the start-up of production of its second range of UK-built cars, the Micra small car. Output of the Nissan Primera large family car, which began in May 1990, is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year to around 130,000 from 141,800 in 1992, while production of the Micra is forecast to rise to 140,000 from the 37,200 produced in the last five months of 1992. The UK-built Micra is particularly important for Nissan in its drive to increase its penetration of the southern European markets, such as Italy, France and Spain. Traditionally these markets have operated very restrictive policies against direct vehicle imports from Japan. At the same time small cars of the Micra-class represent the biggest segments of these new car markets. FORD continued as Britain's leading motor industry exporter in 1992 with shipments of vehicles and components worth around Pounds 2.2bn. Its exports are much more wide-ranging than those of either Vauxhall or Nissan with the UK serving as one of its principal locations for engine production in Europe and a source for other components ranging from radiators to plastic mouldings, instrument clusters and engine castings. In 1992 it exported 159,000 vehicles from its assembly plants in Dagenham, Essex, Halewood, Merseyside, and Southampton despite repeated periods of short-time working caused chiefly by the continuing UK recession. It also exported 770,000 engines from its two engine plants at Bridgend, South Wales, and at Dagenham. Ford reacted more slowly than General Motors to integrate both its UK car assembly plants into its overall European production network. For the first part of the UK recession it was unable to cushion its car production at Halewood by increasing exports, but it finally overcame this hurdle at the beginning of January 1992. The Merseyside plant began shipping its Escort/Orion cars to continental European markets at the start of 1992 and exported more than 30,000 vehicles last year. It exported around 17 per cent of its total output including 20,000 Escorts. The Dagenham plant continued its strong export performance in 1992 with more than 50 per cent of its output of 213,192 Fiesta cars and vans and Courier vans being shipped abroad. Dagenham is Ford's sole production source for the Fiesta Courier high roof van, and in the first full year of production in 1992 more than 46,000, or 93 per cent of output, were exported. More than a third of the output of the Ford Transit panel van at the Southampton plant was also exported last year, amounting to 21,000 vehicles in 1992. Light commercial vehicles are an important element in Ford's UK exports with volumes rising significantly last year to 82,654 from 63,900 a year earlier. The Dagenham engine plant is Ford's sole source in Europe for diesel engines, and last year the Essex plant exported 395,000 engines or 75 per cent of its output of 567,000 engines. Bridgend, which produces Ford's new range of Zeta multi-valve petrol engines, exported 374,000 engines or 74 per cent of output to Ford assembly plants on the continent. Despite its position as the UK's leading motor industry exporter, Ford of Britain has still recorded a UK trade deficit for every year since 1981 with its exports overshadowed by the volume of its vehicle imports (excluding Jaguar since its takeover in 1989). The development of Ford of Britain's trade deficit has followed closely the performance of the overall UK motor industry. The deficit ran close to Pounds 1.4bn a year in 1988 and 1989, but fell to Pounds 1.297bn in 1990 and to Pounds 214m in 1991. No figure is yet available for 1992. Ford of Britain first moved into deficit in 1981 having previously been a significant positive contributor to the UK trade balance.</p>

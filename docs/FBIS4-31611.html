			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 13 (TANJUG) -- UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] representative in Sarajevo confirmed Sunday  night [12 June] that the forces of Bosnian Croats launched an  offensive against the Serbs in Bosnia in the north of the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the UPI news agency  reported, he specified that at least five projectiles were fired  from multiple rocket launchers Sunday on Brcko, a Serb town in  northern Bosnia.    This action by Bosnian Croats surprised the U.N., said the  UNPROFOR representative. According to the Bosnian Serbs'  military sources, five civilians, including a child and a Serb  soldier, were wounded when from the territory of neighboring  Croatia 8 projectiles were fired from the multiple rocket  launchers on civilian targets in Brcko.    This was the eighth artillery attack on Brcko over the past  month, and the fifth from the territory controlled by the  forcibly seceded former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia. The  attacks killed a total of seven and wounded 46 people either on  the street or at home.    The attack on Brcko came in spite a four-week ceasefire,  concluded last Wednesday in Geneva, which came into force on  Friday at noon between the Moslem-Croatian federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.).</p>

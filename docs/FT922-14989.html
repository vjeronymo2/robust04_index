			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing to leave HK bank post MR LI KA-SHING, Hong Kong's richest man, is to step down from the deputy chairmanship of HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Mr Li has been a member of Hongkong Bank's board since 1980 and its non-executive deputy chairman since 1985. The bank said he was retiring to devote more time to his other business and personal interests. It said that Mr Li had wanted to step down for the past two years, but it prevailed upon him to stay. The bank said his advice had been greatly valued. Mr Li is one of the bank's biggest shareholders. He owns nearly 1 per cent of the bank - the limit it places on individual shareholdings - and stands to be a large shareholder of the bank that will emerge from the merger of Hongkong Bank with Midland Bank of the UK. Mr David Gledhill, the retiring chairman of the Swire group, will also relinquish his Hongkong Bank board seat. The bank and Swire have a very close relationship, and it would be no surprise if Mr Peter Sutch, chairman designate of Swire, were to be appointed to the bank's board. Also to step down from the bank's board is Mr FR Frame, an executive director since 1985, but he will continue as an adviser to the board. Husky Oil, the Canadian oil group controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, is asking its government partners to put up another CDollars 140m (USDollars 117.6m) to get its USDollars 1.5bn heavy-oil upgrader on stream in November, Robert Gibbens reports from Montreal. Husky, with a 27 per cent stake in the upgrader on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, would put up an extra CDollars 50m, said Mr Arthur Price, Husky president. The Alberta government, with a 24 per cent stake, and the federal government, with 32 per cent, have given the company the nod, but Saskatchewan, with 17 per cent, is questioning the project's viability.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / N Sea output dips UK OIL production slipped to 1.9m barrels a day last month, a decline of 80,000 b/d from February, according to County NatWest in Edinburgh. The fall in output was partly a result of shutdowns on the Flotta pipeline as the new Piper B oil platform was tied into the grid. Low oil prices and weak world demand are causing many companies to focus on cost-cutting and rationalisation this year.</p>

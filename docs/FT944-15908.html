			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Books: Down the Silk Road . . . into the empty quarter - AC Grayling and Michael Thompson-Noel discuss masterly evocations of the world's wildest places THESIGER by Michael Asher Viking Pounds 20, 582 pages To judge from his clothes and much-cobbled shoes, Wilfred Thesiger is obviously an English gentleman. He is probably this century's most distinguished explorer, and certainly one of the greatest living Englishmen: Old Etonian, Oxford boxing blue, big-game hunter, colonial administrator, guerrilla fighter, war hero, horseman, photographer, writer of distinction, Arabist, friend of emperors, and traveller extraordinary. To the Bedu of southern Arabia, Thesiger, now 84, was Mbarak: the Blessed One. He did not go in for stunts. His explorations were true adventures, whether solving one of Africa's last mysteries, the destination of the Awash river in Ethiopia; crossing the Empty Quarter of Arabia; living among the Marsh Arabs of Iraq; or travelling in the remotest parts of equatorial Sudan, Morocco, western Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Yemen - wherever. As a result, Thesiger's greatest works, Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs, are superb evocations of the world's wildest places, and of their inhabitants, at precisely that moment - the middle of the 20th century - when high technology was bathing mankind in a stark, ungodly light. Thesiger detests the way that the arrival of the machines has heralded the obliteration of traditional values: courage, the warrior instinct, loyalty, dignity, stoic endurance and honesty. For Thesiger, technological society produces little but selfishness and materialism. As his biographer says: 'This is Thesiger's legacy: he reminded us that there is more to our relationship with the earth than can be understood through a windscreen or analysed in a technical report. It is that elusive quality best understood by poets, writers, artists and romantics - spirit.' Thesiger's biographer, Michael Asher, is no keyhole-peeping swot but a desert explorer in his own right. As well as retracing Thesiger's steps uphill, down wadi, across quicksand and through the Empty Quarter, Asher stayed two years in Nairobi, and interviewed the old explorer in his Kenyan home, a modest cabin. His admiration for Thesiger is unstinting. Yet Asher is always swift to describe the paradoxes that underpin Thesiger's self-adopted role as a living link between the world's 'unspoiled peoples' and the juggernaut of technology and modernism that is sweeping them away. For example, Thesiger deliberately courted danger, and remarked: 'Fancy offering any self-respecting person security from the cradle to the grave . . . Today most men do not experience enough challenge and hardship . . . How can people work off their frustrations by kicking a tiny ball in a park?' There is truth in this statement, says Asher. Yet security, he observes, is precisely what the high-born Thesiger always had: the cushion of a privileged place in society from which to launch his manly expeditions. How easy - one imagines - to have satisfied his restlessness and indulged his romanticism by seeking out the hardships that primitive peoples endure in order to survive. Asher's brisk treatment of Thesiger's sexuality, a subject on which another writer might have laboured like a beetle with a dungball, is exemplary. The thing is not a mystery: Thesiger likes men, though he says that his liaisons with a string of dusky youths throughout his life were what Asher calls 'essentially platonic'. Thesiger denies he is a misogynist, though he is certainly anti-feminist. 'A woman tends to bulge in the wrong places', he told Asher. 'It's a pity you can't have babies in bottles . . . It's probably true to say that I have a low sex-drive . . . All those months  - five years in the desert - there was no question of sex and it left me untroubled, just as it did that I couldn't get a drink or a decent meal.' Terrestrial exploration is largely finished, and old age has left Thesiger stranded in disillusionment. We are dinosaurs, he maintains, heading for extinction. 'There's nothing to be cheerful about . . . Everything is going to the dogs.'</p>

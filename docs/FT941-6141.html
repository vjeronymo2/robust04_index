			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Safeguards over Rover stressed The government's role in seeking to safeguard the future of Rover's operations in Britain after its acquisition by BMW of Germany was stressed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Commons last night. He vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for the leadership of the Conservative party. While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, Mr Heseltine insisted: 'We did not stand back from it.' He said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. Mr Heseltine emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its separate base in Britain with independent manufacturing, design and development facilities. He told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked for these assurances and got them.' Mr Heseltine urged his Labour critics to recognise that, while manufacturing was important, it accounted for only 27 per cent of the wealth producing sector and 20 per cent of the whole economy. He attacked Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs for damaging Britain's exporting companies by 'innuendo and smear', and claimed that Labour's industrial strategy would lead to the re-imposition of controls over dividends. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, launched an attack on the government's failure to prevent the erosion of Britain's manufacturing base. He taunted Mr Heseltine with a reference in his book Where There's A Will to the importance of maintaining British control over Rover. Mr Cook said British companies distributed most of their profits in dividends because of the fear that a fall in share price would lead to a takeover bid.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev </F> and Yuriy Pichugin]    [Text] Pretoria 29 April TASS -- A mission of Russian State  Duma deputies in South Africa, where they observed the universal  non-racial elections, has been completed.    Before leaving for Russia on Friday deputy group head A.  Chilingarov told ITAR-TASS the voting was a historic stage in  the life of South Africa divided in the recent past by racial  barriers.    "We have visited many areas of residence of white and black  communities and talked to representatives of various political  parties, officials and average voters," he said. "We were most  impressed by activeness of the population, enthusiasm of  Africans who have been given the right to vote for the first  time, and the atmosphere of friendliness in meters-long lines to  the polling stations."    In his opinion, some drawbacks in the elections were caused  by the absence of registration lists, which resulted in a sharp  shortage of ballot sheets. This may give a reason for doubts in  case of any disputes.    The Russian observer mission included V. Sheynis, G.  Seleznev  and I. Novitskaya. In their opinion, the South African  elections signify a transition from confrontation to cooperation  and show the will of representatives of all races and political  convictions to national reconciliation and solution of  disputable issues exclusively by peaceful civilized methods.    The parliament members noted genuine interest of South  Africans in Russia and their striving to develop fruitful and  friendly relations with it.</p>

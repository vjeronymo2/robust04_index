			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Report on Captures    The report issued by the agents who participated in the  capture of the accused indicates that, at 1630 on Saturday, 15  January of this year, the Ecuadoran citizens, Luis Alberto Mejia  Tarupi and Nelson Orlando Benavides Medina, were arrested. They  had arrived in Guayaquil on Wednesday, 11 January, driving a  white Ford 350 truck with license plates PFS-293, on which they  were carrying 500 packages of drugs (cocaine hydrochloride),  with a gross weight, including their wrappers, of 541,976 grams.  The shipment was camouflaged in boxes containing Colcafe  [Colombian coffee], cookies, candy, lollipops, chocolates, etc.    The report adds that, when the aforementioned vehicle  reached  Guayaquil, it was kept in a garage located on Nicasio Sadafi  Avenue, at the La Atarazana housing complex. They left the truck  in the care of those residing there who served as guards of the  premises, several of whom were witnesses to the seizure of the  drugs and the arrest of Mejia Tarupi and Benavidez Medina.  <H5>  The Interrogations </H5>   During the preliminary interrogations conducted, Luis Mejia  Tarupi claimed that the drugs were intended for Kleber Delgado  Delgado, following a telephone call to be made to the Hotel  Internacional Orquideas, No. 2, room number 205. Hence, several  agents went to the aforementioned room with the subject in  custody, to wait for the call, which was made. During the  conversation, an unidentified speaker told the subject to remain  there, so that they could call him back to give him the  respective instructions for delivering the merchandise (drugs).    At 1500 on Sunday, 16 January, the Colombian citizens, Juan  Carlos Gamba Garcia, Alberto Alfredo Benavidez Coral, and Mario  Fernando Jurado Portilla, arrived at the hotel, located on  Olmedo Avenue between Chile and Chimborazo. They were  accompanied by the Ecuadoran, Kleber Delgado Delgado, riding in  a white Chevrolet Vitara without plates.    The report stresses that only Alfredo Benavidez got out of  the car, heading for the room where Mejia Tarupi was waiting. He  made contact with the latter and was arrested.    The police acted immediately to capture the rest of those  implicated who were still in the vehicle. During the search of  those arrested, Kleber Delgado was found to have a Ruger make  pistol with two loaders and 29 9-mm caliber shells. This  evidence was stored at the Interpol warehouses.    Those arrested, except for Luis Mejia Tarupi, were taken to  the police headquarters lockup, together with the vehicles and  the confiscated drugs.    Luis Mejia was detained in the hotel room, because it was  known that he must have had other contacts, and might possibly  be visited by other members of the "narco"-criminal organization.  <H5>  Customs Police Captured </H5>   As the investigations progressed, the Interpol agents  captured two active members of the Customs Military Police who  were participating directly in the shipment of cocaine from  Guayaquil to the United States, through the Challenger air  freight company.    Those under arrest, Corporals William Oswaldo Rivera Cabezas  and Hugo Segura Hurtado, admitted their association with the  drug traffickers during the preliminary interrogations.    Since the two PMA members were working outside Guayaquil,  arrangements were made with that institution's general  headquarters to have them taken into custody and sent to the  principal port.  <H5>  Drugs at the Airport </H5>   As a result of these arrests, the agents determined that the  "narco"-criminal organization was not only using this city's  seaport for shipping out drugs, but might also have been doing  so from the airport, thanks to the cooperation of the customs  policemen who were captured.    Both Rivera and Segura, who were working at the air  terminal,  maintained contact with Delgado who, after packing the drugs in  bales of T-shirts printed with Galapagos Islands tourist  advertisements, was storing the merchandise in the Challenger  air freight firm's warehouses. There, the dishonest policemen  were pretending to make a counternarcotics check of the cargo to  be put aboard the planes. For their purposes, however, they knew  in advance which boxes contained the drugs, because the name  Jose Heredia was being used to identify them. This made it easy  for them to locate the boxes that they were supposed to send  through without the checking and inspection procedure.    Moreover, these individuals were objecting to the  counternarcotics check being made by the National Police,  through their agents.</p>

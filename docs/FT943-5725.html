			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other People come, people go. (Nothing ever happens in Grand Hotel.) They have their exits and their entrances. Time passes. Peter Handke's play The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other has stage directions but no words. And its top layer - as realised by Luke Bondy's staging for the Schaubuhne am Leitner Platz, Berlin, now at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre - is an absurdist study in character. Individuals cross the stage, each revealing some different peculiarity; and many of the vignettes concerning them are funny. There are the four Austrian-type tourists, determinedly trekking along against all odds, beaming their wonder; the two old peasant women pushing shopping-trolleys; the lone male roller skater who finds time to stroke his hair oh so casually and then glides offstage in a sudden arabesque; the SAS-type soldiers who zoom perilously onto the stage and straight off again; a Tarzan who swings onto the stage and then walks across it like an ape; a Papageno, whistling appropriate tunes by Mozart, with his birdcage, who gets clobbered by a harmless-looking gent carrying a huge pack of nappies. All of them look as if they were New Yorker cartoons. But the fun of a cartoon is that it is one frozen moment out of time. The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other, however, is 120 minutes long. And it soon adds up to a view of the world - a world peopled by oddballs, where nothing has rhyme or reason, where noises off (guns? bombs?) frighten everyone into defensive posture. The mood only darkens after an hour or more, although you know from one look at Gilles Aillaud's elegant after-Magritte set that darkness will descend. An Egyptian dog-deity on a plinth; an old car half-covered by a dust-sheet; a blue horizon; a manhole; an incomplete white wall . . . The fact that these scenic elements do not add up to anything coherent is, of course, the whole point. Let nobody think that any of this is the least bit original, by the way. The shape of it is extremely reminiscent of many Merce Cunningham works, and many of its comic anecdotes have been prefigured in any number of ballets by Jerome Robbins. And the Dadaist feel of it all, the collection of bizarre human eccentricities, derives from such Pina Bausch works as 1980. So why do I find so much less merit in Handke's play than in these works it so resembles? He is only interested in external differences. Whereas Cunningham honours human potential and makes it large and complex, Handke knocks it down to size and makes it pointless. Even Bausch, to whose Teutonic spirit he is much closer, is more interested in the urgent internal forces that motor the unhappy crazies she puts onstage. Handke's play is the hour we knew nothing of each other - and cared less. At the Edinburgh Festival Theatre till September 3</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nelson Franco] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Army Minister General Zenildo Lucena and  the military chiefs who surround him believe the involvement of  Rio de Janeiro's political-administrative structure in organized  crime has reached such a serious level that it justifies federal  intervention. According to an officer stationed in Brasilia,  despite the risks and complexity of this sort of action,  intervention is appropriate, but it will probably be implemented  too late.    For less serious reasons, the Army intervened in Alagoas  State. It did so, however, at the request of the Alagoas  governor and under the orders of the president of the Republic.  In the case of Rio de Janeiro, neither Minister Lucena nor  General Benedito Leonel, the Army chief of staff, believe  Governor Nilo Batista will call for military support. First, he  would be announcing his inability to solve the problem, and  second because Batista is involved in the numbers game scandal.    The Army minister has been receiving visits from  congressmen,  most of them from Rio de Janeiro, at the Army Headquarters in  Brasilia. To each of them, Gen. Lucena regrets the insecurity  that reigns in Rio de Janeiro. He also comments on the legal  impossibility of intervention in the absence of a request from  the governor and an order from the president of the Republic.    The Army minister believes intervention is necessary, but  can  only act if it complies with the constitutional norms, as he and  Gen. Leonel said in Brasilia on 18 April. The two generals  added that they are ready. If President Itamar Franco gives the  order, the Army is ready to act. Their remarks do not seek to  praise their military organization and are more than just a  message: They are almost encouraging the president of the  Republic to give the order.    The Army has the intervention planned. For a long time, the  military information and intelligence services have been  following the actions of organized crime in Rio de Janeiro.  They have reasonably assessed the arrival of weapons in the  city and have precious information on the organization of  criminals.    The involvement of the Rio de Janeiro security apparatus in  organized crime has convinced the military that intervention  would consist of three stages:    1. To moralize the Military, Civil, and Federal Police, as  well as at the Fire Department because, together with the Army,  they will participate in the war against crime.    2. To effectively fight crime by occupying the hill slums.    3. To end the intervention period, when the Army will  return responsibility for the security structures to the state  government.    In Rio de Janeiro, as well as in the federal administration,  there are many restrictions on such a complex action. Last  year, the Military Command of the East clashed with Leonel  Brizola's opposition to an Army participation in a fight against  crime. At the time, Brasilia also opposed military  participation.</p>

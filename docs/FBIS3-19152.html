			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Gustav Haegglund, </F> commander of the Finnish Defense Forces, by correspondent Harri  Korkkula; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] President Martti Ahtisaari has appointed  Lieutenant General Gustav Haegglund, the chief of the General  Headquarters, as the commander of the Defense Forces. [passage  omitted] After extensive Air Force procurement, it is now time  to develop the land and naval forces, according to the new  commander.    [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, while you are  commander  of the Defense Forces, Finland will have to take far-reaching  decisions; how does possible EU [European Union] membership  change Finland's security policy status, in your view?    [Haegglund] It will open new possibilities for us that do  not  exist without the membership. That is one important factor, the  other one is that of course Finland, as a member of such a big  Union alliance, will be in a different kind of position than  being alone, and we would then have to make all sorts of  policies run in parallel with these partners.    [Korkkula] So what is Finland's position if it stays outside  the EU?    [Haegglund] Well, then nothing will actually change in a  defense policy sense, because then there are no other  alternatives but military nonalignment and national defense, in  other words what we have now, and it would be quite logical to  continue on the same course after that.    [Korkkula] There has also been talk about Finland's possible  membership of NATO. Lt. Gen. Haegglund, will this matter be  topical while you are the commander of the Defense Forces?    [Haegglund] I do not have a crystal ball, so I cannot  predict  that.    [Korkkula] There has also been talk about the threat from  the  East in Finland, what do you think about this sort of talk?    [Haegglund] I think it is more or less nonsense. As far as I  understand there are quite a few internal problems and factors  in the East currently, and the trend there is withdrawal from  the West and not pushing into the West. This thinking is maybe  slightly outmoded.    [Korkkula] In the recent report on the EU commissioned by  the  government, it is said that Russia might sooner or later bring  Finland into its sphere of influence if Finland does not join  the EU, do you agree in this matter?    [Haegglund] What else could I do but agree with the  government while I am serving the government. [passage omitted]    [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, the Air Force is in  the  next few years going to take up a large part of procurement  appropriation in Finland; what other branches of defense should  especially be developed in Finland now?    [Haegglund] Well, the land and naval forces, we have no  branches of defense other than these three; these must be  developed in equal measure so that nothing is allowed to become  completely run down. At the moment, the emphasis is moving from  the land forces, which were developed recently, to the Air  Force, and that is quite correct because the Air Force would in  a few years be the weakest link in Finland's defense: The  fighter aircraft we have are getting old, and that would leave a  gap that would have to be filled, so it is now the Air Force's  turn.

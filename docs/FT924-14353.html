			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Economic, not just monetary, objectives must be defined Sir, The number of column inches dedicated to a commentary on the economy never ceases to amaze me. The cost to the Fleet Street 'enlightened' press must exceed all other budgets. Yet these commentaries say nothing in relation to identifying the real problems of the UK economy. Furthermore, if this is anyway representative of the advice give to government by its own advisers then it is no wonder that we are in the state we find ourselves. The simple fact is that we do not have an economic strategy; what we have is simply a monetary policy, nothing more, nothing less. There is no doubt that we need an economic strategy, but before we can define one we must look to our goals and objectives in relation to the short, medium and long term. Since, I assume, it is vital to have a successful manufacturing sector we must define relevant objectives. I would assume it is equally important to define the market areas in which we would like our manufacturing to be active - eg clothes pegs or aeroplanes. If we pursue this course then it is vital, for obvious reasons, that government and industry have close dialogue. Equally, since the banks are a vital player within the economy they must be involved in strategic decisions. Witness the creation of vast acres of worthless property assets in London alone. If we want a strong currency, and it is the declared objective of our prime minister, then we must first build a strong economy. The government's role is quite simple; it has been elected to lead and so it should pull industry and banking together, define an economic strategy and get the country moving.

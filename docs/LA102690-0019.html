Maples claims she was promised the cover, and she felt the story was cut in  half so the Cher story would fit. Vanity Fair Editor Tina Brown said she made  no promises: "We tried it as a cover. In light of the gulf crisis, we thought a  brunette was more appropriate."  </P> <P> Going Strong: James Michener says he plans to keep on writing five hours a day  while he spends his winters teaching. The author said Wednesday that he and his  wife, Mari, looked at 40 cities and towns before settling on Eckerd College in  St. Petersburg, Fla. Said Michener, 83: "A mere quiescent retirement is quite  often fatal . . . . I try to keep my mind active." The author of "Hawaii" and  "Centennial" said earlier this year he had written his last big book.  </P> <P> Sleep Rhythms: Comedian Jay Leno says he has become so good at his routine he  can do it in his sleep. "When I do two two-hour shows . . . I get into the  rhythm of the thing and I fall asleep on stage," Leno, a regular host on "The  Tonight Show," said in Playboy magazine. "I just plain go out for about 40  minutes and then come back in again and drift in and out."  </P> <P> Into the Records: A man who lost almost 700 pounds and the holder of a record  number of records were among the winners who gathered this week at the Guinness  World of Records, a museum in New York, to promote the 1991 edition of the  book.

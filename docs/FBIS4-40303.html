			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- A group of deputies from the  Liberal-Democratic Union "December 12th" walked out of the Duma  session on Wednesday, saying they will not attend house hearings  any more.    Speaking at a news conference, the deputies explained their  decision by the fact that on June 13 the Committee for the  Organisation of Work of the State Duma canceled the Union's  registration, saying that it did not provide the required 35  applications by the day of registration.    Union member Boris Fedorov denounced the move, describing it  as a provocation. He accused the Duma factions of the Liberal  Democratic Party and Russia's Choice of backstage intrigues in  order to get rid of the "wrong" deputies.    He also blamed Russia's Choice faction for actions aimed  against their own allies.    Irina Khokamada, another member of the Union, believes that  the decision has shown that the Duma is excessively politicised.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HUNTER, COOK ADVANCE TO SEMIFINAL ROUND OF STATE WRESTLING FINALS  </P> <P> Any good wrestler has to have goals, and Westlake High's Bill Hunter is a good  wrestler.  </P> <P> Hunter, a junior, came into this weekend's state wrestling championships at  University of the Pacific seeking to make a name for himself.  </P> <P> How's this one?: semifinalist.  </P> <P> Hunter defeated Al Martell of Mount Carmel on Friday in the quarterfinals of  the 175-pound weight class. Even Hunter was surprised after felling Martell,  who came into the state meet ranked No. 1 at 175 pounds.  </P> <P> "I had some high hopes coming into this thing," Hunter said. "But I really  wasn't shooting for this high."  </P> <P> The day did not begin quite as auspiciously for Hunter, who narrowly defeated  Overfelt's Richard Garcia, 4-3, in the first round. Hunter then buried  Monache's Ryan Land, 11-0, in the second round to set up his quarterfinal match  with Martell.  </P> <P> Hunter led throughout the quarterfinal match, opening the scoring on a takedown  in the first period.  </P> <P> "For some reason, I think he quit after that first takedown," Hunter said. "I  could feel it. I think he was even more surprised than me at what was  happening. He's probably never heard of me."  </P> <P> And probably won't soon forget.  </P> <P> The only other Valley-area wrestler to advance to the semifinals was Rob Cook  of Rio Mesa in the 132-pound division. Cook opened with a 12-point victory in  the first round, followed with a pin the second and scored a 6-1 victory over  North Bakersfield's Joe Cemo in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Two came close to advancing.  </P> <P> Chris Kilbane of Newbury Park was undone in the final 10 seconds of his  quarterfinal match against Eric Miklusicak in the 154-pound weight class.  Kilbane, who won his first two matches by a combined score of 26-6, trailed  virtually the entire match. He was behind, 7-3, late in the second period and,  9-6, midway through the third.  </P> <P> Kilbane rallied to take a brief 10-9 lead on a reversal with less than 20  seconds remaining. But Miklusicak quickly countered with a reversal of his own  and won the match, 11-10.  </P> <P> "I thought we had it," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "At worst I  thought it would go to overtime."  </P> <P> Another heartbreaking loss was incurred by Channel Islands' M. T. Merickel, who  was leading Vallejo's Dominic Boutan, 5-4, late in their 126-pound second-round  match when he was turned and pinned.  </P></p>

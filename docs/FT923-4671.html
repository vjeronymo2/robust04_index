			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Agnellis to sell off Moog for Dollars 355m COOPER Industries, the diversified US electrical products, tools and hardware, auto products and industrial equipment group, is to pay Dollars 355m in cash to buy Moog, the Agnelli family's US automotive parts business. The Texas-based Cooper, which has 54,000 employees and had a turnover of Dollars 6.2bn in 1991, is buying Moog from Ifint, the Luxembourg-based Agnelli family holding vehicle. A spokesman for Ifint said the total value of the transaction was Dollars 610m, consisting of the Dollars 355m in cash plus the assumption of Moog's debts. Cooper said the effect of the deal would be to increase its outstanding debt by Dollars 580m to Dollars 600m. The Ifint spokesman said the price being paid was equivalent to 26 per cent of the book value of the Agnelli family holding company's total assets. He said Moog last year contributed 10 per cent of Ifint's Dollars 240.5m of profits. Ifint gave no specific reason for the sale, other than to say it had owned Moog for 15 years and realised its value. 'It makes sense to sell,' the company spokesman said. Moog Automotive, based in St Louis, Missouri, is a leading manufacturer of automotive replacement parts for domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks. The company, which has 3,000 employees and 25 plants, manufactures a broad line of steering, suspension and temperature control products and also distributes a line of foreign replacement parts. Moog's revenues in 1991 were Dollars 476m. Cooper said Moog would become part of its automotive products division, which will be based in St Louis. This division includes Anco, Belden Automotive Wire and Cable, Champion Spark Plug and Champion Aviation. Ifint, which has a range of real estate, agriculture and industrial holdings in the US, operates from New York, Paris and Zurich. Cooper's share price fell by  1/2 to Dollars 47 yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: WAKING UP TO THE REALITY OF 'DREAM LOVERS': THERE REALLY AREN'T  ANY  </P> <P> He is the very essence of manhood. The perfect mate. Your dream lover. But  wait. There's more to him than meets the eye.  </P> <P> Dr. Judy Kuriansky, a prominent New York psychologist and adjunct professor at  New York University, says there are four types of dream lovers:  </P> <P> The Mystery Man. The Intellectual. The Powermonger. And the Operator.  </P> <P> "These men are figments of a woman's imagination," explains the author of "How  to Love a Nice Guy."  </P> <P> "He seems to embody all the qualities you are seeking; he can fix it, take care  of you, stimulate you."  </P> <P> But he is, alas, an illusion.  </P> <P> "Landing a dream guy doesn't mean your dreams will come true," Kuriansky warns.  He will appear to be perfect at first, she says, but when it comes to meeting  your real -- not fantasized -- romantic needs, he will invariably be lacking.  </P> <P> "The Mystery Man" works fast, is charming, a good conversationalist, intense,  even hypnotic. Start talking about skiing and before you can say "stem turn" he  has invited you for a weekend in Aspen.  </P> <P> It feels good being enveloped by him -- at first. But as soon as you are  dreaming of white picket fences, his interest wanes.  </P> <P> "This man is easily distracted," Kuriansky says. "Often a woman will invent  complex fantasies about what might be bothering him -- work pressures, ex-wife  problems."  </P> <P> Dates become less frequent, then he stops calling. When exasperated, you break  down and call him, hoping for an explanation. But you get his answering machine  instead. Or worse, a disconnected number.  </P> <P> "The Intellectual" often attracts a woman who secretly believes she isn't very  smart. "He has a kind of rumpled, academic sexiness, but is self-absorbed and  noncommunicative and frequently treats a woman as if she isn't there."  </P> <P> "The Powermonger" wants control of your life. He finds a perfect foil in the  woman who is weary of pulling in the reins on her life. "He puts her at ease  immediately," Kuriansky says. "He's reassuring, he takes the lead. Soon he's  not only helping her with her problem, he's choreographing her fashion  choices."  </P> <P> "The Operator" gives a woman the chance to feel powerful. "He is a leech, a  gigolo, a hanger-on," the psychologist says. He is often charming and on the  verge of "making it big."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he borrows your Mercedes.  </P> <P> "Dreams offer enticing visions of not only what we want in someone else but of  who we, often unconsciously, want to be," Kuriansky contends. "As you head  toward a new vision of yourself, you gain a clearer sense of the man you'll be  happy with."  </P></p>

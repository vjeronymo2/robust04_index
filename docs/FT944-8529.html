			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: No wriggling out of Pergau refund Sir, Your editorial, 'Utter contempt' (November 16), rightly condemned reports that the UK Treasury is considering ways to wriggle out of the High Court judgment that the decision to give Pounds 234m of aid to the Pergau dam was unlawful. The judges ordered the government to unravel the financial mess, and awarded the World Development Movement the right to return to the courts if the money is not returned in full to the aid budget. The refund of this money, illegally spent on an uneconomic project, would give a much-needed boost to an aid programme fully stretched to meet the stated objectives of tackling poverty and promoting development. The amount is, for example, twice as much as all British aid for water and sanitation for the past five years. It seems somewhat remiss that the foreign secretary, when faced with vigorous opposition from his aid department to this uniquely large project, did not take legal advice - especially since that possibility was considered internally. It is unforgivable that there should be any talk now of subverting the High Court's judgment. The law deserves a little more respect. And WDM, determined that justice shall be done, will not hesitate to return to the courts if necessary. Roger Briottat, director, World Development Movement, 25 Beehive Place, London SW9 7QR</p>

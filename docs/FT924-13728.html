			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Weak pound blamed as Wellcome shares flow back from US market THE NUMBER of Wellcome shares held in American Depositary Receipt form has fallen since the Pounds 2bn share sale in July. At October 9, 58.9m Wellcome shares were held in ADR form, 6.8 per cent of the group's share capital. The pharmaceutical company said that about another 3 per cent of the shares were held directly. In the share sale, when Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, sold 288m shares to cut its stake in the company from 73.5 per cent to 40 per cent, a total of 70m shares were allocated to the US market. Before the sale few of the company's shares were held in the US although the North American market is the largest contributor to Wellcome's profits. One of Wellcome's objectives in the sale was to increase the proportion of its shares held there. Advisers to the sale said that the flowback of shares was disappointing. They ascribed it to a general trend of selling pharmaceutical stocks by US investors and to the fall in sterling against the dollar which made UK shares less attractive to American holders. Wellcome's shares fell 9p to 954p yesterday, still well above the 800p sale price in sterling terms, but much closer to the Dollars 15 sale price in dollar terms.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will not take the  initiative in resuming the suspended inter-Korean dialogue as it  has already dropped its demand for an envoy exchange as a  precondition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with  Washington.    But if Pyongyang changes its mind and embraces inter-Korean  dialogue during its talks with Washington, Seoul will come to  the bargaining table with Pyongyang on condition that the  meeting should first discuss North Korea's nuclear program.    A government official said over the weekend that because the  South announced it would no longer seek to exchange special  presidential envoys with the North, Seoul would not be the first  to offer to resume the suspended dialogue with Pyongyang unless  the latter showed a change in attitude.    If there is firm evidence of a change in the North's  inter-Korean dialogue policy, the government will seek to resume  the talks on the principle of keeping open the dialogue channel  at all times, he added.    If the dialogue resumes, the agenda will focus on mutual  nuclear inspections between South and North Korea under the  declaration of denuclearization of the peninsula, with the  government seeking high-level talks or a joint nuclear control  commission meeting, he said.</p>

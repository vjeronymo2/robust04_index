			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: BT in joint transatlantic video service British Telecom has combined with four North American organisations to operate the first commercial transatlantic fibre-optic video service for broadcasters and production houses. The new company, Atlantic-Vision, will operate its service, using the recently completed cable, from early next year. A service is already available using satellite. When fully operational AtlanticVision will compete with satellite transmission of pictures across the Atlantic by professional users. The Vyvx, a subsidiary of WilTel, the US tele-communications company, and BT have entered an agreement with Teleglobe Canada, the international telecommunications group, to provide the television transmission links between the UK and the US. Links between the UK and Canada will be provided under a separate agreement between Stentor, an alliance of Canada's leading telephone companies, BT and Teleglobe. Charges will be Dollars 600 for 15 minutes and the new organisation claims that the undersea network will offer 'the fastest and most cost-effective secure link between North America and northern and eastern Europe'.</p>

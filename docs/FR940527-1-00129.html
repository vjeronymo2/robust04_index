			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The chart shows the causes of the decline in the rate-of-increase projections since the final rule for FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the chart shows, the decline in the rate of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections is due almost entirely to a decline in the rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of increase projections for Medicare inpatient capital. (As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the chart also shows, the rate of increase projections for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare enrollment, Medicare admissions incidence, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare admissions, have changed only marginally.) In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turn, the decline in the rate of increase projections for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare inpatient capital is the result of declines in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of increase projections for total inpatient capital and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare share. For FY 1993, the panel survey data that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use to develop the projected rate of increase for total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatient capital shows a decline in actual interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments compared to FY 1992. We believe that this decline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in interest payments is due to refinancing of debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments by hospitals to take advantage of lower interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. For FY 1994 and FY 1995, we are projecting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total inpatient capital cost increases will return to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level at which increases for depreciation costs alone have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been running (i.e., 7&hyph;8 percent) as the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refinancings declines. The projection of the rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in Medicare share for FY 1993 is similarly grounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in panel survey data. The panel survey data for that year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show that, contrary to our previous assumption, Medicare day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share has not been increasing in proportion to the increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Medicare admissions. We have accordingly reduced the FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 and FY 1995 rate of increase projections for Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share to account for that fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the decline in the rate of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates since the FY 1994 final rule, there has been a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slight (^0.54 percent) decrease in the FY 1992 cost per case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the December 1993 HCRIS data, compared to the June 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCRIS data that we used for FY 1994. The following chart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shows the combined effect of the reduced rates of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates and the reduced FY 1992 cost per case by comparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the projections from FY 1992 to FY 1995 at the time of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1994 final rule and in this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Economic blocs 'no threat to trade' The trend towards regional economic blocs was likely to accelerate during the 1990s, but there was no evidence that it had damaged the growth of world trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said yesterday, writes Guy de Jonquieres, Business Editor. 'The conclusion that the world is witnessing the creation of three inwardly-oriented 'trading blocs', based in North America, western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, is not supported by an analysis of trends in the patterns of world trade,' he said in a speech in Sao Paulo. Such groupings had had 'a negligible impact' on the structure of world trade, except in western Europe, where trade between European Union members had grown faster than with the rest of the world. But it was difficult to generalise from that example, because EU integration went far beyond trade. Furthermore, external trade had not changed much as a proportion of western Europe's GDP since the end of the war. Mr Sutherland said he was confident that regional integration would complement multilateral trade, provided Gatt members swiftly ratified the Uruguay Round trade agreement. He suggested, however, that the impact of regional blocs should be more thoroughly monitored by Gatt members. Since 1986, 25 preferential trade agreements have been notified to the Gatt.</p>

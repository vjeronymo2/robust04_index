			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Argentine national mint 'absolved' of forgery ARGENTINA'S national mint has never forged banknotes, watchdogs have concluded after a lightning investigation. Mr Jorge Pinzon, chief ombudsman, said yesterday that 'preliminary oral and documentary investigations' reassured him that there was 'no evidence to support claims that the mint printed fakes.' Last year, the central bank detected two sets of perfectly printed 'twin' banknotes with duplicate serial numbers. The twins were traced to the mint, which blamed faulty printing equipment, an explanation the central bank rejected. More sceptical observers believe mint employees may have been moonlighting as forgers to churn out additional, authentic-looking notes. The affair surfaced again this week after a newspaper obtained central bank letters complaining that if massive printing of fakes occurred, it would destroy confidence in the money supply. Mr Pinzon now says the twin notes were not released into circulation. They were caught and shredded on the spot. None the less, he promised to continue with his inquiries to establish how the duplicates, one set worth Dollars 50, the other Dollars 10, came to be printed and 'eliminate all doubts' over the quality of Argentina's money supply.</p>

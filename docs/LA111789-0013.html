			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFANT MORTALITY AND UNWED MOMS  </P> <P> Eberstadt's article certainly was revealing.  </P> <P> Since unplanned and unwanted pregnancies seem to account for high infant death  rates, what is gained by restricting a woman's right to an abortion? Certainly  it is insane to try to shut down family planning clinics (as our county  supervisors are doing), to restrict abortions for low-income women, or to  prohibit minors from using birth control devices.  </P> <P> If Eberstadt's article proves anything, it proves the need for birth control  and planned parenthood. We should discourage anyone from having a baby if she  or he is unwilling to care for the child. Our watchword should be "Responsible  parents only, please."  </P> <P> WILLIAM JOSEPH MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Double-digit rise for Wal-Mart in third quarter WAL-MART, the world's biggest retailer, grew even larger in the third quarter, as its expansion strategy paid off in a double-digit increases in sales and profits. The Arkansas-based discount-store operator posted net income of Dollars 518.7m in the three months to the end of October, an 18 per cent improvement on profits of Dollars 437.8m in the corresponding period of 1992. Earnings were 23 cents a share, compared with 19 cents, when adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split in February. Wal-Mart's sales performance was even more impressive. Revenues climbed 23 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn in the quarter, compared with Dollars 13.6bn a year earlier. Same-store sales - an important measure of retailing strength - showed an 8 per cent improvement, against 5 per cent through August. Wal-Mart continued to push into new markets, as part of a strategy that enables the company to offer 'everyday' low prices by maximising its buying power. In the third quarter, the company opened 56 new Wal-Mart stores (and closed two), expanded 11 others and opened 16 more Sam's Clubs, which offer deep discounts to members. The net addition of retail floor space was 10.9m sq ft. The company now operates a total of 1,989 Wal-Mart outlets and 326 Sam's Clubs. In addition, Wal-Mart is preparing to integrate 91 Pace warehouse clubs which last week it agreed to acquire from Kmart, the second biggest US retailer. The move, part of consolidation in the segment, serves to cement Wal-Mart's dominance. The results, which were in line with Wall Street's expectations, helped lift the share price by Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 in early trading. The Limited, the US specialty-store operator, showed signs of recovery in the third quarter, following a poor performance in the first half. Net income rose 2.8 per cent to Dollars 82.2m, on sales of Dollars 1.61bn, a 0.3 per cent uptick on the corresponding three months of 1992. Earnings per share were 23 cents, against 22 cents a year earlier. The company said several of women's clothing businesses continued to show weakness, but strong performances by Victoria's Secret, Express, Structure and other chains helped lift revenues. Overall, The Limited reported a 1 per cent gain in same-store sales.</p>

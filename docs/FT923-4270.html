			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Arts: Hecuba WRITTEN a decade earlier than his Trojan Women, Euripides' Hecuba is in story-terms a sequel to it - and even grimmer. Within the past 20 years, The Trojan Women has become almost a staple of modern-Ancient theatre, while Hecuba is known mainly by classicists. For the sake of the rediscovery, Laurence Boswell's fine production at the Gate is greatly welcome; but it has many virtues besides. The Trojan Women is a chain of laments and denunciations by the ladies of the fallen Trojan court (including Helen), about to be shipped off to Greek exile and slavery. In Hecuba, they and their captors have reached Thrace, where their ships are becalmed for a while - and where King Priam's widow expects to find her last surviving son Polydorus, sent long ago into safe asylum there. But we know from the start that he has been murdered by the 'friendly' King of Thrace, for his mud-stained shade (John Straiton) has risen from the underworld to tell us. This and other dreadful things remain for Hecuba to face, though she thinks her despair complete. Before the end, she contrives a ghastly retribution upon the King. A note by the translator Kenneth McLeish suggests that the tragedy does not fit Aristotle's famous formula (no o'er-reaching hubris here); but the more general rubric of 'pity and terror' holds good with a vengeance. McLeish's Englishing is pithy, sometimes modern-colloquial but never slangy, often planting single words like speaking wounds - PAIN] - but leaving room too for great formulaic howls. Translation into a tiny arena like The Gate has to be radical; Euripides wrote the agonised central role for a male actor (possibly himself) to deliver through a mask to an amphitheatre crowd of 14,000 strong. Here Ann Mitchell opts for tight-lipped, beady-eyed British control, broken by rare convulsive outbursts. It works. Since it matters that the treacherous Thracians should be deeply non-Greek, Boswell has cast them as black. That works too, and we get the bonus of Don Warrington's impeccable performance as the guilty King  - first suavely gracious, brought later to pitiable ruin. Every other role is strongly filled: Hecuba's doomed daughter Polyxena by Sara Mair-Thomas, a temporising Agamemnon from Sylvestor Morand, Christopher Robbie as the Greeks' doubt-free executive Talthybius. Kevork Melikyan's single appearance as Odysseus (classically, 'the wily. . .') leaves a potently dismaying impression: alert, unwinking intelligence without sympathy. Somehow Boswell has managed to deploy a cast of 25 in this unlikely space. It is no extravagance, for the dozen Trojan women - as distinct from the ladies - sing their choruses in as many as three parts with solos, in Mick Sands' astringently fresh settings: ethnic-flavoured (pipes and drums), dateless and economical, but laden with Affekt. Anyone about to stage an Ancient Greek play should enlist Sands at once. The costumes are an apt motley of plain robes, homespun tunics, eastern embroidery and shawls. If there is some influence from Declan Donnellan's celebrated production of Vega's Fuente Ovejuna, that is all to the good. The show takes less than an hour and three-quarters, without an interval. It is not 'popular entertainment'; but one is seldom so forcibly persuaded that a Greek reconstruction has hit the jugular vein of the scarifying original text. The Gate, Pembridge Road, London W11, until 3 October</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patients' complaint system criticised THE NATIONAL Health Service's system for handling complaints is attracting growing criticism, Mr William Reid, health service commissioner, told MPs yesterday. Mr Reid said nearly a fifth of patients' complaints investigated in the 1991-1992 financial year by the commissioner's team, which acts as an National Health Service watchdog, were about the service's procedure for complaints. Three quarters were upheld as valid. The total volume of complaints about the health service rose by 19 per cent in the 1991-1992 year, to 1,176 - the highest since the post of health commissioner was created. Although these cases predated the introduction of the government's patients' charter, which cited the improvement of the complaints procedure as one of its goals, Mr Reid said he was continuing to receive criticism about the new complaints system as well. Patients have said staff were rude or unhelpful, and that their inquiries had circulated back and forth between different offices, Mr Reid said. Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, insisted that measures were being taken to train medical staff to be more sympathetic and effective in dealing with complaints. Sir Duncan said: 'We are talking about changing attitudes and the culture of the system.' He admitted that in this respect the NHS 'still had a long way to go'. He added: 'I do not see there is a flaw in the system, but people are not operating the system to the standards that I wish.' Although the NHS is planning a league table showing how health authorities matched up to some aspects of the patients charter, their handling of complaints would not be compared in this way, Sir Duncan said.</p>

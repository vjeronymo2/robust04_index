			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Company news features a dull trading session - Market Report Prospects for interest rate rises in the US subdued the UK stock market yesterday, and it was left to trading statements from a handful of leading British companies to provide the day's features. An erratic session saw shares rallying at the close as an earlier sell programme, believed to be worth around Pounds 100m across the equity range, was cleared away. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,168.6 for a net loss of 3.3 points. The Footsie had been up by nearly 13 points and down by 17 points during the day, often led by stock index futures. Trading volume was higher than for some weeks, with the day's turnover through the Seaq network of 669.8m shares more than one-fifth above the previous session's total. Little attention was paid to the widening in the UK visible trade deficit for May. While aware that the trade deficit could prove a restraint on economic policy later this year, equity strategists do not yet see cause to worry. London continued to focus on the chances for a tightening in Federal Reserve credit policies in the wake of the US jobless statistics released last week, which will be followed towards the end of this week by data on retail sales and consumer and producer price indices. At the close, UK stocks were helped by reports of successful pre-auction trading in the Dollars 17.25bn of three-year Federal bonds to be sold yesterday in New York. Some analysts suggested that this week's auctions of around Dollars 40bn in US bonds may deter the Federal Reserve from taking action for the time being. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.65 up when London closed for the day. Confirmation that Commercial Union plans to partly fund the acquisition of Groupe Victoire, the insurance arm of Cie de Suez, by means of a rights issue was no surprise for the stock market - indeed, Pounds 322m was at the low end of expectations. Shares in Commercial Union remained strong as Cazenove, Hoare Govett and Strauss Turnbull Societe Generale commenced sub-underwriting the issue. Other blue chip stocks responding to trading news included General Accident and Barclays, the latter advancing sharply after disclosing first-half results well above the most optimistic expectations. However, the market was turned off in the afternoon by the sell programme, although the individual deals were mostly 'delayed deals' and therefore not fully identified until later in the session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been running more strongly than the FT-SE 100 over the past fortnight, also ground to a halt yesterday, closing 2.3 down at 3,726.4. Trading in second-line stocks remained busy, and made up some 60 per cent of the day's total Seaq volume. On Monday, retail activity in UK equities was worth Pounds 1.12bn, still a satisfactorily profitable level of business for the London securities industries, albeit at the low end of this year's daily averages. Some stocks with Far Eastern links strengthened towards the close of business when unsubstantiated rumours of a pending statement regarding plans to extend the Hong Kong airport began to filter through to London securities houses. Dealers hurriedly searched out stocks in the construction and building sectors which could benefit from such a development. Traders drew heart from the UK stock market's success in holding steady yesterday in the face of falls in long-dated British government bonds. This is a quiet week for UK economic statistics, but markets are expected to react sharply to any sign that the UK authorities have become more bearish on inflation prospects. However, the UK equity market is generally hopeful that the widely expected rise in base rates can be postponed until later in the year.</p>

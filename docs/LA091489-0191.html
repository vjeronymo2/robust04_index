			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JURY FINDS 2 GUILTY IN ABORTION PROTEST; JAIL TERM AN OPTION  </P> <P> Two anti-abortion activists described by prosecutors as leaders in two April  clinic blockades in San Diego were found guilty Wednesday of conspiring to  organize the protests and seven other misdemeanor criminal charges.  </P> <P> A San Diego Municipal Court jury convicted Constance V. Youngkin, 41, of San  Diego, and Frank B. Smith, 56, of Oceanside, in connection with the April 8 and  April 29 demonstrations. They were the first among seven activists, all facing  conspiracy charges, whom prosecutors had alleged in court papers "assumed  active leadership roles" in the protests.  </P> <P> Youngkin and Smith remained free on their own recognizance, pending sentencing,  which San Diego Municipal Court Judge John M. Thompson set for Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sentencing Options  </P> <P> Thompson said Youngkin and Smith should be ready Friday to indicate which of  three sentencing options each preferred -- a 45-day jail term, 60 days of  public-service work such as highway trash detail or probation, likely for three  years, a condition of which would be to avoid other anti-abortion protests.  </P> <P> Smith, a pastor, said he wanted to write about anti-abortion activities, "so  I'm going to sharpen my pencils and go to jail."  </P> <P> His attorney, Greg Anthony of Los Angeles, said, "It's his decision. I can't  make it for him."  </P> <P> Youngkin did not discuss her sentencing options. "I have one comment," she  said. "If it's criminal to protect women from being exploited and to rescue  babies from death, then I am a criminal."  </P> <P> Youngkin also faces a contempt hearing Friday stemming from a speech when the  trial opened about topics Thompson had barred, including allegations of  excessive police force during arrests at the demonstrations and the necessity  of the protests to save babies, said Peter Hughes, the deputy city attorney who  prosecuted both cases.  </P> <P> The jury convicted Youngkin and Smith of conspiring to organize, and aiding and  abetting, the April 8 San Diego protest. It also found them guilty, in  connection with both the April 8 and 29 demonstrations, of trespassing, failing  to disperse and disobeying a court order.  </P> <P> That order was a statewide injunction issued in March by U.S. District Judge A.  Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles. It barred the activists, many affiliated with  the group Operation Rescue, from blockading clinics.  </P> <P> Jury selection in the case began Aug. 24. The lawyers presented their closing  arguments Monday, and the jury got the case Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sending a Message  </P> <P> Hughes said he would ask Thompson to impose "substantial" jail time for both  Youngkin and Smith.  </P> <P> "They knew about the federal injunction. That didn't stop them," he said. "They  were arrested on the 8th. That didn't slow them down. They were arrested on the  29th. That didn't stop them.  </P> <P> "We think the only way to send a message is some custody."  </P> <P> Hughes' supervisor, James M. Bishop, head deputy city attorney, said the  verdict was not surprising. "We expected this all along," he said.  </P> <P> The verdict was expected to boost the morale of prosecutors, who, beginning  Sept. 25, will try four more of the seven alleged leaders, Hughes said.  </P> <P> Those four are Dean Mesa, 30, of Vista; Joseph L. Foreman, 34, of Long Beach;  Terry Macrae, 32, of Santee and Chet E. Gallagher, 39, of Las Vegas, Hughes  said.  </P> <P> In all, 134 anti-abortion activists arrested at the protests April 8 and 29 and  at another demonstration June 10 face misdemeanor charges, prosecutors have  said. The Youngkin and Smith case was the first in what Thompson said at  hearings in August will be a series of trials that will run one after another  and probably will last a year.  </P> <P> Originally, eight protesters faced conspiracy charges. William R. Lehman, 29,  of Vista, who disavowed any affiliation with Operation Rescue, pleaded no  contest Aug. 24 in San Diego Municipal Court to violating the Tashima order. In  exchange, the city attorney's office dropped the conspiracy charge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspended Sentence  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Gale E. Kaneshiro imposed a suspended 90-day jail sentence, put  Lehman on three years' probation and ordered him not to take part in other  blockades. Lehman also was ordered to complete 180 hours of community service.  </P> <P> Lehman, Youngkin and Foreman were among 12 activists Tashima held in contempt  Aug. 29 for violating the statewide injunction, in part from the April 8  demonstration.  </P> <P> Tashima levied $10,000 fines against each of the activists but suspended them,  saying they will be reimposed if the activists again violate court orders  preventing clinic blockades.  </P> <P> The judge also ordered the activists to pay various amounts in attorneys' fees  to the American Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers for costs incurred in  bringing the contempt action on behalf of groups such as Planned Parenthood of  San Diego and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The judge ordered Youngkin to pay $12,000 in attorneys' fees to the San Diego  chapter of the ACLU.  </P> <P> Smith was not involved in Tashima's Aug. 29 ruling.  </P></p>

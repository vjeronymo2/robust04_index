			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL REJECTS STIFF CURBS ON CONTENT OF ADS FOR CIGARETTES  </P> <P> Responding to intense opposition by tobacco and advertising interests, a key  congressional subcommittee voted Tuesday to kill proposals by anti-smoking  advocates to impose sweeping new restrictions on cigarette promotional  campaigns.  </P> <P> However, the panel approved a measure that would dramatically increase the  prominence of warning labels on cigarette packages and billboards, ban sales to  minors nationwide and restrict sales from vending machines and distribution of  free samples.  </P> <P> But proponents said it appeared unlikely that further action would be taken on  the bill this year unless Congress reconvenes after the November election. The  poor prospects reflect a failed behind-the-scenes effort to reach a compromise  between the $40-billion-a-year tobacco industry and its congressional foes.  </P> <P> After an often-acrimonious debate, the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee  on health and the environment voted 13 to 9 to quash a proposal to bar the use  of human or cartoon figures in cigarette advertising. The measure would have  allowed only "tombstone" ads -- written text with no illustration other than a  picture of the cigarette brand.  </P> <P> That was the most far-reaching provision of the Tobacco Control and Health  Protection Act of 1990, a compendium of anti-smoking measures sponsored by Rep.  Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the subcommittee chairman. The provisions are  intended to halt the marketing and sale of cigarettes to young people, 3,000 of  whom begin smoking each day.  </P> <P> Waxman and his allies maintained that limitations should be imposed on the  industry's $3-billion annual advertising effort, particularly ads that portray  smoking as sexy, sophisticated and linked to success. Opponents, led by Rep.  Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), said such curbs would be an unconstitutional  infringement of free speech.  </P> <P> The tobacco industry was joined by advertisers, billboard companies and  newspaper and magazine publishers in lobbying to bury the "tombstone" proposal.  </P> <P> Waxman's entire bill, in fact, was rejected Tuesday in favor of a measure  introduced by Rep. Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.), another anti-smoking leader, as a  compromise. In addition to deleting the "tombstone" restriction, Whittaker's  alternative dropped a proposed ban on tobacco company sponsorship of sporting  events and public entertainment.  </P> <P> The new measure would require that warning labels cover an entire side of a  cigarette package, double the current size of warnings on billboards, prohibit  sales from vending machines accessible to minors without adult supervision and  ban distribution of free samples on streets, sidewalks, public parks or through  the mail.  </P></p>

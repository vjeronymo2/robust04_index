			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / US rice makes Tokyo debut Shoppers crowded yesterday around a pile of packed Californian rice at a Tokyo supermarket (pictured above) as US rice went on sale for the first time at big supermarkets in Japan on a trial basis. The American rice was being sold for Y1,850 (Pounds 11.78) per 5kg pack, about 10 per cent cheaper than Japanese rice. The import of foreign rice has been a serious political issue in Japan, provoking protests from farmers. Japan's refusal to import rice has also been a point of contention between the US and Japan in the context of the Gatt Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation negotiations. It reached the point where the round, which was largely completed after more than seven years of talks, might have come to a halt over the rice imports. However, to a great extent Tokyo's hand has been forced by a poor harvest last year, which according to estimates by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture fell by about 25 per cent to 9.7m tonnes. Japan announced in September that typhoons and a cold summer would force it to import at least 1m tonnes. The international rice industry has since estimated that it might be in the market for up to 3m tonnes. Japan's entry to the rice import market has triggered a near doubling in international prices since September.</p>

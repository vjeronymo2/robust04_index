			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Vardon moves into bingo with Pounds 9m buys VARDON, the acquisitive leisure company which owns the London Dungeon, is moving into bingo with the purchase of 12 clubs for up to Pounds 9m. Vardon, which was listed last October, will fund the acquisitions through a placing and open offer at 72p a share to raise Pounds 13.5m. The shares added 1p to 79p. Mr Nick Irens, chief executive, said bingo would broaden Vardon's base away from seasonal businesses. As well as the London and York Dungeons, Vardon also owns Sea Life Centres and a seal sanctuary, all of which rely on summer turnover. He added that there were also growth opportunities as new, edge-of-town sites were developed to compete with existing facilities. The extra money raised in the placing would be used to build new clubs. Vardon is buying Ritz, a private company which owns three clubs and is about to open a fourth, and Lion Leisure, a subsidiary of Wembley, which operates seven clubs. Both companies were profitable in their latest financial year. The open offer, underwritten by SG Warburg, is on a 2-for-5 basis. Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund, one of Vardon's largest shareholders, has sold its 12.5 per cent stake, which was placed by Warburg. Mr David Hudd, Vardon's chairman, said Causeway invested in Vardon at 45p and had decided to take its profits.</p>

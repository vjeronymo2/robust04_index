			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 1 Feb (EFE) -- In a joint declaration,  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Paraguayan President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy expressed here their decision to give "a  renewed, vigorous" boost to their countries' bilateral ties.    The declaration reiterates the traditional friendship  existing between Paraguay and Peru and outlines their decision  to strengthen cooperation and their political, economic, and  cultural ties.    The two presidents signed the document at the Golden Hall of  Government Palace in Lima in the evening of 31 January, on the  first day of Wasmosy's two-day official visit to Peru. This is  the first visit by a Paraguayan head of state to Peru.    The declaration firmly condemns terrorism, which it  characterizes as a systematic and deliberate form of violating  human rights that poses a threat to the stability of the  democratic system.    The two presidents state that they are committed to  implementing a policy that will improve the standard of living  of their people, especially those in low-income groups.    In their declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy reaffirm that  socioeconomic development must go hand in hand with the  preservation and rational use of natural resources through a  mechanism designed to protect and preserve the environment.  They also express their support for efforts to consolidate  integration processes in the region.    They also state that it is their common objective to  gradually build "a great zonal and continental market" in which  the Paraguayan and Peruvian economies would interact  "dynamically and in a balanced fashion."    They also vow to promote negotiations with a view to  building  a highway that would link Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay,  with the Peruvian cities of Ilo and Matarani.    The two presidents convey their "deep concern" over the  steady rise in the drug trade and the unlawful consumption of  narcotics.    Prior to signing the joint declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy  signed agreements designed to fight the drug trade and the  unlawful consumption of narcotics, to promote and give mutual  protection to investments, and to promote cooperation between  the diplomatic academies of the two countries. They also signed  a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation between  the two foreign ministries.    During day one of his visit, Wasmosy was received in the  Peruvian Congress and declared an "illustrious guest" by the  Lima city government.    Today, 1 February, Wasmosy will visit an exposition of  Paraguayan handicraft and, accompanied by his Peruvian  counterpart, will dedicate a school bearing the name of "Colonel  Jose Felix Bogado," a Paraguayan citizen who took part in the  expedition to liberate Peru led by General Jose de San Martin.    Wasmosy will first decorate Fujimori with the Francisco  Solano Lopez National Order of Merit and then will host a  reception in his honor.</p>

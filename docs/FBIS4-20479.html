			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article provided by the ``Basic Science Research Express''] </F>   [Excerpts] In 1993, Chinese researchers scored significant  achievements in biological sciences:    1) Dr. Tang Jianguo and other researchers at Beijing  University developed a genetic engineering human insulin with  similar constituents and biological functions to natural  insulin, by directly expressing the encoded pro-gene of human  insulin in E. coli. The method is believed to be more  cost-effective and more productive than the conventional methods  using E. coli system and yeast system.    2) Ten new proteins were designed and synthesized by  researchers at the Department of Chemistry of Beijing  University. First the researchers designed and synthesized 10  templates of these peptides including polypeptide segments  having completely new sequences, branch-shaped hexopeptides,  linear dodecapeptides, and cyclic dodecapeptides. The templates  were then used to synthesize six new tetraspiral proteins  containing 54, 60, 70, and 76 amino acid residues respectively.  All proteins synthesized in this laboratory are not naturally  found.    3) The CAS Institute of Biophysics launched a project on  ``Three Dimensional Structure and Functions Research of  Phycoerythrin,'' and successfully obtained the 5 Angstroms  resolution structure of phycoerythrin crystal. It is the protein  research project on third large protein conducted by Chinese  researchers using multi-paired isomorphism replacement method  following insulin and trichosanthes protein research. Research  work on phycoerythrin structure is believed to be much harder,  because of large molecular weight of phycoerythrin (260,000  Dalton), which is about 45 times of insulin molecule and 10  times of trichosanthes molecule.    4) Dr. Lu Fengmin at the Harbin Medical University developed  a new method to research anticancer gene to stop the spread of  cancer cells. Dr. Lu creatively uses anti-sense technique to  research the first Chinese-isolated and cloned P[.sup]14-6[/]  cDNA, and constructs the first P[.sup]14-6[/] cDNA antisense  RNA clone. Through transfection, antisense RNA can cleverly  block the expression of homologous genes in cells and stop the  homologous genes' biological activity, which in turn inhibits  transformation of normal cells into malignant cells.</p>

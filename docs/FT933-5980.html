			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / LWT's millionaires asked to pass the hat round THE NEW millionaires of London Weekend Television have been asked to pass the hat round for their less fortunate colleagues. Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of the London ITV company, has asked 52 other managers who have together netted shares worth Pounds 70m in a controversial management share scheme to donate voluntarily a proportion of their profits for distribution to the other 700 LWT employees. Mr Dyke, who yesterday sold 211,000 of his total of just under 1.5m shares worth nearly Pounds 7m, has written to his managerial colleagues pointing out how fortunate they have been and asking for donations. Mr Dyke has suggested that amounts ranging from 4p a share for modest managerial beneficiaries to 14p a share for those in the millionaire class, be offered. If all 53 managers respond to Mr Dyke's suggestion it would raise a total of Pounds 1.556m or 2.2 per cent of the total for distribution to employees not invited to take part in the management share scheme. More than 550 LWT employees signed a petition calling for a proportion of the profits to go to them. The petition was never handed in after an informal warning that this would jeopardise any chance of staff being given a share. One of the 52 who received the confidential letter from Mr Dyke said: 'It's a good idea at the end of the day but I'm not sure everybody is over the moon about it.' The proposal has the support of both Mr Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman who would donate shares worth Pounds 250,000 out of his total worth more than Pounds 9m. Other leading beneficiaries such as arts controller Melvyn Bragg have been sounded out about the scheme. The LWT managers together put up Pounds 3m to buy management shares as part of a company restructuring. After it retained its broadcasting licence and cut costs, a four-for-one share issue was triggered by the ITV company's share price staying above 278p for the 20 days since the company reported its half-year financial results on July 29. The average price over the period turned out to be 470.4p. Yesterday a total of 3.9m shares were sold by the managers at 458p, equivalent to 3.78 per cent of the ordinary shares. The LWT share price closed yesterday at 465p. Lex, Page 18 London stocks, Page 36</p>

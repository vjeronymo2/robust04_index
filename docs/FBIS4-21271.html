			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast] </F>   [Text] Colombia is not a corrupt country and its  presidential candidates do not have links to the mafia, the  Colombian Government and political circles said when they  rejected charges in this regard by the U.S. Congress.    In general terms we are a clean country and that is why we  reject such slander, Colombian Ambassador in Washington Gabriel  Silva said. We will not remain indifferent nor will we allow  these charges to prosper. Many innocent persons have died and  we are not going to trample on their memories, he said.    The government expressed its concern and disagreement with  the accusation that the entire country is corrupt and that the  presidential candidates receive support from the mafia.  According to the U.S. Congress, this accusation is based on  confessions by former Medellin Cartel member Gabriel Taboada.    The ambassador described those hearings and the statements  by  the drug trafficker -- who is a witness for Senator Kerry -- as  inadmissible. He also lamented that all of this has weakened  the war on drugs. Ambassador Silva said the accusations by this  convict are an affront to the families of thousands of brave  Colombians who have lost their lives in this war on the mafias.  He said the mere use of Taboada is a clear sign of how  Congress' watchdog function has been sidetracked, something that  will affect our capacity to learn about the reality of the war  on drugs. Apparently the only firsthand information this drug  trafficker has goes back to the mid-1980's, but he was  nevertheless allowed to question the integrity of an entire  country, which is known in the whole world as a leader in the  struggle against drugs, Ambassador Gabriel Silva said.</p>

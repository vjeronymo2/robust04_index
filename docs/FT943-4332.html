			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / People: BTR talks about its next generation Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, regrets that yesterday's concern over pressure on the industrial conglomerate's profit margins may have overshadowed what he describes as a 'very significant' trio of appointments to the group's main board. Jackson, an Australian, is 58 - as in a few days will be his American chief operating officer, Bob Faircloth. Group policy is that executives retire at 62, so although the succession is not an immediate issue, Jackson says it is important for BTR to bring on the 'next generation'. The three new executive directors are Chris Burns, a 51-year-old Englishman; Paul Buysse, 49, who is Belgian; and John Thompson, a 47-year-old American. Burns joined BTR in 1991 through the group's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of Hawker Siddeley, where he was director of the aerospace division. His responsibilities have expanded and he is now one of the group's regional chief executives, overseeing businesses which include batteries, aerospace, valves and construction. Buysse, who speaks several European languages, joined BTR in 1988 as group managing director of Hansen Transmission International. He became a regional chief executive in February and has responsibility for businesses such as Brook Hansen Motors and Dunlop Slazenger. Thompson joined BTR in 1976 through the acquisition of Stowe Woodward Industries. As a regional chief executive, his groups are predominantly US-based and include paper technology, US motors, meters and control systems and the manufacturer Rexnord. Faircloth says he worked closely with Thompson in the US over the past 10 years and describes Burns as a great strategic and lateral thinker. Jackson says he is delighted that in Buysse, BTR has finally got a non-Anglo Saxon on its board.</p>

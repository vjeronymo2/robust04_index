			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: JERUSALEM;  </P> <P> POLITICAL SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> Israeli politicians are approaching a make-or-break point in their attempts to  form a new government. Thursday is the deadline that President Chaim Herzog has  given Labor Party leader Shimon Peres to find the 61 votes he needs to build a  majority in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament.  </P> <P> The preceding week was marked by a frenzied round of deal-making and -breaking,  death threats and a tear-gas grenade attack on a religious party's meeting  site.  </P> <P> If Peres succeeds, Israel is expected to move toward talks with Palestinians.  If not, Herzog may allow caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir another shot  at forming a government -- and the deal-making will begin anew.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain Oleksandr Dranikov, NARODNA ARMIYA </F> correspondent, under the rubric "They Serve the People of  Ukraine": "If Need Be, We Will Accept Both the `Shuttle' and  `Buran' -- Say the Men from the X Aviation Equipment Command"]    [Text] We had heard of the airfield located near the small  Ukrainian town of Tokmak while still in the Western Troop  Grouping. Nearly four years ago, there were plans to transfer  one of the aviation regiments of the Western Troop Grouping to  Tokmak. The pilots who had flown reconnaisance in Ukraine gave  high praise to both the airfield and the people serving there.  And why not? It is located in the beautiful steppes of Tauria.  The runway is wonderfully suited to any type of airplane. The  airfield has everything that an aviation unit needs: Parking  areas for the planes, the necessary communications facilities,  and modern equipment. In short, the aviators of the Western  Troop Grouping would have been only too glad to serve there.  Unfortunately, however, this was not meant to be. What ensued  was a flaunting of sovereignties, as it was then called, and the  aviation regiment flew off under the Russian flag to Kursk  Oblast.    Meanwhile, the Tokmak airfield continued its quiet,  provincial existence. But not for long. A storm was moving in  from the Black Sea, even though Tokmak is some distance away. At  any moment, the Sevastopol clouds were threatening to explode in  thunder and lightning...    By now, the reader has probably figured out that the  aviation  equipment command [aviatsiyno-tekhnichna komendatura] has no  connection with the customary duties of military service. There  is also no military police unit [hauptvakhta] for offending  airplanes. The job of the aviation equipment command is to do  what needs to be done to make possible distant flights by  individual airplanes or groups of airplanes. That was also the  job of the personnel of the airfield--servicing the aircraft of  the Black Sea Fleet. They were subordinated, accordingly, to the  command of the Black Sea Fleet, and they tried to serve in a  manner that would not bring dishonor to the naval uniform. And  they succeeded. There were no complaints from the Black Sea  Fleet command--but only up to a given moment.    After Ukraine became an independent state, the personnel of  the aviation equipment command held a general meeting at which  they decided to take the Military Oath of Loyalty to the people  of Ukraine.    Incidentally, this was the second unit in the Black Sea  Fleet, after the battalion of marines, to hoist the  yellow-and-blue flag... This raising of the flag, however, was  only a symbolic action, inasmuch as the unit had taken the  Ukrainian oath three days before the State Flag of Ukraine was  approved.    This action did not get a great deal of publicity--after  all,  all sorts of things were then happening in the provinces. But  the response from Sevastopol was lightning swift. The then  Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Igor Kasatonov, proclaimed the  Commander of the unit, Viktor Petrovskyy, all but a criminal and  ordered him to be dismissed from his job and arrested.    Shortly after this, the unit was visited by a Commission,  headed by Major-General Borys Shevchenko, Chief of Rear Services  of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force. A campaign was launched to  persuade the unit to renounce its Ukrainian oath. But the  servicemen of the Aviation Equipment Command remained steadfast.  Then came the threats. When this also failed to produce results,  an order was issued to hand over all the existing equipment to  the main aviation base of the Black Sea Fleet. This involved no  more and no less than 179 special motor vehicles. Warrant  Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, who was responsible for the  vehicles, refused to carry out the order. Major Viktor Petrenko  also regarded this order to be illegal. And so they managed to  keep the equipment. But the Black Sea specialists would not have  been rear-service personnel had they left empty-handed. Failing  to get the equipment, they promptly began to haggle... over the  production of the subsidiary plot. And they succeeded in leaving  with 70 hogs, 10 cows, more than 200 rams, and a couple hundred  chickens. If it weren't so sad, it would be funny, as they say.    After taking everything they could take, the Black Sea Fleet  command progressively began to reduce all deliveries of supplies  to the airfield. There was chaos at the top, but it was not the  staff officials who suffered. This ambiguity--although the  aviation command [aviakomendatura] had taken the Ukrainian oath,  it was still subordinated to the Black Sea Fleet--produced all  sorts of oddities. The story of the handing over of the grunting  and mooing livestock pales in comparison with the incident  involving the missiles that followed. Yes, you read it right,  air-to-air missiles.    It so happened that the fighter aviation regiment that was  then stationed in Zaporizhzhya had given the unit commanded by  Major Petrovskyy 83 missiles for safekeeping. Shortly  thereafter, the aviation regiment was transferred to Kazakhstan,  and the responsible officials simply forgot about the missiles.  The Major spent two years corresponding with various staffs  before he found the owners of the missiles. For two years, the  unit diligently looked after the missiles, while military  officials of various ranks literally kicked around Petrovskyy's  request from office to office and from republic to republic.    ...Today, as we sat in a sheltered command post, Major  Viktor  Petrovskyy and his Deputy for Educational and  Social-psychological Work, Senior Lieutenant Vasyl Romanenko,  laughed as they told this story. But how much civic courage did  Petrovskyy need to hold out then, at the dawn of the formation  of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? Viktor Mykolayovych had many  years of service behind him at a nuclear testing range in Novaya  Zemlya. But here, on the mainland, as it were, he had neither  picket, nor yard [i.e. nothing]. How would he and his family  have managed if he had been thrown overboard from his unit in  the Black Sea Fleet? Where would he have been able to turn had  this happened? To his old parents in a village near Kryvyy Rih?  This does not even bear thinking about...    A little over a year and a half ago, the tribulations of the  aviation personnel in the small Ukrainian town finally came to  an end. At the request of the commander of the unit, the  aviation equipment command was made part of the 5th Army of the  Ukrainian Air Force. And what did the "wings of the Fatherland"  get (and not only they) by taking in the Black Sea Fleet's  "foundling"? In addition to a wonderful airfield, a large amount  of needed supplies that are in critically short supply. Here are  but two figures. The "ownerless" missiles were not the only  thing that the unit managed to keep. For example, of the 35  metric tons of fuel used by the 5th Army for flights in 1993, 6  metric tons came from the storage tanks at the Tokmak airfield.  Major Petrovskyy's subordinates also helped the young Ukrainian  fleet. More than 2,000 full sets of naval issue clothing were  handed over to the Ukrainian Navy.    Even though we do not serve our Fatherland to grow rich,  still, what did the aviators get in return? And here we have  some interesting numbers. In the last five years, for its 34  officers and warrant officers, the unit received 14 apartments,  nine of which were occupied by their new owners in 1993. For the  sake of comparison: Between 1954 and 1989, the unit was assigned  only nine apartments. While not all the officers have yet  received apartments, all those who wanted a household plot got  one.    It should be noted that the success in solving questions  involving the social welfare of the servicemen is due to the  active support of the city authorities. Yevhen Karban, the mayor  of Tokmak, has done a great deal for the servicemen. They came  to him with a whole variety of requests, and he always showed  understanding for their needs and did everything in his power to  help them. This year, the city is prepared to give the unit four  to five apartments (this means that the housing problem will be  removed from the agenda for the next few years). Obviously, on  condition that the Ministry of Defense contributes its share to  the construction of this housing. I should note that the prices  at which the city is offering the military the apartments are  more than reasonable.    Small wonder that the prestige of serving in the military  under these conditions is not falling in the unit but rising!  Just before I visited the unit, a Certification Commission met  on selecting candidates for contract military service. There  were three to four applicants for each vacant private's or  sergeant's post.    Solving the question of contract servicemen is of great help  to the airfield. Judge for yourselves: The 34 officers and  warrant officers and 20 term servicemen are responsible for 179  motor vehicles, 150 of which are in their safekeeping, and 418  hectares of land housing more than 30 objects and communications  facilities [obyekty and komunikatsiyi]. Thus, every member of  the collective has to do his own job and the next man's, as they  say.    For example, Warrant Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, whom we  mentioned earlier, is simultaneously the chief of the weather  station and responsible for the equipment being looked after by  the unit. Warrant Officer Petro Nayden holds three jobs  simultaneously--he is in charge of PPM, the munitions supply  warehouse, and unit's chemical service. Fortunately, guard duty  in the unit is performed by militarized security forces  [voyenizovana okhorona]. The servicemen guard only two of eight  posts.    Still, none of the servicemen complain about their lot. They  work hard and wait for those in the higher staff to finally  listen to what they think. The thing is that for the last two  years, the unit commander has submitted numerous proposals  regarding improving the unit's organizational and staff  structure. So far, there has been neither welcome nor farewell,  as the saying goes. This is the only problem that the collective  cannot resolve on its own.    For example, the problem of heating both living quarters and  office premises seemed much more complicated, but they solved  it! It had been decided at the outset that the unit would get  its heat from a boiler that uses oil fuel. The problems with oil  fuel are well known. Still, the servicemen did not give up.  Thank God, there is no shortage in the unit of sensible people  who are jacks of all trades. They reduced the space they used,  closed down some of their facilities, and put electric boilers  heated by water in others. Once again, with the help and support  of the city authorities and local industrial enterprises...    I was about to leave the aviation equipment command on a  gloomy February morning. Major Petrovskyy was handing out  assignments for the day. His somewhat hoarse voice could be  heard quite well near the headquarters. As usual, there were  more jobs than people. Nonetheless, the staff orderly  [dnyuvalnyy shtabu], Private Vitaliy Malyshev, who could also  hear everything the major was saying, said with a smile on his  face:    "There are only a few of us, but we wear sailors' T-shirts  [i.e., we can do anything]. If need be, we'll accept both the  Shuttle and Buran."    I am convinced that his joke contains a lion's share of  truth.</p>

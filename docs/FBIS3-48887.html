			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katsunobu Shiihashi, chief, MAINICHI SHIMBUN </F> Public Opinion Survey Section: "Agriculture-Faction Diet Members  Driven Into a Tight Corner"]    [Text] The formation of a nonpartisan Diet-member league,  which Diet members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who oppose opening  the rice market had scheduled for 20 October, was put off  suddenly in response to adverse reaction from Komeito, the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and so on. The adverse  reaction derived from a sense of alarm about "LDP-SDPJ  cooperation," and although it is said to be the biggest urgent  task to the Hosokawa government, it ended up exposing disarray  within the coalition government parties. But what is attracting  attention is the point that the question of opening the rice  market is being discussed on the same level as the question of  election system reform.  <H5>  The Connection to Reform of the Election System </H5>   A Komeito executive who was an active leader in smashing the  Diet-member league said "the hardline faction opposing opening  the rice market is apt to overlap the faction that is opposed to  reform of the election system," and there has also arisen in  some quarters speculation that "there may be a secret agreement  between the LDP and the SDPJ on the question of opening the rice  market and crushing reform of the election system."    To the Hosokawa cabinet, opening the rice market has become  a  big task, along with reform of the election system that would  introduce in the lower house a system which combines single-seat  electoral districts and proportional representation, and the  problem of reducing income tax and increasing the consumption  tax rate. Whichever one you take, it is a hurdle that could  easily prove fatal to the cabinet, depending on how it is dealt  with.    The opening of the rice market and election-system reform,  in  particular, have been spoken of as being linked, as in, for  example, "it is a means for the conservative parties, which want  to ease the problem of economic friction with the United States,  to shift their base of support from the agriculture sector to  the urban sector; former prime minister Nakasone's `86 system'  can be ranked as something on the same line."    It has become clear that, in regard to the question of  opening the rice market, which has become the focal point of the  new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan and  the United States have secretly reached agreement on a policy in  which the Japanese Government would establish a six-year grace  period and accept tariffication of rice. It is said that during  the grace period there would be a course of Japan accepting  minimum access (minimum volume of imports), and that the volume  of imports would be adjusted between a minimum of 3 percent of  domestic consumption to a maximum of 8 percent.    The Japanese Government is denying this. There is also a  policy agreement of the coalition governing parties to the  effect that "we oppose opening the rice market by  tariffication," so it seems that they will not be able to shift  all that easily, but it is certain that the question of opening  the rice market is about to reach the crucial point. There is  also the view that agreement will be reached between Japan and  the United States in the not-too-distant future.    Concerning this plan to "accept tariffication of rice after  six years," Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa  said in mid-October, "It is probably not saying that Japan will  tariff rice right away. It does not contradict to that extent  the policy agreement among the coalition government parties; if  the government explains it properly, the government parties may  also be able to understand."    Even looking at the results of recent public opinion polls,  opposition to opening the rice market has been declining  gradually. According to a MAINICHI SHIMBUN poll, opposition to  opening the rice market continues to decline, with 45 percent in  December 1988, 36 percent in April 1990, 33 percent in December  1990, and 27 percent in December 1991; conversely, opinion for  partial opening has risen. The opinion for partial opening of  the rice market is becoming a great ground swell.    The "League of Diet Members Opposed to Tariffication of  Rice," which was centered on the LDP and the SDPJ, was created  in response to this kind of movement and climate, with a nucleus  of so-called rice Dietmen such as lower house member Shizuka  Kamei in the LDP and lower house member Takeshi Takeuchi in the  SDPJ. Komeito and others attacked at a meeting of the Board of  Governors of the coalition government parties which was held  immediately before the league was to be formed, because of their  judgment that they did not want to leave live embers within the  coalition government parties because of the problem of opening  the rice market, and because there was a danger that opposition  to tariffication of rice would link with opposition to a system  that combined single-seat election districts with proportional  representation, because the number of urban-sector Diet members  would increase more than those of the agriculture sector if such  a system were introduced.    At the time of the LDP's Toshiki Kaifu cabinet, agricultural  organizations reacted against a system that combined single-seat  election districts and proportional representation, saying that  opening the rice market and a system that combined single-seat  election districts with proportional representation would lead  to neglecting and abandoning agriculture; it is related to this  like the reverse side of a coin. As Professor Michitoshi  Takabatake of Rikkyo University said at the time, "on this  occasion financial circles calculated that it would be more  desirable if a conservative government could be maintained, even  if it reduced at one stroke the influence of the  agriculture-sector Diet members and cut off from the LDP  agriculture Diet members who are resolutely opposing opening the  rice market, so it would not be at all strange if the core of  the LDP thought so," a system which combines single-seat  election districts with proportional representation has become a  device that will increase the number of urban-sector Diet  members much more than that of agriculture-sector Diet members.  <H3>  The Agriculture Faction Will Be Ruined by Single-Seat  Election Districts </H3>   We investigated to see how the number of Diet members for  the  four large metropolitan areas (the nine urban and nonurban  prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Aichi, Osaka,  Kyoto, Hyogo, and Fukuoka) and for the other prefectures would  change compared with the present because of the current  government plan for a system that combines single-seat election  districts and proportional representation.    In contrast to the fact that, for the current system of  midsized election districts, the number of Diet members for the  four large metropolitan areas is 203, 39.8 percent of all Diet  members, if it became a system that combined single-seat  election districts with proportional representation, their share  of the single-seat election district portion (250) would be 180,  43.2 percent of the whole. As to the remaining 250 seats of the  proportional representation portion, executive committees have  strong power in deciding on candidates, so it would probably be  very difficult for candidates who represent the provinces or  farm villages to run, so it is also conceivable that the number  of Diet members who are supported by provinces and farm villages  might decline still further. It would be an extreme case, but if  all proportional representatives were to be Diet members who  were not from the provinces or from farm villages, the number of  Diet members for provinces and farm villages outside the four  large metropolitan areas, who accounted for 60.2 percent under  the current system of medium election districts, would decline  drastically to 28.4 percent.    On the other hand, when we compare the proportion of the  entire complement of Diet members under the current system for  the 47 urban and nonurban prefectures, and which would be  accounted for under the single-seat election districts of the  government plan, there are 25 urban and nonurban prefectures in  which the proportion of the complement would decline. In the  Tohoku region the proportion would decline in every prefecture  except Miyagi Prefecture. In the Chubu region, it is Yamanashi,  Nagano, and Gifu. In the Shikoku region, it is every prefecture  except Kagawa, and so on. Prefectures with a high proportion of  agriculture are overwhelmingly numerous. Even judging from this,  clearly the influence of Diet members who are supported by the  provinces and farm villages would decline, and that of urban  Diet members would rise.    The reorganization of political circles which made possible  establishment of a non-LDP coalition government is about to move  from Act I to Act II. All sorts of unions and alliances have  been developed on the premise of introducing a system combining  single-seat districts and proportional representation.    It will probably continue on to Act III and Act IV. It is  judged that, in such a case, an "urban-type conservative party"  will become a single cohesive entity. Shinseito and Komeito  have, since early on, shown a posture of approving partial  opening of the rice market. It seems likely that the non-LDP  coalition government parties will select future development as,  basically, an urban-type political party.    As might be expected, what attracts attention in this case  is  the SDPJ. As to whether it is indicating development as an  "urban-type political party," such certainly not the case. As is  shown by the fact that former Executive Committee chairperson  Sadao Yamahana was the only one of that party elected by Tokyo  in the July lower house election, in recent times the SDPJ has a  strong tinge of a rural party. It is a political party whose  actions are difficult to anticipate.</p>

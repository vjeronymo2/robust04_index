			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-CIA OFFICIAL RELATES PLAN TO AVOID CONGRESSIONAL BAN;  </P> <P> CASEY WANTED NORTH TO HELP CONTRAS, JURY TOLD  </P> <P> A former CIA official testified Monday that William J. Casey, the late CIA  director, designated Oliver L. North to assist the Nicaraguan Contras after  Congress cut off U.S. government funding for the rebel forces in 1984.  </P> <P> The ex-official, Vincent M. Cannistraro, said he attended a meeting that year  at which Casey announced that he had obtained the approval of then-President  Ronald Reagan to make North "the reference point" for aiding the Contras when  Congress barred the CIA from continuing to play that role.  </P> <P> Cannistraro's testimony came as North's attorneys opened their defense of the  retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council aide who  is being tried on 12 felony counts in the Iran-Contra scandal. North's  attorneys are expected to call witnesses for the next few days, after which the  two-month-old case will go to the jury.  </P> <P> The testimony of Cannistraro, a former CIA supervisor who was permitted by the  judge to avoid giving his exact job title in the agency, bolstered contentions  of defense lawyers that North was acting at the direction of his superiors when  he helped organize efforts to assist the Contras during a two-year period when  Congress prohibited government aid.  </P> <P> The principal charges against North are not that he helped the Contras but that  he gave false statements to Congress about his activities and obstructed  congressional inquiries into his affairs. But Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's  chief defense attorney, has argued that the Reagan Administration's overall  plan envisioned keeping the extent of North's activities secret from Congress.  </P> <P> North's lawyers have not disclosed whether he will take the witness stand at  his trial.  </P> <P> Cannistraro testified about two meetings called by Casey in early 1984 to  outline North's role in the event Congress cut off funding for the Contras, as  it did later that year. He said that Casey, who died in 1987, "wanted to assure  the Nicaraguan freedom fighters that the United States would find a way" to  support them after the congressional ban took effect.  </P> <P> In the second meeting, attended also by North, Contra leader Adolfo Calero and  two other CIA officials, Cannistraro said that Casey reported he had discussed  North's prospective Contra role with Reagan and that "he (Casey) agreed with  the President that this is how it should be handled."  </P> <P> In other testimony by defense witnesses, Stanley Sporkin, the CIA's former  general counsel, told of drafting a "presidential finding" signed by Reagan in  early 1986 to authorize covert efforts to free American hostages in Lebanon  through the sale of U.S. arms to so-called moderates in the Iranian government.  Some money from the sale was later diverted to the Contras.  </P> <P> Sporkin said that the finding included a provision that Reagan could wait some  time before notifying Congress of the covert hostage mission, although timely  notification of such operations generally is given to members of the House and  Senate Intelligence committees.  </P> <P> When asked by Sullivan why such a provision was included, Sporkin, now a  federal district judge in Washington, replied: "You want to keep the  information as tightly as possible to make sure the operation doesn't get out."  </P> <P> Sullivan has contended that North feared his own secret assistance to the  Contras would have been jeopardized if he had answered questions honestly from  congressional committees about his private fund-raising efforts for the rebels  and the military advice he was providing them.  </P> <P> However, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked Sporkin whether lying to  Congress would have been permissible regardless of what Reagan had signed.  </P> <P> "Oh no, sir. Of course not," Sporkin shot back. "You know better than that!"  </P> <P> On cross-examination, prosecutor John W. Keker also brought out that the  presidential finding dealt only with secret efforts aimed at freeing hostages  and did not include any matters relating to Contra aid.  </P> <P> Another witness, Ellen Garwood, a wealthy Texas widow, testified that she  claimed an income tax deduction of more than $2 million for money she gave to a  North associate, Carl (Spitz) Channell, for food, clothing and military  equipment for the Contras. But Garwood said she gave her donation in good faith  through a nonprofit foundation operated by Channell, and that North never asked  for the funds directly or advised her on tax matters.  </P> <P> The last count in North's indictment accuses him of conspiring with Channell to  defraud the United States of income tax revenue.  </P></p>

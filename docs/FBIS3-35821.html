Next Few Months Will  Tell Whether It Will Prove Possible To Continue This Route"]    [Text] The Russian State Committee for Statistics  [Goskomstat] has announced the main statistics for the country's  socioeconomic position in 1993. They indicate that the general  slump has not been halted, but is slowing down and gradually  assuming a structured nature. The decline has been stopped in  some important areas, but there is no growth as yet and the  stabilization is hardly reliable. Growth has begun in some  spheres, but the precrisis high has by no means been attained as  yet.   <H5>    Enigmatic and Not So Enigmatic Figures </H5>   GDP dropped 12 percent on last year's level when it in turn  fell 19 percent. In other words, the decline has slowed, but it  is still considerable. At the same time the structure of GDP  use has improved in some respects. The proportion of spending  on final national consumption rose from 53.6 percent of total  GDP use in 1992 to 57.8 percent in 1993. Spending on domestic  consumption totaled 40.5 percent of GDP against 35.9 percent in  1992. The proportion of gross accumulation of fixed capital,  along with the proportion of net exports (minus imports)  remained virtually unchanged.    What has changed, how has consumption risen? The growth in  material working capital dropped dramatically from 11.6 percent  of GDP in 1992 to 5.3 percent in 1993. In the main this is  attributable to the dramatic reduction in material working  capital within production stocks.    The reduction in stocks at certain enterprises may have been  excessive. But this process is by and large beneficial.  Remember that in the early eighties economists spoke with  growing disquiet of the excessive growth of stocks. At that  time economic growth was in actual fact a sham: The entire  growth in social production was used to increase stocks that  were lying idle. Now the process has been reversed: The real  decline in social consumption is less than the slump in  production -- owing to the reduction in stocks.    That is to a considerable extent the reason for what at  first  glance seem enigmatic figures. Thus, notwithstanding the slump  in production, the population's real monetary income was 9  percent up on the previous year. Admittedly, that is still only  57 percent of the 1991 level, since there was a sharp decline of  almost 50 percent in 1992. But nonetheless recovery has begun.  Total commodity turnover was 102 percent of the 1992 level and  99 percent of the 1991 figures. Total exports were 101.4  percent and 84 percent of the 1992 and 1991 levels respectively.  At the same time exports were 16 billion [rubles] ahead of  imports (it is hard to remember anything like that happening in  our history).    And here are some more figures.    The number of people with income below the minimum  subsistence level in December 1993 was 3.7 percent up on  December 1992, totaling 39.6 million, or over one-fourth of the  entire population. The consolidated consumer price index rose  9.4-fold in 1993 as opposed to 26-fold in 1992, and has thus  risen 245-fold in two years. If you remember that the index  also rose 2.6-fold in 1991, in three years there has been more  than a 600-fold rise. At the same time in December the average  wage was 130,000 rubles [R], an 8.1-fold increase last year and  a 109-fold increase in the past two years -- less than one-half  the price rises since liberalization.    By the end of the year over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes  (95 percent of the total) had reregistered. One-third of them  decided to retain their former status. Moreover, 11,500 varying  companies, around 300 open-type joint-stock companies, 400  enterprise subsidiary farms, and 2,000 agricultural cooperatives  have been set up based on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Some 87,000  private farms have appeared in a year: As of 1 January 1994  there were 270,000 of them in Russia (with an average land area  of 42 hectares per farm). Agricultural production in the public  sector is on the decline, but it is on the increase in the  individual sector and this is making it possible to slow down or  halt entirely the slump in the production of certain foodstuffs.  Coupled with the sharp increase in the population's  horticultural and truck garden activity, the urban population  included, this ensured a noticeable increase in consumption of  all basic foodstuffs, apart from fish products, in 1993. The  1991 level has been regained and even exceeded in a number of  areas. All this is particularly impressive if you bear in mind  that imports of grain (and meat and sugar) were cut drastically  in 1993 for the first time in many years and at the same time  reliable grain stocks were set up before the new harvest. There  can be no recurrence today of the situation in early 1992, when  the population's grain supply was directly dependent on the  arrival of the latest grain shipments from the United States.    Nevertheless, agriculture is in an extremely grave position.  Prices of agricultural equipment, fuel, and fertilizers are  rising far more rapidly than prices of agricultural produce.  The profitability of crop farming produce dropped from 211  percent in 1992 to 92 percent in 1993 and thus remains  extraordinarily high. The profitability of livestock produce,  which dropped from 42 to 15 percent respectively, could have  been deemed adequate had it not been shored up by subsidies.  Wool production was unprofitable even with subsidies, which  promoted a reduction in the sheep and goat herd.    There was an unequivocal deterioration in the state of trade  and the consumer market. In 1992 the retail trade's foodstuff  availability coefficient was around 50 percent and the nonfood  commodity availability coefficient 70 percent (an immeasurable  improvement on the empty stores of 1991) and in 1993 the figures  were 60-70 and 80-90 percent respectively. All efficiency  indicators were considerably higher in private trade than in  state trading outlets. After the slump of 1991-1992 consumption  of nonfood commodities rose once again.    As for the market in technical and production output, one  conclusion from the Goskomstat report is simply worth citing:  "In 1993 there was no problem with shortages of resources. The  main condition determining enterprise and organization  procurement was their effective demand."   <H5>    Will Industry Be Able To Restructure Itself? </H5>   Foreign trade results are extremely conflicting. The  sizeable surplus balance of trade represents an undoubted  success, but it has cost us too dear and is hardly a long-term  phenomenon. It is only the reduction in grain imports, which  provided $1 billion out of a total surplus of $16 billion, that  is undoubtedly beneficial and effective for the country. The  reduction -- by 50 percent -- in imports of machinery and  equipment, providing a "saving" of around $7 billion, and  medicine (by almost 75 percent compared with the previous year)  is not at all beneficial.    The already backward export structure deteriorated still  further. We are buying fewer machines and equipment, but on the  other hand exports of crude oil, petroleum products, gas, coal,  iron ore, ammonia, cast iron, and aluminum, in other words  nonreproducible natural resources that involve a low degree of  processing and correspondingly low revenue rose considerably.  The worst thing is that last year average export prices of  Russian oil, petroleum products, gas, coal, iron ore, cast iron,  and aluminum fell. While the extraction and transportation  costs of all these commodities are rising rapidly.    In many cases it was still profitable for enterpries to  export these products only because of the drastically low ruble  rate of exchange and what were until recently low transportation  costs. Now transportation rates are close to real expenditure  on transportation and the ruble rate of exchange, although still  very low, has nonetheless fallen considerably slower than prices  on the domestic market have risen. In effect although the  artificial export incentives have survived, they are appreciably  weaker and the profitability of exporting aluminum ingots, round  timber, and coal is already in question. Oil exports will also  be in jeopardy in the future.    The question in effect is whether Russian industry will be  able to restructure itself to export primarily machinery and  equipment and other commodities with a high degree of processing  before the favorable, but short-lived market situation  disappears and thus maintain an active trade balance. Our only  salvation lies in boosting the competitiveness of Russian goods.  Regrettably, the industrial lobby and the government, which is  obviously succumbing to pressure from the former, are still  taking a different direction. The Russian market is being  closed to foreign commodities by incredibly high duties. Thus  the population is being made to pay for the monopolism and the  backwardness of Russian industry, and that industry is doomed to  lag forever behind its rivals. If it does not learn to  withstand foreign competition at home, much less will it have a  chance of conquering these rivals on other countries' bleak  markets.   <H5>    Response to Critics of Monetarism </H5>   This example is just one of many that make one think about  the choice of course now being made deep within the government.  Primarily the choice of an economic policy in its most general  form. The main position that has been repeatedly stated over  the last few years by government leaders is this: We will  operate not only by monetarist methods. This should be  investigated more carefully since I think that both the  supporters of this policy and its critics are guilty of  inaccuracies.    When it said that there are microeconomic instruments as  well  as monetarist macroeconomic instruments, this idea is for some  reason put forward as a reproof to the monetarists. But no one  can after all claim that macroeconomic levers, above all setting  state finances to rights, are not necessary. I think that few  people would also dare to say that microeconomic actions can be  successful without setting the microeconomy to rights. Everyone  realises that both are necessary. But it is not those countless  sectoral department officials who have done nothing to  streamline the microeconomic structure who are presented as  being to blame for the economy's hitherto untreated ills, but  those who are making abortive attempts to bring about  macroeconomic stabilization. It is the finance minister's  business to watch over the state budget and other departments  should deal with each enterprises.    However, critics of monetarism in the sectoral lobby are  sincerely convinced that they are right. Many of them think  that the Finance Ministry's "miserliness" is to blame for  everything: If it were to give us state money to our heart's  content, we would sort everything out. One can perhaps thank  fate that the state purse is no longer big enough for everyone  to take their fill -- otherwise spendthrift production units  would continue ad infinitum. No, activity at microeconomic  level can be successful not despite but only on the basis of  monetarist policy.    If commitment to the old habits persists, what the premier  said -- "not only by monetarist methods" -- may indeed entail a  return to the long since compromised administration by decree.  With a competent market approach it is quite possible to  combine the two avenues in the state's economic activity. On  the one hand, a return to regulating prices and rates of  exchange, to ceilings and quotas, and broadening subsidies and  preferential loans will do no good. On the other, the state can  help step up enterprises' market activity.    Nonmonetarist activity by the state is a possibility. But on  one condition: Provided that it does not contravene, but rests  on monetarist policy, and utilizes its fruits. Only when the  means of arriving at this kind of combination have been found,  when people have ceased reducing the task to the slowing down of  financial stabilization, will one be able to believe that our  state is indeed committed to the reform course.</p>

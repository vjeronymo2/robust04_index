			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Russia Will Pay the Price for Western </F> Duplicity in Bosnia"]    [Text] Despite NATO's latest stern warning to the Serbs to  cease firing on Gorazde and pull back from the town, the  military alliance still does not want to use its forces to stop  Serbian aggression against Bosnia. One of the main reasons is  purely economical. In plain language, 'there is nothing in it  for NATO members.'    After NATO, led by U.S. forces, attacked the Iraqis and  expelled them from Kuwait, U.S.-based multinational corporations  got the lion's share of the lucrative contracts awarded by  Kuwait for rebuilding that country. Other Western countries,  depending on the pecking order, also claimed their share of the  spoils of that war.    Crude oil has existed under the Kuwaiti desert for thousands  of years. Luckily, this precious commodity does not spoil even  if left underground for many more centuries. When U.S.-led  forces liberated Kuwait, the country was devastated but its  wealth was almost intact prompting Western politico-military  investment in its liberation.    Bosnia-Herzegovina has also been totally devastated, but in  contrast to Kuwait, it has no natural resources to speak of,  ergo the Western delaying tactics in evicting the aggressors  from this beleaguered and newly independent country. The West,  following one of the basic tenets of Capitalism and applying its  usual double standards, considers the cost of its involvement in  the Bosnian-Serb crisis to be too high and its financial rewards  too little to make it worthwhile. However, in order to keep up  appearances in world forums, the West has to find a way of  wiggling out this mess without accepting any blame. This is  where the Russian factor comes into play.    The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly  at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO  action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia. All of a  sudden Russia had to be brought into the NATO decision-making  process. The United States and its allies insist that there can  be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Russians are  allowed to participate in NATO's plans to end the Serbo-Bosnian  war. This logic indicates that the West considers Russia,  despite its diminished stature, to be an important military  power deserving of being included in the resolution of global  conflicts. However, when the U.S.-led UN forces attacked the  Iraqi army, the opposition of the all powerful Soviet Union was  totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies.    Russia, for its own domestic reasons, needs to pretend that  it is still the same menacing `bear' it used to be before it  disintegrated. But the successors to the Communist Empire must  realize that by promoting the Serbian `cause' they are playing  right into the hands of the Western political puppeteers who  plan to sit this war out and blame their inaction on Russia's  opposition to the use of force against the Serbs.    Russia must realize that if it allows itself to be used as  an  excuse for Western duplicity in Bosnia, it will do irreparable  damage to its already fragile relations with Muslim countries  and their more than one billion collective population.</p>

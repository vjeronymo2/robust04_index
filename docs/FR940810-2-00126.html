All of the applicants other than Lord Abbett are registered open-end management investment companies that offer shares in one or more series. The term ``Fund'' refers to any series of such an applicant that offers shares in multiple series, or to such an applicant that offers shares only in one series. Lord Abbett serves as investment adviser to each Fund, and acts as principal underwriter of the shares of each Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Shares of Money Market Fund and the Funds comprising Securities Trust are offered at net asset value. Shares of the other Funds (each an ``FESC Fund'') are offered to investors at their net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. However, there is no front-end sales charge on reinvestment of dividends and distributions, and sales that involve an investment above $1 million. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Also, shares of the FESC Funds and Money Market Fund may be exchanged freely, one for the other, without a sales charge, except on exchanges from Money Market Fund into an FESC Fund when Money Market Fund shares were originally purchased without a sales charge. In addition, shares of the Securities Trust Funds are freely exchangeable with shares of other Securities Trust Funds but are not currently exchangeable for shares of any other Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To reach the $1 million breakpoint, investments in all Funds except Money Market Fund (unless such investment has been exchanged into Money Market Fund from an FESC Fund) are taken into account, as are amounts covered by statements of intention with any FESC Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Nomura Securities Co.  business group is promoting a project to develop a big  industrial zone in Vietnam and invite scores of Japanese  companies such as electric machinery makers.    In early June, a Nomura-Jafco Investment Asia Ltd.(NjIA), a  Singapore-based investment firm, reached a basic agreement with  the authorities of Haiphong, near Hanoi, to conduct a  feasibility study on a development project on a 170-hectare site.    The first stage of the project calls for a study on  infrastructure, like supplies of electric power, water and  telephones.    NJIA, which is equally owned by Nomura and Japan Associated  Finance Co. (Jafco), a finance company in the Nomura group, will  set up a joint venture with the authorities in September, an  official at Nomura said.    It will be the first project by a group to construct such a  large industrial zone in Vietnam.    "Vietnam is expected to see high economic growth in the near  future. We would like to call on companies which have missed  the bus for investment in China to come," the official said.    Japanese manufacturers of electric machinery, car parts,  cosmetics and pharmaceuticals are expected to build factories in  the area, he said.    Nomura, which is financing all costs in constructing the  zone, will accept land-lease fees from those companies.</p>

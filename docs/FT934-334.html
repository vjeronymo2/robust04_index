			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Plug standard claims need investigating Sir, As the 'individual' referred to in Mr M J Davison's letter (December 7) concerning the adoption by the UK of the harmonised plug and socket system being proposed by Cenelec, the European standards setting body, I would like the opportunity to respond. I am not, as he stated, in disagreement with the whole of the electrical industry in the UK - only a particularly vocal part of it. The proposed new Cenelec system is not dangerously compatible with the British 13 amp system, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents most certainly cannot be considered 'truly independent' given the fact that its electrical safety consultant also works for the UK's largest and best-known manufacturer of moulded 13 amp plugs and cordsets. British manufacturing industry will not be 'severely disadvantaged'; indeed the UK plug manufacturers' own trade association, Eiema, supports harmonisation based on an unfused 16 amp MK design which would also require the demise of the 'ring-main' - and cost just the same as the Cenelec proposal. The British consumer will not 'face an astronomic bill for replacing all plugs and sockets' - in fact, the introduction of the new system will potentially save UK consumers hundreds of millions of pounds every year. To state that the 'British 13 amp system' is 'probably the safest in the world' is misleading - as anyone who has read the Department of Trade and Industry's consumer safety accident reports relating to plugs can attest. These reports clearly show that of all the accidents involving plugs in the UK, the single greatest cause (nearly 60 per cent) is the physical size and fundamental design of the 13 amp plug itself. Indeed, only a couple of years ago a highly respected ex-director of Mr Davison's own company, MK, told me that 'nobody in their right mind would subscribe to a fused plug'. Clearly someone has got their facts very badly wrong. Accordingly, I ask both Mr Davison and Mr Dossett, of Eiema, to join me in asking any shareholder or director of any company with an interest in or around this area, and who is concerned about that company's future, to ask for an immediate investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission's competition directorate DG IV, into the veracity of all the various claims and counter-claims that have been circulated. I suspect that the threat of a fine of up to 10 per cent of their companies' gross annual turnover should concentrate wonderfully the minds of those currently engaged in exaggeration of the facts.

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Life industry to fight OFT plan for rule changes RULES for selling life insurance now in force 'have significantly anti-competitive effects' and chief aspects of them should be changed, the Office of Fair Trading ruled yesterday. The chancellor of the exchequer must now decide whether to implement the OFT's proposals, which the life insurance industry has vowed to fight. The OFT urged that independent financial advisers be required to disclose commissions in cash terms to prospective customers. It also said that companies should be obliged to: Tell prospective customers the surrender value of a policy in each year up to its maturity date. Use their own charges - and not industry average costs - when illustrating to prospective customers what their likely returns will be. Allow low-cost sales outlets, such as building societies, to price their products more cheaply than other higher-cost agents. The Association of British Insurers claimed the OFT's proposals would deter consumers from buying life assurance products, and tilt the balance from independent brokers in favour of banks and building societies. Mr Brian Richardson, chairman of the ABI's life insurance council, said: 'There is a very real danger of overkill by regulation and excessive disclosure which could add significantly to the insurance industry's costs for very little real consumer benefit'. Consumer groups, however, greeted the report with enthusiasm. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy for the Consumers' Association, welcomed it. She said: 'The fact that it has taken OFT intervention to provide firm official support for the Consumers' Association's line reinforces our call for statutory regulation of the financial services industry. Only then will investor interests be adequately protected.' The recommendations follow a year-long review of disclosure rules proposed by the Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulatory bodies for the retail financial services industry. The life insurance industry has faced intense criticism since a SIB report last year revealed that, in 1990, 37 per cent of unit-linked life policies and 23 per cent of with profits policies were abandoned within two years. Criticism was so great that last month the ABI mounted a public relations campaign, as 'media representatives have attacked the industry by drawing attention to high surrenders, poor surrender values, apparent high commissions and expense costs'. The OFT's plans would require more disclosure in all these areas. Under the Financial Services Act, the OFT must determine whether the self-regulatory bodies sufficiently promote competition. The OFT yesterday also issued a report outlining what it believes are rules necessary to protect investors. Insurers attack 'unfair' disclosure demands, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Italy's debt to Mr Ciampi Italy's political landscape is about to be redrawn. With President Oscar Scalfaro's dissolution of parliament ahead of new elections in March, the interim government of the technocrat prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, is near the end of its life. The next government will almost certainly be chosen from parties quite different from the ones that have dominated Italy since the second world war. The obvious question now is whether Mr Ciampi and his predecessor, Mr Giuliano Amato, have carried out the reforms needed if Italy is to enjoy a good chance of stability under the new regime. On balance, the answer is yes. Two successive budgets have attacked the huge fiscal deficit and government debt, the highest among major OECD countries. In 1992, there was a primary budget surplus (before interest payments) for the first time in over 30 years. On a cyclically adjusted basis the overall budget deficit is set to shrink by 3 per cent of gross domestic product over the two years to 1993, much the biggest fiscal tightening in this period among major OECD countries. Particularly impressive has been the willingness to tackle structural fiscal problems, rather than repeat the one-off measures often used in the past. Public employment, pensions, health care and local authority finances were all dealt with under special powers obtained in October 1992. The 1994 budget, announced in September, aims to cut the fiscal deficit to 8.7 per cent of GDP, largely as a result of expenditure cuts, the tax burden on the country already being one of the highest in the OECD. The new medium-term economic programme presented in July 1993 aims to stabilise the public debt ratio by 1995 and reduce the budget deficit to 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1996. The civil service has been made more efficient, while a far-reaching privatisation programme, launched by the Amato government in 1992, represented an attack not only on the fiscal deficit but on the historic role of the state. Public banks, insurance companies, industrial firms and utilities are all to be sold off. Labour market reforms have also been instigated in an attempt to attack high, rising and, in large measure, structural unemployment. Inflation remains low and is likely to fall, despite the devaluation. Elimination of wage indexation has greatly assisted the achievement of this objective. Economic recovery depends in large part on the return of domestic confidence, itself dependent on the success of the reforms. For this reason, the switch to a new electoral system is an important step. The lack of domestic confidence has left exports, strongly stimulated by the 20 per cent effective devaluation of the lira since September 1992, to play a large part in sustaining economic activity. Much remains to be done. The momentum of fiscal consolidation must be maintained, since the government deficit is estimated to be 9 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1993 and public debt is 114 per cent and rising. It will also be important to secure effective regulation of privatised utilities, prevent privatised companies from returning for fiscal hand-outs and improve tax collection. Coping with the consequences for employment of shrinking the public sector and privatising public-sector enterprises may be the most difficult challenge of all. The governments of both Mr Ciampi and Mr Amato have pushed reform forward bravely. But the newly elected leaders of the republic must build on these achievements if they want their country to take the place Italians seek in the premier division of the European economic league.</p>

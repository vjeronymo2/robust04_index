			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Hunt urges unions to end Labour link Unions should come out of opposition by seeking partnerships in the workplace and by cutting their 'discredited' link with the Labour party, employment secretary David Hunt told a Trades Union Congress conference on jobs yesterday. Mr Hunt (pictured giving his speech) is the first Tory cabinet min-ister to attend a TUC conference for more than a decade. He had been heckled outside Congress House in London but received polite applause at the end of his speech. Mr Hunt also said that some unemployed people needed to change their attitude to the new service-sector jobs. Speakers at the conference, who included Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, and Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, backed the goal of full employment but differed over the means of achieving it.

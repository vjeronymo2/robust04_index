			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Three counties to hear fate today The High Court will rule today on Avon, Cleveland and Somerset county councils' applications for judicial review of proposals that they should be abolished. The move comes as legal challenges to the English local government review intensify. If any of today's applications succeed, the credibility of the Local Government Commission for England, chaired by Sir John Banham, could be critically damaged in the week before it announces recommendations for restructuring 16 more counties. It could also open the way for more legal action, as several counties already recommended for abolition are considering applying for judicial review, and would be encouraged by any successes today. Buckinghamshire, which was recommended for abolition two weeks ago, to be replaced by three unitary authorities, is seeking 'top legal opinion' over what it says 'appear to be serious inadequacies in a leaflet being distributed to households in the county by the commission'. The leaflet is central to the commission's attempt to gauge public opinion in the area in the final stage of its consultation. But Mr Kenneth Ross, council chairman, said the commission's concern that services would be 'fragmented' under the new structure, included in its formal report, had been excluded from the leaflet. Districts in Cumbria, which will be split into two large unitary authorities under current proposals, are also discussing legal action against the proposals. In Cambridgeshire, both the county and several districts are also planning legal action over the commission's refusal to include the two-tier status quo as an option.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Minister defends foreign holdings MR Richard Hu, Singapore's minister of finance, has defended his government's investments in overseas companies which have run into serious financial difficulties. In recent years Singapore has been utilising some of its large foreign exchange reserves - now officially put at Dollars 38bn - to invest in various companies and enterprises around the world. In May last year the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and Temasek Holdings, a state-owned company, bought a 30 per cent stake in Mount Charlotte Investments, the British based hotel chain, for SDollars 821m (Pounds 272m at today's exchange rates). The purchase was part of a Singapore government move which also involved acquiring a 4.7 per cent stake in the New Zealand-based Brierley Investments company, whose biggest asset is Mount Charlotte. Mount Charlotte has severe debt problems and trading in its shares on the London Stock Exchange stopped late last year. Responding to opposition questions in the Singapore parliament, Mr Hu said no loss had so far been incurred on the government's Mount Charlotte shares. 'Shares in Mount Charlotte were purchased as a long term investment. Therefore, the return from this investment can be determined when Mount Charlotte is relisted on the London Stock Exchange,' said Mr Hu. He also said losses on investments in high-tech companies in the US were no cause for concern. Mr Hu said Singapore Technologies Ventures, ultimately controlled by Singapore's Ministry of Defence, had invested SDollars 38m in Silicon Valley companies last year and losses amounted to SDollars 5m.</p>

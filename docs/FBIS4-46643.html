			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KazTAG report: "A Planned Basis and Dynamism for the </F> Development of the Defense Complex"]    [Text] A session of the Security Council was held on 16  June under the chairmanship of President Nursultan Nazarbayev.  The questions "Status of the Provision of the Armed Forces of  the Republic of Kazakhstan With Equipment and Arms and Their  Supply With Material and Technical Resources" and "Concepts of  the Formation and Execution of Long-Term Defense Programs and  the Development of the Defense Complex of the Republic of  Kazakhstan" were considered. Reports were presented by General  of the Army Sagadat Nurmagambetov, minister of defense, and Mars  Urkumbayev, minister of economics.    Considering the difficult economic situation that has taken  shape in the country, it was observed at the session, the  Ministry of Defense and the corresponding departments are doing  much to provide the troops with everything necessary and are  using the allocated funds in extremely economical fashion. The  arms and the pool of combat equipment of the units and combined  units are being replenished mainly from the Russian Federation  and Ukraine, in accordance with a number of agreements signed at  chief of state level. But in practice the solution of these  questions is attended by great difficulties. And it is necessary  for overcoming them, a number of speakers believe, to exclude  the services of middlemen, who are concerned primarily for their  own profits, and to create an interstate conciliation commission  for reciprocal military supplies within the framework of the CIS.    There was a detailed analysis also of the degree of  provision  of all branches and arms of the service with equipment and arms,  fuel and lubricants, clothing and related gear, and food.  Together with the positive aspects, there are many problems here  also. Specifically, a particular quantity of the equipment of  the radiotechnical troops, whose service life will expire in the  very near future, of certain units of the air defense of major  cities and industrial facilities is in need of replacement.  There needs to be an improvement in the provision of the  aviation units with fuel for the pilots to be afforded an  opportunity to complete the prescribed minimum number of flight  hours logged to maintain and [word illegible] their professional  expertise.    Of the armies of the Commonwealth countries, the men of  Kazakhstan are the best supplied with food. But this is far from  being the case when it comes to clothing and related gear. This  applies particularly to the officer corps. In order to rectify  matters, it is necessary, it was said at the session, to change  the production structure or create in the republic our own  enterprises for sewing military uniforms and making  load-carrying harnesses and field gear. And when it comes to  providing the troops with everything necessary, it is important  to exercise stricter supervision of the fulfillment of the  government defense order.    As the minister of defense reported, despite the objective  difficulties, the Armed Forces are capable as of this time of  tackling the assignments pertaining to assurance of the security  of our state.    Mars Urkumayev considers it necessary to cooperate more  actively in the solution of defense questions with countries of  the CIS and the far abroad, to alter the production structure of  our own industry for military needs, and to assure the precise  work of the operating defense enterprises manufacturing the  product necessary for the normal activity of the republic's army.    The exchange of opinions was summed up by Nursultan  Nazarbayev. We must clearly make up our minds as to what kind of  army and in what numbers we need, he said. We need to solve  immediately all questions connected with supplies to the Armed  Forces and to reduce as much as possible imports of military  products from outside and, as far as possible, make them  ourselves.    The head of state set the task of the creation within a week  of a military industry commission. Its chairman will be directly  responsible for the state of affairs in this important sector  providing for the sure defense capability of our sovereign state.    In its decision the Security Council approved the concept of  the formation and execution of long-term defense programs and  the development of the defense complex. It also confirmed  certain changes in its composition. Specifically, Bulat  Bayekenov was appointed secretary of the council.    Abish Kekilbayev, chairman of the Supreme Council, First  Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, deputy prime  ministers Galym Abilsiitov and Asygat Zhabagin, leaders of a  number of ministries and departments, and senior officials of  the staff of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers took  part in the session.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barbados seeks force majeure on sugar for EU Barbados is seeking to declare force majeure' on it sugar shipments to the European Union because of the drought-hit island's inability to fulfil its 1994-95 quota. Because of the dry weather the 1995 harvest will yield less than 40,000 tonnes of raws, according to Mr Rawle Eastmond, the agriculture minister. 'Barbados will not be able to satisfy its sugar quota with the European Union of approximately 54,000 tonnes, as production is projected to be possibly below 40,000 tonnes,' he stated.

Caricom is seeking a combined quota from the US so that shortfalls by any one member can be met by others within the group. 'If such a proposal is agreed to by the US officials, then Barbados should still be able to benefit from this quota system when we return to our production target of between 65,000 tonnes and 70,000 tonnes per year,' the agriculture minister said. The money being raised for the financially troubled industry will come from bonds floated by Citibank of Trinidad and Tobago, and from a loan from the Caribbean Development Bank, said Mr Owen Arthur, the prime minister of Barbados. He said the industry needed at least Dollars 30m. The present restructuring of the sugar industry might well be the last, said Mr Arthur. 'If this fails, the consequences could be dire.'</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RULES FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS;  </P> <P> PANEL ACTS TO BAR POLITICS IN SPACE RENTED FROM CITY  </P> <P> A San Diego City Council committee Wednesday broadened rules against political  activity by nonprofit organizations that rent subsidized, city-owned office and  meeting space.  </P> <P> In a 4-1 vote, the council's Public Facilities and Recreation Committee  expanded its rules prohibiting campaign activity to include ballot  propositions, issues and initiatives. Under the city's 10-year-old existing  policy, the groups are prohibited from working for or against political  candidates.  </P> <P> The new regulations, which require a vote of the full San Diego City Council to  take effect, do not forbid organization members from lobbying elected officials  in pursuit of the group's goals. Nor would they bar political work that takes  place outside city-subsidized office space.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Judy McCarty, a staunch supporter of the rule change, said the new  language is intended to ensure that taxpayers' money does not indirectly  support partisan political activity.  </P> <P> "We're saying you can't go out and politicize and campaign on subsidized public  property," McCarty said.  </P> <P> But Councilman Bob Filner, the lone dissenter in Wednesday's decision, said  that the rules instruct groups that "they are not supposed to take positions on  the major issues facing this city and this state. I think that's ridiculous  that we are put into that position and that posture."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free Speech Issue  </P> <P> In January, the city attorney's office ruled that the regulations are legal,  but an attorney representing the Sierra Club said Wednesday that the expanded  rules are unconstitutional because the "city-owned buildings in question are a  public forum" where free speech is protected by the First Amendment.  </P> <P> The rules "diminish, albeit in small measure, one of the fundamental civil  liberties guaranteed by our Constitution," said the attorney, Virginia  Lauderdale.  </P> <P> The vote ended eight months of committee debate, which began when the San Diego  Business Journal accused the local Sierra Club chapter of meeting in  subsidized, city-owned office space in Balboa Park to review an endorsement  made by the organization's political arm.  </P> <P> The policy would no longer apply to the Sierra Club because the chapter last  month moved to privately owned quarters in North Park. Other groups that occupy  city-subsidized space and have taken positions on past ballot initiatives  include Citizens Coordinate for Century III and some of the cultural  institutions in Balboa Park's core.  </P> <P> About 1,200 nonprofit groups now pay less than fair-market rates to use  city-owned office space, most of them for social or community meetings, said  Don Barone, the city's property management services supervisor.  </P></p>

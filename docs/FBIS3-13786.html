			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dawud al-Mani in Damascus] </F>   [Text] According to a statement issued in Damascus by the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, riots broke out between  storekeepers and members of the general public at Baghdad's  largest bazaar -- al- Shurjah Market.    The statement blamed the disturbances on the worsening  economic situation with a pack of sugar selling for 13 Iraqi  dinars.    Rioting was said to have erupted during the distribution of  chickens to fill quotas in the city of al-Fallujah in al-Anbar  Governorate. Protestors raised placards calling for the  overthrow of Saddam Husayn's regime.    Forces of the regime cordoned off the market and a number of  demonstrators were taken into custody.    The statement also disclosed that the Baghdad regime is  working on the formation of three military corps, whose recruits  will be drawn from "the friends", and which will be incorporated  into the Republican Guard.    The statement noted that in the application forms the  candidates were handed, the question asking whether they wished  to join the corps was worded to elicit a yes or no response.  This was intended to circumvent a UN Security Council  resolution banning the addition of fresh military units to the  Iraqi Armed Forces. Iraqis are, however, still herded into  compulsory military service, the statement notes.    The statement emphasized that special training camps, where  entrants are to receive military instruction, are being prepared  in Mosul, Nahrawan, and al-Kut. The exact locations are secret  and off limits, save for the trainees.</p>

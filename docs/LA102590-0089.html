			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS FIRE STUBING, BRING IN HINES, REBERGER AS COACHES  </P> <P> Moose Stubing, who was a minor league coach and manager for the Angels before  becoming their third base coach for nearly six years, was released Wednesday in  a shuffling of scouts and coaches.  </P> <P> Stubing, with the Angels' organization since 1968, most recently served as the  Angels' first base coach after having been shifted from third base on Aug. 17.  </P> <P> He was 0-8 as the interim manager in 1988 after Cookie Rojas was fired.  </P> <P> Stubing will be replaced by Bruce Hines, who was a scout, rookie league manager  and roving defensive instructor for the Angels. Hines is the son of Dodger  batting instructor Ben Hines.  </P> <P> Stubing, 52, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> One-time major league pitcher Frank Reberger, formerly a roving minor league  pitching instructor for the Angels, was named bullpen coach, succeeding Joe  Coleman, who became pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> The Angels also hired Bob Harrison, who was a major league special assignment  scout for the Seattle Mariners, to perform the same role for them.  </P> <P> Outfielder Max Venable filed for free agency Wednesday, one of 50 major league  players to do so in the 15-day "window" after the World Series. Venable, who  hit .259 in 93 games, had said before the season ended he that hoped to be  re-signed.  </P></p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Party chief faces tough task: The new boss of Italy's Christian Democrats must try to reconcile old guard and reformers REMOVERS have been busy hauling away files from the Christian Democrat's headquarters in an imposing 16th century palace in the centre of Rome. The old guard has been emptying offices, making way for Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the new party secretary. In less than a month this 61-year-old lawyer, former justice minister and amateur poet, has imposed a more sober style. Fewer courtiers are to be found murmuring into cellular telephones, fewer chauffeur-driven cars are permanently parked outside. His team is smaller, pays less heed to the various party factions and is more eclectic. It includes a one-time conscientious objector and the party's first woman president, Rosa Russo Jervolino, the minister of education. Throughout Italy's post-war political history, the secretaries of the ruling parties have consistently orchestrated the making and breaking of governments. The Christian Democrat secretary, as leader of the party winning the most votes, has also been the apex of the system of 'soto-governo'. This has meant control of the nominations and decisions in the civil service, regional/local government, the boards of state companies and banks and management of the main state television channel. Such control, where favours were exchanged and votes gathered, interlocked the interests of party and state (the former always taking precedence). The circumstances confronting Mr Martinazzoli are wholly different. New political alliances are in the air; a financial crisis is forcing the parties to slim down their organisations; electoral reform is on the way and the incestuous relationship between the parties and the state apparatus is being forcibly untangled by a wave of corruption investigations. As a party, the Christian Democrats urgently need renovation like the Socialists, their long-standing partners in government. Indeed their problems only differ in degree and timing: the Socialists have yet to change the discredited leadership of Mr Bettino Craxi and are even more besmirched by the odour of corruption. Founded in 1942, the party owed its strength to the backing of the Vatican (and the US) during the Cold War as an inter-class anti-communist front and the charismatic early leadership of Mr Alcide De Gasperi. Gradually its rationale became reduced to the exercise of power through men like Mr Giulio Andreotti, who was prime minister seven times, and the intricate balancing of power factions headed by the various 'barons' and their accolytes. The party failed to adjust to the end of the Cold War, miscalculated discontent over corruption and failed to see the challenge in the north from the populist Lombard League. The party's share of the vote fell to 29 per cent in April. Though still easily the largest single party with 206 of the 630 seats in the chamber of deputies, it has lost much of its legitimacy as the natural party of power. Moreover, a gap of as much as 15 percentage points has opened up between party support in the north and the south, where the vote has held through traditional patronage and mafia links. The latest polls suggest the party would get only 20 per cent in the north, half that of the League. Mr Martinazzoli, who had been anticipating retirement, is one of the few senior Christian Democrats with a clean reputation. He also comes from the northern city of Brescia and the recovery of the north with a clean up of the party's structure there is a priority. This entails changing both the way the party is funded (ending kick-backs on public contracts) its behaviour and policies. The most coherent platform is propounded by Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement. He combines the best of the party's Catholic ethical tradition with a strong reformist bent and is by far the Christian Democrat's most attractive asset. The old guard refused to accept him as the new leader, and Mr Segni was wary about pushing himself forward, aware his political career could be undermined by taking on a party he could not reform properly. This leaves the uncharismatic Mr Martinazzoli with an old guard sniping from the side-lines terrified of losing their privileges, and the reformists under Mr Segni continually threatening to leave. Mr Martinazzoli can probably rely on the old guard being further discredited by the countrywide investigations of magistrates into political corruption. But the party is too conditioned by over four decades of soto-governo to change overnight, and Mr Martinazzoli may not have the ability to retain the loyalty and contain the ambitions of the likes of Mr Segni.</p>

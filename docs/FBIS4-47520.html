Mosenkova, engineer, Institute of High Temperatures at Russian  Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.181:629.9]    [Abstract] A method has been developed for waste-free  removal of sulfur dioxide from exhaust gases emitted by  metallurgical plants and power plants into the atmosphere. As  the sorbent is used sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, either  of these two compounds being chemically more active than the  conventionally used analogous calcium compounds. The new method  is not only almost waste-free but also more efficient, inasmuch  as up to 95 % or even more of the SO[.sub]2[/] content will  be removed, and simpler than the conventional one. The processes  taking place are reaction of the sodium compound with sulfur  dioxide in the presence of oxygen, which results in formation of  sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite, followed by reduction of both  these salts by methane, carbon monoxide, or molecular hydrogen.  The principal end product is sodium sulfide, which by treatment  with carbon dioxide and water vapor will be converted into  sodium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide. A pump feeds sorbent from  a storage tank into the flue duct for removal of sulfur,  whereupon the clean exhaust gas pass through a dust trap-  separator cyclone chamber into the air while the sodium sulfur  salts are precipitated into an extractor into which also water  is injected. Their water solution is fed into a centrifuge, from  where they are loaded for sorbent regeneration while residual  ash falls out. The equipment in such sorbent regeneration plant  consists of:     -  evaporator    -  centrifuge discharging water    -  Claus furnace discharging sulfur    -  afterburning furnace for sulfur dioxide + hydrogen sulfide  mixture    -  scrubbing chamber    -  methane combustion chamber with air injection and    -  melting chamber (1200C) for sodium sulfur salts  including  makeup sodium sulfate    -  methane incomplete-combustion chamber with air injection and    -  sodium sulfur salts reducing chamber (900C)    -  carbonizer with carbon dioxide and water vapor injection    -  two collector tanks, one for sodium sulfur salts coming in  from  the user and one for sodium carbonate going out to the user  respectively.     Inasmuch as installation of such an equipment in every  plant and  especially in small ones is costly, regional centralization of  the treatment is proposed: one sorbent regeneration plant to  collect on tank trucks sodium sulfur salts from all users in the  region and to deliver to them on tank trucks regenerated sodium  carbonate. Such a scheme is demonstrated on a radial grid with  the sorbent regeneration plant at an optimum location within the  Tula-Ryazan-Tambov-Lipetsk perimeter. Figures 3; references 10.</p>

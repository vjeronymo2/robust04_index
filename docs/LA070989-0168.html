			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANTOS PREDICTS PRISON FOR SOME IN HUD PROBE  </P> <P> The California congressman who is heading the investigation of allegations of  fraud and political abuse at the Department of Housing and Urban Development  said in an interview to be aired today that "large numbers of people will go to  jail" as a result of the probe.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations  employment and housing subcommittee, refused to name the individuals he expects  to be charged, but he predicted it will be revealed that wrongdoing at the  agency has cost taxpayers billions of dollars.  </P> <P> "It's much too early at this stage of my investigation to give you a hard  figure, but when I say billions, I think I'm conservative," Lantos said in a  taped interview to be broadcast on "The Wall Street Journal Report."  </P> <P> "I'm not going to comment on specific individuals, but I'm fully prepared to  say that large numbers of people will go to jail -- there's no question about  it," he said.  </P> <P> The investigation was sparked by disclosures about abuse during the Ronald  Reagan Administration.  </P></p>

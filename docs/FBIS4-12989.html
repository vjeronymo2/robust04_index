			<p>BFN     [Text] Katyusha rockets were fired during the night into  the Galilee Panhandle from south Lebanon. There were no reports  of injuries or damage. On the line now is reporter Alan  Ben-'Ami:    No one was hurt from the katyusha rockets which fell in the  Galilee Panhandle twice during the night, nor were there any  reports of damage. But it is only with first light that the  Army has been able to begin sweeping the area to find exactly  were the rockets fell. The katyusha attacks followed shelling  of the Lebanese port city of Sidon by South Lebanon Army [SLA]  soldiers last night, and that shooting came in the wake of two  explosions yesterday in the village of 'Aramta in the security  zone, explosions which killed several SLA soldiers and wounded a  dozen more people, both soldiers and civilians. One of the dead  SLA men is said to be Major As'ad Nasir, an SLA commander in the  area. Hizballah has claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts,  and Hizballah gunners also began shelling a number of SLA  positions during the night. SLA gunners returned by firing a  number of shells at different targets, including Sidon.  Lebanese Army gunners also said to have taken part in exchanges  of fire yesterday. This is the first time that this big port  city in south Lebanon has come under fire in some years, and it  is not clear just why it was targeted, but the SLA shellings  claimed a number of lives and wounded a dozen people or so in  this city, as well as setting a number of fires.    Israeli military sources deny reports that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] was involved in the shooting in any way, and it  was clearly a breach in the understandings which were reached  after Operation Accountability in south Lebanon last year. It's  not clear now just how the situation is going to develop,  whether stability will return to the north or not, but tension  remains very high both inside south Lebanon and in the Israeli  border towns in the north.</p>

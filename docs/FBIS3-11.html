			<p>SUMMARY                                     Apparently responding to domestic pressures to demonstrate more  balance in the country's foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev used his late January visit to China to press  Beijing to greatly expand and deepen the Sino-Russian  relationship and forge a "constructive partnership" between the  two countries.  For its part, Beijing, concerned about the  unsettled Russian political situation, appeared reluctant to  embrace Kozyrev's initiative, suggesting instead a more modest  expansion of bilateral ties.                                 END SUMMARY      Visiting China from 26 to 29 January, Kozyrev--the first high-  ranking Russian visitor to Beijing since the mid-December  elections in Russia--not only reaffirmed Moscow's intention to  maintain its relationship with Beijing but also called for  significantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a  "constructive partnership" between the two countries.  Introducing this initiative at a press conference on 26 January,  Kozyrev said a "constructive partnership" between the two  countries would mean a "qualitatively higher-level" of bilateral  ties (ITAR-TASS, 26 January).  Expanding on this theme in a  speech the following day to China's People's Institute of  Diplomacy, the Russian foreign minister portrayed the new  relationship as a multifaceted one (ITAR-TASS, 27 January).  Beijing and Moscow, he indicated, should cooperate in solving the  "new problems" in Asia, focusing on the "danger" from the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies, the  question of access to the resources of the Pacific Ocean, and the  problems caused by an "upswing of religious nationalism" in  Afghanistan and Tajikistan.  Kozyrev went on to underscore the  importance of cooperation in these areas, saying that the failure  to make "joint efforts" to resolve these problems would result in  a "very explosive" situation.  In addition to cooperation on  regional problems, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive  partnership would lead to greater Sino-Russian cooperation in the  international arena, particularly in the UN Security Council on  problems such as peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and  nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.     Economic Relations and High-Level Visits      Kozyrev also pressed his Chinese hosts to raise the level of  economic relations between the two countries, saying, in a press  conference on 28 January, that the constructive partnership  "presupposes" a transition to a "higher level and more stable"  forms of economic cooperation (ITAR-TASS, 28 January).  In  particular, he pointed to the need to change the "form" of cross-  border contacts from "petty commercial dealings to large joint  projects."  Elaborating on the economic aspect of his  constructive partnership, Kozyrev, in remarks aired by Moscow's  Mayak radio on 31 January, said that Russia would "cOunt on"  Chinese support in getting Russia "included" in plans for  regional economic cooperation.  In addition, he noted that Russia  was "very interested" in participating in modernizing those  Chinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by  Moscow and was "ready" to participate in major economic  development projects like the Three Gorges hydroelectric project.      Finally, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership  proposal demands increasing the number of high-level contacts  between Moscow and Beijing.  At his 28 January press conference,  he claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been  accepted, saying that his visit had "mapped out a program" of  exchanges which would be capped by a visit to Moscow by PRC  President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang  Zemin.      Moscow's Positive Assessment      Moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of Kozyrev's visit.  Commenting on Kozyrev's 27 January meeting with PRC Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen, for example, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's  political adviser, claimed that the two ministers had agreed to  continue a "progressive and constant exchange of views and visits  at summit and high-levels" (ITAR-TASS, 27 January).  She noted  that Jiang Zemin would visit Moscow in the "third quarter" and  that his visit would be preceded by trips to Beijing by Russian  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and to Moscow by Foreign Minister  Qian.  She noted that the two sides had indicated their  "readiness" to continue negotiating their border problems and had  "decided" to maintain the "status quo" on the border after it had  been demarcated.  She also claimed that the two foreign ministers  had expressed their "mutual interest" in further developing  "constructive cooperation" in the military-technical sphere.      A 29 January ITAR-TASS report on the visit was even more positive  in assessing the results of the Kozyrev-Qian talks.  It said that  the foreign ministers had "confirmed their mutual desire" for the  development of political, trade, economic, and military  cooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of Sino-  Russian relations.  According to ITAR-TASS on the 31st, Kozyrev  was also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks  while made on route to Moscow.  He claimed that with the visit  China and Russia had established "new relations characterized by  normal cooperation" and that the relationship now contained  "elements of geostrategic mutual understanding."  He also  portrayed Beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive  partnership, claiming that Chinese leaders had been "very  balanced and positive in principle" in their response to his  initiative.      Cautious Chinese Reaction      Reflecting China's longstanding wariness about dealings with  Moscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political  situation in Russia, Beijing was considerably more circumspect in  its treatment of Kozyrev's visit and his suggestion that the two  countries rapidly expand their relationship.  Reflecting  Beijing's desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral  relations, Qian, according to a 27 January Xinhua account  of his meeting with Kozyrev that day, underscored the importance  of "maintaining and developing long-term, good neighborly,  friendly, mutually beneficial, and cooperative relations" between  the two countries, but did not repeat Kozyrev's optimistic  predictions of a rapid expansion of ties.  While Qian, in  response to Kozyrev's call for "summit" meeting between the  leaders of the two countries "this year," said that China  attaches "importance" to maintaining "dialogue and contacts"  between the leaders of the two countries, he seemed to dismiss  the idea, pointedly noting that documents signed during Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 visit to China as still being  carried out "step by step."      Judging by Xinhua accounts of their 28 January meetings with  Kozyrev, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin also counselled a more moderate  approach to developing bilateral ties (28 January).  Li, for  example, was reported by Xinhua as telling Kozyrev that the  "correct" policies agreed to during Yeltsin's 1992 visit should  be "adhered to for a long period."   Turning to economic matters,  he suggested that the two sides need to "proceed from reality"  and "explore new ways" of bilateral cooperation.  Jiang similarly  seemed to advocate a more cautious approach, telling Kozyrev that  bilateral relations are "developing steadily" and noting that  China's "firm and unwavering" policy is to "maintain and develop  long-term and steady good neighborly and friendly" relations with  Russia.      Like Qian, Jiang also expressed reservations about Kozyrev's  proposal for a summit meeting this year.  According to Xinhua,  Jiang, in response to Yeltsin's invitation to visit Russia,  merely "expressed the hope" that the visit "can be materialized  at an appropriate time."  However, the Xinhua report on Li Peng's  meeting with Kozyrev did indicate that Beijing would accept a  visit to Beijing by Chernomyrdin, noting that Li "invited" the  Russian premier to visit China.      Further underscoring Beijing's more circumspect approach to the  relationship, Chinese media reporting on the visit gave short  shrift to Kozyrev's proposal for a constructive partnership,  failing to report his 27 January speech to the People's Institute  of Diplomacy outlining the initiative.  In addition, Xinhua  accounts of Kozyrev's meetings with Qian on 27 January and with  Jiang Zemin the following day did not indicate that Kozyrev had  presented his proposal to them during the talks (27, 28 January).  While the 28 January Xinhua report on Kozyrev's meeting with Li  said that the Russian foreign minister had stated that in today's  "turbulent world" the "constructive partnership" between the two  sides should be "enhanced and reach new heights," it did not  indicate that Li made any response to Kozyrev's initiative.      Prospects      Despite Chinese concerns about the Russian political situation,  Beijing and Moscow are likely to continue expanding their  relationship.  However, Beijing, anxious to avoid any  entanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation  in Russia, will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing  those ties.  Beijing will continue respond positively to Moscow's  desire for greater economic cooperation.  In addition, the  inclusion of Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov as a  member of Kozyrev's delegation suggests that military cooperation  will remain a key part of the Sino-Russian relationship.

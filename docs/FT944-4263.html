			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Rivalries stymie African body The future of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a grouping of 22 states committed to lowering regional trade barriers, has been thrown into jeopardy by the reluctance of countries of the Southern African Development Community, most them also part of Comesa, to give primary allegiance to Comesa. Comesa, which aims to create a common market throughout the region, was due to be officially launched in Lilongwe, Malawi, yesterday, but proceedings were delayed by calls from southern African countries for the body to be split into northern and southern sub-regions. Many members of SADC, which comprises South Africa, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, would prefer to focus on removing economic barriers in the smaller body first rather than trying to pursue the more impracticable goals promoted by Comesa. A joint SADC/Comesa summit to discuss the issue is likely to be called soon, but analysts see little likelihood of Comesa getting off the ground in the near future. 'Liberalising trade within SADC is not particularly feasible in the short term, let alone co-ordinating trade policy in 22 countries,' notes one regional analyst.</p>

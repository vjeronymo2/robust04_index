			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Banking on the State </F> Apparatus, or the Latest Attempt To Overcome the Crisis"]    [Text] There is every basis for calling the publication by  the Russian president of a package of economic edicts, and also  news of his support for an increase in budget expenditure of  almost 28 trillion rubles, the most important political events  of the past week. Despite their strictly economic content, the  political consequences of these decisions are quite major.    These two facts alone are entirely sufficient to draw the  conclusion that changes are taking place today in the Kremlin,  and there are grounds for talking about a search for a new  political strategy to overcome the crisis. The situation looks  all the more important in the light of the spiraling decline of  the regime's social, financial, and military support.    The president received the most recent painful blow from the  State Duma, which officially questioned the results of the  referendum on the Constitution and instructed the Credentials  Commission to verify the vote. This, despite the opinion of  representatives of the president's team, is a blow to the  legitimacy of the president, not of the Federal Assembly. It is  the fate of the referendum that is at stake. In addition,  according to natural law, power should belong to the people and  their representatives. Therefore, in subjecting the results of  the elections and the referendum to review, the Duma in  particular is risking very little.    In the course of the past month, since the start of the  campaign to sign the Treaty on Social Accord, the president has  adopted a number of decisions which contravene the Constitution  and existing legislation. In addition to signing the Law on the  Status of Deputy adopted by parliament -- which B. Yeltsin  himself acknowledged as contravening the Constitution -- he has  signed six economic edicts. And in the opinion of many  specialists -- in particular Central Bank Chairman V.  Gerashchenko -- they contravene such legislative acts currently  in force as the Law on Enterprises, Property, and Bankruptcy and  the RSFSR Civil Code. General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko remains  in his post, despite the Constitution's requirements. The  country still has no Constitutional Court.    It is perfectly obvious that a painful search is under way  in  the president's entourage for a solution to the unstable  political situation, which is exacerbated by the intensifying  economic crisis. The question is what this solution will be.    There are currently weighty grounds for suggesting that the  choice could be made in favor of strengthening the state  apparatus and the power of functionaries. At any rate, this  follows from the revised draft of the federal budget. The role  of the special services in politics is markedly increased. This  is confirmed not only by the president's speech to officers of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service last week. Among the  edicts signed by B. Yeltsin last week is one extremely curious  edict which has nothing to do with the economy: the edict  setting up another department in the Presidential Staff -- for  collaboration with the Federal Assembly. Though it is well  known that structures ensuring collaboration with parliament  have been functioning smoothly in the Presidential Staff for a  long time already. This includes the president's official  representative, A.M. Yakovlev.    One of the department's officially defined tasks is "to  inform the president on the mutual relations among the factions  and groups of deputies in the Federal Assembly chambers." A.  Loginov, who formerly worked in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy,  has been put in charge of the new department. In recalling him,  his former colleagues from the ministry slap one another on the  back knowingly.    It seems that this tendency, which can be clearly seen  today,  to gamble on strengthening the state apparatus and the special  services in the search for a solution to the political crisis  does have its own logic. On the one hand, the president's  agreement to increase budget expenditure, primarily in favor of  the military-industrial complex, and the publication of economic  edicts benefiting the military-industrial complex objectively  presuppose an increased state role in the economy, and, as a  consequence, in politics. On the other hand, the adoption by  parliament of an inflationary budget could well lead the country  to an extremely severe economic crisis by as early as this fall.  And then a change of government will inevitably be required,  with the appearance in the executive leadership of people  capable of taking tough measures. Including state regulation of  the economy.    And if you stretch out the chain of logic further, it seems  perfectly apt that, according to trustworthy sources, on the eve  of the publication of the edicts and the adoption of the  decision to support increased budgetary expenditure, the  president was visited by Yu. Skokov. A man who, as is well  known, enjoys the reputation of being a powerful administrator  capable of decisive actions.    It would appear that Yu. Skokov has fully assessed the  statement made some time ago by S. Shakhray that it is he,  Skokov, who is the most probable candidate to replace V.  Chernomyrdin and is doing everything to avoid refuting the  opinion of his former colleague in the president's team. Today  the political standing of this leader is stronger than ever.  Yu. Skokov has begun the formation of his own party on the  basis of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary group and the  Union of Commodity Producers. He also enjoys support, as far as  is known, in the Presidential Staff. Primarily from V.  Ilyushin, who is drawn to Yu. Skokov by many things, including  -- to judge by a recent interview in TRUD -- an inclination  toward "closed policy." It would appear that the president's  chief aide has already decided for himself whose side he will be  on in the event of B. Yeltsin's retirement from active service.    Today the president seems to be attempting to maneuver  politically in an increasingly narrow space. The economic  problems are insoluble. The military-industrial complex is a  millstone round the country's neck. And there are no recipes on  how to cast off this millstone while saving our head. B.  Yeltsin's former major political support base -- the people --  are increasingly shying away from politics. In effect the  president is becoming hostage to the forces on which he gambled  last October and on whom his power rests today -- the  bureaucracy, the power structures, and the special services.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: Get down to business - Television Although work, business and finance occupy over 20m Britons for a large part of the week, British television covers the area very sparsely. There is nothing to compare with the old Financial News Network or its successor on US cable television, CNBC. Neither does British television have anyone to rival CNN's Lou Dobbs, who presents business and financial news with urbanity and knowledge. Yet there are dozens of magazines covering the area, most newspapers have substantial business sections and this newspaper exists to give over most of its space to it. The BBC broadcasts The Money Programme for 40 minutes on Sundays and has Business Breakfast every weekday morning between 6.00 am and 7.00 am. The ITV network has no business or financial programmes at all. Channel Four used to have a first-rate popular programme dealing with personal finance and business, High Interest, but it came to the end of its run recently and there are no plans to replace it. The Money Programme is broadcast at an awkward time, starting at 7.00 pm on Sunday evenings. It gets a smallish audience - around 1.4m was the average between January and May of this year. BBC 1's Business Breakfast has, on average, only 199,000 viewers and, according to an analysis by Carat UK, only 34,000 of them are 'business spenders'. Even Channel Four's down-market The Big Breakfast gets 41,000 business spender viewers, and Good Morning Television gets 53,000 of them. On the basis of the audience figures, then, British broadcasters seem to have got the balance of supply and demand about right. Or should one apply the supermarket law that products given less display area disproportionately undersell those with more area? Or are the programmes just not good enough? Business Breakfast, which I have been watching recently in the course of my enquiry, is a peculiar hotch-potch. Presenters read out the latest indices and the overnight closes. The figures appear as captions at the bottom of the screen. The information is of limited use to professionals, who would know the figures already. To the general viewer, the information is as of much use as periodic announcements of the height of the tide at London Bridge, which keeps on going up and down and there is nothing you can do about it. Business Breakfast has a format borrowed from news magazines. There are two presenters. The man does most of the difficult stuff, like interviews; the other presenter is usually a woman, who, among other tasks, has to read out the overnight indices. This is sometimes done by a presenter who gives the impression that she is a little challenged arithmetically, since there are discrepancies between what she reads out and the captions on the screen. Last week the job was taken on by an escapee from a hair spray advertisement, with Big Hair Band Second Wife Lip Gloss, which in this respect at least put the show on a par with Financial News Network. The format is that the presenters introduce or read the national and international news, the local news, sports news and weather in a rolling sequence. They break this up with reports from 'our European business correspondent' or 'our North American Business Correspondent'. The North American man reported from California about the wine industry there on the day last week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed its previous all-time closing peak. This was not mentioned on the programme. Those interviewed by the European correspondent are all suspiciously fluent in English, which leads one to think that they might not have appeared if they had not been fluent because of translation difficulties. Getting knowledgeable guests to travel to the BBC's studios in West London for a 6.00 am start is obviously difficult. Stockbrokers' analysts must know about the dangers of agreeing to talk about company results due in an hour: if they are wrong, they will never forgive themselves, if they are right no one will remember. As a result, the producers have fallen upon the idea of importing journalists as 'experts'. This produces the bizarre spectacle of one journalist, the presenter, asking another journalist, the Expert, about what other journalists wrote about the day before. The greatest expert of all came from a regional British daily. Asked to comment on a photograph in The Sun of several hundred Mercedes cars in a field, apparently unsold, the expert gave the following baffling response: 'Well, I think Germany is finally having to wake up to the problem of excess capacity in its industrial base. Britain and America, to a certain extent, have had over 150 years to move away from industry, from cars and nuts and bolts, toward high-tech service-orientated industries. Germany and in particular East Germany has had barely 50 years to do this. And they are now feeling the crunch. It's going to involve the loss of much capacity and, I am afraid, very many jobs.' In this week's Money Programme, the BBC's economics editor, Peter Jay, did an analysis of Germany's economic situation, relating it to political aims and giving a considered view on the prospects. Germany has lost its productivity advantage relative to its competitors, which is perhaps what the expert was trying to say. But when the expert spoke, he was working in the wrong medium for him at the worst possible time of day for newspaper writers, therefore giving no service to the viewers and doing no service to himself. On Monday morning, Business Breakfast carried an item about the Stock Exchange's clamp-down on leaking. Professionals knew about it on Friday; it was the lead story in this newspaper on Saturday and led most of the business sections in other newspapers. The presenter summarised the story and then did a short studio interview with Alastair Ross-Goobey, the chief executive of Postel. This was the sort of item that should be on the show every day: but it was notable because it was so exceptional. What Earl Brian of Financial News Network realised was that the real demand for a daily business programme was from the sort of people who sat around watching the screens in hundreds of stockbrokers' offices around the US. The key was to site the studios in low-rent areas in midtown Manhattan so that guests could pop in on the way downtown to work in the morning and to switch production to Los Angeles out of prime time to take advantage of the lower wage rates for television production people in California. Success lay in concentrating on delivering pure programme strands to committed audiences, eschewing sports, general and local news. It follows that the BBC should learn the lessons of modern technology and falling rents. Television studios can now be anywhere: City of London rents are such the BBC could afford to take space at the UK's financial centre, and provide a proper service to the 20m. or so people who are so underserved now.

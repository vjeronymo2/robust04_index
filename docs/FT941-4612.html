			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Currency gain helps Holliday rise to Pounds 13.1m Holliday Chemical Holdings, the industrial dyes and speciality chemicals group which came to the market a year ago, increased pre-tax profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 13.1m on a pro forma basis in 1993. The outcome was slightly better than the company had indicated in a profits warning in November, and the shares rose 5p to 214p. Without the impact of favourable exchange rates, which boosted profits by about Pounds 1m, the pro forma figures would have shown a decline. The present year is expected to benefit from a further exchange rate gain of Pounds 2m. Mr Michael Peagram, the company's founder and chairman, said: 'It could have been worse, but it was still a bit disappointing.' He said that profits would have been about Pounds 1.5m better but for two specific trading problems 'which have now been overcome'. These were a bout of abnormally fierce price competition for its Spanish pharmaceutical intermediates business, which has 'subsided substantially', and a hiatus in ordering by a hair dye customer which was reducing its stocks. The orders have been rescheduled for the current year. Mr Peagram said that, after a pause around the time of the profits warning, the group was again 'actively looking' for acquisition opportunities. The profits warning knocked the share price back to 174p, against the flotation price of 195p. Boosted by exchange rate movements, sales improved by 8 per cent to Pounds 105m, with most of the growth on the colours side. Here sales rose from Pounds 35.8m to Pounds 41.9m, with underlying growth of about 7 per cent. Operating profit from colours rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 6.98m, but chemicals, which takes in both pharmaceutical intermediates and hair dye, fell by Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 7.88m. Capital spending was Pounds 6.3m, against the projected Pounds 8m, but is set to rise to about Pounds 9m this year. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to 11.7p on a pro forma basis and there is a recommended final dividend of 2.4p, giving a total for the year of 4p. COMMENT Companies which disappoint soon after flotation are rarely forgiven as quickly as Holliday. But then the problems do appear to have been genuinely unexpected one-offs which are already on the mend. Given the extra Pounds 2m to come from exchange rate movements, a full recovery in the affected areas would take group profits to about Pounds 16.5m without any underlying growth from the rest of the business. On that conservative assumption the shares are on a multiple of less than 15. Despite the excellent record, the rating is likely to be held back by the threat of a large share issue to fund acquisitions.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: The jewel next door to the West End - Once, Regent's Park had more peasants than crescents. Things have changed MANY WOULD count Regent's Park as the jewel in London's rich crown of parkland. But it is more than just space and greenery; the necklace of creamy, neo-classical terraces which edge it was designed by John Nash as an integral part of the whole. The area was mostly farmland leased from the Crown - more peasants than crescents - when the Prince Regent and Nash, his favourite architect, decided to develop it in 1811. The ambitious plan was for a 'garden city' stretching all the way down Regent Street to St James's Park; but only the terraces and a handful of the 56 villas planned for Regent's Park had been built when it was opened to the public in 1835. Today, property in and around the park, next door to the West End, is among the most sought-after in London; a modest two-bed flat will set you back Pounds 250,000. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a three-bedroom flat in Cumberland Terrace (which, unlike the other terraces, contains only apartments) for Pounds 400,000. At the other end of the scale, this is where you will find the most expensive house ever sold in London. The Holme, which lies beside the boating lake and includes four acres of land and a nine-car garage, fetched Pounds 25m in spring 1991. This, however, was something of an exception. Neil Gilchrist, of estate agent Lassmans (who handled the sale of The Holme), says since the end of 1990 the market has, by and large, been 'completely dead.' He explains: 'Our biggest problem until recently has been the lack of overseas buyers because of the weak dollar. As a consequence, prices have fallen at least 25 per cent. It has taken this long for them to come down to sensible levels because a lot of owners were just not prepared to drop their prices at first.' For some, though, the bleak scenario has involved more than a price drop. Lassmans has on its books a Grade I-listed house in Hanover Terrace, on the west side of the park, which was repossessed from the previous owners. They paid Pounds 1.9m in 1988; it is now on offer at Pounds 1.35m complete with four double, en-suite bedrooms; numerous living rooms; a staff suite; sauna; 60ft garden, and a mews house. Admittedly, it lacks niceties such as a kitchen: that was ripped out and sold before the eviction. Gilchrist estimates the new owner will have to spend Pounds 200,000 to restore the property. 'This hasn't the cachet of, say, Eaton Square (in Belgravia),' he says, 'but then, it would cost about Pounds 4.5m there. This is really good value now.' Meanwhile, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a similar house next door (but with some fitments) for around Pounds 1.475m. Unlike much of the property around the park, the 20 houses of Hanover Terrace have private gardens. But Chester Terrace, on the eastern side, has communal gardens instead and Gilchrist describes it as 'secure and popular.' Lassmans is selling numbers 34 and 41 at Pounds 1.35m and Pounds 1.4m respectively; for that, you are looking at recently refurbished five-bedroom houses with staff accommodation in the basement and great views. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has one of Nash's few villas for sale. Nash House, which he is thought to have built for his own use, is a pretty, Grade I property in Chester Terrace for which the agent is asking Pounds 1.55m - Pounds 200,000 less than when it first came on the market in May 1992. But it is not necessary to move into the million-plus league for a house in Regent's Park. If you are prepared to sacrifice the view, you could pay less than Pounds 1m for 5 Chester Terrace, just round the corner. And for smaller houses such as 8 Chester Place - which still contains five bedrooms and is also on Lassmans' books - the asking price falls to a mere Pounds 600,000. Although it was the prolific Nash whose work established Regent's Park as the cutting edge of architectural design in its day, he did not monopolise the area entirely. St Katherine's Precinct by the Danish Church, which was built as an ancient charitable foundation, was designed by Ambrose Poynter, a student of Nash but no fan of his (indeed, they hated each other). The precinct's collegiate Gothic style cocks a hefty snook at Nash's classical facades, pillars and statues. One six-bedroomed house there, modernised fully and with a 60 ft garden, has come onto Savills' books recently at Pounds 1.275m. Another, with Lassmans, needs around Pounds 250,000 spent on it but compensates with an asking price of Pounds 450,000. In a late-'80s neo-classical extravaganza, Ouinlan Terry designed three showpiece villas. The Ionic Villa sold in a couple of months two years ago, but number two, the Veneto Villa, has been on the market for well over a year at Pounds 6.75m, complete with every conceivable mod con and Palladian flourish. Poynter would turn in his grave.

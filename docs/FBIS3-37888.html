			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym </F> Zvyahilskyy to a Supreme Council session on the economic and  social situation in Ukraine -- live]    [Excerpts] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, esteemed  people's deputies! Let me inform you in accordance with  yesterday's Supreme Council instruction about the course of  implementing two resolutions, of 17th and 23rd December 1993.  [passage omitted] Primarily, on the recurrent issue of  index-linking the population's deposits in savings banks and  insurance contributions to the former GosStrakh [State  Insurance] institutions, as well as settling the debt in respect  of the former Soviet Union's securities. We realize the urgency  and acuteness of this issue in view of the lack of nonemissive  sources to cover compensatory payments.    As a result of more in-depth work on the proposals put  forward by people's deputies, citizens, and scientific  establishments, the government has set up an interdepartmental  working group of representatives of the Finance Ministry,  Economy Ministry, Justice Ministry, Statistics Ministry, State  Property Fund, National Bank, and the insurance company  Harantor, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy.  Specific proposals will be made ready by 2 March of this year.  The commission has begun working. [passage omitted]    The next issue is that of the possibility of providing the  population with the minimum selection of food products at fixed  prices. Analysis shows fixing prices under the present  conditions requires huge subsidizing funds to be set up to the  amount of tens of trillions [as heard] karbovantsi. You all  very well know our budgetary capabilities in this respect.  Apart from that, to perform the functions of supervision and  distribution centrally, the recreation of the former system of  (?monitoring) and (?funding) will be required, i.e. virtually  the recreation of the system of short supply. [passage omitted]    Another issue that has lately caused passions to flare is  currency regulation. The government's position on this question  is univocal: We are for the regulation of [currency exchange]  rates, which has to take account of the state of the economy in  real terms and, accordingly, the relationship between prices for  the main types of products of both ours and those of our  principal trade partners, as well as the state of the balance of  payments in relations with them.    Together with the National Bank, we are constantly at work  to  improve the mechanism of currency regulation. That said,  however, I would once again like to confirm the government's  tough stance in that we will not agree to (?increasingly  obtrusive) proposals effectively to restore the currency  exchange activity. This in practice would legalize the  speculative rate of the dollar, which would inevitably lead to  prices rising steeply and the state of the economy destabilizing  further.    I cannot comprehend the position of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on this issue. Does it really  reflect the interests of enterprises and labor collectives?  Despite the fact that a lot has been done to implement the  Supreme Council December resolutions, the state of the economy  remains extremely complex, but at the same time, there is  nothing new in it. We have come to it together, the Supreme  Council, the government, dependent and independent trade unions,  local presidential representatives, and managers of enterprises.    One thing I would like to ask you to do, however, is this:  Let us finally stop looking for those to blame for the present  state of affairs but honestly say that we are all to blame and  that the economy has been taken hostage by our policies.    What should be done in this situation and how and where  should a way out be found? The simplest thing is to take the  position of wrathful denunciation, endlessly dramatize the  situation, and undermine the remainder of the people's belief  that the state of affairs can be rectified. There is, however,  another approach, which is doing the heavy work, without  gratitude, in search of ways to overcome the crisis and (?making  an effort) to increase the creative potential despite all the  problems and difficulties. [passage omitted]    So have we got any real opportunities to stabilize the  situation? Firstly, we have to overcome the acute payments  crisis in the national economy. It primarily reflects the state  of the economy. Ineffective, high energy and resource  consumption structural production, and serious drawbacks in the  work of the banking system, as well as unstoppable cost and  price rises, have aggravated the financial situation at  enterprises, which under the inflation conditions has caused a  catastrophic shortage of their working capital, the cessation of  mutual settlements, lack of funds to pay wages, and a sharp fall  in budget contributions.    There are, however, other things that caused the payments  crisis. They have to do with the absence of elementary control  by local authorities and banks over the timeliness and  completeness of settlements. [passage omitted]    To solve the payment crisis, the government and the National  Bank have found a compromise that makes it possible to begin to  disentangle the nonpayment knot that was tied, insure the  liquidity of commercial banks, and cause the actual movement of  ready products to consumers, which would create conditions for  the wages of enterprises's employees to be paid and payments to  the budget insured.    The issue concerning the allocation of 1.5 trillion [figure  as heard] karbovantsi to pay the pensions has been settled, 700  billion to the wages of budgetary sectors' employees, grants,  and benefits. Finances have also been provided for expenditure  on the Chernobyl program, the Defense, Internal Affairs, and  other ministries.    One has to bear it mind, however, that financial resources  are not unlimited. To improve the health of the financial  situation by unsecured financial injections is impossible. This  is a path to inflation rocketing higher, prices rising, and  production degrading even further. This is why I would like to  say frankly, mainly to state enterprises managers, that we have  approached the boundary, beyond which ineffective high resource  consumption production facilities have to undergo the clearance  of their funds [sanatsiya], specialize in another field, or  close down. The government, of course, will for some time  support and guarantee the social security of the collectives  employed at these facilities. Everybody has to realize, however,  that the only way for enterprises to earn profit, wages, and  funds is by selling their products.    Second, the work of the agroindustrial complex and  preparation for spring field work. I would like to note that  last year's debts of the state [to the farmers] for the grain,  sunflower, and sugar beet supplied, have been completely  settled. At the same time, due to the payments crisis and  insufficient sales of meat and diary products, there has formed  a debt to producers from trade and processing enterprises to the  amount of 1.5 trillion karbovantsi. This, in its turn, has  caused a debt in terms of wages at collective agricultural  enterprises to the amount of 1.3 trillion karbovantsi. Alongside  of resolving the problem of nonpayments in the national economy,  the issue of sale has to be settled.    Apart from that, 1 trillion karbovantsi worth of credits  have  been allocated to subsidized industrial centers and consumer  cooperative organizations to purchase food and industry  products. Within the framework of a government credit, 2  trillion karbovantsi have been allocated mainly to purchasing  petrol, oil and lubricants, fertilizers, spare parts, and other  resources with the aim of financially backing the agroindustrial  complex. Under the state contract the countryside will again  receive around 2 trillion karbovantsi in March. [passage  omitted]    An additional 2 million tonnes of white petroleum products  has been bought, with 400,000 tonnes having already been  received by now and sent to farms. It will have been 500,000  tonnes by the end of the month. Fuel prices have been fixed,  with farms being supplied with it on average at a price of 4  million karbovantsi per tonne and the strictest control over its  storage and use established.    Virtually all sowers, cultivators, and harrows have been  made  ready and the readiness of tractors is higher than last year, at  over 80 percent. To purchase spare parts, 14.5 billion rubles  and over 5.5 million German marks have been allocated.  MinMashProm [Machine-Building Industry Ministry] has determined  the volume of additional production to manufacture 1,600  articles of spare parts previously imported.    Farms have been fully provided with seeds of grain, sugar  beet, sunflower, potatoes, and most varieties of vegetables. To  provide mineral fertilizers, MinSelHosProd [Agriculture and Food  Industry Ministry] has been granted a government credit of over  400 billion karbovantsi. [passage omitted]    Third, concerning the work of the fuel and energy complex:  Last year an additional 3.6 million tonnes of coal were supplied  by power industry workers than was envisaged by the plan. As  regards the coke-oven industry, the plan was achieved. In order  to stabilize the work of coal enterprises, measures were taken  to increase supplies of timber, rubber belting strips, ropes,  personal protection equipment, and other resources. Contracts  have been signed for the delivery of 80 billion cubic meters of  gas from Russia and Turkmenistan in 1994. Work is also underway  on concluding agreements for the supply of oil and oil products.  A new clearing system for gas has been introduced for  enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of  Machine-building. It envisages that their enterprises will pay  independently for gas supplied to them. A resolution has been  adopted on state regulation in order to restrict the increase in  prices for oil products. The government has practically  established daily control over the work of thermal and nuclear  power stations. This has enabled the work of Ukraine's energy  system to be preserved and has prevented its collapse, thus  avoiding catastrophic consequences in the country's economy.  [passage omitted]    With the aim of stabilizing the work of sectors in the fuel  and energy complex, we are preparing a range of measures to  provide assistance particularly to those sectors. The building  of new capacities for the production of electricity is being  sought. The allocation of hard currency resources to purchase  the necessary materials and equipment is envisaged. [passage  omitted]    Fourth, trading relations with CIS and Baltic countries  have a special place in our economic policy. These are the  traditional markets for products manufactured by Ukrainian  enterprises. As of today, intergovernmental agreements on trade  and economic cooperation have been signed with all the former  USSR states, apart from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. A list of  the most important products and goods that are subject to mutual  deliveries has been drawn up. With the aim of overcoming the  crisis in mutual clearances, appropriate work is being carried  out between the National Bank of Ukraine and the Central Banks  of the former USSR republics. As of 1994 there are agreements  on mutual clearances with the majority of these countries and  work is continuing with banks of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Lithuania,  and Moldova. Work is continuing on developing bilateral  relations with CIS countries and in other areas where there is  mutual interest. Thus, principles of cooperation have been  determined with Kazakhstan in the area of heavy industry, with  Uzbekistan in the area of elaborating innovations and  scientifically intensive production processes, and the  processing and exploitation of rare and precious metals, with  Belarus on eliminating double taxation, and with three other  states on the mutual protection of investments.    As before, we are paying particular attention and will  continue to do so on the development of relations with the  Russian Federation which is our main trading partner. Its share  in Ukraine's foreign trade turnover is more than 72 percent. I  recently returned from Moscow and would like to inform the  Supreme Council of the complete mutual understanding reached  during the talks between Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, Fuel and  Energy Minister Shafranik, and other members of the Russian  Federation's Government. Apart from us Russia, is also actively  in favor of developing bilateral cooperation. We have found  mutually beneficial possibilities for paying off our debts for  energy resources. We agreed on a pricing mechanism for oil and  oil products depending on its quality and delivery conditions.    With the aim of developing mutually advantageous and  long-term cooperation regarding exports of Russian natural gas  to Ukraine and its transit through our territory, a draft  intergovernmental agreement for the years 1994/2005 has been  prepared. [passage omitted]    By way of conclusion I would like to say that the government  is aware of the acuteness and the difficult situation in the  country's economy. There are no illusions with regard to the  simplicity of the issue and understanding the painfulness of  those decisions that have to be taken on the path of overcoming  the crisis. In carrying out the duties of acting prime minister  and the government, we can see ways of stabilizing the situation  and are doing everything possible in order to achieve this.  Thank you for your attention.</p>

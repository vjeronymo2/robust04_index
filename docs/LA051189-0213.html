			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DUPONT PLAZA SETTLES FIRE LAWSUITS  </P> <P> The DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has agreed to pay about $100  million to settle lawsuits stemming from the New Year's Eve 1986 fire that  killed 97 people, newspapers reported today.  </P> <P> The Telegram of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Hartford Courant attributed the  figure to unidentified sources. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis quoted James  Fetterly, a Minneapolis lawyer for the hotel, as saying the settlement would be  substantially less than the $200 million in settlements from the 1980 MGM Grand  Hotel fire in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the DuPont Plaza  fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel, which was packed with almost  1,000 tourists. More than 140 people were injured. About 2,300 plaintiffs sued  for a total of $1.8 billion.  </P></p>

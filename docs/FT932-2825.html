			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scots water privatisation plan rejected THE OUTRIGHT privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been rejected by the government, at least until after the next general election. But ministers remain keen for private capital to be injected into the sector by franchising, competitive tendering for services and possibly allowing management to buy a stake in the industry. With a white paper on the future of Scottish water expected within a month, ministers are grappling with how to ensure - in the absence of an outright sale - that as little as possible of the extensive capital spending the industry requires in the next decade will come from public funds and hence count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. An estimated Pounds 5bn in capital spending is needed in the next 15 years, half to improve water quality and half for the maintenance and replacement of infrastructure. One favoured option is for a handful of publicly owned water authorities to be set up under the administration of a soon-to-be-created network of 25 to 35 unitary authorities. Under this model, private contractors could be encouraged to get involved in financing big capital projects through the offer of long-term franchises to provide services such as sewage treatment and water purification to the authorities. With about Pounds 240m a year already earmarked by the Scottish Office for capital spending over the next three years, ministers would have scope to offer public money for such projects, possibly on a joint-venture basis. The Treasury would be anxious for private investors in such cases to take responsibility for commercial risks such as cost overruns, enabling public liabilities to be fixed. This blueprint would have the further advantage of restructuring the industry in such a way that would allow it to build up a financial track record, easing the path to a possible sale after the next general election. Scottish water is currently owned and administered by regional councils, with the result that 100 per cent of the industry's liabilities must come out of the public purse. A bill covering the reorganisation of both the local authorities and the water industry is expected to be introduced in the next parliamentary session beginning in November. Ministers are also keen to drum up private-sector interest in proposals to build a Pounds 1.5bn pipeline to enable Scottish water to be exported to England. While they believe there is a widespread acceptance among consumers that water prices in Scotland will have to rise, ministers see the opportunity of selling water profitably to English water companies as a way of containing these increases. Two months ago it emerged that Scottish Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, is considering studying the feasibility of building a pipeline to carry water from southern Scotland and northern England to the south of England. The government's original decision to consider outright privatisation among a range of options for Scottish water has ignited a political storm in Scotland. Opinion polls have indicated that a large majority of Scots are against it. In April, the government angered Scottish MPs by shelving the privatisation of Northern Ireland water until after the election for 'technical reasons'. Labour and the Scottish National party seized on that decision to demand that the possible privatisation of Scottish water should also be postponed.</p>

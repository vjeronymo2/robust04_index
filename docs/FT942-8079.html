			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Sunday opening victory for Virgin Virgin Stores, which defied a French ban on Sunday trading, quietly triumphed at the weekend after the government dropped the ban, Reuter reports from Paris. 'Our stores open seven days a week,' said a recorded telephone answer at the company's Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees. Virgin Megastore, part of Mr Richard Branson's business empire, opened its doors on three successive Sundays last summer, angering unions and risking huge fines in its fight against the government for the right to trade on Sundays. Virgin eventually agreed to abide by the law pending a legal review. Despite trade union opposition, the French official gazette on Friday published new regulations allowing Sunday trading in leisure goods in tourist areas. Virgin Stores manager, Mr Patrick Zelnik, had argued that 20 per cent of the store's annual 8m customers came on Sundays and closure on these days would cut sharply into profits.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION;  </P> <P> STIFFER RULES FOR AIRLINE TAKEOVERS OKD  </P> <P> A House subcommittee agreed Monday to impose tough new standards on takeovers  of major airlines after witnesses testified that the debt that accompanies  leveraged buyouts could threaten airline safety and viability.  </P> <P> The bill would give the Transportation Department authority to block an airline  takeover if it would financially weaken the airline and jeopardize safety,  cause a major reduction in assets or transfer control to a foreign interest.  The bill would apply to any purchase involving at least 15% of a major  carrier's voting stock.  </P> <P> The House Public Works subcommittee on aviation passed the legislation by voice  vote despite the objections of the Bush Administration. The bill was sent to  the full Public Works and Transportation Committee, where approval is virtually  certain, probably this week.  </P> <P> Subcommittee members impatiently dismissed financier Donald J. Trump's  assertion that mere consideration of the measure helped kill the pending buyout  of UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, last Friday, causing stocks generally  to plunge.  </P> <P> Another airline takeover -- Trump's proposed $7.5-billion buyout of AMR Corp.,  the parent company of American Airlines -- helped prompt quick action on the  bill in Congress. However, Trump on Monday withdrew his $120-a-share offer as  AMR's stock dropped to less than $80 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.  Trump indicated that he might make another proposal at a lower price.  </P> <P> "We are not going to be intimidated by Donald Trump saying that we caused the  downturn in the market," said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), a key sponsor of  the proposed new takeover restrictions, along with Rep. James L. Oberstar  (D-Minn.), chairman of the aviation subcommittee.  </P> <P> The day after similar legislation was approved Oct. 5 by the Senate Commerce,  Science and Transportation Committee, the Dow Jones industrial index and the  associated transportation average both hovered near historic highs.  </P> <P> Because of recent mergers, Oberstar said, the country's top eight airlines now  control more than 90% of domestic air traffic. "There is a widespread feeling  that leveraged buyouts ought to be subject to review and some degree of  regulation so they do not jeopardize the potential for competition," he added.  </P> <P> Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.) said takeovers "can result in debt so great that  even the healthiest of airlines may be forced to take drastic actions, such as  selling off assets . . . delaying or abandoning needed growth and modernization  of its aircraft fleet, and neglecting personnel operations important to the  safety and maintenance of the airline."  </P> <P> However, a letter from Deputy Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao hinted at  a veto by President Bush if the bill passes in its present form.  </P> <P> The Administration "strongly opposes enactment" of the proposed legislation,  Chao said. "The Department of Transportation currently has sufficient authority  to act where an acquisition raises questions about an air carrier's fitness."  </P></p>

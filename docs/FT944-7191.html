			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCE warns that 22-year run of dividend growth may be ending BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, has raised its dividend for the twenty-second consecutive year, but warned that the increase may be the last for a while. The quarterly dividend, payable to shareholders registered on December 15, will rise by one cent a share to 68 cents. The Montreal-based company, whose subsidiaries include Northern Telecom and Bell Canada, the country's biggest phone company, said that it planned to review its dividend policy next year 'in the light of widespread changes in the telecommunications industry, which are creating growth opportunities for investment in new technologies and in new businesses'. Separately, Bell Canada International, BCE's offshore arm, named Mr Robert Kearney, a former chief executive of Bell Canada, to spearhead its expanding UK interests. Belfast-born Mr Kearney, who was due to retire at the end of this year, will become deputy chairman of Bell Canada International Management, based in London. BCE has a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications and a 42 per cent interest in Bell Cablemedia, the UK's third-biggest cable-TV operator.</p>

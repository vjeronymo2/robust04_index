			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: BR takes the long route Sir, British Rail's 'customer care' programme is raising InterCity's in-train announcements to new heights of ingenuity. On Tuesday, some 10 minutes after a London-bound train advertised as stopping at Milton Keynes had hurtled through the station, the senior conductor reassuringly told us: 'You will have noticed that the train did not, in fact, stop at Milton Keynes. I have spoken to the driver about it. He tells me that he had developed a problem which prevented him stopping safely at Milton Keynes. Passengers for Milton Keynes should change at Watford Junction.' The sense of mounting excitement during the remainder of the journey was almost tangible.

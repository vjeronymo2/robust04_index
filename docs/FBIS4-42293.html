			<p>BFN     [Text] The government move to secure the arrest and  extradition of former SS captain Erich Priebke "was dictated by  a repudiation, which has deep roots in our country, of crimes  against humanity, of racism, and of anti-Semitism." The  declaration was made by Prime Minister Berlusconi to two  representatives from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi's  Abraham Cooper and Simon Samuels, during a meeting at the prime  minister's office.    Justice Minister Biondi gave assurances that the  documentation asking for Priebke's extradition would be sent to  Argentina within the next few days.</p>

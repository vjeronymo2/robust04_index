			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Use of controversial fuel forecast to rise BURNING of orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel described by Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, as 'front-runner for the title of filthiest fuel in the world', could increase twentyfold by 1995. The forecast of 10m tonnes being burned each year compared with the 500,000 tonnes now burned provoked fierce criticism from environmental groups. Responding to the announcement by BP Bitor, sole supplier of the fuel in Europe, Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: 'Orimulsion is filth from start to finish.' BP Bitor yesterday defended the fuel, which became notorious last August after an accident at Richborough power station, Kent, left cars corroded by 'acid smuts', a kind of acid rain. Dr Manuel De Oliveira, BP Bitor's chief executive, dismissed claims that the fuel was dirty as 'absurdly untrue'. He said Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution had proved that the accident at Richborough could equally well have happened with oil or coal. He said orimulsion would not make power stations dirtier as they would still have to meet European emission targets. The fuel contained more sulphur than most coal or oil, but emitted little dust and heavy metal and was less likely to cause acid smuts than other fuels. BP Bitor has contracts to supply 5.5m tonnes of orimulsion, including 1.5m tonnes for the electricity generator PowerGen, which burns the fuel at Richborough and at Ince in Cheshire. Another 4m tonnes will go to National Power if the generator wins consent to burn orimulsion at its Pembroke station in Dyfed, Wales. BP Bitor expected sales to reach 7m to 10m tonnes by the end of the century.</p>

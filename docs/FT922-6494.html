			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt climbs after months of stagnation - The German equity market has taken this week's two big news items to its heart At last, after months of stagnation, it has been a good week for the German equity market. The DAX index has climbed 4.5 per cent in the past five days. The reason for this surge is that the rubbish has gone from the streets, and the headlines have improved - all of a sudden things seem to be going right for Germany again. True, there is no sign that the Bundesbank is set to cut its rates at its next Council meeting, or that the government is going to be able to sort out its spending plans in the next week or two or, indeed, that the level of productivity in the eastern part of Germany is set to come up to that of the west in a matter of months. However, the public sector workers' strike of the past weeks - which seemed to be but an inconvenient and malodorous precursor to a more general breakdown in Germany's hitherto successful social-market economy - did not lead, as investors had feared, to a damaging strike by the metalworkers. Instead, at midnight last Sunday, employers and employees reached a 21 month deal which provided a 5.8 per cent increase this year and a 3.4 per cent rise next year. This was not as good as the Bundesbank might have liked, but better than the market expected and the cue for a 2 per cent spring in the DAX on Monday. According to analysts, much of the buying then reflected traders' attempts to square 'short' positions taken last week in anticipation of a vicious strike and a serious fall in the market. But as the week progressed, there was more good news and some genuine international and domestic investment buying. As Mr Gunter Kirchhain of the Deutsche Bank's institutional investors' team in Dusseldorf quipped, the metalworkers' settlement suggested that 'the much heralded German disease was little more than a viral infection'. With a variation on the imagery, Mr Jurgen Rothig of BZW in Frankfurt said it proved that Germany 'did not suffer from the English disease at all'. In more sober language, Mr Hans Peter Wodniok at James Capel in Frankfurt observed that a wage-price spiral - fears of which had inspired the stock-market stagnation of recent weeks - was no longer on the cards. On Tuesday, the country's 1.5m building workers fell into line, accepting a 5.8 per cent pay offer, thus stirring up interest in the construction sector to complement buying of carmakers, chemicals and engineering companies. Further impetus came the same day when Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, predicted that it would enjoy an 'excellent result' for the current year. Mr Edzard Reuter, its chief executive, said that current year profits would be higher this year than last - evidence that Daimler is set to turn the long-awaited profits corner after years of earnings stagnation. In addition, it emerged that AEG, the Daimler electricals subsidiary which has been a long-term drain on its parent's resources, is not set to burden Daimler with any losses this year. Thus on Wednesday the market was propelled still higher to 1,787.50, its highest level since August 1990, with volume surging to DM9.9bn from DM7.2bn the day before. To cap the week, yesterday's money-supply figures were better than expected. Broad money as measured by M3 rose by 8.8 per cent in the year to April, after a revised 9.4 per cent increase for the previous month. This is still significantly higher than the Bundesbank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range  -but better than expectations of more than 9 per cent. The news provided a fillip to both bond and equity prices. The market is now alive with suggestions that the DAX is on course to reach its pre-Gulf, all-time high of 1,976.43 by the end of the year, perhaps sooner. However, Mr Mark Edmiston of Goldman Sachs in London is not alone in predicting that a target of 1,850 is more realistic, for the next three months at least, and that other bourses are more attractive at present. For, despite this week's outbreak of optimism, the future trend of share prices is more likely to be determined by the outlook for interest rates than by anything else. Once they start to come down - or, rather, once investors are convinced that they are to be cut in the not too distant future - the market is likely to take off. This week's developments are not in themselves enough to induce a policy shift from the Bundesbank. Commentators believe that the metalworkers' settlement was low enough to remove the possibility of another rise - but that it will not lead automatically to a cut. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said on Monday night that the agreement followed a pattern of excessive awards in recent months. Even if present inflation rates dropped to between 3.5 to 4 per cent by the end of the year, from 4.6 per cent at present, that would still be too high, said Mr Schlesinger said. And money supply was growing too rapidly, he cautioned. Thus it seems that the spectre of monetary rectitude will hover over the market for some months ahead although, as Mr Jochen Neynaber of Schroder-Munchmeyer Hengst puts it, the pay settlement at the beginning of the week makes it much more likely 'that there will be a cut in rates - eventually'.</p>

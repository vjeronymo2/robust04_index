			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A document on civic accord  should be called a declaration and should be signed, believes  President of Tatarstan Shaymiyev. He believes the title of a  declaration would mean a milder political approach to the  agreement being concluded. Shaymiyev, a deputy of the  Federation Council, said this in an interview to ITAR-TASS  during a break in the council's meeting where the draft treaty  on civic accord is being discussed today.    The Tatarstan president believes the agreement refers above  all to parties and movements, but for comprehensive accord it  should be joined by all republics, territories, regions.  Stability in the country for the implementation of the economic  reform should be achieved within definite political frameworks,  Shaymiyev said.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Enigmatic Christmas cards: Dominic Lawson is tired of receiving greetings from strangers This year I finally managed it. I sent out no Christmas cards, except to my immediate family. For years I would vow not to shower friends and colleagues with these garish tickets to nowhere. But then, as December dragged on and my desk began to pile up with the cards that had been sent to me, I would crack and rush out to the post office with belated reciprocity. This year, my meanness has got the better of my social insecurity. At some times the feelings of guilt have been sharper than at others. The card carefully chosen by good friends, and painstakingly inscribed by their three-year-old child, is a real choker. At the other end of the spectrum is the card displaying a photograph of the family of someone I scarcely know and with nothing but a printed message inside. I am not a Christian but somehow the substitution in such cards of the holy family with that of the sender's own has always struck me as rather preposterous. Operating at a different level of irritation are the cards from people who think that a straight line with a couple of dots on top is a proper signature. What makes it worse is the knowledge that this lazy hieroglyphic is the result of the sender having to sign hundreds of identical cards in one rushed signing session with a secretary standing by. Yet still I want to know who this man or woman is. We are entering here the murky world of the corporate Christmas card, sent from office to office, from business contact to business contact. The problem has been caused by companies which have allocated part of their public relations budget to the purchase of thousands of such cards. Those of us who have to buy our own Christmas cards, at about Pounds 1 each, cannot compete with those who can simply ask their secretary to make another dip into the stationery cupboard. They, of course, need not discriminate at all: the choice for them is only whether to sign or not to sign. The cleverest ones avoid even this brief moment of decision by embossing all their cards with a facsimile signature. I will not reveal which head of one of the royal houses of Europe does this on his Christmas cards because I always have liked the look of his card on my mantelpiece and I would therefore not want to offend His Royal Highness. Of course if you are a King you need not use a surname. Which is just as well for you: also on my list of Christmas cards to be sniffed at are those from people who sign with their full name. If we are not on first name terms why are we exchanging such fondnesses? Why, Virginia, why? On the other hand, Virginia, I much prefer your studied formality to the misplaced chumminess of the Churches' Media Officers, a strange ecumenical ensemble which has sent me card signed personally by 'Eric', 'Patrick and 'Steve'. Fortunately the printed side of the card reveals that Eric is the Rev Eric Shegog, the director of communications at Church House, so that is one Christmas mystery solved. And, who knows, perhaps I will at some time in the future meet and learn much from the Rev Eric Shegog, and then his card will seem merely an anticipation of fine friendship. The same, I fear, cannot happen between me and the 'University of Wolverhampton', nor between the 'Editor of The Spectator' and the 'Mersey Partnership Team'. I feel we have too little in common, at this stage in our lives. And who are you, anyway? However, to those at the Grand Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, an establishment even Sir James Goldsmith regards as something of an extravagant treat, I say thank you for your lovely and unexpected Christmas card: and if you ever care to ask me to stay one Christmas, I and my family would be delighted to accept your kind and thoughtful invitation. Yet among the shower of envelopes and other fruits of the forest there are one or two cards missing this year. In particular, John Major's name no longer appears in my Christmas card in-tray. Is it something I wrote? No, it can't be. I am being properly punished for not sending a Christmas card to the prime minister last year. And Christmas 1994 will obviously bring an even leaner harvest. It serves Scrooge right. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

Before the Nov. 6 vote, local GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes is  expecting visits from the President, vice president, governor, U.S. senator and  former President Ronald Reagan. First up is Dan Quayle, due Oct. 25. "That's  why I've always said how futile the Democrats' efforts are in this county,  because they don't have the galaxy of big stars," says Fuentes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> O.C.

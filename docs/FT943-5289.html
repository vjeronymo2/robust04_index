			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The chance for a Euro-debate Last week's proposals from France and Germany for building a 'hard core' of states at the centre of Europe launch an essential debate on the future of the European Union. They mark an end to the uneasy truce over the pace and scope of integration that had prevailed since ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The suggestions from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, and Germany's governing Christian Democrats address the question at the heart of the EU's intergovernmental conference in 1996: how can the Union remain an integrated structure while embracing an ever-increasing number of member states? The challenge is to build a Union that will be more numerous in its membership, more effective in its decision-making, more open in its relations with the rest of the world, more competitive in its economic structures, and more capable of winning loyalty from its citizens. These are goals to which not just France and Germany but Britain too must pledge support. Since an expanded Europe will be more diverse, it will have to be flexible enough to embrace varying patterns of integration. Unpalatable though it may be for some countries, Europe must accept the inevitability of a multi-speed future - without in the process allowing its decision-making machinery to become hopelessly cumbersome. The desire to open the EU to the east is a top priority for several member states including Germany and Britain, and rightly so. Reinforcing parliamentary democracy and market capitalism in central and eastern Europe is vital to the entire continent's stability. But unless EU governments find the right formula for enlargement, the process could well aggravate the existing strains in the Union. Widening and deepening - enlargement and integration - will not prove easily compatible. Huge strains For a start, enlargement will impose huge strains on the EU budget, both in agriculture and in relation to the structural funds. The German document says a fresh round of reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy will be needed to enable the central and eastern European states to join the Union around the year 2000. This is a welcome shift in thinking since, up to now, Bonn has shrunk from publicly accepting the need for such painful adjustments. The message needs to be brought home with brutal clarity, not only in France but also in the Mediterranean states that remain major net beneficiaries from agricultural and structural funds. Still more potential for discord lies in the German admission that Italy, Britain and Spain are unlikely to be in the group that first accomplishes economic and monetary union. This assertion, although controversial, is little more than a statement of the obvious. In monetary affairs, as well as in immigration and justice matters and foreign and defence policy, different EU groupings are already co-operating with varying degrees of intensity, as Mr John Major pointed out three months ago in espousing a 'multi-speed, multi-track Europe'. Hard core However, the existence of a 'hard core' for the third stage of Emu does not inevitably mean the same group constituting the core for all other forms of co-operation. And it does not mean that countries outside Emu should not play a leading part in other fields. Italy, Spain and indeed Britain are strongly committed to development of a common foreign and security policy. Other constellations would be keener, say, on a joint immigration policy. The key to making such 'variable geometry' work is twofold. First, co-operation between groups of states should be inclusive and open to extension, rather than exclusive. Second, to avoid undermining the existing level of integration, it is important that members and future members of the EU agree on certain minimum essential requirements. Above all, economic liberalisation, through the single market, must remain the central component of efforts to improve the Union's productive capacity and its citizens' prosperity. Enforcement of the rules of the single market, and its extension to areas like energy and telecommunications, are essential goals from which there can be no opt-outs. By launching debate on these issues now, the French and German leaderships have taken a calculated risk. Their prescriptions will certainly offend public opinion - not only in existing 'peripheral' member states but also quite possibly in the Nordic countries which face more or less finely-balanced referendums on membership in the autumn. But the truth is that all member states, present and future, have some extremely difficult questions to answer if they are to make the expanding Union work. It is vital that these issues are aired thoroughly and publicly over the next two years. Only then can the Union's tasks of widening and deepening be successfully reconciled.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Expulsion Reveals Advisers' True Role"] </F>   [Text] Any remaining illusions about China's real motives  for establishing the group of Hong Kong affairs advisers have  now been swept away with the expulsion of Anthony Cheung,  dismissed for having the temerity to join the new Democratic  Party.    The initial fear was that the advisers group would become a  kind of shadow government, undermining the current  administration of Hong Kong. The initial, most optimistic hope,  was that the advisers would open up a channel of communication  between Hong Kong and China so that the incoming sovereign state  would have its ear closer to the ground in its new territory.    Both the fear and hope have failed to materialise. The  advisers' conclaves have proved to be too incoherent to have  much impact. They certainly give no credible impression of  forming any kind of shadow government.    On the other hand, it has become clear that China has no  real  intention of creating a truly representative group of advisers.  The membership consists of longstanding supporters of the  Chinese Government, converts, or potential converts.    The exercise of appointing advisers has become an exercise  in  giving rewards to the chosen few. Thus, Elsie Tu was rewarded  for her outspoken criticism of the governor and new converts,  such as Allen Lee, are being offered an opportunity to move  closer to the embrace of the new masters.    The Chinese Government is employing tactics that are  familiar  to those versed in the works of the Soviet Union's first leader  V I Lenin. His strategy for winning power for the  revolutionaries was one of the few aspects of revolutionary  thought absorbed by the infant Chinese Communist Party, under  the tutelage of the Communist International's agent, Michael  Borodin.    The essence of Leninist strategy was to widen the net of  those who could be called upon to support the revolution, using  the outer periphery of supporters to attract mass support, while  ensuring that real power resided with a highly-disciplined  revolutionary clique.    Beyond the inner circle, a broader band of revolutionaries,  committed to the cause but not trusted with full knowledge of  the strategy, were to be brought together.    In essence, these tactics have been dusted down and employed  again in China's battle for control of Hong Kong. The Chinese  Government has grouped its allies in three categories. First,  the long-term hard-core supporters, second are those showing a  willingness to be fully committed (but not yet fully trusted)  supporters, and third are those with whom it is thought  desirable to form a tactical alliance.    In many ways, the third group is the most important because  they give China access to a much larger section of the  population than the other two groups. In addition, the  recruitment of allies, as opposed to fully committed supporters,  provides an opportunity to isolate those considered hostile to  the Chinese Government.    Thus, China has created a complex web of advisory bodies and  appointed a number of people to important-sounding posts within  the Chinese parliamentary system. The strategy is to reward  friends, make new friends, and mobilise the widest possible  alliance against the enemy, who in current circumstances, are  the pro-democracy groups.    Those who remain within the third group of the Chinese  alliance will have to think long and hard about whether they  intend to be used in this way. It seems most likely that they  will stick with their new friends, although some might emit a  few whimpers of regret over Cheung's dismissal.    As many members of the third group used to be counted among  the colonial government's chosen few, they should be fully aware  of what to expect. For years, the British administration, in a  more selective and elitist way, played the game that China is  now playing with equal skill.    The colonial rulers would pluck a number of "suitable"  people  from the ranks of the Chinese community and shower them with  honours, positions of alleged responsibility, and fancy titles.    They were then expected to go out and extol the virtues of  benevolent British rule. They would also be paraded on  occasions that demanded a token display of confirmation that the  colonial administration had the support of the local population.    The Hong Kong Government still makes desultory attempts to  mobilise its supporting forces in this manner but the imminence  of Chinese rule has made the exercise rather problematic.    History, as Karl Marx, the founder of communist thought,  said, is repeating itself; first as tragedy, then as farce. It  is in this light that we view the purging of Anthony Cheung from  China's advisory group.</p>

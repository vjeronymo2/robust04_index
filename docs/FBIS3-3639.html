He stressed in his speech: Party and  government leading cadres at all levels should firmly cultivate  a mass viewpoint, conscientiously implement the mass line, exert  utmost efforts to do practical things for the masses, try by all  possible means to do practical things for enterprises, fully  mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, further  pool the efforts of all sectors, work with one heart and one  mind, seek development with all-out efforts, and create  brilliant achievements in Tianjin.    After listing to speeches given by several deputies, Gao  Dezhan said: All of you have great confidence in Tianjin's  development prospects and unanimously held that the development  objectives defined by the municipal authorities are encouraging,  in conformity with Tianjin's reality, and fully reflect the will  of the people across the municipality. This has strengthened the  confidence of the municipal party committee and the municipal  government in doing their work well. Certainly, to realize the  development objectives and comprehensively fulfill all tasks of  this year, we will face many difficulties. This requires our  painstaking efforts to successfully carry out all fields of  work. The most important is that leading cadres at all levels  should firmly bear in mind the fundamental purpose of  wholeheartedly serving the people under the new situation. It  is necessary to fully understand that strengthening the  flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of people is a  fundamental political issue. Even all things change, the  original aim will not change. We must not slightly slacken our  efforts in this fundamental issue or forget it under any  circumstances. The people's feelings and complaints are the  most important because they directly affect the success or  failure of our work. If we do a good job in resolving this  issue, we will overcome all difficulties and make our  undertakings more invigorating.    Gao Dezhan said: We must carry out all party and government  tasks and all activities for the sake of the people and uphold  Comrade Xiaoping's "three criteria," particularly the things  that are conducive for raising the people's living standards.  Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should  regard the immediate interests of the people as a matter of  prime importance and as the fundamental starting and resting  points for doing all work. All issues that affect the basic  living standards of the people should be regarded as the major  and urgent matters. No one is allowed to treat them  indifferently or adopt an unconcerned attitude. Through our  efforts, we should help the people eliminate misgivings, seek  benefits, enable them to enjoy real benefits and see the hopes.    Gao Dezhan stressed: The masses are the sources of strength  and the foundation for achieving success. The working class and  the masses of people across the municipality are the masters,  the mainstay, and main forces for invigorating Tianjin and  creating brilliant achievements. The past brilliant achievements  were created by the people across the municipality and the new  historical chapter must also be written by them. Leaders at all  levels must truly and wholeheartedly rely on the broad masses  of people, go to the grass roots and the masses while doing each  and every work, organize the masses, boost their enthusiasm,  respect their will, and give full play to their pioneering  spirit. This is essential for implementing the party's basic  line and doing all tasks well, and should be regarded as one of  the important criteria for evaluating leading cadres at all  levels.    Gao Dezhan said: The higher the enthusiasm of the masses is,  the more concern the leading cadres at all levels should give to  the masses, particularly those with difficulties in their living  standards. Tianjin has good traditions for doing practical  things for the masses. We should continue to display this good  tradition , and unceasingly enhance the level of doing practical  things. When doing practical things, the thing of prime  importance is to do it with real efforts, turn all things we  managed into a success, and enable the masses to enjoy real  benefits. To do practical things, the most important is to  unceasingly raise the income of urban and rural people under the  premise of deepening reform, developing production, improving  management, and raising efficiency, and let the people have  money in their pockets. This is a major matter which the party  committees and governments at all levels should do.    Gao Dezhan stressed in particular: Doing practical things  for enterprises is also very important. Doing practical things  for enterprises and the masses is an issue with two aspects.  When enterprises are invigorating, the workers will become  prosperous; when enterprises are not successfully managed,  Tianjin will have no hope and the living standards of the broad  masses of workers will be hard to improve. We should try by all  possible means to invigorate enterprises. Well-managed  enterprises should become more invigorating and difficult  enterprises should have a turn for the better. Pertinent  departments at all levels, departments dealing with  comprehensive work, and administrative law-enforcing departments  should further enhance the concept of serving enterprises,  change functions, streamline organs, change work style, do  practical things for enterprises on their own initiative, help  them solve problems, provide timely help, change their  operational mechanism, and create a good external environment  for enterprises. Enterprises should also use reform as a  motivation, strive to successfully readjust structure, develop  products, strengthen management, conduct technological  transformation, train workers, build leading bodies, deeply tap  potential, and improve their own skills.    Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: The masses are the  foundation of society and enterprises are the foundation of the  economy. As long as we exert utmost efforts to do practical  things for the masses, try by all possible means to do practical  things for enterprises, and rely on the strength and wisdom of  the masses of people, we will surely make the work of Tianjin a  success.</p>

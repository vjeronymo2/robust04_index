			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Monday Interview: The sure touch of a survivor - Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, talks to Philip Stephens Sir Norman Fowler is one of the great survivors of Conservative politics. As others who sat around Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first cabinet table in 1979 squabble from the House of Lords over how an economic miracle shattered into a mirage, Sir Norman is among those still trying to pick up the pieces. Now Conservative party chairman, he left the cabinet in January 1990, telling Mrs Thatcher that after nearly 11 years he wanted to spend more time with his family. Mr John Major's move into Downing Street 10 months later persuaded him that that he had time still for politics. By the end of this week he may be forgiven for having third thoughts. When he moved into Smith Square last April Sir Norman saw his principal role as a peacetime chairman who would overhaul the creaking structures of a party which wins elections despite its campaigning skills, rather than because of them. That remains a priority. Within the next few months he will announce the most fundamental reform of his party's organisation for 40 years. It will weld together the disparate wings into a single board of directors and begin to whittle down a Pounds 10m overdraft. But his energies this week in Brighton will be absorbed by the latest bloody episode in the Tory civil war over Europe. His job will be to rally the support of grass-roots activists for Mr Major over the Maastricht treaty; to persuade them that images of Mr Norman Lamont should be cast from their minds when they issue the traditional call for the return of capital punishment; and to ensure the now Lady Thatcher is silent. Sir Norman, who has no department of his own but sits in on the cabinet's political discussions, is one of the pivotal figures in Mr Major's effort to regain a grip. Rooted in the same Tory centre-ground as the prime minister, his job is to offer the soothing reassurance which has made him a master in the art of lowering the political temperature. The party's footsoldiers are feeling bewildered and betrayed. Six months ago they anticipated a celebration in Brighton of their fourth consecutive election victory. That hope was shattered in a few hours on September 16 when the City of London's young men in braces kicked away the central plank of the prime minister's economic and foreign policies. Instead of economic recovery, there is continued recession; instead of unity on Europe, there is open warfare. The prime minister who promised he would never devalue has done just that - by a whacking 18 per cent. Sir Norman, of course, does not quite see it like that. The Man from Middle England, whose sureness of political touch saw him emerge unscathed from some of the most difficult posts in a Tory cabinet, emphasises that Mr Major will fight. He applauds last Thursday's decision by the cabinet to begin to fill the vacuum left by sterling's ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism by pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht. The activists need leadership. Sir Norman omits to add that last week he pressed the prime minister as hard as anyone to demonstrate that leadership before - rather than after - this week's conference. 'My own view is that the centre of the party backs John Major's stand, backs his negotiating skills . . . and are also in a sense delighted that he has come out fighting.' The theme crops up again and again during a 40-minute interview. If the Tory party in the country gets clear leadership, its activists will respond: 'One of the messages of this conference is that this is a time when the party is under attack. . . . We recognise that . . . but it is also a time when we will signal very clearly that we are fighting back'. Left unspoken is the thought that the most threatening assault comes not from the Labour party but from the Euro-sceptics in the Tory party. Lady Thatcher, Lord Tebbit, Lord Ridley and 50 or more of their acolytes on the Conservative backbenches in the Commons look far more threatening than that nice pro-European Mr John Smith. After signs of cabinet divisions over whether Mr Major should drop Maastricht, the party chairman is determined to get one point across - every single cabinet minister had signed up to ratification. Last week's decision to press forward with Maastricht followed a 'discussion around the cabinet table, the political cabinet, in which most ministers - almost all - took part and in which everyone was agreed that this was the way forward'. There is then a gentle warning to his colleagues as well to the Euro-sceptics: 'I think opponents of this course should actually take note of that (agreement). Because there are not going to be people going behind and saying, 'Well, actually it has nothing to do with me. We believe in something else.' That isn't going to happen.' Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Howard and Mr Lamont - the least enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet - have been forewarned. Sir Norman has persuaded Lady Thatcher that she should reserve her next onslaught on Maastricht for a more suitable occasion. He spoke at length to her 10 days ago and agreed that she should step on to the platform alongside Mr Major on Thursday morning just before Mr Lamont's speech. The Lady is unpredictable, but Sir Norman seems confident enough that she will stick to a silent part: 'I had a long talk with Margaret. . . . She was in tremendously good form. What she said was that she wanted things to happen as normally as they could. But the party conference will want to make a fuss of her and rightly so.' But what about the economy? Constituency parties after all are crammed with small-business owners, who have been among the worst hit by the recession. For two years Mr Lamont told them the pain of the ERM would bring its rewards in stable prices and renewed growth. Neither are in sight, and the attempt to hold the exchange rate has been abandoned. Sir Norman opens up the tap of reassurance: 'I think what one says is what the truthful position is. It was the right decision to go into the ERM. But given the totally tumultuous circumstances that we faced at the time it was right to suspend our membership'. But surely the representatives (there are no delegates in the Tory party) will want to know whether the government still has an economic policy? 'What the chancellor I'm sure will be spelling out is that, whether we are in the ERM or not, what matters is the underlying policy of, for example, the control of inflation and the control of public spending.' Neither will be easy and this year's spending round is proving particularly rough: 'Any government department has to act within the confines of what the nation can afford,' says Sir Norman. The implication is that the Conservatives can no longer guarantee to meet the manifesto pledges they offered to the electorate only six months ago. Sir Norman moves on for the remaining minutes to his other role, acknowledging in effect that Tory party finances are in as bad a state as the nation's: 'We have an overdraft of over Pounds 10m. That is an absurd position for this party to be in'. Popular myth has it that the party is a gleaming, well-oiled machine, the Rolls Royce of British politics. In fact, local constituency parties - independent of Smith Square and represented by a separate National Association - are frequently at war with Sir Norman's empire in London. Many associations refuse to hand over any money to the central office, accusing Smith Square of waste and mismanagement. A group of 50 constituencies have demanded an emergency meeting of the umbrella Central Council to force through the 'democratisation' of the party's organisation. The chairman hopes to outflank the critics by putting representatives of all wings of the party on his new executive boards and by introducing a modicum of transparency into the central office's notoriously secretive accounts. He has chosen a finance director, and the other newly created post of chief executive should be filled by the end of this year. That, of course, is if Sir Norman is not gripped by an overwhelming desire to spend more time with his family after a week of civil war in Brighton.

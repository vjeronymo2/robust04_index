			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Tighter margins hit Dart TIGHTER MARGINS in aviation services and the cost of introducing Electra freighters into European service hit the profit of Dart Group. In the year ended March 31 1993 it lifted turnover from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 42.8m, but saw pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 1.66m. The introduction costs would be fully depreciated during the present year, Mr Philip Meeson, chairman, assured shareholders. The largest operation within aviation services is Channel Express (Air Services) which operates 11 freighter aircraft on contract services, and leases additional capacity when necessary. On the distribution side, the group specialises in the nation wide moving of cut flowers and pot plants, and the importing of ornamental fish from suppliers throughout the world. Earnings per share came to 7.5p (9.4p). The final dividend is 2p, for a maintained 3.3p total. For the current year there were indications of improved performance, and trading so far was encouraging, said Mr Meeson.</p>

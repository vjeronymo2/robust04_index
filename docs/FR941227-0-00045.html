			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1374(d)(5)(A) provides that any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period but attributable to periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in gain. Section 1374(d)(5)(B) provides that any item of deduction properly taken into account during the recognition period but attributable to periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in loss. The proposed regulations provide that an S corporation's items of income or deduction generally are recognized built-in gain or loss if the item would have been included in gross income or allowed as a deduction against gross income before the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer (accrual method rule). The proposed regulations provide that all rules applying to accrual method taxpayers (whether from the Code, regulations, administrative pronouncements, or otherwise) also apply for purposes of the accrual method rule with two exceptions: (1) Section 461(h)(2)(C), relating to liabilities for tort and worker's compensation for which payment constitutes economic performance, and (2) section 469, relating to suspended passive activity losses. The proposed regulations also provide special rules for certain items including an S corporation's section 481(a) adjustments, income reported under the completed contract method, income reported under the installment method, and distributive share of partnership items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1374(d)(1) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is the amount by which the fair market value of all its assets exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of all its assets as of the beginning of the recognition period. Section 1374(d)(5)(C) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is properly adjusted for items of income and deduction that would be recognized built-in gain or loss if taken into account during the recognition period. The proposed regulations provide that the S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is determined by reference to a hypothetical sale of all the assets of the corporation immediately before the beginning of the recognition period to a buyer that assumed all the corporation's liabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1374(b)(2) provides that an S corporation's net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation are allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in gain. The proposed regulations provide that no other loss carryforwards may be used as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain. Section 1374(b)(3) provides that an S corporation's special fuels credit for the year, and business credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation, are allowed as credits against the section 1374 tax. The proposed regulations provide that no other credits or credit carryforwards may be used as a credit against the section 1374 tax. The loss carryforwards, credits, and credit carryforwards allowed to reduce the section 1374 tax are collectively referred to as the section 1374 attributes in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

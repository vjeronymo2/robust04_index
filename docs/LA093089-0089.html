			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING A LONG SHADOW;  </P> <P> OVERLOOKED BY RECRUITERS, 5-10 DOWIS IS WALKING TALL AT AIR FORCE  </P> <P> Royston, Ga., is hardly more than two quick pumps of the brake pedal along  Highway 29 heading into South Carolina. If you choose to pause at either of the  town's stoplights, you will notice the mural of Ty Cobb on the water tower, the  statue of Ty Cobb at city hall and the Ty Cobb Memorial Hospital near his  birthplace.  </P> <P> Soon, folks in Royston might have to erect another water tower. Another native  son, Air Force Academy quarterback Dee Dowis, is gaining acclaim, to the mild  surprise and immense pleasure of locals who remember him as a scrawny kid  running the streets from the time he was, well, knee high to Ty Cobb's statue.  </P> <P> Dowis, 21, has grown -- numerically and emotionally, if not quite physically --  into a scrawny major college quarterback whose elusive running has helped Air  Force post a 4-0 record this season. It also has put Dowis in the running for  the Heisman Trophy along with Notre Dame's Tony Rice, West Virgina's Major  Harris and all the other bigger names and bodies.  </P> <P> So far, Dowis seems to be a contender. The 5-foot-10 (wearing heels), 153-pound  (after a pasta dinner) senior leads the nation in rushing with averages of 145  yards and 16.5 points a game going into the Falcons' contest today against  Colorado State at Fort Collins, Colo.  </P> <P> Air Force, somewhat unaccustomed to such national attention for its football  program, has nonetheless launched a comparatively restrained Heisman campaign  on Dowis' behalf. On the grass-roots level, some of Royston's 2,404 residents  already have talked to Helen Brown, Dowis' mother, about making Dee as famous  as Cobb.  </P> <P> "Everywhere I go, I swear, I can hardly do my work without people stopping me  and saying how proud they are of him," Brown said. "Our whole town follows him.  They say to me, we're going to have to change that sign (on Highway 29) to  'Home of Ty Cobb and Dee Dowis'. Wouldn't that be something?"  </P> <P> What makes Dowis different from the norm, and what might sway some  underdog-conscious Heisman voters is his slight build, the unsullied image of a  military man and the wistful fact that his football career will soon end.  </P> <P> All cadets have a five-year military commitment after graduation and, unlike  the special consideration given to the Navy's Napoleon McCallum and David  Robinson, the Air Force has not made allowances for star athletes in the past  and says it will not in the future.  </P> <P> "Chad Hennings (an Air Force All-American defensive tackle in 1987) came out of  here a few years ago and he probably would've gone number two or three in the  draft, and he couldn't go pro," Dowis said. "I guess that answers that  question."  </P> <P> Dowis said he would not mind giving professional football a try -- as a wide  receiver, not as a quarterback. But he accepts the inherent circumstances, says  he only plays football for fun anyway. Next year, Dowis probably will pursue a  master's degree in business and perhaps serve as a graduate assistant coach for  Air Force.  </P> <P> Dowis has an ability to elude tacklers -- juke and slither are football  writers' favorite descriptions -- and has led the team to the second best total  offense average in the country. It is the whole package that attracts  inordinate attention. People are suckers for men in uniforms.  </P> <P> It has reached the point that this chronic overachiever is dealing with  overexposure. The national media has found its way to the Academy and done so  in droves.  </P> <P> Introverted and occasionally embarrassed around strangers, Dowis does not find  talking about football nearly as fun as playing it.  </P> <P> He arrived unavoidably late for an interview Wednesday in a storage room  adjoining the sports information office at Air Force. He looked tired and  confirmed that he was "worn out." A publicist sat Dowis down and told him that  his 3 o'clock interview would be rescheduled, to which Dowis replied, "Cool."  It already was after 3 and this was Dowis' 2 o'clock appointment. Practice  would be at 4, and Dowis also needed treatment on his left knee, which was  injured last week against Texas El Paso.  </P> <P> He is unfailingly polite and speaks with a soft Southern drawl. However, he's  easily distracted by the same unimaginative questions about his Heisman  prospects, his height and the structured military life.  </P> <P> He sat through a 20-minute interview without making eye-contact and bided time  by tightening a stray string of athletic tape around his left index finger. He  watched the tip turn from red to blue with steady pressure, then released the  string. He repeated the process throughout. At one point, Dowis rubbed his  temples so hard in trying to hold back fatigue that red marks appeared.  </P> <P> It is consistent with Dowis' accommodating nature, however, that he has yet to  turn down an interview request. His reticence is more from bewilderment than  cynicism.  </P> <P> "It gets to me at times," Dowis said. "Like right now. I'm just worn out. The  last few weeks, there's been a lot (of interviews). But it brings attention to  the school, and that's good. I understand that."  </P> <P> Dowis also seems to have been born without an ego. By most accounts, he is a  modest and serious kid who never asked for all this attention.  </P> <P> His standard response to Heisman speculation: "I think it's an honor just to be  mentioned. I don't even think about it."  </P> <P> Jay Mariotti, a columnist for the Rocky Mountain News, has written that Dowis'  only Heisman drawback may be that he does not care if he wins the award. A  recent conversation between columnist and quarterback:  </P> <P> "You mean you don't have any thoughts at all about the Heisman?"  </P> <P> "That's right."  </P> <P> "Doesn't your family talk about the attention you're starting to receive?"  </P> <P> "I haven't talked to them about it."  </P> <P> "What about CNN? Was that (interview) a thrill?"  </P> <P> "They're nice people."  </P> <P> "Didn't they ask you about the Heisman?"  </P> <P> "I don't remember."  </P> <P> "Dee, I gather you don't want to talk about the Heisman."  </P> <P> "Exactly."  </P> <P> There is more about Dowis to explore than hyped awards and the complexities of  the wishbone offense. Dowis has an abiding love for football and family, common  among Georgians.  </P> <P> Dee was 3 when his father, Leonard, died of a heart attack. Leonard Dowis had  been a local football hero who would have played halfback for the University of  Georgia, 30 miles south in Athens, had World War II not intervened. Leonard, in  later years, had coached high school football in Royston but quit shortly  before his only son was born.  </P> <P> Dowis' mother, who married local businessman Harold Brown when Dee was 7, said  her son's physical attributes, determination and mannerisms resemble Leonard's.  </P> <P> "He was little, like Dee," Helen Brown says of her first husband. "I never saw  (Leonard) play ball in high school, but I'm told he ran just like Dee. That  cutting and juking, you know. There, he definitely takes after his father. They  both hate to lose.  </P> <P> "The day before (Leonard) died, he wanted Dee to go to Y-camp if he wanted to  learn football because he didn't want to coach him. It was as if he was giving  me a message about how to raise Dee, like he knew he was going to die. A  premonition or something."  </P> <P> Leonard Dowis never played for his beloved Georgia Bulldogs. Neither did Dee,  but for a different reason. They did not want him.  </P> <P> Normally, Vince Dooley, former Bulldog coach, would not let a prospect leave  the state without an exit visa. But in the big pond that is Georgia high school  football, Dowis apparently was too small a fish. Despite impressive prep  rushing statistics, other schools also ignored Dowis. Recruiters from nearby  Clemson, Duke and Furman visited Royston and left after seeing Dowis in the  flesh.  </P> <P> Jeff Davis, Dowis' coach at Franklin County High School, described many  recruiting visits in a recent interview with the Rocky Mountain News: "I'd go  get (Dowis) out of class, and then I'd watch (recruiters') eyes when they saw  him walk in. You could just see it in their eyes. They'd be thinking, 'This is  the guy?' "  </P> <P> Dowis said he was not particularly military-minded when he applied to Air  Force, but he wanted a quality education as well as the chance to play football  in college.  </P> <P> Perhaps an indication of the culture shock to come was the reaction from  townspeople when they first heard Dowis had received a scholarship to the Air  Force Academy.  </P> <P> "They all asked," said Dowis' mother, "what base Dee'd be stationed at. I found  it funny. They really didn't know."  </P> <P> It turned out that Dowis didn't know all that was involved at the Academy,  located at the base of the Rampart Range north of Colorado Springs. They gave  him a heavier course load than he would have received at most civilian  universities, which he had trouble handling.  </P> <P> Dowis' longing for Royston almost led him to transfer after his freshman year.  His mother remembers emotional evening phone calls home that first year. She  said Dee occasionally knelt at the Cadet Chapel and prayed for guidance.  </P> <P> "I didn't know anything about the military," Dowis said. "They just gave me the  chance to play football and get a great education at the same time. This is  definitely one of the top academic places in the country. People on the outside  see this as pretty prestigious.  </P> <P> "It was tough (the first year). I didn't quite know what I was getting into, so  I was kind of shocked when I got here. I didn't have my mind made up to stay  here the whole time when I first got here."  </P> <P> He had all but signed transfer papers to Georgia Tech after his freshman year,  but his mother, his high school coach and Cal McCombs, an Air Force assistant  coach, talked him out of leaving the Academy.  </P> <P> "I was really close," Dowis said. "I'd gone to Tech and talked to them, and I  just came back (home) to get my stuff. But I just couldn't quit (the Academy)  when it came right down to it. Also, I went to coach McCombs' house and talked  to him for three hours that night. I decided to stay.  </P> <P> "Now, yeah, I like it here. I think a lot of it has to do with being a senior."  </P> <P> Dowis' quiet demeanor turns aggressive when on the field. His running style is  similar to that of former Oklahoma quarterback Jamelle Holloway. In fact,  former Sooner Coach Barry Switzer said Dowis could have started for him at  Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry has said Dowis is a more talented option  quarterback than Notre Dame's Rice. Irish Coach Lou Holtz will not say that.  But, after watching Dowis and reading his statistics, Holtz deemed Dowis a  Heisman contender.  </P> <P> If Dowis maintains his prolific statistical pace, he will be hard to discount  when ballots are cast.  </P> <P> As a sophomore, Dowis rushed for 1,315 yards, a National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. record for quarterbacks. Last season, in a more balanced attack, he  gained 972 yards. The Falcons pass sparingly, but Dowis is capable of going to  the air for the Force. Last season, he tied an NCAA record when he completed 11  straight passes against Northwestern.  </P> <P> Dowis' prowess, however, is running. He has rushed for 2,869 yards in his  career, only 430 short of the NCAA record for career rushing yardage by a  quarterback, held since 1974 by Freddie Solomon of Tampa. Dowis only needs to  average 53.8 yards per game in Air Force's final eight games to break Solomon's  record.  </P> <P> There is an outside chance that Dowis might break the record at home on Oct. 14  against Notre Dame. Of potentially more significance in that game would be a  matchup between Dowis and Rice on national television. Each team's potentially  unbeaten record, and hundreds of Heisman votes, could be in the balance.  </P></p>

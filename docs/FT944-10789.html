			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Market has the right AIM for young companies Sir, Your epitaph for the Alternative Investment Market (Lex: 'Questionable AIM', November 7) is premature, to say the least. M&amp;G's statement that its funds will avoid the market comes as no surprise to those involved in the design of the AIM, and indeed we would have been more surprised had M&amp;G indicated that it would be investing. The AIM has from the outset been conceived as a market for the larger retail investor, and the stock exchange's proposals have quite rightly focused on balancing the needs of those investors with the need to reduce access costs for young companies to the minimum. The likely size of AIM companies will automatically lead the great majority of institutions to ignore the new market. You lament the absence of private sector initiatives to meet the needs of young companies. Past experience of such markets has shown that the confusion created by a diverse portfolio of products obstructs their growth and acceptance (witness the confusion among investors, intermediaries and companies over the relative merits of the Unlisted Securities Market, Rule 595.2/4.2 and the Third Market). A single, effective solution, launched on the back of an infrastructure already in existence and paid for, which can provide one forum for the raising of capital in amounts well below the range of the Official List, should be welcomed as a significant tool for the support of industrial investment. The USM, in being too much like its elder brother, failed in this respect, as would the European Venture Capital Association's proposals. Provided the exchange remains true to its current vision, the AIM has every chance of meeting an urgent need. Gavin Don, Equitas, 2 Clermiston Terrace, Edinburgh EH12 6XF</p>

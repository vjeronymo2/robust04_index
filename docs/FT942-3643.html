			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Four county councils to go in Banham's radical proposals Plans to abolish four county councils and cut the powers of a fifth were published yesterday in a radical blueprint for local government reform. Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England, which is charged with recommending new local authority structures to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said that the two-tier system of counties and districts should be replaced with new all-purpose 'unitary authorities'. These would have all the powers now shared by districts and counties. Warrington in Cheshire and the city of Oxford would be given unitary status on their own boundaries. Elsewhere, the new authorities would be formed by merging current district councils, as the commission believes the new councils would need a population of between 150,000 and 250,000 to be viable. Huntingdonshire, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, represents in parliament and which is administratively a part of Cambridgeshire, is the one exception. It would be given unitary status on its own boundaries in spite of its small population, in a move which echoes last week's decision to give unitary status to Rutland, another ancient county. In Kent the two-tier system would be retained across most of the county, against the government's wishes. The commission has said that in all the counties it is merely stating one 'preference', and has provided other alternatives which it believes are viable. All households in the counties concerned will receive leaflets on the different options next week, and will be invited to vote on which option they prefer. If change proves unpopular the government might be provided with an excuse to abandon the reform programme, which has already proved highly controversial in the counties for which the commission announced recommendations last year, such as Somerset and North Yorkshire. The cross-party Association of District Councils complained that in no county had the commission recommended the plans for mergers which local districts had presented while the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils welcomed the retention of two tiers in Kent. The commission's detailed proposals for the five counties are: Cambridgeshire The two-tier status quo is not on offer as an option, as both the county council and the districts proposed a unitary system. Huntingdonshire would become a unitary authority, following what the commission described as 'significant support for an unitary solution'. Peterborough and Fenland districts would merge, as would Cambridge City, South Cambridgeshire and East Cambridgeshire. Local politicians were still angry, as the county called for only two unitaries, while the districts wanted four, with unitary status for Cambridge. The Association of County Councils complained that outside Huntingdonshire, keeping the status quo had been the favoured option in the commission's first consultation, supported by 43 per cent of residents. Cheshire Cheshire's 966,000 people are to be asked to choose between three proposals. All would create a new unitary authority in Warrington, which was moved from Lancashire to Cheshire 20 years ago and now houses nearly 184,000 people after forced growth as a new town until the mid-1980s. The commission's preferred option for the rest of Cheshire is to redraw district boundaries creating four unitary authorities with between 143,000 and 250,000 people each. These would merge Chester with Ellesmere Port, Macclesfield with the town of Congleton, expand the current Halton district council, and create 'Crewe and Mid-Cheshire' to include Crewe, Nantwich and Northwich. The commission says this might cost Pounds 2m a year but could save Pounds 4m a year, with start-up costs between Pounds 24m and Pounds 29m. The alternative is a series of mergers on existing boundaries to create four authorities from seven, the smallest 124,000 people, the largest 236,000. Annual costs might be Pounds 1m but savings could be Pounds 4m. Start-up would cost between Pounds 23m and Pounds 28m. The third proposal is to leave the rest of Cheshire as a two-tier structure, with more power devolved to districts. Leaders of Congleton, one of the districts most affected, said yesterday that they would support this. The commission's preferred option would split their district, while abolishing the county for all but ceremonial purposes would threaten strategic planning. Cumbria The commission wants to cut Cumbria in two, controversially bisecting the Lake District, which would no longer have one overall authority. South Cumbria would take in Barrow-in-Furness and South Lakeland, with the Millom area of Copeland and the area south of Shap in Eden. The rest of the county, including Carlisle, would be linked in North Cumbria. The commission said responsibility for land use planning would be shared by the new councils and the Lake District National Park Planning Board. People would also be able to opt to return to the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland and Westmoreland for ceremonial and traditional purposes. Ms Ann Levick, joint commissioner for the area, said the consultation of residents which started next week was not a referendum but a means of ensuring people's views were taken seriously. Kent Only two unitary authorities would be created, both on the edge of greater London. North West Kent would be formed by a merger of Dartford and Gravesham, while Medway would take in Gillingham and Rochester district councils. The rest of the county would remain as it is. The reserve option is to split Kent into seven unitary authorities, but the county - one of the largest and most powerful, with several supporters on the Tory back benches - signalled it intends to fight to retain the status quo. Oxfordshire Oxford would be an independent city with a population of 131,500. The rest of the county would be split into two unitary authorities - Northern Oxfordshire - taking over Cherwell and West Oxfordshire; and Southern Oxfordshire, formed by a merger of Vale of White Horse and South Oxfordshire districts. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and an Oxfordshire MP, has called for the status quo to be kept. The commission's second option follows the county's plan for a large county-wide authority, abolishing district councils, with powers devolved to parishes and town councils.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F> Grants ECU10 Million in Aid To Help Create a Palestinian Police  Force"]    [Text] The European Commission took the provisions required  to make concrete the decision of principle (adopted by the  General Affairs Council of 18/19 April in the framework of joint  action under the CFSP [Common Foreign and Security Policy] "in  supporting the peace process in the Middle East") of granting  ECU10 million to assist in creating a Palestinian police force  in the Occupied Territories. Mr. Marin informed Mr. 'Arafat  this very Wednesday [4 May], in Cairo, of the Community  decision. It is now up to the Palestinian authorities to submit  operational projects that the Commission can finance (equipment,  wages, means of transport, etc., but excluding the purchase of  weapons). This measure is only one aspect of Community aid to  the Occupied Territories. The ECU10 million are from the 1994  budget, from a 50 million package for aid to these territories,  33 million of which have already been committed for housing,  schools, and technical assistance. For the 1994/98 period as a  whole, the Union is committed to supplying ECU500 million for  economic development in the Occupied Territories. The joint  action under CFSP decided on 19 April contains several other  initiatives alongside the emergency assistance for the police  force.</p>

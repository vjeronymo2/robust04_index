			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: Debate on Emu timing hots up - Economics Notebook European issues continue to fascinate and alarm. But while attention in the UK has been focused on today's Commons debate over contributions to the European Union budget and the British cabinet's 'suicide pact' to fend off the threat of a backbench Tory revolt, discussion elsewhere in Europe has shifted back to economic and monetary union. Half-forgotten pledges in the Maastricht Treaty have gained a new lease of life. The European Commission, in the person of Mr Giovanni Ravasio, its director general of economic and financial clauses, set the ball rolling about ten days ago when he declared that Emu was a 'feasible option' for 1997, the first target date in the treaty. Since then, some formidable figures have waded into the debate on the side of caution. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has stated his conviction that 'monetary policy integration in Europe can only be the outcome of a lengthy process.' He later criticised the Maastricht convergence criteria for low inflation and manageable budgetary positions as 'unambitious'. Interviewed by a French newspaper, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, pronounced the Maastricht timetable 'completely dead', while making clear that he was sympathetic to Emu as a general objective. Last week in Brussels, Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, challenged the whole idea of the Maastricht approach of gradual convergence towards Emu as 'economically fallacious and politically dangerous.' Convergence was 'neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for monetary unification,' Mr Martino said. Complaining that the 'convergence paradigm' might result in the division of Europe into a club of supposedly virtuous countries that met the criteria and others deemed unfit for such an exclusive club, Mr Martino called instead for a 'monetary constitution' for Europe. 'Those of us who believe that monetary unification is desirable should concentrate on identifying the rules most suited to that end.' In less than a fortnight, four significant personalities have pronounced on a subject that Mr John Major in September 1993 said would have 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency.' True the voices are discordant. But they show that the debate in Europe about Emu is hotting up. The accompanying chart shows why. Europe's economy is recovering strongly from recession. A healthy EU economy has usually stimulated greater economic and monetary integration. The latest commission forecasts suggest that EU economic growth will accelerate to an average of 2.6 per cent this year, from 0.4 per cent in 1993. It has projected growth of 2.9 per cent next year, followed by 3.2 per cent in 1996. Government deficits should drop: to 3.9 per cent of EU gross domestic product by 1996. True, this forecast is above the Maastricht criterion of 3 per cent. But it is based on unchanged policies. Mr Ravasio has predicted that a majority of member states could meet the excessive deficit criterion before the end of 1996 'if consolidation efforts are undertaken.' But there is more to making Emu work than meeting Maastricht criteria. Mr Malcolm Levitt, EU adviser of Barclays Bank, has pointed out that the 'boring bits' of Emu, such as the introduction of Ecu notes and coinage, adaption of payments and accounting systems, conversion of electronic card facilities in shops and restaurants and the resolution of legal uncertainties, could take five years. Mr Levitt's argument is that is already too late to contemplate Emu starting in 1997. For Emu to start in 1999, the second date envisaged in the treaty, preparations would have to begin now. This is not yet the case in the private sector. Mr Levitt reports that companies are largely unaware of what needs to be done. The few banks and companies that have studied the issue are uncertain about the precise timetable and scenario and are therefore not making the investments necessary for introduction of a single currency. Things are more advanced in the public policy area. The European Monetary Institute this month secured the approval of central bank governors for a 'master-plan' aimed at completing the technical arrangements for the proposed European System of Central Banks by the end of 1996. Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI president, has also produced a suggestion for moving to Emu by the end of the century. He says the EU should consider irrevocably fixing the exchange rates of its currencies, but delay before introducing the Ecu, the single European currency. Mr Lamfalussy's idea for a phased introduction of stage three of the Maastricht Treaty would hand over responsibility for monetary policy to a European central bank with the fixing of currencies. It would allow time for dealing with technical problems, such as common banknotes or compatible payments systems. The Maastricht Treaty says that Emu should go ahead in 1999, even if only a minority of EU members meet the treaty criteria. The Lamfalussy suggestion could make this a feasible option. But for Britain, it raises the prospect of even greater political ructions than at present.</p>

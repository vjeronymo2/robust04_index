			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indian inquiry puts reforms to test - The country's biggest corporate takeover plan INDIA'S Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission yesterday started a public examination of the country's biggest corporate takeover plan in a hearing which is being seen as an important test of the effectiveness of the government's economic reforms. The inquiry concerns proposals by Hindustan Lever, the Indian subsidiary of Unilever, to acquire Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), an affiliate of Tata, India's largest industrial grouping, and a large producer of soaps and detergents. Before Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched the liberalisation programme in 1991, the monopolies commission was a powerful instrument of the licence raj - the panoply of economic controls developed in post-independence India. The inquiry into the Hindustan Lever-Tomco deal is the commission's first major probe since its powers were curbed by changes to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act. The handling of the case will be a significant indication of how reforms are being implemented. Hindustan Lever's takeover of Tomco was announced in March and approved in June by shareholders of both companies but it has still to complete its passage through legal and official reviews. Under Indian law, companies wishing to make acquisitions must register them in court. Would-be opponents are given the opportunity to file protests. Hindustan Lever's plans have been opposed by one of its in-house trade unions, the Maharashtra Girini Kamgar Union (which represents about 20 per cent of the employees), and by the Maharashtra Small-Scale Soap Manufacturers Association, a small-scale employers' organisation. The trade union is worried about the potential impact of the merger on jobs and the small-scale manufacturers association is concerned small-scale producers might be squeezed out of the market. Both organisations have filed protests against the merger in the Bombay High Court and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC). In its case to the MRTPC, the trade union concedes that amendments to the anti-monopolies act have ended blanket restrictions on large groups carrying out takeovers or making other investments which would substantially increase market share. However, the union argues that the proposed acquisition of Tomco by Hindustan Lever would infringe rules still in force on 'restrictive trade practices'. It claims the acquisition would create a group with nearly 80 per cent of the national market in toilet soaps and 90 per cent in detergent. This would distort competition with 'disastrous' results for consumers and cuts in employment in the industry. Hindustan Lever says the union's figures are exaggerated, claiming that its market share in soaps and detergents would rise from 25 per cent to 30 per cent after the merger. It argues that the deal will 'benefit all'. Hindustan Lever hopes that the commission will finish its deliberations soon, before December 15, when the Bombay High Court is due to consider the merger. Hindustan Lever officials believe that a positive verdict from the commission will help the court to deliver a favourable verdict.</p>

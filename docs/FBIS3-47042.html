			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has decided to establish a  third-party "Committee on Promotion of Administrative Reform"  (tentative name) as a nucleus to promote administrative reform,  mainly through deregulation. The committee will be authorized  to give advice to the prime minister and ministries and  agencies. At the strong request of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other  government offices have been preparing for the committee's  establishment. The government will include the decision in an  administrative reform action plan (administrative reform  outlines) for fiscal 1994, which is expected to be approved at a  cabinet meeting before the end of January. At the same time, it  will submit a bill to establish the committee to the next  ordinary Diet session. Besides monitoring the progress of  deregulation, the committee will carry out the major task of  studying enactment of an information disclosure law. The  government will also include a plan to work out by the end of  the year guidelines for decentralization of political power -- a  basic policy to promote decentralization -- in the action plan.    As an organ to promote administrative reform, the government  earlier decided to inaugurate the "Administrative Reform  Promotion Headquarters" by mid-January. Prime Minister Hosokawa  will serve as head, and the chief cabinet secretary and MCA  director general as deputy heads in the headquarters, which will  be composed of cabinet members and the Fair Trade Commission  chairman. The aforementioned committee will work as an advisory  organ to the headquarters and as a watchdog, as proposed by the  Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform  [Provisional Council] and the Economic Reform Research Council  (chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa).    The committee's major tasks will be devising an action  program to promote deregulation, monitoring the progress of  deregulation, and drawing up a bill on the disclosure of  information. The committee will be established in accordance  with Article 8 of the National Administrative Formation Law  [name as published], and will fall under direct control of the  prime minister. It will comprise intellectuals from the private  sector.    The Provisional Council is authorized only to submit reports  and opinions when asked by the prime minister. Because of its  limited power, the Provisional Council is helpless against  bureaucrats. Therefore, the government plans to give more power  to the administrative reform promotion committee. It will  clearly state in the bill on establishment of the committee:  "The committee is authorized to give advice to the prime  minister and to each cabinet minister." It will also give the  committee the right to investigate ministries and agencies,  local governments, and corporations with special status so it  will be able to promote active investigation and discussion.    The government hopes the committee will be a body similar to  the Japan National Railway Reconstruction Committee and the  Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. To enable the  committee to make decisions quickly, the government intends to  form it with three to seven members. The choice of committee  members will be decided with approval of the Diet. So far, the  government has not decided on how many members it should select  from what sectors.    The outlines of decentralization will be worked out by the  end of the year based on the administrative reform report  released last October. However, it is uncertain whether the  government will be able to include a plan, proposed in the  report, to enact a "basic decentralization law" in the outlines  in defiance of strong opposition from ministries and agencies.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Retailing projects E THOMAS CONSTRUCTION has been celebrating Christmas with more than Pounds 10m worth of new business from a large foodstore chain. Following its first contract for Safeway Stores earlier this year, the company has now won three more at Newquay, Penzance and Totnes. E Thomas is to fit out a Newquay store in Treloggan Road, for which it has recently completed the shell. Safeway has awarded the company management contracts to extend its Penzance premises and to build and fit out a new foodstore at Totnes. The 10-month Totnes project involves a structure similar to the Newquay building, with a mostly single-storey foods store of about 48,000 sq ft. It will be built on the site of the demolished Harris Bacon factory close to the river Dart, together with complete external works, roads, car parks, drainage etc, and construction of a new bridge over the leat. At Penzance, the Safeway foodstore on the approach road to the town will be expanded by 15,000 sq ft to provide a new cafe, shop, a larger petrol filling station, and increased car parking space.</p>

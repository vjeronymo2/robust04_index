In development, it is imperative to  strengthen ideas to make Xining's comprehensive agricultural  development mount a new plane.    Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao attended the meeting and made a  speech. He said: In comprehensive agricultural development over  the past few years, we paid attention to the production of  grain, edible oil, and meat, but failed to place the issue of  rural areas working hard to become comparatively well-off in a  sufficiently important position. In comprehensive agricultural  development, it is necessary to pay attention to linking  development to local plans for agricultural development. It is  also necessary to stabilize results in project areas,  stabilizing the output of grains, edible oil, and meat,  invigorating diversified management, and augmenting the overall  effects. It is necessary to regard increasing peasants' income  as an important goal in comprehensive agricultural development.  Only then will it be possible for Xining's comprehensive  agricultural development to have vitality.    Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao required farming areas to pay  attention to developing herding, actively encourage the practice  of feeding cattle with crop stalks, and regard the development  of herding as a major affair for farming areas to get rid of  poverty, become well- off, and improve effects. Attention  should paid to the spread and application of science and  technical know-how in project areas and increase input in  science and technology. In dealing with the tasks for  comprehensive agricultural development in 1994, Vice Governor Ma  Yanbiao indicated that, regarding first-phase projects, it is  necessary to grasp well some individual projects, and  consolidation and improvement of work in general. It is  necessary to continue to complete and perfect a whole range of  projects in farmland construction, and work hard to fulfill the  tasks of afforestation. First-phase project areas should further  implement the contracted responsibility system and operational  plans for planting so that the development of each piece of land  will bring benefits.    Second-phase projects should be conducted in light of funds,  labor, and tasks, with arrangements made rationally so that  people will benefit immediately from every project of  comprehensive agricultural development.    It is also learned from the aforesaid meeting that the  central authorities will increase an annual investment of 10  million yuan in the province's second-phase comprehensive  agricultural development to support Xining transforming medium-  and low-yield farmland and building grasslands.</p>

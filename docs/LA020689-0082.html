			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET AFGHANISTAN FORCES RETURN TO HERO'S WELCOME  </P> <P> Convoys of Soviet armored personnel carriers and tanks draped in red banners  streamed back into the Soviet Union from Afghanistan today, crossing the Oxus  River to a hero's welcome from waving children and soldiers' families.  </P> <P> The Communist Party daily Pravda said moujahedeen rebels, who have battled  Soviet troops for nine years, held their fire as Kremlin forces pulled out of  Afghanistan in a huge convoy that left Kabul last Friday.  </P> <P> Although Pravda said the last Soviet soldier had left the capital, a battalion  of about 500 Soviet troops remained in Kabul to guard the airport until the end  of a Soviet airlift taking out personnel and equipment and bringing in flour  and fuel.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Igor Korolyov told reporters in the Soviet border town of Termez that  30,000 troops had left Afghanistan during the second phase of the withdrawal.  This indicated that about 20,000 Soviet forces remained in the country, in five  provinces.  </P> <P> In one convoy, 300 men of the 350th Parachute Regiment riding 60 freshly washed  tanks and armored personnel carriers crossed into Termez over the "Friendship  Bridge" across the Oxus.  </P> <P> Hundreds of schoolchildren waved flags, and soldiers' families brought to  Termez by air and road waited to be reunited with the troops.  </P> <P> Red banners draped across tanks proclaimed "We have fulfilled our orders" and  "We defended the peaceful Afghan people." Some soldiers had stuck red  carnations in their gun barrels.  </P> <P> The day before the crossing, some young Soviet officers told foreign  journalists that Moscow's decision to send troops to support the Kabul  government nine years ago was a mistake.  </P> <P> Moscow pulled out half its 105,000 troops by last August in the first stage of  the withdrawal due to be completed by Feb. 15 under accords on the conflict  signed last year.  </P></p>

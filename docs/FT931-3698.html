			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: Wave of FRNs helps to meet surprise demand in US THE STRONG run in the US Treasury market has brought long-bond yields down to new lows. With deposit rates languishing at around 3 per cent, investors are keener than ever to find a way to enhance their returns. And they have become increasingly willing to take positions to express their views on the market. The latest trend is for plays on the shape of the yield curve, or on bond yields, as well as on short-term rates. While short-term interest rates in European markets are still expected to fall, US short-term rates are widely believed to have reached their lows. But when they will start to rise, how the shape of the yield curve will change and which way bond yields will move are questions which investors are addressing. The result has been a wave of structured products to meet a demand the depth of which has surprised bankers. In the US market, the US agencies have issued a spate of CMT floating-rate notes, a structure which pegs the coupon rate to 10-year Treasury yields (the reference yield is the constant-maturity treasury or CMT). The concept has now been brought to the Eurobond market by Lehman Brothers, whose brand name for the instrument is the SURF - step-up recovery floater. The coupon of these seven-year instruments is reset every six months to equal half of the CMT rate plus a predetermined margin. In addition, the notes offer a minimum interest rate of interest of, say, 5 per cent. With 10-year Treasury yields around 6 per cent, an investor would theoretically receive 4 1/2 per cent, so the minimum coupon of 5 per cent appears attractive. This is below current seven-year yields - the seven-year US Treasury yield is quoted at about 5.6 per cent - because the interest rate is reset every six months, but the investor has some upside potential from an increase in 10-year yields, whereas a fixed-rate bond holder loses capital if yields rise. The structure represents a play on the yield curve. The investor is taking the view that the US yield curve will remain steep over a period of time - or that if it flattens, rates will be low across the curve - and expects the downside protection of 5 per cent to be sufficient compensation if this view proves incorrect. Many market professionals are taking the opposite view. Dealers report a high level of activity concentrated on plays on a flattening of the US yield curve. 'Basically, a lot of people are buying the long end and shorting the front end of the US Treasury market,' said one trader. The CMT floater structure is economically viable because the derivative products used to create it are relatively cheaply available in the OTC market. This reflects an assumption among many traders that the yield curve will flatten. The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries has already declined from around 370 basis points in the autumn to below 300 basis points. The theory is that economic recovery is on the way in the US, so short-term interest rates will start to rise slowly; but the relative lack of inflationary pressure and hopes that President Clinton will be able to reduce the budget deficit will prevent yields from rising substantially at the long end of the market. Last week also saw a revival of activity in the market for collared floating rate notes - floating rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels. The buyers of these notes have been largely continental European investors, keen to lock in coupons of about 5 per cent, at a time when current money market rates are more than 1 1/2 points lower. Since the market opened in July, there has been more than Dollars 11bn of collared floaters in the dollar market, as retail demand has vastly exceeded expectations. In order to structure these transactions, the issuer sells a cap and buys a floor, using the money raised by selling the cap to pay for the floor. When the Treasury market falls, the value of the cap increases, making the process more attractive to the issuer. The flaw is that as soon as money market rates rise above 5 per cent, much of the value of the paper will be instantly eroded, and investors may face large capital losses.</p>

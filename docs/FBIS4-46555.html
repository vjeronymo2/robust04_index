			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Sychev: "How </F> the T-80 Tank Lost the Swedish Contract to the Leopard-2"]    [Text] In September 1993, at the request of the Swedish  Ministry of Defense and with the permission of the Russian  Government, two T-80U tanks were sent to Sweden for testing.  These combat vehicles returned home in March 1994. Russian heavy  armament was presented in the West for the first time and in  principle was seen as a possible variant in the reequipment of  two tank and three mechanized brigades.    At the time of the arrival of the Russian tanks in Sweden,  the search for a replacement for the obsolete STRV-103 tanks  produced by the Swedish concern Bofors since the 1960's and for  its British counterpart of the same age, the "Centurion," had  been continuing for more than two years. Tests were performed on  the American tank "M1A2 Abrams," the West German "Leopard-2K  Imperwood," and the French "Leclerc."    There are 400 tanks subject to replacement. So far the  Swedish Parliament has given its approval for 200 vehicles but  it has authorized the expenditure of less money than that--about  a billion kronor (approximately $150 million). The incongruence  of the dream of the military with the possibilities of the  country forced the Ministry of Defense to look for an up-to-date  and high-quality tank that would serve the next 30 years,  extremely advantageous in terms of price as well as other  contractual conditions. Therefore, when the T-80U first appeared  at an arms exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the Swedes decided to test  it as well. In terms of price--about $3 million--the tank was  doubtless very interesting.    But they were not able to complete the testing. The  government made the decision to buy West German "Leopards."  Judging by the haste with which the choice was made and by the  attempts to disparage the merits of the T-80, the decision was  basically dictated by political considerations. Swedish Minister  of Defense Anders Bjoerck declared, in particular, that only  servicemen no taller than 165 cm can work in a Russian tank, and  it is difficult to find such people in Sweden, and that the  loader may lose his arms, although in reality this process has  been automated....    By the way, the FRG and France demonstrated how to trade  with  arms. There were more and more frequent visits of high-ranking  government delegations from Bonn and Paris in Stockholm and  Shevde, where a tank test range is located. It is rumored that  the Germans brought about a ton and a half of documentation and  advertising about the "Leopard" and the French brought about 3  tons. In Sweden, the French merchants established a presentation  office and hired retired generals to work in it. They spent  about $5 million to promote the "Leclerc."    These two main competitors for the big contract (the United  States was out of the game as soon as it refused to concede even  a cent) agreed on the most improbable conditions of the deal  even to the point of concluding contracts on the basis of  100-percent compensation. The advantage went to Bonn's offer to  establish a joint enterprise in Sweden for the assembly of the  "Leopard" tanks, part of the production of which Bonn agreed to  sell to third countries. This makes it possible for Stockholm  not only to rearm its army but also to create a large number of  new jobs, which is quite important in time of crisis.    In Sweden, for some reason Washington did not utilize a  single one of its customary methods to attract a buyer and did  not even resort to the means of political pressure, which it  actively utilizes in other regions to increase its share of  world trade, which in the last few years has increased from 30.5  to 45.8 percent.    The arms market has become tight and to occupy a substantial  place there it is necessary to trade in the new way, as do the  French and Germans. It appears that the reform of the arms trade  in Russia that apparently began with an edict from the president  on the establishment of the firm "Rosvooruzheniye" was limited  to this. In any case, the view of trade in the leadership of the  country has not changed. We expect it to bring many billions  into the treasury but we are not giving political support to our  merchants abroad. Not a single delegation visited the T-80 tanks  in Sweden. And there can be no talk of the organization of a  temporary representation with the hiring of local military  people or the establishment of joint production in Sweden.    In Sweden, the T-80 tanks justified the funds spent on them  and showed what they are capable of doing, even though they were  driven by Swedish crews that quickly learned this art. Even  during the preparatory phase, the meticulous Swedes set forth  their questions on 500 pages, questions that were answered by  close to 10 Russian research establishments.    The vehicles were driven through ravines and snow drifts at  the very Arctic Circle. The tanks did not break down a single  time over six months. "My observation is that the military  people liked the T-80," said Aleksandr Vonsovskiy, an expert  with the state company "Rosvooruzheniye" who has been given  awards in our time for his commercial successes, "our tank is  better than the other vehicles and is adapted to Swedish  conditions. But even if it came to the commercial negotiations  that are planned for 1995, we could not offer conditions  analogous to those of the Germans and French."    To change the tendency in recent years toward declining  Russian arms exports (from 1988 through 1992, they declined 83  percent in comparable prices and amount to about $2 billion), it  is necessary to change a lot above all in the attitude toward  this business and also to resolve the problem of the  compatibility of Western and Russian standards for arms, which  will inhibit the advancement of complex Russian hardware to  Western markets. The differences are so great that for the  Swedes to acquire the T-80U tanks would mean that they would  have to spend many millions more to restructure all of their  logistical and technical support facilities.</p>

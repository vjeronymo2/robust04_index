			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / BA to oppose French limits Unions at Air Inter, the main domestic carrier in the Air France group, yesterday called their second 24-hour strike in three weeks in protest at the lack of 'concrete' assurances at their pay and job security will not suffer as a result of new austerity measures for Air France. But the strike, called also to press Air Inter's case for more autonomy within the Air France group, was less widespread than the first one, halting about 50 per cent of flights yesterday. Meanwhile, the French government has warned the European Commission that if Brussels stops it injecting FFr20bn into Air France and thereby forces the airline into liquidation, the total cost to the French taxpayer would be even greater, amounting to FFr30bn. This was revealed by the Commission in its formal nouncement last Friday of an inquiry into the Air France deal, which Brussels said in view of the airline's debts and losses could not be equated with the 'rational' decision of a private investor.</p>

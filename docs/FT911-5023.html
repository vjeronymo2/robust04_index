			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Boise Cascade in warning after first-quarter deficit BOISE Cascade, the Idaho-based forest products group, suffered a loss in the first three months of this year and has warned that its performance in the current quarter may be even worse. Weak markets, exacerbated by higher costs and interest rates, pushed the company into a Dollars 16.9m loss (53 cents a share), compared to a Dollars 33.6m profit (73 cents), a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 992.7m from Dollars 1.1bn. As part of its response to the recession, Boise is cutting its capital spending budget to about Dollars 300m this year, only slightly more than one third the 1990 level. The Dollars 2bn it has spent on capital investment in the past three years is the chief cause of the higher first-quarter interest and depreciation charges. The company said that prices have eroded for most grades of paper which it produces, as well as for its wood products. Uncoated white papers, its largest single grade, have been especially hard hit.</p>

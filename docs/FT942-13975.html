			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / South-west sees improvement Companies in south-west England are reporting a rise in sales and orders and improved profitability. About 70 per cent of companies saw higher turnover in the first quarter of this year, says the latest survey by Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative. Only 10 per cent said turnover had fallen. Slightly more than half said profitability had improved. 'This is a very positive report,' the chamber said. Its survey, covering 337 companies in the south-west, found businesses in the manufacturing and service sectors had seen improvements in the domestic market. In the export market, nearly half of manufacturers had higher sales and orders, with only about one in five registering a fall. Nearly a third of manufacturers and service businesses were increasing their investment plans, although 70 per cent of companies were operating at below full capacity. Companies employing more than 500 people continue to shed staff. Smaller companies expected employment to remain stable, or in some cases to expand, in the next quarter. About a third of companies said cashflow was deteriorating, with smaller companies suffering most.</p>

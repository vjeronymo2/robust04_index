			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(C)_Amendments to Allocation Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters objected to the restrictions in the proposed regulations that would prohibit the reallotment of the association's investment in the FCB more often than annually without the FCA's approval. While one commenter acknowledged that the FCA may have a legitimate regulatory concern in curbing the potential abuse of amendments to manipulate capital ratios, the commenter asserted that FCA prior approval is an inappropriate means of addressing the concern. In the commenter's view, a prior approval is inconsistent with the FCA's role as an arm's-length regulator, and without specific criteria for granting approval the FCA could become involved in the business decisions of the institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA has reexamined the proposed prior approval procedure and has determined that it would be appropriate to replace it with a provision enumerating specific circumstances in which a reallotment may be made. Therefore, the final regulations permit only annual amendments to the allocation agreement, except in the event of a reorganization or merger, or when a reallotment is required to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital Preservation Agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA strongly believes that the more frequently an allocated investment ``moves'' in the computation of the permanent capital ratio, the less reliable the permanent capital ratio is as an indicator of the financial soundness of an institution or of trends in the institution's operations. Consequently, one of the most important uses of the minimum permanent capital standard would be eliminated if institutions were permitted to change their allotments frequently and at will.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other than in the context of a merger or other corporate reorganization of one of the parties, when a reallotment would likely be necessary, or when a reallotment is necessary to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital Preservation Agreements, the FCA is aware of only a limited number of situations in which there would be any incentive for the institutions to reallot capital. For example, as part of its examinations, the FCA makes evaluations of the capital adequacy of each institution. The FCA is concerned that, if a reallotment is permitted as often as desired, it would be permissible to reallot capital in the time period between the examination of an FCB and an affiliated association for the benefit of the institution to be examined next.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, since the lending limit of an institution is based on the amount of its permanent capital, it would also be permissible to temporarily reallot capital to enable an institution to make a loan that would otherwise be in excess of its lending limits. Similarly, an institution could reallot capital in order to retire stock that it would otherwise be unable to retire, or even attempt to forestall an enforcement action by the FCA based on insufficient permanent capital. Although these matters could be viewed by institutions as ``internal business decisions,'' they raise safety and soundness and other issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, as a policy matter, the FCA views frequent changes in where the capital is counted as undesirable. The FCA believes that it is more efficacious to prevent the possibility of manipulation by regulation rather than to examine institutions to determine, after the fact, if such manipulation of their capital has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A)_Effective Date of Allocation Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A) provided that all of the allocation agreements would become effective at the start of the second quarter of each year. A commenter stated that there was no need for delay in implementing the agreement and noted that many districts currently implement the agreement on a calendar year basis. The commenter also stated the opinion that the effective date of these agreements is a procedural matter that ought to be left to the discretion of the parties and should be controlled by the business needs and planning processes of the affected institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The date proposed by the regulations was set, for the convenience of the parties, as the quarter following the allocation of earnings from the FCBs to associations so that the actual dollar amount of the allocation would be known when the allotment was being determined. In addition, setting a specific date would have facilitated the FCA's oversight of institutions. However, upon reconsideration, the FCA believes that the requirement to file a copy of the agreement with the responsible FCA examination field office will be sufficient to enable the agency to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. The final regulations permit banks and associations to select any date as the effective date of their agreement, provided that such date is no less than 12 months after the effective date of the existing agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(D)_Filing of Allocation Agreement With the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(D) required an allocation agreement to be sent to the FCA and any nonparty associations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , associations that were not parties to that allocation agreement) in the district within 3 days after the agreement was signed. A commenter asked that the time period be increased from 3 days to 20 business days, stating that this would enable a district with many associations to submit all of the agreements in one mailing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

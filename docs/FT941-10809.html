			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Scottish 'vested interests' attacked The number of quangos in Scotland was attacked fiercely yesterday by the Labour party. Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife, said: 'We see a situation where the public interest is playing second fiddle to private and vested interests. The promotion of the culture of closet Toryism is well to the fore. Nearly 5,000 people behind closed doors are spending nearly Pounds 7bn of public money.' These bodies had 'very tenuous' lines of accountability to the Scottish Office, parliament, the press, MPs and the public, he said. Mr McLeish went on to accuse the government of 'vote rigging' and 'gerrymandering' in Scotland, which he claimed had become the 'most centralised state in the developed world'. Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for Tayside North, dismissed any suggestion that Scotland suffered a 'democratic deficit' compared with England. He said that what Labour MPs was really saying was: 'We, the Labour party, can't get our hands on the levers of power.' Mr Raymond Robertson, Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, aimed his attack at the Scottish National party. 'Scotland has had her best days since 1707 in culture, commerce and in influence,' he said. 'The union has endured and it will endure.' But Mr John McAllion, Labour MP for Dundee East, protested that ministers' refusal to accede to demands for a Scottish assembly made 'a mockery' of their claim to be democratic. He said there should be a referendum for Scottish people on how they were governed. 'If Scotland doesn't have self-government, and it doesn't, it can't be described as a democracy - and it isn't a democracy.' At the last general election the Scottish people voted by three to one to assert their own sovereignty and set up their own parliament, he added.</p>

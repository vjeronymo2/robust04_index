			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Landslip kills 210 At least 210 people have been killed and between 200 and 1,000 are trapped or missing after a landslide in western Bolivia, writes Chris Philipsborn in La Paz. The slide, which buried the Llipi gold ore mining camp beneath 17 metres of mud and rock, occurred early on Tuesday morning, but the camp's inaccessibility has hindered rescue operations.</p>

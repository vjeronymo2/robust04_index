Noriega to admit wrongdoing.  </P> <P> But the attorney for Eduardo Pardo, 44, said he did not know if his client  would testify against Noriega and the other defendants in the drug conspiracy  case.  </P> <P> Lawyer William Meadows said there was no plea bargain with the government.  </P> <P> The pilot pleaded guilty to making a flight with $800,000 in drug money from  Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Panama in 1983. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler  told Pardo he could face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> Noriega, who is still arguing with prosecutors over their right to prosecute  him, is accused of taking payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Oswaldo Ribas] </F>   [Text] The countries of the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) will be interconnected by a fiber optics network as  of September, according to the estimates of the C&amp;M joint  venture gathering 25 telephone enterprises from several  countries, which is investing $75 million to allow Brazil,  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay to gain access to multimedia  systems. Christened Unisul, the fiber optics cable will join  Florianopolis (Santa Catarina) and Montevideo, while two other  cables will make connections with Asuncion and Buenos Aires.  The expansion of the network to Santiago has also been provided  for. There will be a total of 1,720 km of underwater cables  along the South American Atlantic coast.    Unisul will allow regional telecommunications enterprises to  send images, data, and voice, both separately and  simultaneously. This infrastructure will in the near future  allow South American users of interactive systems to have access  to or to transmit from their homes communications services and  entertainment, cultural, or general information for public use.    The Unisul system will join the Brazilian fiber optics  network as far as Fortaleza (Ceara). From this city it will  connect South America with the cable systems of North America  and Europe. The Brazilian part of the project should be  finished in 1995, but there could be a delay. For Europe and  North America, the estimate is that operation will begin in  1994. To communicate with Argentina, Brazil will have 15,120  channels. During a first stage, however, only 2,500 channels  will be opened. This figure, however, is enough to expand by  five times the current communications capacity between the two  main South American countries. In the opinion of Embratel  [Brazilian Telecommunications Company], the cables will serve to  relieve the congestion of telephone traffic to Argentina.  <H5>  Brazilian Network </H5>   The Brazilian fiber optics network provides for a first  stage  of 7,500 km. The first stretch will join Rio de Janeiro and Sao  Paulo. The following lines will join southern Brazil and Belo  Horizonte (Minas Gerais) and the northeastern region.    According to Embratel reports, Brazilian fiber optics  projects include short and long distance systems that will  connect the main capitals of the country. According to Telesp  [Sao Paulo Telecommunications, Inc.] information, 90,000 meters  of cable are being installed per month. By the year 2000 it is  estimated that 70 percent of the Sao Paulo metropolitan region  will be served by fiber optics cables.  <H5>  Educational Telecommunication Network </H5>   Embratel and the Ministries of Education and Science and  Technology have begun to work on Brazil's information  superhighway. It is a system that will expand the National  Research Network interconnecting Brazilian universities, which  will also connect schools and cultural organizations such as  libraries and museums. There will be three cultural networks  that will be freely accessible in the future.</p>

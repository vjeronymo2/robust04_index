			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Summit condemns ethnic cleansing THE Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) yesterday ended its summit in Jakarta with a communique condemning 'the obnoxious policy of ethnic cleansing by Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina'. The Yugoslav delegation, representing Serbia and Montenegro, rejected the condemnation, saying the movement had 'changed the document after adoption'. Before the final draft, the communique had not singled out the Serbs as responsible for ethnic cleansing. The Yugoslavs called the changes 'deplorable', insisting 'all three sides to the conflict, including Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina, are involved in such practices'. Some member states want to expel Yugoslavia. Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina re-applied for full or observer status.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEX CHURCH LEADERS ALLEGE HARASSMENT  </P> <P> The self-professed leaders of a church that includes sex acts in its rituals  asked Thursday for a federal court order prohibiting Los Angeles police and  prosecutors from "harassing" the church and said they will appeal their recent  conviction on prostitution charges.  </P> <P> The request for a court order follows the filing of a lawsuit Wednesday against  the Los Angeles Police Department and the city attorney's office claiming that  Will and Mary Ellen Tracy of Canyon Country were persecuted by police and  prosecutors because they practice an unorthodox religion.  </P> <P> Will Tracy, 51, and his wife, 46, are scheduled to be sentenced next Friday  after their conviction by a Municipal Court jury of operating a house of  prostitution in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in federal court Wednesday, charges that authorities sought  to deny the Tracys their freedom of religion and expression. Will Tracy on  Thursday filed a request for the court order to bar the Police Department and  city attorney from conducting surveillance on the church or making public  statements about the religion.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne is scheduled to hear the request Monday.  </P></p>

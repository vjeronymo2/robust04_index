			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour seeks to woo rebel Tories LABOUR yesterday sought to woo Tory Euro-sceptics with an amendment for tomorrow's debate on Europe which would simply delay consideration of the Maastricht bill until after the Edinburgh summit, Alison Smith writes. Even as Labour courted potential Tory rebels, however, they continued also to stiffen the resolve of opposition MPs by emphasising that the government itself was treating the motion as one of confidence. The amendment argues that the conditions set out for continuing with the bill which Mr John Major set out in the Commons' emergency debate in September  - that the position of the Danes had been clarified and the question of subsidiarity, or minimum interference, had been settled  - have not been fulfilled, and cannot be met until the Edinburgh EC council at the earliest. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is confident that, despite accusations from the government and from the Liberal Democrats of Labour U-turns over Europe, the party can still convincingly claim to be pro-European. A Labour conference this weekend on Europe will be the opportunity for Mr Smith to underline the party's commitment to the Maastricht treaty as agreed by the other 11 EC member states, without the 'opt-outs' on economic and monetary union and on the social chapter that were negotiated by Mr Major last year. The party's Euro-credentials will be reinforced by the presence at the conference of leading European socialists, including Mr Paul Rasmussen, the leader of the Danish social democrats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aida Shehu from Brussels] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Let us follow a telephone report by  the spokesman of the President's Press and Information Office,  who will inform us about the meetings President of the Republic  Sali Berisha held in Brussels with high personalities of  international institutions.    [Shehu] Yesterday President Berisha held a meeting with  members of the European Parliament's Foreign Policy Commission.  After the opening speech by the chairman of this commission,  Baron Crespau, President Berisha took the floor. He said that  20 months ago the chairman of this parliament received him at  this building as a newly elected president. At that time,  Albania had elected a democratic government after 65 years.  However, the challenge it had to face was enormous. Mr.  Klepsch assured me that the solidarity and support of the  European Parliament and Community will not be absent, even for  Europe's forgotten country, that is, our country. Today, this  may seem a bit superfluous to anyone here, but I can assure you  that my country has had a history of pure success during this  period. For this, the main merit certainly belongs to Albanians  who, though under more difficult conditions than others,  committed themselves with extraordinary courage to the most  painful course of the reforms.    Within two years, they managed, with great efforts and  sacrifices, to lay the foundations of a society based on the  rule-of-law state and free initiative. However, I would stress  that the assistance granted by the European Community has been  vital for the victories and development of democracy in Albania.  That is why I would like to whole-heartedly thank you for the  assistance that you have granted and continue to grant to our  country.    President Berisha later briefed the participants on the  current situation in Albania and the course of the reform in all  fields: economic, institutional, and legislative. Berisha  briefly mentioned some figures and statistics. Regarding the  economic field, he stressed that inflation has been brought  under complete control. It has reduced from 40 percent, which  was the monthly increase at the beginning of the reform, to 33  percent in 1993. In a free exchange rate course, our currency  is stable and has even gained a lot. The budget deficit has  decreased from 60 percent to 10 percent. Prices have been  completely liberalized. We have managed the complete  privatization of agricultural land and housing units. During  one year, more than 100,000 people have been employed in the  private sector. Meanwhile, the privatization of medium and  small enterprises is proceeding rapidly. Urban transportation  has been privatized and we are trying for a large scale  privatization of large enterprises, railways, ports,  hydroelectric power stations, etc. Albania ended 1993 with the  highest economic growth rate in Europe, an increase that can  amount to 10 percent. There are some promising beginnings  regarding foreign investments.    As for the institutional field, President Berisha stressed  that the heritage of the communist regime could not serve as a  basis for building a democratic society. The government that  emerged from the elections was courageously engaged in a deep  institutional reform. Thus, besides the real revival of the  government administration on the basis of advanced legislation,  we set up an independent judicial power and the Constitutional  Court. The infamous secret police were completely dissolved and  this service was rebuilt from the very beginning. In  coorporation with NATO and its members, we are carrying out a  reform of the army. In the same way, the Albanian police force  was subject to a deep reform and its staff was reduced by half.  Of 18,000 policemen, it now numbers 8,500. The diplomatic  sector also had to undergo reform. In general, the  institutional reform has been deep and, of course, painful.  However, we can say that its first fruits are positive.    Regarding the legislative field, President Berisha said that  we think that greater importance should be attached to the fact  that today basic human rights and freedoms have become a  permanent reality. Thus, freedom of assembly and association  has been implemented in the creation of dozens of political  parties, associations, and independent organizations. No one in  Albania is convicted for their beliefs today. Albania has the  greatest number the independent and private newspapers and  journals per capita in Europe. Albania is not only a country of  religious pluralism, but also of religious tolerance. Albania  has adopted the most liberal system of free movement of the  people. The freedom of private property is completely  guaranteed. The rights and freedoms of an individual are  guaranteed in Albania for all citizens, be they of Albanian  origin or of minorities. Considering the treatment of  minorities, Albania constitutes an example that I think can be  followed by other countries as well.    Closing his speech, President Berisha thanked those present  and expressed his gratitude for the encouragement the council  and the commission gave in their 9 February resolution to bring  to the European Parliament the proposals on Albania's associate  membership of the European Union as soon as possible. He  continued to say that he considered the commission's support for  the aspirations of integrating Albania into Europe to be not  only very important for Albania, but also a valuable  contribution to establishing peace in the Balkans, to  encouraging the Europeanization of this turbulent region between  West and East, and to achieving stability on our continent.    Berisha later had a long conversation with the members of  this commission and answered the participants' many questions.    At 1945 yesterday Berisha had a meeting with European  Parliament President Egon Klepsch. To honor President Berisha,  Klepsch hosted a dinner after the meeting, attended by the  members of the Albanian delegation and many members of the  European Parliament.    This morning, President Berisha was invited to a meeting  with  CNN television. Berisha answered the varied and numerous  questions posed to him.</p>

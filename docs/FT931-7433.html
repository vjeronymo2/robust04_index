			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: TDK records sharp third-term decline TDK, the Japanese magnetic tape maker, posted a sharp fall in consolidated profits for the three months to December owing to tough competition in both audio and video tape markets. The company said lower profit margins and the audio slump hurt third-quarter earnings. Pre-tax profits for the quarter plunged 32.3 per cent to Y9.4bn (Dollars 80.8m) on a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y136.5bn. After-tax profits fell 22.3 per cent to Y5bn. TDK said sales of floppy discs rose in tandem with the widening of personal computer ownership. But sales of audio and video tapes fell 5 per cent to Y47.1m. Domestic sales fell 8.2 per cent due to the sluggish Japanese economy. But sales overseas rose 2.9 per cent to Y70.2bn, accounting for 51.5 per cent of sales, on higher US demand for semiconductors and an increase in magnetic head sales in Hong Kong. For the nine months to December, TDK's consolidated pre-tax profits fell 33.7 per cent to Y27.6bn on a 2.4 per cent decline in sales to Y402.6bn.</p>

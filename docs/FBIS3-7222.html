			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Think of Japan-U.S. Relations--Break the </F> Deadlock in Relations With Speedy Action"]    [Text] Japan-U.S. economic frictions are heightening  tensions in the two countries' relations. While it is said that  the two nations are increasing their interdependence, they are  deepening their mutual distrust. Why is this happening?    The cause of this situation is the February Japan-U.S.  summit  talks, which ended with no agreement being reached. Japan has  not taken voluntary and persuasive actions to resolve the  economic frictions between Japan and the United States after the  prime minister said no to U.S. trade demands. In the United  States, the President has increasing taken a hard-line stand  against Japan on trade while hinting at the possibility of  slapping sanctions on Japan.    The relations between Japan and the United States, which  account for 40 percent of the world's gross national product,  should not be left as they are. Worsening Japan-U.S. relations  would not only hurt the national interests of the two countries,  but would also bring instability to Asia and would affect the  world negatively. Many nations are now concerned by how  Japan-U.S. relations will develop in the future.    Therefore, the two countries should by all means overcome  their current economic frictions. If the two nations pool their  wisdom, they will certainly overcome their economic frictions.    Where, then, is the heart of the economic frictions? What  should the two nations do to ease their economic frictions? We  hope that both Japan and the United States will return to the  starting point of their relations and think calmly about how to  improve and move forward their relations without criticizing  each other.    The most important point is that shock waves resulting from  the end of the cold war have now reached the economic imbalance  between Japan and the United States. In that sense, it can be  said that the latest developments involving Japan-U.S. relations  are a totally new and difficult trial for postwar Japan-U.S.  diplomacy.  <H5>  Break Away From "Optimism" During the Cold War Age </H5>   First of all, Japan urgently needs to discard the optimistic  view that it held during the cold war era and to fundamentally  change how it handles its relations with the United States.    Japan-U.S. trade frictions during the cold war era, no  matter  how fierce they were, were prevented from developing to the  breaking point by the 11th-hour intervention of the Departments  of Defense and State because of the existence of the Soviet  Union, which was a common threat to the two nations.    It has been pointed out that the recent Japan-U.S. summit  talks broke off because this time the traditional mediatory role  played by the Departments of Defense and State did not work in  the end. The so-called "water table" of security in bilateral  economic talks has dropped, thus pitting the two nations against  each other over economic interests.    This is an important point. While the United States does not  care about the decrease in the "water table," the weight of the  United States in Japan's security remains unchanged. This is  clear if we look at the situation on the Korean peninsula and in  Asia, which remains unstable.    The heart of problem lies in the combination of the Asian  situation and Japan's $130 billion annual current-account  surplus and its $50 billion trade surplus with the United States.  <H5>  Japan's Huge Surplus Is the Problem </H5>   Japan's huge surplus has given the impression abroad that  Japan is the only nation that won the cold war. Japan's massive  surplus has already reached a level that cannot be tolerated  politically, although it can be justified by academic analysis  and logic. We cannot help but say that Japan does not fully  understand this stern view.    Japan, in a flurry of trade white papers and official  government documents, has continued to criticize U.S. trade  policy, which increasingly has tilted toward managed trade since  the Clinton administration was inaugurated. It can be said that  Japan's criticism has been so well-grounded that U.S. experts  have echoed it.    However, we regret actions taken by Japan itself after its  criticism of the United States. Japan has failed to speedily  take measures to turn the Japanese market into a transparent and  open market. The brakes will be put on managed trade only when  Japan firmly stands up for maintaining the free trade system.    It is clear what tasks Japan should accomplish as a  frontrunner of the world economy.    The government should take measures to expand Japan's  domestic demand and further open the Japanese market. What is  important for Japan is speedy action. The private sector should  reject the government's intervention, which disrupts the market,  and should make independent efforts to boost imports.    To that end, the government should first voluntarily set a  medium-term target for reducing Japan's current-account surplus.    Second, the government should speedily overhaul the current  tax system and decide to cut the income tax for three years  prior to raising the consumption tax.    Third, the government should try to add more than 100  trillion yen to the basic plan for public investment after  making clear how it will secure revenue to cover the additional  amount. Needless to say, the government should review the  conventional allocation of public investment in the basic plan  to prepare for the arrival of a graying society and the  information age.    The government also should take measures to relax  regulations  and to liberalize direct foreign investment in Japan. We hope  that the government will more boldly relax regulations and  liberalize foreign investment in Japan than is the case in other  industrialized nations. The promotion of fair competition  through the stringent enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is  indispensable.    It is important to employ publicity to get the message  across  to the world that Japan is taking action. We would like to  propose anew holding an "import summit" where Japanese  entrepreneurs and ordinary Japanese meet together to discuss how  to boost Japan's imports. Americans' attendance at the summit  is welcomed.  <H5>  The U.S. Withdrawal of Sanctions Against Japan Is the Key </H5>   There is a major prerequisite for Japan's voluntary actions:  The United States should withdraw its approach of unilateral  sanctions against Japan, such as the Super 301 provision of the  1988 Omnibus Trade Act, and indicate its intention to deal with  trade frictions with Japan on the basis of sound thinking.    The U.S. International Trade Administration (ITA), which had  examined a dumping complaint filed by U.S. steelmakers against  Japanese steelmakers involving steel wire being sold on the U.S.  market, handed down a final ruling on 17 March that the Japanese  steelmakers did not inflict any damages on U.S. steelmakers. It  can be said that the final ruling was a decision that reflected  the actual state of the Japanese and U.S. economies, which rely  on each other. Mutual retaliation between the two countries  have ended in both of them shooting themselves in the foot.    It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to work  to broaden the scope of their diplomacies from a medium- and  long-term perspective. The creation of a wise men's conference  of Japanese and U.S. opinion makers is worthy of a full study.  The conference is expected to play the role of preventing any  fresh frictions between the two countries by providing early  warnings of them.    We would like to refrain from commenting on the lack of  political leadership in Japan in this editorial. But, now is  the time for politicians to break with their past practice of  using "external pressure to accomplish Japan's domestic reforms."</p>

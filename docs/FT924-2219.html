			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Decision on plans for Jubilee line postponed LONDON TRANSPORT has dropped plans to announce a go-ahead for the long-awaited Jubilee line extension to London's Docklands today because there is still no sign of an agreement with the private sector over the funding of the Pounds 1.8bn scheme. One London Transport source said negotiations over the private sector contribution were 'completely and utterly bogged down in detail' and there was no hope of an agreement this year. London Transport had privately earmarked today as the launch date for the line in the expectation that a deal with the private sector would be ready for signature by now. LT's London Underground subsidiary still believes a deal will be reached. 'I don't believe that, having got this far, we are going to stumble over detail,' it said. 'But clearly it is taking a good deal longer than we had hoped.' The postponement of the Jubilee line launch coincides with the publication today of a hard-hitting report by the Confederation of British Industry criticising the government for failing to evolve an integrated transport strategy for London. The report is expected to say that any business given the job of providing the best possible transport services for the capital would have been sacked if it had done as badly as the Treasury and the Department of Transport. Work on the Jubilee line extension was to have started in April. It was put on hold when the Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf project in Docklands, which had undertaken to pay Pounds 400m towards the scheme, went into administrative receivership. Last month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in his autumn statement that the government was still prepared to fund the bulk of the scheme, but only if the private sector paid up. Canary Wharf's 11 bankers have agreed in principle to come up with the Pounds 400m, but negotiations over the terms have proved unexpectedly complex and now threaten to delay a start to the project until well into next year. Issues holding up an agreement are believed to be the bankers' insistence that the deal should incorporate guarantees about the timing of the line's completion and its levels of service.

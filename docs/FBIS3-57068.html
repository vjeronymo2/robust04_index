			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 420] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, ELTA -- A newly appointed chairman  of parliamentary National security committee Vytautas  Petkevicius MP [member of parliament] arranged his first news  conference on Friday [21 January].    He told the news conference Lithuanian Army could not fight  against an aggressor for any longer period of time, therefore  the national defence conception should be based on the  resistance of all the nation. But the Army is not ready even  for that -- it seems to be very poor.    Meanwhile, bureaucrats of National Defence Ministry live in  prosperity. Petkevicius said the committee would do its best to  leave not more than 30-40 employees in the ministry instead of  214. And the Army is needed as much as the state is capable to  maintain.    130 million lats [as received] are provided for needs of  national defence in 1994 and this reflects real possibilities of  today. Petkevicius expressed indignation the means were used  irrationally and sometimes even wasted.    Voluntary National Defence Service /SKAT/ should be a  reserve  of Armed Forces, a sub-unit of National Defence Ministry and not  an organization organizing rallies, Petkevicius said. Some  units and services of SKAT are headed by people with no  understanding of military things.    Speaking about state border protection Petkevicius said it  should be and will be given over to the border police.    National Security service was in principle destroyed by  earlier governments and now the things must be newly restored,  Petkevicius said. Lithuania had become an object of  international spying. Foreign secret services knew about  Lithuania, its national defence and national security more than  Lithuania itself, he added.    The committee is preparing draft laws determining activity  of  services of national defence and national security, Petkevicius  said.</p>

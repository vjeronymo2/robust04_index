			<p>BFN     [Text] The Indonesian Government will not force Vietnamese  refugees currently housed on Galang Island in Riau to return  home. The planned repatriation of all the Vietnamese refugees is  based on an old agreement between the two countries. Vietnamese  President Le Duc Anh, who visited Indonesia recently, agreed to  speed up the repatriation.    Replying to reporters on the refugee protests on Galang  Island where some have died from self-immolation, Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas said the protests had been staged by a group  of refugees who failed to pass the screening test for  resettlement in third countries. The protests were not directed  at the Indonesian Government but rather at the United Nations  High Commission for Refugees. According to Ali Alatas, about  140 out of the estimated 8,000 refugees are prepared to return  to Vietnam.</p>

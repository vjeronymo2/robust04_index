			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Grass is greener in the high street - John Thornhill says retailers are coming back into town Shoppers love those massive out-of-town superstores because they can get everything they want in one go. Retailers love them because they are cheaper to run. The arguments seemed so powerful that for many years, the big food retailers left small, high street shops in droves for vast sites on the ring road. The number of grocery shops has fallen in the last three decades from more than 100,000 to 40,000 and the current recession has continued to throw up casualties. But it now seems that edge-of-town sites do not satisfy all shoppers - especially those without cars and the elderly. Retailers are realising that there is money to be made from efficient town centre chains. There are signs that the high street is coming back to life. Some retailers, of course, have never deserted it and have defended their positions by offering premium products and service. Marks and Spencer runs a highly profitable chain of neighbourhood stores while John Lewis Partnership is still expanding its 99-store chain of Waitrose supermarkets. The Kwik Save discount chain and the Iceland frozen foods business have also mainly stuck to traditional shopping centres. Even the bigger chains, such as Tesco and Safeway, are now returning to high streets with the benefit of their sophisticated distribution systems. Tesco is redeveloping the old Moss Bros site in Covent Garden in central London to launch what it describes as a 'Metro' store. But one of the most ambitious attempts to create a completely new high street chain has been the launch of Somerfield, run by Gateway Foodmarkets, bought by the privately-owned Isosceles group three years ago. Twenty-five Somerfield stores have already opened with a wide range of own-label goods. The number of stores will rise to 50 by next April giving the chain total square footage of about 1m sq ft. More will rapidly follow if the chain establishes itself. The man behind the idea is Bob Willett, Gateway's chief executive, who claims that Somerfield is one of the most heavily researched food chains ever launched, aimed at one layer of a segmenting food market. The stores, which consist of 11 conversions from weary Gateway stores and 14 new sites, range from 12,000 sq ft to 26,000 sq ft. They offer fresh produce, expansive delicatessens and bakeries. They are well-designed with high-quality lighting and even boast barrel-ceilinged wine aisles complete with echo. Willett wants the chain to offer a premium service. Staff are attentive and dress smartly either in boaters and traditional aprons or black blazers and striped trousers or skirts. The check-out staff pack the goods after scanning them at specially-designed tills. The stores have an up-market, leisurely feel but Willett claims that prices are consistent with other Gateway stores. He prefers to refer to them as 'up-value'. Willett says that converted Somerfield stores are performing well and have seen sales increases of more than 20 per cent. The average basket size of Pounds 16.30 was well ahead of the Pounds 8.80 achieved at Gateway. 'Somerfield is focused on building the shopping basket by offering range and service,' he says. The birth of the new chain has been a brave move in a recession and has had its problems. Gateway, which runs 635 Gateway stores and 18 Food Giant discount superstores, recently reorganised its management structure around the three retail concepts, causing some friction. 'It has been painful as people have lost turf' Willett says. While admiring the idea, industry analysts harbour doubts about Somerfield's heavy costs and question whether the indebted Isosceles can give the chain the backing it needs. Willett also accepts that it will take time before customers appreciate the Somerfield name and suggests the chain would double its turnover if it had the magical words Marks and Spencer emblazoned over its shop-front. 'The problem is that Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer have been around for more than 100 years. We are as yet unknown,' he says.</p>

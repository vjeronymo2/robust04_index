			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 7 Jun (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of  Cambodia, declared he was worried about Cambodia's environment,  which had been seriously threatened during the past decades.    In his speech made on World Environment Day, the head of the  royal government said he wanted a law on environmental  protection to be promulgated.    "The war, which has lasted for over two decades, has  destroyed the environment in the country," said Prince Norodom  Ranariddh. "This," he said, "would plunge Cambodia into the  abyss of disaster if we (the new generation) did not coordinate  efforts to fight this crisis."    The Cambodian leader recalled that the flood of 1991,  exceptional for Cambodia, was one of the consequences of  environmental destruction.    The prince wanted severe measures to be taken to protect the  environment, and he invited Cambodians to follow him in that  direction.    Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh pledged to implement the  UN environmental program. He thanked international  organizations for helping to save Cambodia's environment.</p>

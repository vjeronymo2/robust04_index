			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Grandmet moves welcomed AFTER THE shock of last week's board changes, Grand Metropolitan surprised the market again yesterday by announcing a large restructuring charge. However, the shares moved forward on the news, incorporated in a relatively positive trading statement, as investors and analysts expressed relief that Friday's market speculation of a profits warning did not materialise. The shares finished 10 ahead at 403p in good turnover of 10m. Grandmet said the Pounds 175m provision would be spread across all its businesses, although its Green Giant food division and Pearle optician concern will take large chunks. Brewery analysts were largely positive on the moves, the two US businesses being weak spots in profitability for some time. There was some speculation that Grandmet will use the Pounds 60m rationalisation costs at Pearle to ready the division for sale. Analysts said that, once profitable and restruc-tured, Pearle could fetch up to Dollars 400m. There was also talk that Grandmet would put money into its Chef and Brewer restaurant business ahead of its long-rumoured sale. Whitbread, whose 'A' shares advanced 5 to 536p, remains the market favourite to buy the bulk of the 1,500-strong chain. Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'Today's statement has allayed the market's worst fears. Trading in particular has been shown to be surprisingly resilient, particularly at IDV.' He added that the shares could show some strength from their current level once the market had digested the details of yesterday's statement.</p>

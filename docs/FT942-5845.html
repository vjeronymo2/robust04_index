			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: German buy for GEC Alsthom GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French transport and engineering group yesterday said it had taken control of Linke-Hoffman-Busch, the German rail equipment manufacturer. GEC Alsthom said it bought 51 per cent of the shares from Preussag for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition is the first by the Anglo-French joint venture in the railway sector in Germany and is aimed at strengthening its presence in European markets. 'It fills an important gap for us,' the company said. GEC Alsthom has large operations in Germany in two other core divisions - power generation and power distribution. GEC Alsthom has sales of about DM1.2bn (Dollars 706m) in Germany and employs about 4,000. LHB, which has annual sales of about DM450m and a workforce of 2,000, is based in Satzgitter, near Hanover. It is involved in the design and manufacture of trains, trams, electric and diesel locomotives, freight wagons, bogies and couplers. LHB participates in the manufacture of the ICE, the high-speed train which has been developed and built by a consortium led by Siemens. The ICE is the principal European competitor for the Train a Grande Vitesse, built by GEC Alsthom.</p>

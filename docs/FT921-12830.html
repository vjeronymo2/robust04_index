			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): A real top rate of 59% - If Labour wins . . . / There are limits to what the Opposition can divulge, but savers should ignore the cries of salesmen SPARE A thought for the Opposition. The Labour party is under pressure to provide details of exactly what tax rates it would impose throughout the next government. The faintest obfuscation is punished in the press. Meanwhile, Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is in purdah. He is not allowed to comment, even vaguely, about changes to come in the budget that is less than two months away. Bear this in mind when looking at Labour's proposals. There are limits to what it can be expected to divulge, and also on what it can commit itself to at this stage. The broad principles are clear. According to Margaret Beckett, the shadow treasury minister: 'We are looking for a greater degree of equity. We want the tax system to treat everyone fairly, but we think people on the highest earnings can afford to pay more at the top end.' This in itself limits the financial plans that people should make in preparing for a Labour government - while another problem with forward planning, of course, is that Labour may not win the coming general election. The broader issues of macro-economics are likely to be more important than alterations to the tax system. However, there are few moves that savers and investors can make to protect themselves against the chance of a Labour government which do not make sense anyway. For this reason, it is best to ignore some of the more desperate 'buy now while stocks last' pleas, which may come from salesmen and advisers. What follows is a summary of Labour's current thinking. The first budget Income tax: The top rate would rise from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. This is a firm pledge. Mrs Beckett suggests that this will go no higher: 'While 50 per cent is fair at the top end, it is enough.' The threshold for this top band would be around Pounds 40,000. Below this, people would continue to pay 40 per cent. However, the upper limit for national insurance contributions would be phased out. In the current regime, contributions are only paid, at the rate of 9 per cent, on the first Pounds 18,200 of earned income. Abolishing the threshold would mean that the top rate of tax effectively became 59 per cent. Income tax for those in lower tax brackets should eventually come down to below 25 per cent, though Labour now makes it quite clear that this would be unlikely in the first budget. Married couples' tax allowance: This will be frozen. Note that it will be left to 'wither on the vine' - with inflation gradually reducing the value of the benefit. Investment income. This would be surcharged. Labour wants to make unearned income subject to national insurance contributions at the same rate (9 per cent) as earned income. The idea is to put earned and unearned income on a 'level playing field'. Thresholds would be high - an income of Pounds 3,000 from investment would probably be needed before you paid any tax on it. Thus, this measure would be unlikely to affect those with less than Pounds 30,000 in savings. People above the state retirement age would be exempt. Income from pensions paid to people who retire before this age is also exempt, but any other investment income they derive would be liable to this charge. However, this measure has still caused more concern than any other Labour proposal. It discourages saving. There is also the argument that so-called 'unearned' income usually derives from money saved out of earned income. Mrs Beckett defends the proposal against these charges, saying that it equalises the taxation of earned and unearned income. 'It may be the case that it's income they've earned over a lifetime, but it may be income that they have not worked for at all. We don't think it's unfair to treat the same level of income as subject to the same level of charge.' She cites accountants who say that their clients do better by living off their investments, rather than going out and earning money. However, the move still removes an incentive to save for people between middle age and retirement. Tessas: Tax-exempt special saver accounts seem likely to stay. Labour welcomes them as having 'one small part' to play in increasing saving, and dampening demand, but suspects that they are not encouraging much new saving. Pensions: State pensions will be increased by Pounds 5 a week for single pensioners and Pounds 8 a week for married couples, over and above the rate of inflation. Labour would reinvigorate the State Earnings-related Pensions Scheme (Serps) by relating it to earnings over the 20 best years of the user's career, rather than the average of the whole of it. Any new personal pension plans would have to guarantee a return of at least the amount to be gained via the new Serps. Business Expansion Scheme: The BES for private 'assured tenancies' would be ended, possibly in the first budget. Labour is highly critical of the scheme as it works at present. But a scheme similar to the original Business Start-up Scheme might well be established, with big incentives to invest in small firms and manufacturing. The long-term plans Tax avoidance: Loopholes will be plugged, probably by a system modelled on the US, where those on high income have to pay a minimum proportion of that income in tax, regardless of any other allowances and reliefs. Labour would set a maximum level of allowances for people above a certain income. This could substantially choke off the appeal of 'tax shelter' investments, such as enterprise-zone property. Capital gains tax: The threshold will probably come down from the present Pounds 5,500, but stay above the level of income tax allowances. Mrs Beckett categorically denies that the Pounds 1,000 figure bandied about in the press has any basis in fact - the threshold will stay much higher than this. One scheme in favour with researchers would cut the level of tax according to how long an investment had been held before sale. Stags involved in short-term speculation would pay heavy amounts of tax, while patient holders of shares for 10 years or more would pay virtually nothing. Clearly, this scheme could be complicated, but if it could be made to work it would be a powerful and direct incentive for long-termism. Inheritance tax: A 'more effective and progressive form of taxation' than IHT would be introduced, to tax wealth. Tax would be payable on gifts as well as legacies, so the new tax would resemble capital transfer tax. IHT would also, probably, be based on the recipient, encouraging wider dispersal of wealth. This makes comparisons of thresholds and rates awkward. On a recipient basis, the threshold would probably be a lot lower than the current Pounds 140,000. However, it would allow people to avoid tax being paid on their estate altogether, if they spread their money among enough people in their wills. Another possible measure is to tax transfers between individuals on a lifetime basis, rather than annually. Labour dissents strongly from the suggestion, signalled by the Conservatives, that the next budget should actually make IHT more lenient by increasing the threshold. Personal equity plans: Labour will honour existing tax commitments on all existing plans. Beyond that, the party is examining Peps, and is now less negative about them than it was. Complete abolition is still an option, but Labour is interested in using the Pep concept to encourage investment in manufacturing industries. Sectors to watch if Labour wins, Page 13</p>

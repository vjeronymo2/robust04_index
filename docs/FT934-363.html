			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Merchant finds fleece can be golden: An elaborate manoeuvre which is used to evade wool marketing controls The government's drive to free commodity markets in the UK has led to the abolition of all marketing boards except that for wool - and ministers are coming under pressure to complete the process by getting rid of that as well. Those campaigning against the board have highlighted an elaborate manoeuvre which allows foreign buyers to evade its UK monopoly on the purchase of clip wool - sheep fleeces. But officials argue that the board is necessary to protect small farmers by guaranteeing them a market for fleeces, which are a by-product of sheepmeat production on small farms, and to ensure that the maximum amount of wool comes to market. To avoid the British Wool Marketing Board's controls, Mr Aidan Walsh, an Irish wool merchant, last year brought his lorries, staff and equipment from his base in Naas in County Kildare to Perth. He bought 100 tonnes of wool there, took it back to Naas and then shipped it back across the Irish Sea to the Midlands. Even with transport costs, he can sell wool in the UK more cheaply than domestic merchants who have to buy through the wool marketing board. In May, the Ministry of Agriculture abolished the system of guaranteed prices it used to give farmers through the board. Buyers from outside the UK had been exempt from the board's monopoly on the purchase and sale of clip wool since 1981, and the ending of the guarantee scheme provided an opportunity for them to take advantage of the exemption. In Perth, Mr Walsh offered farmers 40p per kg for wool from blackface sheep, rising to 50p over the summer. This is less than the board price, but it pays over two years - 20p down and the rest the following year. In July, the board won an interdict (injunction) in the Court of Session in Edinburgh preventing Mr John King of the wool merchants J &amp; W Greig of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, from approaching the farmers because he is not a foreign buyer. Mr King said he was obliged to buy from the board at 81p a kg for blackface wool, including the board's costs of 25p a kg. 'Let's say, for argument's sake, Mr Walsh's transport and other costs amount to 20p a kilo, he can still undercut me when selling to a carpet manufacturer in Britain by 11p a kilo. That is before my own costs,' said Mr King. 'That is some discount. I do not mind Aidan Walsh doing this. It is just that I want to do it myself.' Mr King has lobbied MPs and Mrs Gillian Shephard, Minister of Agriculture, arguing that the board should be abolished. 'The monopolies in eggs and milk have been abolished, why is one being retained in wool?' The ministry argues that most sheep come from small farms, often in remote areas. 'The average clip is 500 kilos. Without the board, a lot of the wool would not reach the market and would have to be imported.' Mr Ian Hartley, deputy managing director of the board, said: 'There are 93,000 suppliers of wool in the UK and only 25 main buyers. You have to have some form of marketing because most farmers are so small. It would not be worthwhile them driving huge distances to deliver.' He says every dealer apart from Mr King is happy to work through the board, although he admits that it must lower its charges to 'well under' 20p a kg. 'Mr Walsh bought 100 tons from about 40 farmers. The total market in Britain is 50m tons. Over 99 per cent of farmers are happy to deal with us. The government wants to continue.' Mr Walsh said: 'This year was a trial run. Next year I am going to set up centres all over Scotland. I know others who are planning to set up in England. The BWMB will break up eventually.'</p>

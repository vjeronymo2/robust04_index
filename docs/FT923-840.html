			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Clean-up campaign at DG Bank - David Waller on the tough task faced by the German institution MR Bernd Thiemann has, on the face of it, a modest objective at the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank (DG Bank), the Frankfurt-based institution he joined as chief executive last summer. He wants the bank again to be a respected and uncontroversial member of the German banking community. But, as Mr Thiemann readily admits, the task is difficult. For, by the time he took over, DG Bank had become a by-word for over-expansion and financial imprudence. Through its role in a cross-border imbroglio involving DM6bn of government bonds, it had succeeded in blighting Frankfurt's reputation as a European financial centre. The bank, the six-largest in Germany on balance sheet, announced last month it expected to break even for 1992 - a step towards normality following big difficulties last year. It also received support for its second substantial cash injection from shareholders within a year, taking the total raised since Mr Thiemann's arrival to DM3.2bn. The DG Bank occupies a special role within the German financial system. It is the central bank for the country's network of more than 3,000 co-operative banks, also DG Bank's principal shareholders. If the assets in the organisation's 20,000-plus branch offices were added together, they would amount to some DM919bn, bigger than those of Germany's top three bank's put together. DG Bank's problems date back to the 1980s. Then, it set out to become a universal bank, providing a full range of banking services for the co-operatives, entering the equities and government bond markets in its own right, and building up a network of 13 overseas offices. It also tried to buy up the five regional co-operative central banks, which alienated the co-operative movement. This era came to an inglorious end in early 1990 when it emerged that the bank's chief bond trader had entered a verbal agreement to buy back DM6bn of German government bonds sold to nine French banks as part of repurchase agreements. When the the price of bonds fell, the DG Bank refused to buy them back, arguing that the head trader - subsequently dismissed - had exceeded his authority. Four other traders were arrested following a criminal investigation. They are still in prison. The affair became an international incident, with the French Finance Ministry protesting to Germany's banking authorities about DG Bank's refusal to pay. It embarrassed the Frankfurt financial community, foreshadowing the insider dealing scandals of the following summer in that it raised questions about the lack of regulation in German financial markets and lack of controls at one of Germany's larger banks. DG Bank had to take the bonds back on to its books in March of 1990 and, in November last year, it gave up all its legal claims against the French counterparties. Meanwhile, Mr Thiemann replaced Mr Helmut Guthardt as the bank's chief executive. 'I knew full well that it was a 'clean-up' commitment when I took the job,' said Mr Thiemann, who joined after 10 years as chief executive of Norddeutsche Landesbank, one of Germany's larger public sector banks. 'There was a gigantic hole in the balance sheet and it was clear that the bank faced at least 25 major business problems,' he said. The balance sheet hole was plugged by a DM1.4bn capital-raising exercise last autumn and, one by one, the litany of business problems is being dealt with. The bank is carefully unwinding what Mr Thiemann calls a 'mismatched position of grandiose proportions' between assets and liabilities. With the help of the Boston Consulting Group, new computer systems and financial controls are being put in place. The scale of provisioning against problem country loans is being bolstered. The bank's personnel is to be cut by 800 from the current 5,500 and, in June, the bank announced the closure or sale of six businesses as part of a general restructuring of its overseas activities. Mr Thiemann is confident that the shadows of the past are shortening. He draws a distinction between the two capital-raising measures of the last 12 months. 'The first one last autumn dealt with the past,' he argues, while 'the second prepares us for the future'. This summer's DM1.8bn will strengthen the balance sheet and allow the bank to meet tough new capital adequacy requirements, which take effect next year. The next step on the road to normality will be a marketing offensive designed to intensify the ties between DG Bank and the co-operative banks, its natural customer base. But Mr Thiemann admits that it will be a long haul. DG Bank will signal its return to full normality only when it pays its shareholders a dividend, and that is not likely to happen for another four years.</p>

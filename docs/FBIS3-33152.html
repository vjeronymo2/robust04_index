The registry will open to the public as of today. Initially  it will work exclusively with individuals charged with violating  antiterrorist and national security laws in Lima and El Callao.    Colan Maguino said in the next few months the registry will  cover all regions of the country and will cover individuals  arrested for all crimes, a task that will involve the Attorney  General's Office, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense  Ministry.    The attorney general said that the registry's central  headquarters will be connected with the various prosecutor  offices -- particularly those located in emergency zones --  through radio equipment donated by the AID.    The Registry will provide free information to relatives,  lawyers, and national and international organizations involved  in the defense of human rights.    Interior Minister General Juan Briones Davila said the  registry will prevent excesses that might distort Peru's current  efforts to defend human rights.    Briones said that all national police regions are linked to  the registry's computer system which operates from the first  floor of the Attorney General's Office Building on Abancay  Avenue, in downtown Lima.    The files used by the registry contain information on the  physical condition of the detainee at the time of his arrest at  a police, military, or judicial department. It will also  include other information such as sex, education level, age, and  the number of the prosecutor's office that is handling the case.</p>

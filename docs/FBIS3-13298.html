			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz followed by a </F> question-and-answer-session with unidentified correspondents at  the Foreign Ministry on 10 March; broadcast in  progress--recorded]    [Text] [Buwayz] ...the attempt to implement the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement and what has followed continue in the  south and in the country's interior. I say very simply and  frankly that there are repeated attempts to destabilize the  internal situation with the aim of forcing Lebanon to attend the  negotiations from a weak position. This requires us to respond  to this provocation with more internal and national cohesion.    [Correspondent] Minister, you received this week the  Lebanese  negotiating delegation members who reported to you on the  negotiations and talks held in Washington. Can you tell us if  there has been progress on the Lebanese track?    [Buwayz] It is clear from the latest round held in  Washington  that Israel's desire to make progress was almost nonexistent.  It was evident that the Israeli Government was not ready to  apply the principles of the Geneva summit between President  Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. This gives the  impression and makes it clear that there was a determined  decision to foil this round or ensure its failure.  Additionally, we feel there is not yet readiness within Israel  to achieve progress, something that is possibly due to the  domestic situation in Israel. In any case, there are  U.S.-Israeli contacts that are supposed to activate things.  Some U.S.-Arab contacts are also expected with the aim of  finding a way out that would restore substance to the  negotiations.    [Correspondent] Has the United States asked Lebanon to  rescind its decision to suspend the negotiations? What are the  conditions for doing so?    [Buwayz] Negotiations are not an issue of formalities.  Formalities, the timing of the round, and the way invitations  are sent out to attend the rounds are not the bases for the  negotiations. The basis remains Israel's ability and its  decision to achieve progress. For several reasons, we do not  feel that Israel has decided it wants to achieve progress.    [Correspondent] What did you discuss with the secretary  general of the Higher Lebanese-Syrian Council?    [Buwayz] Lebanese-Syrian relations are not outside the  framework of this regional situation. It is normal for us to  discuss the regional developments that are of interest to the  secretary general of the Higher Council.    [Correspondent] Regarding the peace negotiations, what is  your stance on the Russian positions that yesterday announced  the death of the peace negotiations and called for a new  international conference. Regarding security, many  denunciations were made and the state was asked to take strong  measures to prevent bombings. Is there anything new?    [Buwayz] Of course. The Lebanese state must perform all its  duties, now more than ever, in controlling and monitoring  security. Citizens should also realize that there is a  premeditated provocation aiming to provoke a particular sector  of the Lebanese people to create reactions that will play a  principal role in undermining internal cohesion and solidarity.  It is no coincidence that the Kasrawan area was the direct  target. The reason for targeting it is clear. The targeting of  a church and the French Cultural Center were no coincidence  either. All these developments should clearly make us realize  that there is an attempt to provoke. We should not be trapped by  it. The state must thwart these attempts through its security  organs and the Lebanese people, who have experienced war and  know that things should be more cohesive than ever.</p>

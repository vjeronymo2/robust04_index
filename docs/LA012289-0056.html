			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS FUNDS  </P> <P> I want to clarify your article "United Way Assails Distribution of U.S. Funds  for the Homeless" (Metro, Jan. 5). During the press conference and subsequent  media contacts on Jan. 4, the point was made that I was speaking as the chair  of the Local Emergency Food and Shelter Board, which is responsible for the  distribution of $4 million in federal funds earmarked for this program in Los  Angeles County, and not in my position as president of United Way.  </P> <P> As chair, my comments reflected the sentiment of the Emergency Food and Shelter  Board and not necessarily those of the United Way.  </P> <P> Quickly now the Emergency Food and Shelter Board will meet to discuss what  actions will be required to increase Los Angeles County's share of Emergency  Food and Shelter Program funds. More than likely the United Way along with  other partners on the Emergency Food and Shelter Board will be asked for  support. And, I am confident support will be forthcoming.  </P> <P> LEO P. CORNELIUS  </P> <P> Chair  </P> <P> Emergency Food  </P> <P> and Shelter Board  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

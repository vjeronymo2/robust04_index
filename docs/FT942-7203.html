			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ciga suffers net loss of L200bn Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels chain, yesterday announced a net consolidated loss for 1993 of L200bn (Dollars 126m), weighed down by the heavy cost of financing more than L1,000bn of debt. Net financial charges reached L149bn, against L196bn in 1992, but overall debt grew from L972bn at end-1992 to L1,102bn at end-1993. Having been courted by ITT Sheraton of the US and Forte of the UK, Ciga has now gained a fragile independence following the unexpected success of a L1,003bn rights issue. The L1,000-a-share issue was expected to fail, delivering a majority of shares to Ciga's creditor banks and then to ITT Sheraton, which had offered L740 a share for the company. Ciga has now started direct negotiations with creditors to reduce its debt, most of which is short-term. Talks are likely to take some weeks. The rights issue means Ciga is no longer controlled by Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company. Attention is now focused on the shareholder assembly called for June 24 or July 6, at which new investors could press for board changes. Snam, the gas distribution subsidiary of Eni, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals group, made net profits in 1993 of L127bn, against L139bn in 1992. Sales rose to L12,011bn from L10,807bn.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China urged to cut fees A group of multinational chemicals companies operating in China is putting pressure on Beijing to cut registration fees which could cost several million dollars, according to the magazine Asian Chemical News.

The companies, which include BASF of Germany and the UK's ICI, complain that the fees are incompatible with the membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) which China is trying to rejoin.

The companies' case has been taken up by US and European chief trade negotiators at Geneva.</p>

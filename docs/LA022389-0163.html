			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN TRADE DROP REPORTED BY SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> DECLINE IN EXPORTS HURTS DRIVE TO BOOST ECONOMY  </P> <P> Exports from the Soviet Union declined last year despite a major push by Moscow  to expand its foreign trade, while the total cost of imports increased  significantly, the government said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But even though the total value of imports and exports rose to the equivalent  of nearly $220 billion in 1988, the growth was so small -- only 2.3% -- that no  real recovery was possible from a massive drop in 1987, the official Soviet  newspaper Government Herald reported.  </P> <P> Thus, foreign trade has stagnated at a time Moscow had hoped that increased  trade would help revitalize the country's economy, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The report was one of the most pessimistic accounts of the Soviet Union's  deepening economic crisis. It made clear that growth is small and circumscribed  and that various quick solutions that have been proposed, such as joint  ventures with foreign investors, are not likely to be the breakthroughs the  government wants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scathing Criticism  </P> <P> Economic relations with the Soviet Union's socialist partners, Moscow's most  important trade links by far, are "unsatisfactory," the newspaper frankly  declared. "New forms of cooperation have not yet produced any returns, and  direct ties between socialist countries have turned into a means to exchange  deficit items," it added.  </P> <P> According to the paper, prices for raw materials and fuels, the principal  Soviet exports, declined worldwide, and Moscow did not meet its sales targets.  </P> <P> Sales of machinery and other equipment fell as well. They now account for less  than 12% of the country's exports and, largely because of shoddiness and old  technology, only 3% of Soviet sales to capitalist countries.  </P> <P> "Soviet industry continues producing planes, vehicles, tractors and  agricultural machines whose specifications differ very little from previous  models and which are inferior to Western types," said the newspaper, an  authoritative new semimonthly publication from the Council of Ministers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost of Imports Rises  </P> <P> At the same time, it said, the cost of imports rose 6.5%, an increase that  reduced the Soviet Union's trade surplus in 1988 by almost half, to the  equivalent of $6.5 billion. But it calls into question the ambitious plans put  forward by some Soviet officials for massive imports of Western consumer goods  and equipment to expand Soviet industries -- all of which would have to be  financed by foreign loans and credits if the surplus declined further.  </P> <P> Overall prospects for Soviet economic restructuring this year do not appear  promising, the Government Herald reported, saying that contracts for the  delivery of raw materials this year are well below targets set in the country's  economic development plan.  </P> <P> It said fuel prices seem unlikely to increase much and that various trade  development programs, including joint ventures and new deals with the West,  have brought little investment and limited trade.  </P></p>

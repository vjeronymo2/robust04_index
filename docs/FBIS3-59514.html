			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "A Software To Accelerate </F> Use of Carbon Fibers"]    [Text] With Composic, a bicycle wheel made of  carbon-epoxy fiber can be designed in five days. Sports  industries, as well as the automotive and aeronautics  industries, are interested.    To sell to the Japanese its software for computing  composite-material structures, Framasoft+CSI, a Framatome  subsidiary, has found a worthy ally: no less than Toray, the  world's number one in carbon fibers. Toray has been using the  software, baptized Composic, in-house for the past year for its  own account, and began marketing it in July 1993. To date, it  has found three clients: the National Aerospace Laboratory (the  Japanese NASA) and two manufacturers of golf clubs.    These first users operate in the two sectors that consume  the  most carbon fibers in Japan. This is, of course, not  happenstance. But Toray is making no secret of its intent to  penetrate other sectors, especially the automotive sector. This  will not be possible unless the sector's design departments,  whose culture is still strongly influenced by metals, learn to  work with composites. And the Composic software should help them  in this regard.    "The design of a part made of composite material still takes  more time and the productivity of the design departments is very  low," says Toyoki Tanaka, manager of Toray Industries' research  and engineering laboratories. Actually, the 20 or so engineers  and technicians comprising this center have substantial computer  facilities at their disposal: A battery of computers, including  a Cray, and softwares gleaned from all parts of the world, such  as Abaqus and Ideas of American origin. But these are difficult  to use and require a learning period of at least two months.  <H5>  40 Units Already Sold in Europe </H5>   The Framasoft+CSI product "is learned" in two weeks. It  enables the construction of a part, on a computer screen, by  stacking up to 60 layers of materials, and the advance  computation of its mechanical behavior. It is much more  productive than its competitors. For example: The design of a  bicycle wheel with three carbon-epoxy-fiber spokes takes no more  than five days versus two to three months heretofore. And "the  concordance between design computations and test results is very  good," says Toyoki Tanaka. Composic does have its limitations:  It does not provide for taking into account the nonlinear  behavior of materials. Given the interest being shown by Toray,  however, Framatome+CSI expects to close this gap.    The software has already been sold to the extent of  approximately 40 units in Europe in the aeronautics  (Aerospatiale), sports (Rossignol), and automotive (BMW, VW,  Ligier) sectors. It will undoubtedly contribute to the more  widespread use of carbon fibers by industry, possibly even in  the automotive sector, but the price of the fibers will also  have to come down. This angle is also being studied under the  Toray research program.</p>

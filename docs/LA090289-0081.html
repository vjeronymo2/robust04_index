			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 21, GIVES BIRTH IN HELICOPTER  </P> <P> A 21-year-old Antelope Valley woman gave birth to a baby boy Friday while en  route to a hospital in a Fire Department helicopter, authorities said.  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics delivered the healthy baby.  The mother, Julie Enis, and her son Johnny were in good condition Friday at  Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, officials said.  </P> <P> The unusual delivery occurred during the 15-minute flight between Enis' home in  the rural desert community of Lake Los Angeles and the hospital. The baby was  delivered by paramedics Dan Coffman and Jack Ferme while pilot Bob Dunbar flew  the helicopter.  </P> <P> Inspector John Lenihan said the airborne delivery was unusual because when  birth is imminent, paramedics routinely deliver the baby at the mother's home  rather than risk having to do so in a helicopter.  </P> <P> "We usually try to do it so it happens at the hospital or the house, not in the  air," Lenihan said.  </P> <P> Because Lake Los Angeles is a 20- to 30-minute ambulance drive from the closest  fire station, Fire Department helicopters from Pacoima are routinely sent to  emergency calls, Lenihan said.  </P> <P> It was Ferme's first delivery -- airborne or otherwise. But Coffman is a  veteran. "My 23rd," he said proudly.  </P></p>

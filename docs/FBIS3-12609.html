The minister conveyed to his  majesty a verbal message from his brother His Majesty Sultan  Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman dealing with Jordanian-Omani efforts and  coordination to bring the views of the various Yemeni parties  closer, especially after the success of Jordanian efforts that  culminated in the signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and  accord, which safeguards the unity of sisterly Yemen and helps  build its modern state.    The talks also dealt with the distinguished relations  between  the two sisterly countries as well as regional and international  issues of common concern.

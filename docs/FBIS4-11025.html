			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Legislative sources have reported that several  deputies who opposed the military dictatorship yesterday offered  their services as "mediators" in the creation of a grand front  of "democratic forces." The objective is to form a united front  to defeat the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] in the coming  elections.    Legislator Gloria Moreno, spokesperson for the group, read a  statement titled "For the Unity of Democratic Forces," in which  they made their summons. The document was presented at the seat  of the Assembly Credential Commission.    According to election polls, the PRD is the people's  favorite, with a 35 percent lead. Opponents are trying to unite  in order to defeat the front runner in the upcoming election.    The document reads: "We hereby offer our services as  mediators to facilitate a broad-based understanding among  democratic forces. We also call upon the candidates and the  people to support this statement."    The statement is signed by Marco Ameglio, for the National  Renewal Movement; Gisela Chung, for the Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement [MOLIRENA]; Raquel Lanuza, for the Christian  Democratic Party; Rodrigo Molina for Solidarity Party; Jose  Paredes mayoral candidate for the National Unity Mission; Jilmer  Gonzalez of the Arnulfist Party; Mario Lasso for MOLIRENA, and  Gloria Moreno.    They have also called a meeting among all sectors opposed to  the PRD in the next few days "to discuss the contents of an  agreement to defend democracy."    The politicians highlighted the historic relevance of  President Guillermo Endara's "brave decision" to disclose  several videotaped recordings of corruption within the military  government.    The note adds that "the president's action constitutes a  vital measure that made the people realize what the PRD really  represents. It also made the democratic leaders reflect on the  unity needed to prevent the allies of the military from rising  to power."    Opponents of the PRD condemned the disgraceful past of  "demagoguery and violence against those who struggled under a  single flag, a past that the PRD now wishes to hide with  unrestrained cynicism."    The PRD is the former political wing of the dismembered  military regime. Many of the party's activists have been  accused of corruption and other illegal activities, although the  party maintains that the accusations are part of a persecution  campaign launched by the present government.    Following the meeting of the legislators, PRD Legislator  Elias Castillo affirmed that "this is the expression of those  who want to rise to power and those who want to remain."    He questioned the possibility of unity among the forces that  oppose the PRD and said that his party has "the force of the  organized population."    Castillo added that the PRD also has "a personality of its  own; it is not divided. The PRD is united," while its opponents  are divided.    "The people are intelligent and have a keen eye. They will  not be fooled by the false prophesies of its opponents. They  only demonstrate their division. The only thing that unites  them is their ambition for power," he argued.    Castillo said that the videotapes Endara showed "will not  affect the party's image at all," which has received the full  support of its activists and followers.</p>

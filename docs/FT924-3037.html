			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Takeshita confident he can avoid resignation JAPANESE opposition parties yesterday went through the ritual of formally demanding the resignation from parliament of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, who has already defied two months of public demands that he take his final political bow. Mr Takeshita's determination to remain the elder statesman of the ruling Liberal Democratic party reflects the ability of tainted Japanese politicians either to ignore demands for their departure or to feign a resignation, only to return a few months later, apparently 'purified' by the experience. In presenting the resignation demand to parliament, the three largest opposition parties claimed that Mr Takeshita had brought shame to the Japanese political system and 'damaged its international reputation' through alleged gangster links. It is claimed that Mr Takeshita used the good offices of a gang boss to silence an extreme right-wing group which had mounted a 'praise to death' campaign against him in 1987, before his selection as party president and elevation to the prime ministership. Having survived two sessions of testimony before parliament and secure in the knowledge that the opposition does not have the numbers to make its resolution stick, Mr Takeshita has told his aides that the worst of the crisis is over, and that they should concentrate on a cabinet reshuffle likely later this week. He has justified his stand by arguing that 'if I resign, people will think I am guilty', though the conflicting evidence given by himself and other LDP officials has prompted about 70 per cent of Japanese, as measured by opinion polls, to demand Mr Takeshita's resignation. In private, Mr Takeshita insists he has done more for Japan than any other MP and, regardless of the gang allegations, is entitled to a dignified exit from politics. He also says the party owes him a large favour for his resignation as prime minister in 1989 during the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal. Mr Takeshita argues that he deserves credit for having negotiated the introduction of a controversial consumption tax, and that his skills contributed to the resolution of various complex bilateral disputes, including a decade-old debate with the UK government over exports of whisky to Japan. While Mr Takeshita is confident he has survived, he recognises that another term as prime minister is out of reach. Conscious of his place in political history, he had hoped to clear his name with a scandal-free second term and had presumed that a lack of obvious successors to Mr Miyazawa would provide an opening.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Only the vows will satisfy the sceptics - Why the float of 3i is again being proposed If the promised wedding between institutional investors and 3i, the UK's leading provider of equity finance to small and medium-sized businesses, is finally held this summer it will mark the end of one of the most prolonged and turbulent courtships the stock market has ever known. The suggestion that the six clearing banks and the Bank of England which own 3i - formed in 1945 as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation - may finally float up to 40 per cent of its equity provokes some natural scepticism. The notion of a float has been around for up to a decade. Yet the banks, led by National Westminster and Barclays, which between them own 41 per cent of 3i's equity, have good reason to support a 3i float now. 'There is hardly going to be a better time. It is just common sense really,' said a director of one of the shareholding banks yesterday. The last attempt to float 3i early in 1993 came to grief because National Westminster and Barclays decided that they would not gain enough from selling their stakes. Although 3i's net assets had risen to Pounds 1.3bn by then, the sale price was not likely to be sufficiently attractive. This is because NatWest, which holds a 23.1 per cent stake, is among shareholders which equity account for 3i. This allows them not only to gain from 3i dividends but from the rise in net asset values. This is thought to add about Pounds 15m a year to NatWest profits, in addition to the dividend income. This means that the float price for 3i becomes a delicate calculation. Banks such as NatWest have to gain enough from the one-off sale of part of their stakes in return for giving up regular income. The loss would be more pronounced if it prevented them from equity accounting their stakes. Accordingly, the rise in the shares of venture capital investment trusts - the most obvious comparison being Electra - over the past year was very significant. The sector discount to net asset values has now fallen to about 11 per cent, compared with a historic high of 35 per cent. The most immediate benefit of a flotation for the shareholders is that 3i will gain investment trust status. At the moment it is classed by the Inland Revenue as an investment company and is required to pay corporation tax on profits made from the sale of assets. Once 3i floats as an investment trust, there will be no corporation tax liability on the sale of investments and group shareholders' funds will be that much better off. As to the size of the float, 3i's advisers, Baring Brothers, and shareholders are understood to have chosen to sell no more than a third of the company in order to avoid the substantially greater cost involved in a larger sale like that of Wellcome shares last year. The float nevertheless left some of the venture capital industry somewhat uneasy. Some venture capital groups which are raising new capital are having an exceptionally difficult time persuading UK institutions to replenish their funds. Institutions may have decided not to invest in these new funds in order to enter the unquoted company sector indirectly via the 3i flotation. 3i added further to the competition for funds earlier this month when for the first time it raised a Ecu300m (Pounds 227m) fund of its own. 'There is no doubt potential investors were attracted by the spread of our business and the enormous deal flow we enjoy,' said Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive. 3i denies the move into fund management has anything to do with the float. But it is clearly planning to raise further fee-earning funds, possibly for investment in the UK. Such a move would inevitably drain funds that might have flowed to the venture capital groups already focused on investing in smaller unquoted companies. By raising funds 3i will also be able to keep more of the deals it finds and has to syndicate because of its policy of only taking minority stakes in its investments. 3i could therefore become a significantly less generous provider of deals to smaller venture capital groups. This is likely to lead to further pressure for consolidation among the smaller venture capital suppliers within the industry. So will 3i change its approach to its market once it becomes a quoted company and an FT-SE 100 stock to boot? 'We are not going to shorten the time horizons for our investments,' says Mr Charles Richardson, director of corporate affairs. One of 3i's selling points, it says, is that it does not push companies to provide investors with an exit, unlike many other venture capital providers. A company's management is the 'best judge' of when to seek a float or a trade sale, 3i says. But the 3i flotation will give it greater flexibility to sharpen its focus on the smaller unquoted investment sector. The group is considering, for example, setting up a venture capital investment trust or regional venture capital trust along the lines proposed by the chancellor in the last budget. This depends on details of the trusts which the Treasury expects to announce by the end of the month. Aside from the financial calculations, the shareholder banks decided that 3i had reached the stage where it should benefit from the financial discipline of a Stock Exchange listing. They regarded the group as having reshaped itself in a way that would withstand investor scrutiny. Despite the financial and managerial logic, the engagement has been mooted so long that there will be a sceptical City audience until the vows are finally exchanged.</p>

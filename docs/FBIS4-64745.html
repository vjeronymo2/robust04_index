			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Otto Wolf von Amerongen, chairman of the </F> Eastern Committee of German Industry, by Adelbert Reif; place  and date not given: "Not Let Ourselves Be Discouraged"]    [Text] [Reif] How do you assess the prospects of the  former Soviet Union to catch up with the West in economic terms?    [Wolff von Amerongen] They are not rosy. Apart from a few  exceptions in the field of high technology and energy, the CIS  states are currently unable to supply competitive products to  the international market.    [Reif] How will things continue with Russia?    [Wolff von Amerongen] Russia will remain a problem for a  long time. The greatest tragedy of the Russians is that they  are unable to stop inflation. The National Bank, which should  actually act as a factor of stability, is the biggest banknote  printer of the country. And even though it provides enormous  amounts of money to the armament industry and heavy industry in  violation of all reason, wages cannot be paid as a rule.    [Reif] What should the Germans do in this situation?    [Wolff von Amerongen] We must not let ourselves be  discouraged by the events in Russia. If a great number of  German companies get involved in Russia, this is done out of  tradition and human obligation -- but also with a view to the  large market that will come one day.</p>

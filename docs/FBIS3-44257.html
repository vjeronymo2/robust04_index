This followed a request by the Freedom Alliance that  the deadline should be postponed to give it the opportunity to  examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC [African National  Congress].    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after  talks between the government, the ANC and the Freedom Alliance  that the government had made a proposal regarding the future of  the Zulu king and Natal/KwaZulu. A constitutional principle  providing for traditional leadership is to be discussed with the  Zulu king this weekend. However, new problems arose regarding a  volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners.    Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that the  proposals submitted to the alliance were considered to have vast  implications, and that urgent consultations with alliance  leaders were imperative. Discussions were to have begun last  night after the trilateral meeting. Mr. Cronje said the fact  that the state president would be prevented from promulgating  the election date today gave the alliance additional time to  look for an acceptable solution. He said that changes to the  constitution would not have been easy after the promulgation of  the election date.</p>

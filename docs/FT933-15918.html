			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Equity Issues: Hong Kong listing for Shanghai Petrochemical SHANGHAI Petrochemical, the largest of the nine Chinese state-owned companies to seek a stock market listing in Hong Kong, yesterday came to the market for up to HKDollars 2.72bn (Dollars 351m) in an issue which will see 30 per cent of the company listed internationally. Company officials said proceeds would be used to repay foreign currency borrowings of HKDollars 950m falling due in 1993 and 1994, to finance capital expenditure this year and next of HKDollars 1.25bn and to increase working capital. The company's financial advisers, Merrill Lynch and Peregrine Capital, a Hong Kong broker, will split the issue of 1.68bn H shares equally between Hong Kong and the rest of the world. US investors will be offered American depositary receipts - each equal to 100 shares in Shanghai Petrochemical - and European investors either ADRs or lines of unbundled stock. The issue price, to be determined by tender in the US, is expected to be between HKDollars 1.55 and HKDollars 1.74 a share, giving the stock a prospective price/earnings ratio of 12.3 to 13.8 on forecast 1993 net earnings of Yn848m (HKDollars 612.7m). Depending on the level of subscription in Hong Kong, up to 168m of the shares allocated to international investors may be clawed back to satisfy demand in the colony. Last week, Tsingtao Brewery offered 317.6m shares at HKDollars 2.80 each to raise HKDollars 889m. Indications yesterday were that the offer was around 100 times oversubscribed with some HKDollars 100bn committed to the offer. Shanghai Petrochemical is China's largest petrochemical company and the mainland's ninth biggest industrial group. Its main lines of business are synthetic fibres, resins and plastics, intermediate petrochemicals and petroleum products. The company is dependent solely on the Chinese economy. It buys its main input, oil, at a subsidised price and 40 per cent of its output is sold at below market prices. The crude oil subsidy will remain intact until 1995. Mr Wang Jiming, Shanghai Petrochemical's chairman, said, however, that planned additions to the company's plant and further economic liberalisation in China would fuel significant earnings growth in the years ahead. Any move by the state to raise the price of crude oil towards the free market price would be compensated by price increases in the company's products, he added.</p>

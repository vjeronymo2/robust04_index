			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Motoring: A diesel which has the power DIESEL cars account for 12 per cent of British registrations and that figure is climbing. As recently as 1988, it was less than 5 per cent. A further boost will come from the Citroen ZX Turbo which is quite simply the best small-medium diesel car yet. Powered by the first turbocharged version of the 1.9 litre XUD engine, the ZX outperforms some petrol- engined cars of similar price while offering around 47 mpg (6 l/100 km) diesel economy. Both the Pounds 11,370 Avantage and Pounds 11,970 Aura have power steering, electric sunroof and front windows and remote- control central locking. Aura buyers get alloy wheels, better upholstery and smarter external trim. With masses of torque (pulling power), the ZX Turbo's driveability is unmatched. For a diesel, acceleration through the gears (0-60 mph/0-96 kph in 10.3 seconds) is unusually vigorous. More impressive still is the way it pulls up steep hills in the 25.3 mph (40.7 kph) per 1,000 rpm fifth gear without slackening pace. Ride and handling are best in class. The engine is quiet at tickover, barely audible at a motorway cruise. Build quality is up to best German standards. The ZX Turbo is so good that anyone in the market for a 5-door for under Pounds 12,000 would be perverse to buy a petrol-engined car without trying it first. I have just two grouses. Tall drivers will find the front seats too short and it would be better if the back seat cushion folded forward to provide a completely flat, load-carrying floor.</p>

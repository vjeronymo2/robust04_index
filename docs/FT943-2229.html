			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: City regulation The British system for investigating and prosecuting fraud has once again been found wanting. Powers that compel suspects to answer questions are blatantly unfair - as the European Commission of Human Rights has ruled in its assessment of the Guinness affair. But it is not as though these powers are particularly effective anyway. Britain's record of convicting fraudsters is notoriously poor. A rethink is needed. A promising approach would be to abandon criminal punishments for many classes of financial skulduggery and instead focus on civil penalties. Those convicted could be fined, ordered to restitute funds to those who had been damaged, and/or be disqualified from being directors. When individuals have not personally enriched themselves, a prison sentence often looks unnecessarily harsh. And since they would not go to jail, it might also be acceptable to lower the standards of proof to those in civil cases. The main argument deployed against such an approach is that it would create one law for the rich and one law for the poor: petty thiefs would end up in prison, but big fraudsters would not. But this need not be so. It would still be possible to retain criminal sanctions for cases such as embezzlement. Moreover, if the evidence was not strong enough for a criminal trial in such cases, surely it would be better to inflict stiff civil penalties than no punishment at all.</p>

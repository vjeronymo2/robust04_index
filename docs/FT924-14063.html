			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Amsterdam mourns air crash dead THOUSANDS of people filed silently past the site of the Netherlands' worst air disaster yesterday as Amsterdam mourned the 75 people killed when an El Al jet smashed into blocks of flats in the Bijlmermeer suburb a week ago, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. A bugler sounded The Last Post in pouring rain as Mr Ed van Thijn, the city's mayor, laid a wreath some 50 metres from the point where the Israeli jet left a huge hole in the two adjoining 10-storey blocks. Some of the bereaved among the estimated 10,000 present fainted and had to be helped to their feet. 'I lost two sisters and two children. They found one of my sisters and jewellery belonging to the other. They didn't find the children's bodies,' said a 20-year-old Surinamese woman as she gazed blankly at the proceedings.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READING THE REAL RESULTS OF EXIT POLLS  </P> <P> Kudos and hip-hip-hurray to Roger Simon for his views on the exit poll (View,  Nov. 19). The recent TV journalistic embarrassment in New York City and  Virginia is cause for sanctity of the secret ballot.  </P> <P> Simon is correct in saying that people are sick of pollsters and that the  practice of lying to them is a healthy sign.  </P> <P> WALTER MORYKWAS  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

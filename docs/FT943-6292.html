			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (6): Compliant workforce - Why trade unions are not more militant Malaysia's trade unions ought to be flourishing. The country has full employment and rising wages, and the unions are freer than in most countries in the region. But the leaders of the the main union centre - the Malaysian Trade Union Congress - are subdued. 'Things here are not as bad as in many countries, we have semi-free trade unionism,' concedes Mr G Rajasekaran, MTUC secretary general. Union membership has even been rising, especially in the manufacturing sector, but it is not keeping pace with the growth in employment and has fallen sharply in the traditional stronghold of the rubber plantations. Including members of the two smaller union centres, the Malaysian Labour Organisation (led by the main bank employees union) and CUEPACS, representing public sector workers, there are about 700,000 trade union members in Malaysia. That means about 15 per cent of the eligible workforce is organised. 'We are doing better than some countries like the US, but we are not happy with our performance and we should do better,' says Mr Rajasekaran. One of the biggest problems for the unions is the growth of immigrant labour - mainly from Indonesia and Bangladesh. Immigrants have caused a big drop in union membership in construction and the plantations, where they are often paid at lower rates than Malaysian workers. How much the low membership is also the result of government restrictions is hard to judge. Mr Gordon McColl, in the Singapore office of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, reckons that the MTUC would double its membership from 400,000 to 800,000 if it faced no restrictions. The government believes in consensus around its own model of 'guided' politics and economics and makes no secret of its dislike for adversarial trade unionism. Government ministers labelled union leaders 'traitors' when they supported the call in international forums for minimum world labour standards, an accusation that hurt. Mr Anthony Yeo, secretary general of the Ministry of Human Resources, says that complete freedom of association could add to costs 'because of unscrupulous trade union activity'. On paper the trade union recognition laws are liberal. If seven workers petition for a union the Registrar of Trade Unions has to consider it, and if 50 per cent plus one of the relevant employees of a company are members of the union the employer has to recognise the union. In practice, however, it is extremely difficult to form a new union and the unions are engaged in a constant game of cat and mouse with the Registrar. Applications are regularly turned down. The textile union wanted to organise the Mattel plant which makes Barbie dolls, but was told it was a toy and not a textile factory. Similarly, when workers at a Kimberley-Clark factory wanted to join the print and paper union the Registrar told them it was the wrong union but refused to tell them which would be the right union saying it would be 'unethical' to do so. Most controversially, the national unions are not allowed to organise in the electronics sector, which employs nearly 200,000 people and is the fastest growing sector. 'About 70 per cent of the workers are women and they tend to be docile,' says Mr Abdul Razak Hamid, head of the textile union in Penang. Mr Yeo defends the government's position: 'We believe that enterprise unions are the most appropriate for this sector, although it may be that at some point in the future we will adopt a different position.' Mr P Arunasalam, general secretary of the electrical workers union, says that most of the enterprise unions wither away after a while, and some employers even prevent them getting started. But his biggest complaint is that the definition of electronic is constantly shifting to include lots of electrical workers who should be in his union. If extending organisation is hard, going on strike is harder. Mr Hamid, of the textile union, says: 'We can go on strike, but then again we can't' The last proper strike in his sector was in 1976. The law can require compulsory arbitration instead of a strike and there is no right of appeal. In practice that means no strikes. The closest union members get to industrial action is picketing in their lunch breaks. Recently, for example, employees at Unilever in Kuala Lumpur started a lunch-time picketing campaign after a 9 per cent pay claim was rejected. The union leaders do not deny that wages and working conditions have been improving. But they are caught between claiming that wages have not been rising as fast as the employers maintain and claiming credit for the rises that have been achieved. Mr Arunasalam says that wages have gone up 27 per cent over the past three years in the electrical sector in factories covered by collective agreements (which have built-in 10 per cent annual increments), compared with only 15 per cent in non-union plants. Mr Rajasekeran believes, like the government, that wages should rise in line with productivity but claims that many workers have been getting reasonable rises only by working excessive overtime and points to the much higher basic wages in Singapore. And Mr N Balakrishnan, an official of the electrical union in Penang, takes issue with the World Bank figures which show average per capita income at around USDollars 3,000 and says that 70 per cent of workers earn less than USDollars 2,000. But Mr Balakrishnan sounds dispirited. 'Consumer culture is now such a big thing, workers are just interested in working and spending, they are not interested in union activism,' he says. Workers in unionised plants have better job security. But Malaysia does not have a hire and fire industrial culture and employment rights and health and safety regulation are both reasonably good, at least on paper. An economic downturn might help improve the standing of the unions, but the union leaders fear that any success would bring with it even tighter restrictions.</p>

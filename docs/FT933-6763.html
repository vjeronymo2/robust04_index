			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Brussels warns on airport monopolies THE European Commission's competition commissioner yesterday threatened to use controversial legal powers to break open monopolies in airport ground-handling services. Mr Karel Van Miert said a special directive aimed at deregulating services such as passenger check-in, baggage handling and refuelling would be the 'best general solution' to the problem of monopolies at some EC airports. He is considering the use of Article 90 of the EC treaty, which allows the Commission to impose liberalisation on intransigent member states. Seven EC airlines have complained to the Commission about alleged abuse of ground-handling monopolies at Milan, Frankfurt and across Spain. KLM, the Dutch carrier spearheading the complaint, claims that charges for services at these airports are between 30 per cent and 50 per cent higher than at airports offering a choice of services. Mr Van Miert said yesterday that the Commission had also received formal complaints from airlines and private ground-handling companies concerning other German and Portuguese airports. Informal complaints have also been lodged against airports which he would not name. The commissioner said all the formal complaints would be investigated. But he added that competition officials were already working on a draft directive, which could be imposed on EC governments using Article 90, or passed under the usual procedure, which requires member states' approval. Mr Van Miert's predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, frequently threatened to use Article 90 directives to break open energy, postal and telecoms monopolies. This is the first time that Mr Van Miert has openly backed the use of Article 90 in a specific sector. But he stressed that fellow commissioners, member states, the European Parliament and all the interested parties would have to be consulted. Some monopoly airports claim safety will be compromised if too many rival companies are allowed to compete. As transport commissioner until January, Mr Van Miert pushed through the latest package of airline liberalisation. He said that a situation where competition in ground-handling services was restricted would become 'more and more intolerable' as the rest of the civil aviation sector was liberalised. Prospects for a voluntary cut in EC-wide steel capacity have improved over the last month, Mr Van Miert indicated yesterday. But he said the Italian and Spanish industries had not yet met strict demands for cuts in state aid or capacity. Mr Van Miert said there had been some progress in recent discussions with Italian officials, and with the new Spanish industry minister. Rome submitted outline plans for the future of Ilva, the state-owned producer, last week and has promised to supply more details next month. Community industry ministers will meet on September 21 for a discussion on the steel industry, which has been hit by over-capacity, recession and competition from cheap non-EC imports. In principle, producers must submit plans for voluntary cuts by the end of next month, but private steelmakers will be reluctant to reduce capacity if their publicly-owned rivals are still receiving heavy subsidies.</p>

The  shuttle had originally been scheduled to land at the Kennedy  Space Center (KSC), but bad weather over the center forced the  change in the landing place.    The moment the shuttle touched down, approximately 300  mission controllers and other people, who had been watching the  large image screen within a studio at the German Space Operation  Center (GSOC) stood up and applauded, celebrating the safe  return. Among those people at the studio watching the landing  were Professor H. Stoewer, managing director of the German Space  Agency (DARA), Dr. W. Kroell, chairman of the German Aerospace  Research Institute (DLR), D-2 mission manager Dr. H. Dodeck, and  the author.    Following the 1985 D-1 mission, the D-2 mission was  originally scheduled to be carried out in 1988. However, it was  delayed five years due to the accident involving the U.S. space  shuttle Challenger. Considering the difficulties they must have  had to overcome during those years of delay, this author could  read the mixed feelings of relief and hardship on the faces of  the people in the mission control room.    Our company, Space Technology Corporation (STC), was the  Japanese participant in the D-2 mission. In the following, the  author will introduce the reason for STC's participation in the  D-2 project and the experiences we had by participating in it.  <H5>  Outline of D-2 Project </H5>   Management of D-2 Project    The D-2 project was led by DLR under the supervision of  DARA.  The launch of the space lab was delayed several times before the  launch was carried out in 1993. Germany set up DARA in the  summer of 1989 to promote space development efficiently by  empowering it to coordinate all space-related activities within  the country. In line with this, the responsibility to implement  the D-2 project was transferred from the German Research and  Technology Ministry (BMFT) to DARA in August 1990.    However, considering the fact that DLA was already  responsible for promoting the D-2 project, the institute was  allowed to continue managing the D-2 mission as an exceptional  measure.    In October 1990, the names of four German astronauts, i.e.,  R. Bruemmer, H. Schlegel, G. Thiele, and U. Walter, all of DLR,  were announced. In September 1990, the Manned Space Control  Center (MSCC) was set up within GSOC located in Oberpfaffenhofen  in the outskirts of Munich. The work for launching space lab D-2  according to the time schedule (Table 1 [not reproduced]) in  September 1992 proceeded. However, the manifest for the  launching of the space shuttle was revised several times. The  shuttle launch from KSC finally took place at 1050, 26 April  1993, seven months after the original launch schedule.    Background of D-2 Project    The manned space flight project in Germany started with its  participation in the space lab development program in the early  1970s. Based on the success of the manned space lab D-1 mission  in 1985, the D-2 program was planned. (The D-1 mission sent two  German astronauts into space.)    The D-2 project was led by Germany, with the United States,  Japan, and other European countries participating, to conduct a  series of experiments under the microgravity environment of  space. The project was regarded as the first important step in  preparation for using Europe's Columbus space center.    Scientifically, the D-2 mission aimed at conducting material  and life science experiments and conducting earth and  astronomical observations. Technologically, the mission was  designed to test the operation of the experiment equipment  systems, to promote the automation of ground control operation,  to evaluate space robotics technology, and to carry out the  measurement of microgravity in space using the most advanced  measurement technology. The scientific experiments involved the  evaluation of the technologies used in the mission experiments  and the operability of the experiment instruments to prove their  functioning and performance in space.    The payload of the D-2 mission was composed of 15 payload  elements involving 28 experimental instruments. Approximately 90  experiments, taking a total of 210 hours, were conducted in  space using these instruments.    One aim of the D-2 project was to promote international  cooperation in space endeavors. ESA took charge of the  development of an anthrorack and a fluid physics experiment  system. Six ESA experiments were conducted using these  German-developed systems. ESA shouldered a reasonable percentage  of the mission costs.    CNES of France offered a temperature-gradient furnace for  use  in the experiment. NASA cut the launch costs for the European  partners in exchange for its use of 30 percent of the anthrorack  and for allowing them to conduct one experiment in the biolab.    Originally, 30 percent of the German space experiment  resources was made available to German industry. However, the  industry's interest in conducting experiments in space was low,  and only one company, a beer company, participated in the D-2  project. As for Japan, STC participated by shouldering a  reasonable amount of the mission costs.  <H5>  Background of STC's Participation in D-2 Mission </H5>   Since former U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced a  program  to construct a space station in 1983 and called on Japan,  Canada, and European countries to participate in the program,  Japanese interest in the program has been mounting. Since the  announcement of the program, a group of private companies, led  by major trading companies, has been set up to study space  station utilization. In addition, the Japan Space Utilization  Promotion Center (JSUP) has been established.    In 1985, an agreement was reached between the Research and  Technology Ministry (BMFT) of the former West Germany and the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) regarding  Japan's participation in the D-2 mission. Both parties agreed  that it was beneficial to both countries to strengthen their  mutual cooperation in space fields to expand the industrial  utilization of space.    This agreement was followed by the establishment of STC in  April 1986, with MITI's backing, as a domestic organization to  promote Japan's participation in German space experiment  programs (the D-2 and D-3 projects). STC was set up with 70  percent of the capital supplied by MITI and the 30-percent  balance, 5 percent each, shouldered by six private companies,  i.e., Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Toshiba, NEC,  Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric. STC was originally  established to engage in the research and development of  compound semiconductor materials under microgravity conditions.  To date, approximately 30 STC researchers have been engaged in  R&amp;D at its labs set up within the research centers of these  companies.    STC was originally scheduled to participate in both the D-2  space lab mission, scheduled to be carried out in 1988, and the  D-3 mission, scheduled to be implemented in 1991. However, the  Challenger accident forced the United States to drastically  change the space shuttle program, and this prompted the  Department of Defense (DOD) to include the expendable launch  vehicle (ELV) as a payload. The schedule for the resumption of  the space shuttle launch program, announced in late 1986, set  the launch of the D-2 mission space lab for 1991, three years  after the original launch schedule. This delay forced STC to  thoroughly review its space research plan. As a result, our  corporation decided to continue research under a microgravity  environment by using small rockets and the free-fall tower, both  of which were available for obtaining microgravity conditions.    On the German side, on the other hand, BMFT designated  Intospace as the establishment in charge of accepting  applications from private German companies, as well as from  foreign companies, for participating in the D-series missions.  STC signed a new contract with Intospace for the Japanese  corporation's participation in the D-2 mission (Figure 1 [not  reproduced]). The negotiations for STC's participation took time  because the German side had failed to determine the fees that  private companies participating in the D-2 project were required  to pay. The German side had no time to determine the fees  because it was preoccupied with the preparations for  establishing DARA. An agreement between the two countries was  ultimately reached. The agreement required the private  participants to pay mission costs by taking into account the  weight, energy consumed, and the length of use of the  experimental resources by the researchers of the participating  establishments.    In addition to these mission costs, the costs for creating  the cartridges and for conducting the preparatory experiments on  the ground in Germany came to an unexpectedly high level.  <H5>  Access to D-2 Mission </H5>   When STC was set up, each of the labs located within the  research centers of the investing companies drew up proposals on  the kind of experiments that should be conducted when STC  participated in the D-2 mission. The following are the proposals  put forth by these labs.        -  Lab No. 1 (Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries):  Growth of a PbSnTe crystal using the Bridgeman technique    -  Lab  No. 2 (Toshiba): Growth of compound semiconductor crystals  involving the use of several material systems    -  Lab No. 3 (NEC):  Research on the fluid state of materials for growing crystals    -  Lab No. 4 (Hitachi): GaAs/Ge heterojunction    -  Lab No. 5  (Fujitsu): Growth of a GaAs/Ge crystal from the melted fluid  state    -  Lab No. 6 (Mitsubishi Electric): Epitaxial growth of  InP       These proposals came when information on the experimental  systems to be used in the D-2 mission was still scarce.  Therefore, this caused these proposals to be reviewed later by  taking into account the results of the preparatory experiments  conducted on the ground and the characteristics of the  experimental systems to be used aboard the space lab. The review  was made in a series of systematized meetings at which STC  researchers, engineers in charge of the experimental systems  from Germany and France, D-2 mission officials from Germany, and  the German contractors participated. They exchanged candid  opinions on technological matters. It was not easy to reach an  agreement because of conflicts in the policies and the method of  dividing the mission costs among the participants.    The quadripartite meeting was held a total of six times,  i.e., in Hanover (Intospace), Koln (DLR), Bremen (ERNO),  Friedrichshafen (Dornier), Toulouse (CNES), and Tokyo (STC).  These meetings were very useful in promoting mutual  understanding, as well as the project, by grasping the actual  situation surrounding the preparations being made for launching  the space lab (Photo 2 [not reproduced]).    When STC was established, the investing companies intended  to  conduct one experiment each, for a total of six separate  experiments in the D-2 mission. However, they failed to  coordinate these experiments because of lack of information  about how long they could use what kind of experimental hardware  and how much their experiments would cost.    Therefore, efforts were made to coordinate and reach an  agreement with respect to the mission costs at the quadripartite  meetings.    For the D-2 mission, four types of furnaces were  available--a  temperature-gradient furnace (CNES), a uniform temperature  furnace (ERNO), a fast-cooling furnace (Dornier), and a mirror  furnace (ERNO). STC held discussions with engineers from these  furnace manufacturers to ascertain if the furnaces could be used  to conduct the experiments put forth by these six Japanese labs.  First, Lab No. 3 submitted the specifications for the system for  conducting an experiment involving the measurement of the  thermal conductivity of molten semiconductor materials under  microgravity conditions. The D-2 project was designed to allow  manned space experiments employing mostly general-purpose  experiment systems to be conducted. Because of this, it was  almost impossible technologically to modify the systems to meet  the specifications required by Lab No. 3. Therefore, the  quadripartite meeting concluded that the lab's experiment should  be conducted by launching small rockets mounted with experiment  systems specifically designed for the lab's experiment.  Following this conclusion, Lab No. 3 decided not to participate  in the D-2 project.    The superiority of CNES's temperature-gradient furnace made  many participating establishments want to use the furnace for  conducting their experiments. This furnace made it possible to  use larger specimens than did the other available furnaces, and  it also made it possible to provide heat treatment to three  specimens simultaneously under the same conditions. Considering  the necessity for all these furnaces to be used uniformly, the  popularity of the French-made furnace posed a problem. Other  labs restudied their experiment themes so that the experiments  could be conducted in the D-2 mission. Lab No. 2 decided to  conduct an experiment involving the diffusion of impurities  within the melted fluid of a material using the uniform heating  furnace. On the other hand, Lab No. 5 decided to carry out the  growth of a crystal from the melted fluid of a material using  the uniform heating furnace in a slow cooling mode.    Lab No. 6 submitted a request to use the  temperature-gradient  furnace to conduct its experiment to realize the crystal  gas-phase growth of a material. However, the mission manager  recommended that the lab use the mirror furnace, and the  engineers from the mirror furnace company ascertained that the  furnace had the specifications that would satisfy the  requirements put forth by the lab. However, the lab insisted on  using the temperature-gradient furnace, and the Japanese request  was ultimately met.    As the experiment by Lab No. 1 progressed on the ground, it  became clear that the growth of a good PbSnTe crystal could not  be obtained unless it was carried out by controlling the  temperature gradient very accurately over several dozen hours.  Thus, the lab determined that the CNES's temperature-gradient  furnace was not suitable, and withdrew from the D-2 mission.  Instead, the lab decided to conduct its experiment by launching  small rockets (TEXUS).    Originally, Lab No. 4 intended to conduct material  experiments by launching many small rockets on its own without  relying on the D-2 project in view of the cost advantage and for  other research-related reasons. However, taking into  consideration the agreement between Japan and Germany regarding  the former's participation in the D-2 mission, the lab finally  decided to conduct its experiment using the steep-cooling  furnace designed to be used in the D-2 mission.    Finally, STC decided to conduct the four labs' experiments  involving nine separate specimens in the D-2 mission. However,  the extension of space shuttle's flight by one day made the  Japanese corporation conduct more experiments involving the  unexpectedly larger number of 13 specimens thanks to Germany's  largesse.    Of the research conducted by STC, research results have been  detailed in the July 1987, July 1988, August 1989, and August  1990 issues of KIKAI SHINKO. Therefore, the author will refrain  from elaborating further on STC's research in this report.  <H5>  Lesson Learned from Participating in International Project </H5>   The D-2 project was planned and carried out based on the  experiences and results of the D-1 project. However, the D-2  project was the first D-series project in which private  companies, including STC from Japan, were to participate. This  caused much time to be consumed during the preparatory stages in  order to determine the mission costs that these companies would  be required to shoulder. The original estimate of the costs  which STC would be required to pay was far higher than STC was  prepared to pay. This made STC, an organization which was set up  with a limited budget for financing its operation, take much  time and effort in narrowing the gap. However, thanks to the  cooperation from the Japan Key Technology Center, a compromise  was struck between the STC's budget for the D-2 project, which  was totally dependent on the government's ceiling-limited yearly  budgetary allocation, and the D-2 mission costs that had  increased substantially from the original estimate due to the  delay in the launch schedule.    By experiencing these difficulties, we have learned the  importance of nurturing a good relationship based on mutual  trust among the project partners for the success of the joint  project. We have also learned the importance of having a direct  exchange of opinions among the scientists and engineers involved  in the project with respect to the data obtained through the  ground experiments by having the experiment systems used at  hand. We traveled to Germany a number of times, the expenses for  which were covered by our limited research budget. However, the  author thinks that the travel expenses were worth spending in  that they promoted communications with the German side.    Through these experiences we have had in our efforts to  carry  out the D-2 project, we have learned (1) that the  characteristics of experiment systems change greatly depending  on the conditions of the specimens used, (2) that the effects of  these changes can be reduced by the use of optional systems or  through software modification, and (3) that it is important to  ascertain a system's limitations at the earliest-possible stage  of the experiment. We have also found that the researchers who  are equipped with insufficient data for preparatory experiments  tend to make the requirements too stringent. The availability of  a coordinator well versed in both the experiment systems and the  experiments conducted using these systems ensures that a project  will progress smoothly.    In the course of our efforts to promote the D-2 project, we  have experienced many instances of awkwardness resulting from  the cultural differences between the two countries. One example  of this is that we have seen the mission officials from German  governmental establishments and the officials from the private  sector having vigorous and candid discussions on matters  concerning the D-2 project. In Japan, such heated exchanges of  opinion do not occur between the government and the private  sector. Another example was that in German documents, that were  thought to have been prepared with the utmost care, we found  proofreading errors in passages referring to thermocouples. In  addition, there were many problems which German researchers did  not notice and which had to be pointed out by us. These problems  included the loss of reproducibility of data when specimens were  changed.    There were many occasions in which we were misunderstood by  the people we contacted in the United States and Europe. These  misunderstandings were traced mainly to the Japanese penchant  for valuing the proverb "Action speaks louder than words." By  carrying out the D-2 project together, we have been able to  further our mutual understanding with German engineers and  scientists. At the same time, we have recognized that carrying  out an international project is not as easy as it is generally  said to be.  <H5>  Epilogue </H5>   The specimens we used in the D-2 mission are scheduled to be  returned to the research organizations to which they belong  within about six weeks of the completion of the mission. These  returned specimens will be analyzed and evaluated, with the  results to be reported later. STC is grateful that an  unexpectedly large number of valuable experiments have been  successfully conducted through participation in the D-2 project,  i.e., the first large-scale technological cooperation program  carried out between Japan and Germany. Representing STC, the  author would like to express the company's gratitude to the  government departments concerned and to those investing  companies for their support and cooperation extended to its  research.    In order to promote research on the utilization of the space  environment, it is important to improve the infrastructure of  the domestic space industry and to introduce a system which will  make the users support space research more actively. To realize  this, the author suggests that research centers, like the Center  for Commercial Development of Space (CCDS) in the United States,  in which researchers from government establishments,  universities, and private industries can conduct R&amp;D  jointly, be  established.    STC's participation in the D-2 project made us more  confident  of promoting further Japanese-German technological cooperation  in the future. The project also contributed to promoting the  mutual exchange of scientists and engineers between the two  countries. The author concludes this article by hoping that our  experiences in the D-2 program will serve as a guide in our  continued efforts toward developing space.</p>

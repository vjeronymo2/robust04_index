			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jian (7115 0256)] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 14 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chen Jian,  Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United Nations,  said at the UN Security Council today that taking further  military actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina may entail negative  consequences rather than aid a political settlement of the  conflict there.    He said: The use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina should  be limited to the defense of the UN Protection Forces  [Unprofor]. China cannot help but express anxiety and concern  about the serious consequences which the air strikes may cause  for the safety of Unprofor personnel and their humanitarian  relief activities. The international community should act very  prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action.    Over 200 civilians have died or were wounded in Sarajevo,  the  capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as result of a shelling incident  there on 5 February. On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum to  the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in which it warned  them to remove their heavy weapons 20 km from Sarajevo or turn  them over to the United Nations within 10 days, otherwise they  would be subject to NATO air strikes.    The UN Security Council meeting today was called at the  request of Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Pakistan. The  representatives of over 50 countries demanded to take the floor  on the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation.    Chen Jian said: China is opposed to the use of force, or the  threat to use force, in resolving the conflict. He said: "The  eventual settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue should  continue to be sought within the framework of the principles set  out by the international conference on the former Yugoslavia and  relevant Security Council resolutions and through peaceful  negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair, and reasonable  solution that can guarantee the fundamental interests of the  various parties and that can be accepted by all."    In his speech, French Ambassador Merimee reiterated that the  warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina should place their heavy  weapons under UN control, otherwise they will be subject to air  strikes. He added that France endorsed Russia's proposal for  placing Sarajevo under UN control.    Russian Ambassador Vorontsov said that the UN Security  Council should come up with an "appropriate decision" so that  its previous resolutions on a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the removal of heavy weapons can be carried out.</p>

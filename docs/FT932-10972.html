			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Royal Insurance makes Pounds 404m cash call ROYAL Insurance yesterday surprised the markets with a deeply discounted one-for-three Pounds 404m rights issue which should enable it to take advantage of recent rises in insurance rates in the UK and overseas, News that the group returned to the black in the first quarter, however, helped calm unease among investors with the shares falling only 9p yesterday to close at 307p, compared with the rights issue price of 255p. Pre-tax profits in the first quarter of 1993 amounted to Pounds 2m compared with a Pounds 48m loss during the same period last year. Royal lost Pounds 679m between 1990 and 1992 'We felt the time was right to take advantage of the market upturn,' said Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, who said: 'We have trimmed back sufficiently and want to maintain the market share that we have. We are not looking to make any rapid expansion but the capital will support the whole base of our business.' The issue has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Barings. Brokers to the issue are SG Warburg Securities and Hoare Govett Corporate Finance. And the proceeds will be invested directly in Royal's general insurance business, increasing its solvency by 11 per cent to approximately 54 per cent. Although several insurers have raised cash through subordinated bond and debt issues, Royal is only the second composite insurer to ask its shareholders for fresh capital. Commercial Union raised Pounds 428m in February. 'We understand the reasons why they have done it but we are disappointed,' said Mr David Hudson, analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'It dilutes the potential earnings recovery. Without the rights issue the balance sheet would look a little bit wobbly.' Royal's first-quarter figures indicate continuing improvement in underwriting results, especially in the UK where underwriting losses fell to Pounds 21m compared with Pounds 91m at the same stage last year. Rises in premium rates, milder weather and a fall in mortgage indemnity losses were responsible. Underwriting losses in the United States rose to Pounds 65m (from Pounds 41m). The new cash could help Royal expand in some markets. Mr Roy Elms, underwriting director, said opportunities in the commercial risks market were particularly attractive. The withdrawal of reinsurance capacity in recent months had lead to a reduction in competition in this sector. Royal Global, the subsidiary which specialises in insuring the risks of multinational companies, has been hampered by its poor security ratings in the past and should benefit from the injection. 'It will enhance their position when they can say they are part of a company with a 50 per cent solvency rating,' added Mr Gamble. Further expansion is also on the cards at The Insurance Service (TIS), the Gloucester-based 'direct' motor insurer. By contrast sales through brokers, which generate two-thirds of Royal's motor business, remained static. Lex, Page 18</p>

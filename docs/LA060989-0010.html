			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING TOO FAR  </P> <P> Israeli authorities held an international press party this week, inviting  foreign journalists to watch as the army blew up a house in the Gaza Strip that  was home to 13 Arabs. This carefully staged event had two openly announced  purposes. One was to punish the family of a 19-year-old Palestinian who is  awaiting trial on charges of throwing gasoline bombs at Israeli troops. The  second was to try to frighten other Arabs into abandoning their support for the  uprising against the Israeli occupation that is now in its 18th month.  </P> <P> Collective punishment of this kind has become a regular occurrence in the  occupied territories. Over the years the Israeli army has demolished or sealed  hundreds of Arab homes in retaliation for real or, just as often, suspected  acts of criminality or political defiance, almost always before any accused  person has been tried or convicted. Such actions, protested repeatedly by the  U.S. and other governments, violate the most elementary standards of Western  justice by ignoring due process and holding an entire group responsible for the  alleged crimes of one of its members.  </P></p>

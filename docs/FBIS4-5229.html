			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's abrupt decision to resign took the business community  by surprise Friday [8 April], drawing words of regret from many  business leaders while raising worries of a political vacuum.    "It's very regrettable because he has set a new current in  politics," said Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita  Electric Industrial Co.    Many executives gave high marks to Hosokawa's political  achievements since he took office eight months ago.    "He set out to relax regulations in order to promote  administrative reform," said Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the  Life Insurance Association of Japan.    "I believe many people are disappointed because there were  high expectations of fiscal and administrative reforms from now  on," said Kenji Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of  Construction Contractors.    But Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corp., criticized  Hosokawa for evading responsibility for bringing the economy  back to health.    "It's not a responsible act to resign now that there is the  need to secure economic recovery," Sekimoto said.    Many business leaders voiced concern about a political  vacuum  that could dampen a budding economic recovery and appealed for  early Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and an early setup  of a new cabinet.    "We hope a new government will be established quickly," said  Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation.    Hosokawa offered to resign earlier in the day to take  responsibility for a Diet stalemate in the wake of allegations  of corruption over his loan from a scandal-ridden parcel  delivery company.    None of the business people commenting on the resignation  called for pursuing the corruption allegations.</p>

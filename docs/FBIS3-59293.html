			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Li-wei (7115 0500 3634): "Futures Storm </F> Sweeps the Mainland"]    [Text] In present-day mainland the term that people are  most envious of and that most makes people's hearts pound and  that is the most fashionable and richest in stimulation is not  "speculating" on owning something, but what is sweeping the  Divine Land like a storm after the stock craze, and the real  estate craze, is that a futures craze has suddenly risen in  China.    The Futures Market Is In Its Ascendancy    To adapt to the rapid development of the mainland's market  economy, [the futures market] is catching up with world trends.  The government at the end of 1992 began to gradually relax its  restrictions on approval of futures companies. Beginning with  Shanghai's metals, coal production, petroleum, and chemical  industry exchange; Nanjing's petroleum exchange; Shenzhen's  nonferrous metal exchange; Zhengzhou's wholesale grain market;  and Hainan's exchange, they opened the first stream of mainland  futures exchanges and advanced them to international standards.  And in the past year, an even larger number of futures companies  have been sprouting up all over. At the end of 1992, the first  large, national futures company -- the Chinese International  Futures Corporation -- came into being in Beijing. At the  beginning of this year, the first state futures broker -- the  Guangdong General Futures Brokerage -- was established in  Guangzhou. On 18 April, the mainland's largest-scale  international futures exchange was opened in Nanjing. The  largest comprehensive futures exchange in the country -- the  Dalian Commodity Exchange -- also opened. In addition, the first  high-level futures markets in west central and south China --  the South China Commodity Futures Exchange and the Chongqing  Capital Goods Exchange --will be starting business soon. The  first settlement firm in the country -- the Extensive Futures  Settlement Firm -- formally went into operation recently. The  Hainan International Futures Exchange with 100 million yuan  invested has broken ground and begun construction. According to  incomplete statistics, not counting the numerous underground  brokerages conducting business without a license, the mainland  presently has more than 360 licensed futures companies. A great  many of these are Chinese-Hong Kong joint ventures, that is,  branch organizations of Hong Kong brokerages in the mainland.  There are presently more than 40 exchanges at various places  throughout the country.    Underground Companies Stir Up Trouble    As regards the content of the business, mainland futures  companies mainly conduct commodity and foreign exchange futures  exchanges. The futures market plays an ever more important part  in the economic life. The transaction price of the first futures  market in the nation -- the Shanghai Metals Exchange -- has  become the standard price or the reference price for metals  exchange throughout the country. After being open less than a  year, its total transactions have reached more than 60 million  tons and the value of its transactions has broken 100 billion  yuan and has elicited at great deal of respect and interest in  the international futures field.    Presently, mainland underground futures brokers are  extremely  active. But current laws and regulations are very unsound. They  lack rudimentary supervision and there are obvious corrupt  practices in the business.    Internal management of underground futures brokers is  extremely chaotic. They only care about collecting commissions.  Futures is still an unfamiliar term to the vast majority of the  people in the country. Even several individual investors who are  "speculating" on futures do not have a deep understanding of the  method. And underground futures companies keep their mouths shut  about the risks. They only play up that "playing" futures can  earn a lot of money. Some even engage in business trickery such  as delaying reporting the price and secretly overcharging.  Because good and bad people are mixed in, there are no rules and  regulations, and their accounts do not receive the accounting  oversight of relevant departments, it is very easy to falsely  report a few figures and mislead investors. Moreover, when there  is a dispute with a customer, the department concerned does not  pursue it, because they have no legal basis.    Private Investors Suffer 90 Percent Losses    A broker pointed out that, with the exception of specialized  investment organizations, private individuals engaging in  commodities and foreign exchange futures exchanges have losses  as high as 90 percent or more. A few customers who are expecting  excessively high earnings have a hard time accepting [the  situation] and public indignation is aroused, which can easily  trigger the outbreak of an incident. Several foreign futures  specialists early on expressed deep concern about this.  Excessive speculation not only can dampen the confidence of  Chinese investors, ultimately it will have an impact on the just  beginning Chinese futures market.    In another respect, the appearance of underground futures  companies affects the business of regular licensed futures  companies. A regular Guangzhou broker established at the end of  last year is presently Guangdong's most standardized company.  But in the last two months, their total number of customers has  fluctuated around 50 and their daily transactions at around 200,  far from the ideal 500. The main reason is that the internal  management of regular companies is rather strict compared to lax  management of "underground" companies, creating several  imperceptible inconveniences for their customers to the point  that the customers do not dare to lightly "patronize."    To Guard Against Losing Control There Must Be  Legislation    Several experts have pointed out that despite the general  reliability and soundness in the initial development of the  mainland futures market, in present-day China, the development  of various types of futures brokers is too fast, too numerous,  and too indiscriminate, and they are facing the danger of losing  control. Moreover, the more than forty futures exchanges are  essentially specialized and the scope of their business is very  narrow and they are limited in the way that their operations  follow international practice. Some have even become forward  contract and wholesale markets. Even the Shanghai Metals  Exchange and the Shenzhen Metals Exchange, in the view of  foreign specialists, are forward merchandise exchanges and are  not strictly futures exchanges.    Presently, many mainland futures brokers settle with foreign  exchange and exchange renminbi for foreign exchange and send it  out of the country. But if they do not have permission, this  amounts to foreign exchange flight. Because the departments  concerned are not in agreement whether futures exchanges are a  form of financial instrument or a business activity, regulations  on futures exchanges are not distinct, not clear, and not  specific. This situation has raised the concern of the state.    Somewhat earlier the State Foreign Exchange Control Bureau  gave approval for the Guangdong Foreign Exchange Subbureau to  grant permits this year to run three or four futures companies,  but they must be strictly checked by the department concerned  and obtain an operating license before they can operate. If they  go into operation on their own without approval, they will be  considered in violation of the law and prosecuted. The first  Guangzhou futures exchange laws and regulations, and the first  in the nation, were formally promulgated a while ago. On 27  April, the State Industry and Commerce Administrative Control  Bureau promulgated the Provisional Control Procedures for  Futures Brokers and from that day the industry and commerce  bureaus of various localities no longer handled futures brokers  registrations, generally they are registered by the State  Industry and Commerce Bureau.    It is understood that the departments concerned are studying  how to improve mainland futures markets and standardize futures  brokering activities. The specialists concerned are appealing to  the government that when they develop the futures market, they  should become familiar as quickly as possible with futures and  establish standard rules and regulations for the operation of  futures markets at an early date and not incite futures fever  too early. They must now establish a centralized futures  oversight and control organization and they can consider  expanding the present National Securities Control Commission to  a National Futures and Securities Control Commission. At the  same time, they must formulate unified national futures exchange  rules and regulations.    bold&gt; Caption    1. p. 57 (top left): A Futures Management and Administration  Person Sent From Hong Kong Lectures Guangzhou Brokers    13619</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Two Weeks with the Queen - Theatre Speaking of the blitz, the film director Jean Renoir observed that it would have been impossible to make a movie like Brief Encounter in Hollywood. What Hollywood needed, he opined, was a few bombs dropped on it. The same ungenerous sentiments occur to me every so often when I see a bland, bright, bumptious assertion of the current Australian self-confidence that by implication patronises, blames or simply discounts the old country. Not that I wish anyone to suffer, least of all the culture that gave Rupert Murdoch and Neighbours to the world, but an awareness of the complexities, subtleties and agonies forming a national identity would not come amiss. These curmudgeonly musings are prompted, doubtless unfairly, by Two Weeks with the Queen, a good-hearted and well-intentioned piece for children at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round, Scarborough. You can tell that Alan Ayckbourn is the director since the nasty characters come more horribly to life than the goodies. Would that he had written the play as well, but it is adapted by Mary Morris from a novel by Morris Gleitzman, ex-pats both, long since settled in the Antipodes. Young Colin is sent to stay with his English relations when his brother Luke is fatally stricken with cancer. His innocent frankness in referring openly to the big C provides a lesson to the evasive adults; and he himself grows up a little after wild schemes to intercede with the Queen and fly the best doctor in the world back to Oz to cure his brother. He befriends a gay couple, one of whom is dying of a newer and deadlier plague; and even manages to breathe some gumption into his pampered hypochondriac cousin, a lumpish wimp with psychosomatic dandruff. The six-strong company plays 28 roles, setting up some sort of speed record for quick costume changes as the action whisks us from Australia to English suburbia via an airliner, not to mention sundry hospitals and Buckingham Palace. Roger Glossop's design centres ingeniously on what look like crates; their lids and sides open like flaps on which are the necessities for scene-changes - toys, books, cushions, plants. The plot's swifter moments (there are at least two in the first half) whizz by with tinkling piano accompaniment and flickering lights as in a silent film. Unfortunately, for an adult audience it all seems protracted and predictable. The play comes to life with the nerdish English uncle and aunt who might have come from an Ayckbourn play, or even Mike Leigh. With their pea-sized imagination, a patriotic pride in 'the biggest hardware centre in Greater London', the cultural identity of a shopping mall, knee-jerk prejudices (anti- monarchists, take note of how the production has its cake and eats it) and terminal mean-mindedness, they seem a pretty good symbol of Britain today. Philip Bird and Sophia Winter must get their teeth into real Ayckbourn roles as soon as possible. But then so should Dorothy Atkinson (specialising in startled nervousness), Peter Forbes (saddled with an improbably nice gay character) and Sean McKenzie, who makes the naff cousin's revolt against his parents almost cheer-worthy. But the show depends on Tamblyn Lord, who created the part of Colin in the Sydney world premiere. Irrepressibly optimistic, touchingly cheerful, exhaustingly (for this spectator at least) boyish, he even manages to silence our puzzlement at Colin's supposed age (anything from eight to 18, to judge by his mixture of the naive and the resourceful). It's enough to make you want to run out and stamp on a koala. At the Stephen Joseph Theatre until Sept 10, then to the National Theatre</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RIGHT TRACK  </P> <P> My husband and I and several friends traveled to New Orleans with Rodney Pick  of Sentimental Rail Journeys. The vintage rail cars are wonderful and  Sentimental Rail Journeys does a great job of taking care of everybody. Food  aboard the train also is excellent and accommodations and tours are the best!  We highly recommend Sentimental Rail Journeys, P.O. Box 4574, Thousand Oaks  91360, (805) 499-9306.  </P> <P> MRS. LYNN FAIRBROTHER  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

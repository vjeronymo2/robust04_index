From cashing peasants' IOU's early in  the year to the unveiling of a series of State Council grain  production and sales polices, from the much publicized effort to  reduce peasants' burdens to the convocation of the Central Rural  Work Conference to the year-end fluctuations in grain and oil  prices -- all of these attracted the attention of the whole  society. It is no exaggeration to say that agricultural and  rural economic development ran through 1993 as "hot spots."  <H5>  Agriculture: High Yield, High Quality, Faster Pace </H5>   Agricultural production reaped bumper harvests again with  the  annual grain output hitting 456.4 billion kg, breaking the  all-time high by 10.2 billion kg. Total output of oil bearing  crops reached 17.61 tonnes, 1.2 million tonnes more than the  previous record. Though the total sown area under grains  decreased slightly, average output per mu rose by eight kg.  Major agriculture and sideline products continued to grow,  except cotton and sugar crops, which dropped in output. Total  output of meat, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products is expected to  rise by more than 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7 percent, and 10  percent respectively on the previous year, assuring the whole  country of a rich supply of food. Most encouragingly,  agricultural production has met market demands, stepped up  efforts in structural adjustment, and taken new steps in the  direction of high yield, high quality, and high efficiency. In  response to falling prices of early crops like long grains due  to a slow market and stockpiles, and rising prices for  under-supplied quality grains, soybeans, and mixed cereals,  localities all stepped up efforts to adjust their crop mix.  Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that national  grain farmland shrank by 26 million mu in 1993, down 5.5 percent  from the previous year. In particular, the area of early long  grains, inferior in rice quality, was cut by over 12 million mu,  down 9.5 percent from the previous year. Soybeans acreage and  other mixed cereals increased by over 34 million mu, up 20  percent. Quality crop acreage extended to some 100 million mu,  accounting for over 30 percent of all rice paddies. Quality  wheat acreage grew by over 3 million mu to some 16 million mu.  Meanwhile, there has been faster development in well-known,  special, quality, new, and rare breeds in the breeding industry.  <H3>  Township and Town Enterprises: Parallel Growth and Strong  Momentum in East, Middle, West Regions; Good Momentum </H3>   Township and town enterprises continued to maintain a strong  growth momentum and parallel growth in economic efficiency.  Total income from realized operations and sales last year is  expected to be 2.6 trillion yuan [figure as published], total  profits and taxes of 255 billion yuan, and total output value of  2.9 trillion yuan, a 40-percent increase on the same period a  year earlier for all three items.    Foreign exchange earnings from exports grew by leaps and  bounds. The total delivered export value was 190 billion yuan,  up 60 percent from the previous year and accounting for about 45  percent of the total value of the country's exported commodities.    Firms continued to expand in scale. There were some 400  township and town enterprises in 1993 whose annual output value  topped 100 million or above, 300 had sales over 100 million yuan  or above, and close to 100 delivered exports of 100 million yuan  or above.    Numbers employed rose considerably. There are about 112  million workers in township and town enterprises, 6 million more  than in the previous year. Over 60 percent of the net increase  in peasants' per-capita net income came from township and town  enterprises, 29 billion yuan was used to support various rural  projects, and 13 billion yuan was provided in agricultural  development funds in a scheme to encourage the subsidization and  development of prefectural agriculture by industry, respectively  up 50 percent and 20 percent on the previous year.    One important characteristic of last year's development in  township and town enterprises was a new situation in the  economically developed eastern region, where scale, standards,  quality, and economic efficiency all rose. In the middle and  western regions, the development pace quickened. Statistics  from the Ministry of Agriculture show that in 1993, rural  surplus labor absorbed by township and town enterprises in the  central and western regions in 1993 accounted for 60 percent of  the new jobs provided by all of the country's township and town  enterprises, the total output value of township and town  enterprises in the central and western regions grew by about 400  billion yuan, about 40 percent of the net growth in national  output and up over 60 percent on the previous year, higher than  the average national growth rate of 10 percentage points.  Meanwhile, total output value, income from operations and  sales, total profits and taxes, and the total number of workers  in township and town enterprises in the central and western  regions all saw a rise on the previous year in their share of  township and town enterprises nationally. This was a remarkable  achievement.  <H5>  Rural Reforms: More Explicit Market Orientation </H5>   The main characteristic of rural reforms last year was an  enhanced role for market mechanisms and a further deepening of  marketization. At present, apart from a few items, such as  cotton and tobacco leaves, operations and prices of all other  agricultural products have been deregulated, chief among which  was basically the national deregulation of grain purchase and  sale prices. Reform in the grain purchase and sale price  system, the main agricultural product of the national economy  and the people's livelihood, had gone through years of  exploration, suffered many reversals, and had come to be seen as  the last bastion of the planned economy and the hardest one to  conquer. The important progress of last year's deregulation of  grain prices, therefore, will undoubtedly provide the peasants'  efforts to tailor production to market demands with greater room  for maneuver.    The cooperative shares system has come a long way in rural  areas. About 10 percent of township and town enterprises around  the country are pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock  system, with a considerable increase in the number of business  conglomerates, there being nearly 100 of them nationally. Areas  and counties experiencing a more extensive range of the share  cooperation system have appeared in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and  Shandong, offering much new experience.    A series of new policies unveiled by the central rural  conference was aimed at deepening reforms, such as extending the  duration of land contracts, permitting paid transfers, and  buying in shares of land contracts, and reforms in the urban  residence status system are playing a role in optimal resource  allocation in rural areas.  <H3>  There Are Still Hidden Problems: We Cannot Afford To Grow  Complacent </H3>   Early in 1993, many worried about agriculture. But by the  end of the year, the situation was such that people were  relieved, which was a hard-won achievement: Leadership over  agriculture and rural work from the central to the local level  was strengthened, a series of policies and measures aimed at  protecting agriculture were unveiled, policies were enforced,  peasants' burden reduced, and practical production problems  solved. The weather helped too: There was basically fine  weather throughout last year, with no major climatic disasters  during key growth periods, which ensured bumper harvests.    There are still hidden problems behind the favorable  developments in agriculture and the rural economy in 1993, and  some deep contradictions gradually emerged. In 1992, peasants'  net per- capita income grew by 5.9 percent, a sign of recovery.  In 1993, the increase in peasants' income, after factoring in  price increases, again slowed to 2 percent from the previous  year, a far cry from the 12 percent per-capita increase in  income for urban residents, which widened the gap between them.  Agriculture, especially grain and cotton production, suffered  from low efficiency, which remained a headache for agriculture  and a main cause of the peasants' slow income growth.    Pressure on employment in rural areas is increasing. There  is a surplus labor force of 100 million in rural areas, to which  another 13 million is added each year, while there are only  limited ways to channel this surplus labor force. Township and  town enterprises are also absorbing this labor force at an  increasingly slower rate.    Methods of regulation and control available to the state are  far from enough, such as insufficient inputs to agriculture,  capital drain, occupation of farmland, and unperfected  macroregulatory control, information, and guidance systems for  the demand and supply of agricultural products.    In 1994, reforms in the economic structure are entering a  stage of attack on all fronts and are taking on key problems,  and the reform and development of agriculture and the rural  economy is facing more complicated external circumstances and  unprecedented opportunities and challenges!    We hope that rural areas will forever remain "hot spots!"</p>

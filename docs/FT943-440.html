			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Calling the bond market bluff The Nobel Prize-winning American economist, Paul Samuelson, once said the stock market was good at predicting economic downturns; so good that it had predicted five out of the last three recessions. His point was, of course, that although financial markets contain useful information, they can often be wrong and should not be followed blindly. It is time to make the same point more loudly in relation to bond markets, financial futures markets and all the other markets which deal at one remove or another with fixed interest rate securities of varying maturity. One sometimes has the impression that the whole of economic policy is a play acted in front of a financial market audience. A Treasury permanent secretary, whom I visited in the pre-Thatcher days of 'unbelieving monetarism', had a pile of reports on his desk from the leading city monetary analysts of the day. The permanent secretary probably did not believe a single word, but he wanted to read them because he feared they influenced the price of sterling. The markets that are now putting the fear of God into central bankers and finance ministers are no longer the foreign exchange markets but the bond markets. The latter are said to be afraid of the resurgence of world inflation, in spite of widespread evidence of an anti-inflationary climate in which intended price and pay increases are difficult to implement. The US is further along the economic cycle and displays more evidence of inflationary tendencies than Europe - let alone Japan where deflation is the main threat. But the Federal Reserve deserves some cheers for making its own decisions on the pace and extent of monetary tightening and for not simply reacting to the bond markets and their spokesmen. How good are the bond markets at predicting inflation? The top chart shows UK inflationary expectations, based on the difference beteen the yields on conventional gilt-edged securities and the yield on indexed bonds. Because the inflationary expectation relates to a 10-year average, caution is required. But if the gilt-edged market is correctly signalling an increase in inflation, it is likely that recorded inflation rates will start to rise before too long. The forecasting record of UK gilts is decidedly mixed. In the late 1980s, inflationary expectations were above actual inflation, but the gilt market forecast gave no warning of an inflationary boom until that boom had almost burst in 1990. Nor did the gilt-edged market anticipate the steepness of the fall in UK inflation in the early 1990s. In earlier years there were no indexed gilts to provide independent evidence of real interest rates. But nominal yields gave little warning of the lax monetary and fiscal policies of the early 1970s, until 20 per cent-plus inflation was almost upon the UK. Once positive real yields reappeared in the 1980s they gave little clue to the inflation cycle but were just erratically following actual events. I could not resist looking for comparison at an indicator that does not claim to peer ahead, but which does provide insight into what is actually happening: namely, some measure of total spending in nominal terms. Reflection suggests that the least bad measure is not nominal gross domestic product, but a variant known as domestic expenditure. This has two principal advantages for policy purposes. First, it excludes net exports (that is exports minus imports) and concentrates on domestic monetary flows that national authorities can influence. Second, an objective for domestic expenditure alone will leave room for an improvement in the balance of payments, without having any specific target for that balance. Some economists regard the mixture of real and inflation variables in a domestic expenditure target as a drawback. But from a policy point of view it is an advantage. For it recognises that official monetary policies can only help provide the conditions for non-inflationary growth. How far a given flow of spending translates into more real output and jobs, and how far it is dissipated in price and pay increases, depends on the actions of economic agents such as businesses and trade unions. The result of plotting domestic expenditure is better than anything that could have been be expected. The third chart, which is a half-yearly moving average, shows that this measure uncannily tracks the course of the 1990 recession, the subsequent recovery and the fact that domestic ex-penditure is still only grow-ing at just over 5 per cent a year. One should avoid a monomanic approach. For instance, the third chart suggests that the UK is on course for a moderate non-inflationary expansion and does not on its own support a base-rate increase. But if it is taken in conjunction with material and commodity prices, industrial capacity surveys and other forward-looking indicators (including bond yields as one indicator among many), there is some justification for the pre-emptive moderate base-rate increase that took place earlier this month. Precisely because the third chart appears too good to be true, the fourth chart plots the cruder year-on-year domestic expenditure increases over two and a half decades. The fit is still reasonable. It shows, for instance, the quickening pace of the boom from 1985 onwards, even though the impact was first borne by the balance of payments and the effect on measured inflat-ion did not appear until 1988-90. Obviously there would be difficulties in practical monitoring. National income statistics are published with a lag and are afterwards revised. But they could be improved if there were sufficient interest; and they can be estimated for recent and current periods where there are still no published figures. Some defeatists nevertheless suppose that governments and central banks have no alternative but to follow financial-market expectations. For instance, forward contracts suggest that the UK base rates will be 7 per cent early next year and will then rise towards 9 per cent. Central banks are not, however, compelled to do what the bond markets appear to be telling them to do. Since the beginning of 1994 world long-term bond yields have risen by 2-3 percentage points. About 1 percentage point represents a rise in real interest rates, perhaps reflecting a world capital shortage - which was prematurely diagnosed two or three years ago. The remainder of the rise in bond yields represents the increased inflation premium. Market opinion here deserves to be taken seriously, but not followed as if it were the word of God. The bond markets may be fighting the last war when they see inflation round every corner. Bondholders and dealers can still be as wrong as economic forecasters or finance ministers. Central bankers can and should be prepared to buck the market so long as they realise that, if they are wrong and the markets are vindicated, there will be a high price to pay in lost public standing. This time round central bankers will not be able to make scapegoats of governments or finance ministers. In the end, either bond rates will come down or short-term interest rates will rise to meet them. If the Bundesbank or Bank of England is convinced that bond markets are wrong and inflation will not on average be much above 2 1/2 per cent a year, then they should act on their beliefs - which means doing as little as possible. If they are not so convinced, they should tighten policy until they are.</p>

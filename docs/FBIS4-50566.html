			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pursue Civil Affairs Satisfactorily, Promote </F> Social Stability and Development"]    [Text] The 10th National Civil Affairs Conference, which  was convened by the State Council, ended today. Party and  government leaders and civil affairs workers gathered together  to discuss plans for reforming and developing civil affairs  work. These discussions will play an active role in reforming,  developing, and promoting social stability. We warmly  congratulate the convocation of the conference.    Civil affairs is a key work area for the party and  government. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  Central Committee, civil affairs departments at all levels,  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and led  by the party and government, have revolved closely around  economic construction and have self- consciously linked civil  affairs work closely with the country's economic development and  social stability, taken the job of ensuring the well-being of  the daily lives of people -- the target of civil affairs work --  as a mission basic to the maintenance of social stability,  upheld reforms, worked in a down-to-earth manner, and played a  key role in creating a stable, unified, democratic, and  harmonious social environment beneficial to socialist  modernization. Reform has injected vitality into civil affairs  work. Reform in disaster relief management and the unfolding of  social old-age insurance in rural areas has promoted the  development of social security in rural areas. Flourishing  community services have brought a new outlook for urban social  welfare services, and the activity of competing for the creation  of "two-support" model towns (counties) has opened a new  dimension in welfare work to provide preferential treatment,  pensions, and home placements. Civil affairs work has scored  various long-term achievements and is vibrant and flourishing.    The Central Committee has stressed that seizing  opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability is the overall  framework for party and government work. Civil affairs work is  a key integral part of government work. We must resolutely obey  and serve this overall framework, fully exercise the functions  of civil affairs departments, and satisfactorily pursue rescue  and relief work, social welfare, the work of providing  preferential treatment, pensions, and home placement, the  construction of grass-roots political power and mass self-rule  organizations, rural social old-age insurance, and social  welfare and social management work, such as that concerning  community bodies, marriages, child adoption, and funerals. The  main responsibility of civil affairs work is to safeguard and  protect, with state-given powers and according to the law, the  people's basic living rights and interests. It represents a  basic demand of socialism and shows the superiority of the  socialist system.    Civil affairs work concerns thousands of households and is  connected with people's lives, intimately related to various  socialist modernization projects, and strongly social in  character. It involves mass participation. Civil affairs work  departments must understand and study new situations emerging  under the socialist market economy system, sum up new  experiences, and solve new problems. Party committees and  governments at all levels must strengthen leadership and put it  high on their agenda. Concerned departments must care about and  support civil affairs work and mobilize forces in various social  sectors in a joint effort at civil affairs work. Its missions  are arduous and responsibility great. We are convinced that  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th CPC  Congress, and led by the party Central Committee and the State  Council, civil affairs work will score greater achievements and  make new contributions toward maintaining social stability and  promoting socialist material and spiritual civilizations.</p>

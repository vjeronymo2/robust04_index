			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement issued by the Albanian Helsinki  Committee states that, with the attack against cultural and  scientific institutions, a new wave of violence has fallen on  the Albanian population of Kosova. Such institutions as the  Academy of Sciences and the Albanological Institute, which enjoy  a high prestige that surpasses Kosova borders and have scored  achievements that have been recognized outside the Albanian  world, are now being threatened directly with closure by the  repressive Serb power.    The statement says that the Albanian Helsinki Committee  considers this a further escalation of the campaign against  human rights and the individual and collective rights of the  Albanian population that is systematically conducted by the  Serbian authorities.    After the closure of Albanian schools, the suspension of  Albanian television and radio programs, and the dismissal of  dozens of thousands of employees on the only basis of being of  Albanian national origin, this is a new measure that enters the  framework of that alreadt known notorious plan, which aims to  uproot the Albanian population, and isolate and segregate it to  make its life unbearable on its ancient territories.    Increasingly, the Serbian regime in Kosova is assuming the  features of an apartheid regime. By losing every feeling of  responsibility, the Serbian authorities are not stopping their  dangerous course that may lead the present crisis in Kosova into  an open conflict in Serbian-Albanian relations and further  terrible consequences for the overall peace in the region.    The statement ends adding that the Albanian Helsinki  Committee regretfully makes this act known to the Vienna-based  International Helsinki Federation and all the Helsinki  committees that act in the name and defense of the great  principles [words indistinct] of cooperation in Europe. The  Committee also calls on them to raise their voice to denounce  the escalation of repression in Kosova.</p>

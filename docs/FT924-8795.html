			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (5): A long, hard slog back to recovery - The economic recession SWEDEN'S economic recession, which began in the autumn of 1990, shows few signs of coming to an end. Indeed, the turbulent events of this autumn have added to widespread predictions that the slump will persist until the mid-1990s - much longer than even the most pessimistic economists believed likely only a few months ago, writes Robert Taylor. The immediate future is not all gloom. Sweden looks set for an export boom on the back of a sharp decline in unit costs, with an expected 9 per cent improvement in competitiveness over the next two years. Industry is forecast to increase its relative competitive position by 18 per cent against Germany, its main export market, in that period. Sweden's exports are set to rise by 3.5 per cent next year and by 6 per cent in 1994, according to the Ministry of Finance. That will ensure a healthy trade surplus of Skr47bn in 1993 and SKr59.6bn in the following year. The country's current account will move out of deficit. In 1991 it was SKr21.3bn and this year it will be SKr19.9bn in the red but by 1994 Sweden will enjoy a small surplus of 4.1 per cent. Wage and price rises are expected to be much lower than those experienced by Sweden's main trade rivals. The 5 per cent cut in employers' social contributions announced as part of the September crisis package, combined with expected low wage rises of only 2.5 per cent on average in both 1993 and 1994, will help to boost industrial productivity by an impressive annual growth rate of 5 per cent over the same period. The consumer price index is expected to increase by 2.1 per cent this year (compared with a crippling 9.4 per cent in 1991), which is lower than that of most western European countries. Prices are set to climb by 4 per cent next year, but this is due to increases in indirect taxation. In 1994 the Ministry of Finance predicts the index to grow by 2.3 per cent. Some comfort might also be drawn from official forecasts (backed up by independent predictions) for savings. The savings ratio - for so long negative in a country that believed it should spend and spend because of high inflation - is expected to be a positive 6.2 per cent this year, 5.8 per cent in 1993 and 6.3 per cent in 1994. Such savings figures have not been seen in Sweden since the middle of the 1960s. But these optimistic economic indicators seem unlikely to comfort most Swedes who face a squeeze on their affluent living standards until at least 1995. This year Sweden is expected to suffer a fall of 1.1 per cent in its gross domestic product after a 1.4 per cent decline in 1991. This will be followed by a further 1.5 per cent drop next year before a modest 0.9 per cent recovery in 1994. Real disposable income is set to plummet by 2.9 per cent next year before staging a modest 0.5 per cent recovery in 1994. Personal consumption will decline by 2.5 per cent this year followed by a 2.5 per cent fall next year and nil growth in 1994. But the Ministry of Finance believes that there is 'a considerable risk that the decline will be even greater'. The most serious sign of continuing slump will be the nosedive in investment, partly because of the intractable crisis in the property market due to plummeting real estate values and the drop in demand for construction. Official predictions for 1993 and 1994 suggest gross investment will drop by 8.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. The Federation of Swedish Industries in its latest prognosis expects a huge 29.1 per cent slump in housing investment next year and a further 17.4 per cent plunge in 1994. The Ministry of Finance believes there will be an improvement in industrial output in 1993 of 1 per cent, followed by a 5 per cent growth in the following year. This follows a 5.3 per cent decline in industrial output last year and a predicted further 2.5 per cent fall this year. These figures could prove over-optimistic. The Federation of Swedish Industries forecasts a 5.4 per cent fall in industrial production this year followed by a further 4 per decline cent in 1993 and even a 1 per cent drop in 1994. The non-Socialist coalition government is committed to a free market strategy designed to reduce the burden of the state on the economy. But the prolonged recession is forcing ministers to scale down expectations and accept they cannot cut taxes and government spending as fast as they would like. The latest forecasts suggest the Swedish public sector is going to remain substantial at least until the middle 1990s. The level of public consumption that totalled SKr383bn in 1991 (out of a total demand of SKr1.809bn) is going to remain constant with a 0.1 per cent increase this year and a rise of 0.2 per cent in 1993 before it falls by 0.5 per cent in 1994. This year government outlays total 69.2 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic product while tax revenues have declined to 50.8 per cent because of the decline in business activities. In 1993 the proportion raised by the public sector in taxes and charges will rise to 51.5 per cent and to 52.1 per cent in 1994. At the same time public expenditure will climb to 71.8 per cent next year and to 72.7 per cent the year after. Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, faces an uphill task in reducing the government's budget deficit. It is not hard to understand the anxiety of Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, and the money markets at what has been happening to government spending over the past 12 months. In this calendar year the budget deficit is predicted to be around SKr110bn, just under 8 per cent of gross domestic product. This contrasts with a SKr70.8bn deficit totalling 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1991. For the 1992-1993 financial year ending next July the budget deficit looks set to be about SKr160bn. The first of the two September cross-party crisis packages aims to abolish the structural part of that deficit over the next two years although the precise size of that figure remains uncertain. The Ministry of Finance expects the public sector deficit to amount to around 10 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic product in both 1993 and 1994, so it is not going to be easy to bring government spending under control. The bleak message this autumn is that the country faces a long, hard slog back to economic recovery. But at least there is a bipartisan consensus on the framework of what needs to be done. All sides hope to adapt Sweden to the rigours of the European Community after 1995. This means a rapid adjustment in laying down the foundations for future growth. It is unfortunate for Sweden that it is having to abandon old ways of economic thinking in the middle of a financial hurricane. The current outlook depends so much on what happens to the international economy outside the control and even the influence of Sweden's policy-makers. In September Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, likened his country to a small boat tossing and turning on high seas. The turbulence may have eased but it remains questionable whether it has really gone away completely. Since the early months of 1989 Sweden has experienced five separate economic crises that have produced large net outflows of foreign capital from the country and necessitated government spending cuts, tax increases and exorbitant interest rates. The country has had to pay a bitter price for its old reputation as a devaluer. Most observers are convinced now that Sweden has gone through too much to resort to manipulation of the exchange rate as a way out of its troubles. But the policymakers will have to keep their nerve when registered unemployment soars over 7 per cent in 1993 and popular pressure increases for a dash for growth as a method of creating jobs quickly. What looks likely to hold them back from abandoning their current strategy is the recognition that such a U-turn would destroy Sweden's determination to be a model EC member in 1995.</p>

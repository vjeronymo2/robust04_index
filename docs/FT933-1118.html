			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Accounts guidelines go beyond Cadbury COMPANIES should provide detailed information on their cash position in interim accounts, say recommendations released yesterday by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The guidelines - a response to the Cadbury committee's recommendations on financial aspects of corporate governance - go further than Cadbury suggestions that companies might consider including some limited cashflow information in interim statements. The institute says companies' half-year figures should contain details such as operating cashflow, and financing and investment payments required in FRS 1, the cashflow statement which is mandatory in year-end figures. The guidelines were produced by a working party of the institute's financial reporting committee on behalf of the Accounting Standards Board. The working party says companies should provide a summarised balance sheet, including details of fixed assets, creditors, provisions and capital and reserves. They should include basic profit and loss account information such as turnover, interest payments, tax and exceptional items as required by FRS 3, the profit and loss accounting standard. It recommends a combination of approaches, treating most figures for the half-year in isolation, but relating some to expected full-year results. It is unclear how the guidelines will be enforced because the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, only deals with annual accounts. It is possible that the Stock Exchange may make amendments incorporating some of the recommendations in its official Yellow Book of listing requirements for quoted companies. The proposals are being circulated for comments by November 22.</p>

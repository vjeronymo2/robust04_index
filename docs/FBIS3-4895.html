			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Communications Minister Phinit Charusombat  has reported on the outcome of his meeting with Japan's deputy  international trade and industry minister in Tokyo yesterday.    The Thai deputy minister informed his Japanese counterpart  of  the latest progress and developments in telecommunications in  Thailand and told him of the government's policy of allowing the  private sector to invest more in the telecommunications field.  As a result, the government has promoted free trade competition  in line with Thailand's commitment to GATT.    Phinit said that Japan and Thailand have cooperated with  each  other in developing telecommunications activities in both the  government and private sectors. Japanese companies have invested  several billion baht in the communications field in Thailand.  Given that Thailand is currently more prepared for foreign  investors, Japan's international trade and industry ministry is  therefore asked to encourage Japanese investors to invest more  in Thailand, especially in the telecommunications field, so that  the telecommunications services in Thailand and Japan will  develop on an equal basis.</p>

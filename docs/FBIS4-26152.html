			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Three men guilty of  robbery and murder in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy in  Zhejiang Province, east China, were executed here today after  the provincial higher court approved the death sentence.    More than 1,200 people gathered at the Hangzhou theater this  morning to hear the judgement announced by the Intermediate  People's Court of Hangzhou. The verdict was read by the  intermediate people's court, saying that Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan  and Yu Aijun on March 31 this year robbed and murdered 24 Taiwan  tourists and eight mainland crew members on a pleasure boat on  Qingdao Lake, a major tourist attraction in Zhejiang Province.    It said that the three men robbed the tourists of large  quantities of their property by threatening them with violence  and then murdered the victims by blowing up the boat and setting  fire to it.    The three men accused of robbery and murder were sentenced  to  death and deprived of political rights for life on June 12.    They did not appeal to a higher court against the sentence  within the legal period. Chinese law grants a three-day period  for appeals.</p>

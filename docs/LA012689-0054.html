			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: SAYING 'NO' TO MORE LIFE INSURANCE  </P> <P> Question: From reading your columns, I realize that people usually come to you  when they have exhausted their patience or avenues of appeal. Perhaps you could  address this issue: Is there any state law or regulation that covers the top  age at which people will be approached to buy more straight-life insurance?  </P> <P> The enclosed correspondence outlines the situation experienced by my neighbor,  C.A., who with his late wife were also good friends of mine. In essence, C.A.  was approached by representatives of Prudential Insurance Co. about his  "insurance needs." C.A. told the two of them that he had no need for more  insurance, but because they persisted, he invited them for a visit.  </P> <P> They kept him for an hour and a half and told him that Prudential was unhappy  with him because they were paying him more in dividends (on three older  policies) than they were receiving in premiums. Finally, he agreed to a new  $10,000 policy because he was assured that "it would cost him nothing." A  medical technician checked out his health, but then he began receiving notices  asking him to pay $638.10 for the new policy. Yearly premiums are $1,250.50  until March 12, 2008, when it will increase to $1,661.30.  </P> <P> C.A. is 76 years old, with no children and has no dependents. And he is  convinced that Prudential is "looting" his three senior policies to pay for the  new $10,000 one. I feel that this smacks more of intimidation than  salesmanship. I am retired from the Social Security Administration, and I am  well aware of seniors being sold multiple insurance policies. Is there no  self-policing within the industry regarding the top age at which companies will  stop attempting to sell life insurance? -- L.B.  </P> <P> Answer: Everyone should be blessed with someone like you as a neighbor --  pursuing this matter with everyone from the California Department of Insurance  to the local office of Prudential to the chief executive officer of the company  in Newark, N.J. You've made more waves than the U.S.S. Lexington hitting open  water.  </P> <P> Indeed, according to David Langenbacher, the Los Angeles-based chief of the  Department of Insurance's underwriting services bureau, the department has  already begun an investigation of C.A.'s case, and Prudential has already been  asked for an explanation.  </P> <P> From a purely practical standpoint, however, there isn't any state law or  regulation that prohibits any insurance company from approaching anyone, of any  age, and selling him or her a product.  </P> <P> And in certain instances, Langenbacher says, there can be a valid reason for  selling a 76-year-old man a new life insurance policy: if there's a large  estate involved, for example, and the need for liquidity in that estate is  advisable.  </P> <P> But, in C.A.'s case, as you point out in a footnote, what we have is a retired  painter with anything but a large estate. And, certainly, with no visible need  for any more life insurance.  </P> <P> In such cases, Langenbacher adds, "we review the case and try to determine if  there is any value to it for the consumer. More often than not, though, nothing  can be proved or disproved because documentation doesn't exist -- there's no  paper trail, and what we end up with is an account of what the company's  representative said and what the consumer said and they're usually  contradictory."  </P> <P> If it therefore comes to hardball, he continues, "our choices are limited. We  can suggest that they see an attorney. But, for a 76-year-old person on a fixed  income, it isn't very practical, and so the insurance company wins by default."  </P> <P> However, it isn't as bleak as it sounds -- especially with a company of  Prudential's size and standing in the industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Someone of Authority  </P> <P> "They've got an awful lot of agents," Langenbacher adds, "and the company  doesn't have a choke-chain on them. So, after we've investigated, we try to  conclude whether a well-informed, intelligent person would have made such a  buying decision. If the answer is 'No,' then we call it into question with  somebody of authority in the company and make every effort to convince them  that, in the interest of fairness, they reconsider.  </P> <P> "Can't we restore this person's position with the company to what it was  before?"  </P> <P> "We take the position that any solution that doesn't leave the policyholder in  as good or better position than he was in before isn't a good solution."  </P> <P> Prudential, through consumer affairs assistant Laurie Webber, concedes that the  company has been contacted by the Department of Insurance and that the "matter  is under review and investigation."  </P> <P> Subsequently, however, Department of Insurance underwriting officer Mike Brison  assured us that the C.A. matter has gone considerably beyond "review and  investigation" and that the affair has been "completely resolved. Prudential  has agreed to a total return of the total premiums paid, either directly to  C.A. or through complete reinstatement of his old policies -- it's as if the  new policy had never been written."  </P> <P> So, all's well that ends well.  </P></p>

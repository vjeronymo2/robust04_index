			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yanbin (3769 6066 1755) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- As summer approaches,  all localities will be busy with three summer jobs -- summer  harvest, summer planting, and summer field management. As  information from various major summer grain and oil-bearing seed  production bases indicates, this year's summer crops are growing  well. Especially since the last 10-day period of April, there  have been several rainfalls which are very beneficial to the  bumper harvest of wheat. Despite damage from drought,  waterlogging, and freezing, the total output of summer  oil-bearing seed crops is expected to be higher than last year.  At present, summer crops are entering the yellow maturity  period from north to south. According to experts from the  Ministry of Agriculture, this is a critical stage for the bumper  harvest of wheat, and it is imperative to pay attention to field  management to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops.    How can we do a good job in promoting short-term  agricultural  production? According to relevant departments of the central  authorities, the following five points are very important:    First, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the  importance of field management during the yellow maturity  period. We should seize the opportunity and use every possible  means to increase the grain number and grain weight so as to  enhance the per unit output and make up for what is affected by  the decreased sown acreage. All localities should take  effective measures according to local conditions. In  particular, they should provide enough irrigation water during  the filling period. This is a critical measure for increasing  the grain weight.    Second, government departments at all levels should  strengthen guidance and service to agricultural production.  Cadres at all levels should go down to grass-roots units and  help peasants solve concrete problems. Departments in charge of  means of production, farming machines, oil, and transportation  should properly arrange the production and shipment of various  means of agricultural production and ensure their supply in a  timely fashion. Agricultural departments at all levels should  organize scientific and technological personnel to go down to  the first line of production and provide technical guidance and  pest prevention service.    Third, it is necessary to always foster an ideology of  fighting against natural disasters to reap bumper harvests.  Efforts should be made to avert peril. According to weather  predictions, in the last 10-day period of May, there will be two  rainfalls and possibly rainstorms, gales, or hail. In addition,  dry winds might come at the end of May. All agricultural  production areas should closely watch the weather changes and do  their best to prepare to prevent various natural disasters.  They should also do a good job in pest prevention. Once the  harvesting begins, all-out efforts should be made to bring the  crops in as soon as possible.    Fourth, good preparation should be made for the purchase of  summer crops. Governments at all levels should take active  measures to ensure enough funds before the purchase season  arrives. Departments at all levels should be responsible for  their work. Efforts should be made to ensure that peasants will  not be given IOU's for crops sold to the government. Financial,  grain, and banking departments should work together, pay  attention to the market situation, and ensure the pooling of  enough funds for the purchase. It is necessary to strengthen  management of the grain and edible oil market, and ensure the  smooth progress of purchase work.    Fifth, while concentrating on the purchase of summer crops,  all localities should lose no time in promoting summer field  management and summer planting. Particular effort should be  made to enlarge sown acreage of summer crops.    Relevant departments of the central authorities held that  the  bumper harvest of summer crops has a direct bearing on this  year's agricultural production. All localities should try every  possible way to achieve a good result in "the summer harvest,  summer planting, and summer field management." They should work  hard in the summer to enjoy a good harvest in autumn. In this  way, they can ensure a year-round bumper harvest.</p>

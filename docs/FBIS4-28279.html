			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that the North  Korean Army is maintaining the highest-level war-readiness  posture [choego sujunui chonjaeng chunbi taeserul yujihago  iddago] ever since 1990. At a Defense Committee meeting of the  National Assembly held today, Minister Yi reported: Since 1989,  the North Korean Army's military exercise was being continuously  reduced but has been restored since the end of last year, and  its ground troops' mobile exercise, joint exercise by the Navy  and the Air Force, and Army- people cooperative anti-air-raid  drill have been conducted very actively since the beginning of  this year.    In particular, Minister Yi said the Ministry of People's  Armed Forces conducted an inspection to evaluate  combat-readiness in mid- April and began to do follow-up  inspections to confirm it in May.    He also reported that North Korea carried out a test fire of  a new-type ground-to-ship missile in May and has begun to make  preparation for test-firing the Taepodong No. 1, 2, and 3 whose  range is more than 1,000 kilometers.    Minister Yi said: In summary, we have reached the conclusion  [pyongga] that the North Korean Army has entered the  highest-level war-readiness posture ever since 1990. As yet,  however, there have been no inclination of specifically  belligerent moves [kuchejogin tugi tonghyang].    In particular, Minister Yi noted that we cannot ignore the  possibility of North Korea's sudden provocation relying on its  military superiority in number [sujoguro usehan kunsaryokman  midgo ubalchoguro tobalhal kanungsongdo paejehalsu optago] as  the difficult situation makes it impossible for North Korea to  maintain nuclear transparency while possessing nuclear weapons.    He continued: Accordingly, our Army has strengthened its  early warning posture and is making every preparation to  immediately pursue strong, punishing, and retaliatory operations  [chukkak kangnyokang ungjing pobok chakchonul pyolchil modun  chunbirul hago idda] against international provocation by the  North Korean Army [kukchejok tobal].</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH, in its editorial today,  comments on President Husni Mubarak's interview with the  Lebanese magazine AL-HAWADITH. Under the headline "The New  Chaotic Order," the paper notes that President Mubarak described  the new international order as a new chaotic order.    The newspaper writes: What we see in today's world is chaos,  not order. What is happening in Russia, the former Eastern  bloc, Iran, Afghanistan, and Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrate the  traits of this new international order. The new order is  characterized by chaos, wars, and genocide perpetrated by the  big powers against downtrodden nations, particularly the Muslim  ones. Muslim people have suffered terribly under the new order.  This is true in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and the Islamic republics that were part of the former Soviet  Union.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (24): From spa visits to communion dresses  -Workers' perks as they do most of the time - they tend to harp about the unbearable burdens of statutory extras such as health and unemployment insurance and taxes. Government policy, they say, actively damages efforts to achieve full employment. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister, smartly whacked the ball back into the employers' court in his recent paper 'Securing the Future of German's Economic Base'. Yes, indeed, he noted, 84 per cent of gross pay in manufacturing industry was accounted for by ancillary costs. This reduced the opportunities for pay policy to be more closely related to productivity. But less than half of these extras were attributable to government: 56 per cent stemmed entirely from deals between employers and unions. Lack of strife and consensus between employers and unions was certainly an important factor in Germany's attractions, he wrote. 'But when companies distribute more than they earn, in the long-term more is put at risk than social peace.' Mr Rexrodt was making a non-too-subtle allusion to a tendency among employers to pay up rather than risk strikes. Over the years basic pay deals have been padded and embellished with a bewildering array of extras and perks. Varying from industry to industry they include holiday bonuses, payments for education, recuperation and having babies. Travel subsidies or free transport to and from work are commonplace. Other benefits include interest-free loans, bonuses for 10, 15 and 20 years' service, heavily subsidised or free canteens and work clothing, paid-for visits to health spas, and even, in the case of some Daimler-Benz workers, contributions to the cost of their children's first communion dresses and suits. Typically, the cash components have been included in the calculations of annual pay increases. So, for example, a union deal on basic pay has usually been applied to the basic rate plus all the extras. It was Robert Bosch, the arch-conservative electrical and electronics giant, which first tested the 'social peace' when, in April, it told its workforce that this year's previously-agreed 3 per cent pay rise would apply only to the basic rate. Non-union workers had their pay cut 3 per cent. Further, it said, it wanted to cut other benefits. Some 10,000 employees were bused into Stuttgart to protest as negotiations started with the workers' council. To no avail. Last month the company announced it had achieved its targeted DM180m savings on 'voluntary' elements of pay. Economies on the basic pay rise arrangement brought total savings to DM250m. That still left the group's ancillary labour costs at around DM700m a year, but progress had been made. At around the same time, the Mercedes-Benz management announced savings through similar cuts in 'traditional' extras worth some DM200m a year. Elsewhere, negotiations grind painfully on, and there is no shortage of frustration on both sides. The head of one big engineering group, for example, where paint shop employees have long enjoyed the right to a free annual holiday in the mountain air, shakes his head. Under modern health and safety regulations, paint shops are among the healthiest places in a factory. 'We've had it checked,' he says. 'For goodness' sake, the air in there is cleaner than in my office.'</p>

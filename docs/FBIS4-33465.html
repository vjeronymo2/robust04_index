			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, 4 Jun (NA) -- Local  Metalworkers Union (UOM) workers today accepted the agreement  reached in the federal capital between UOM representatives and  business by which the 18-day conflict was settled.    At the end of the workers assembly just before noon, an act  on the decision made in the assembly was signed by the local UOM  secretary general, Marcelo Sosa; Pedro Waisman, head of the  Tierra del Fuego Industrial Union; and a Labor Ministry  representative.    The act was signed during a meeting held by representatives  of all the parties involved, in the this capital's Albatros  Hotel.    During the assembly in this city's Augusto Lacerre Sports  Center, which was headed by Marcelo Sosa in the presence of  about 500 union members, the workers accepted all the points of  the agreement announced in Buenos Aires on 3 June.    It was learned, however, that about 30 percent of the union  members disagreed with the agreement establishing a gradual  increase of 300 percent in one year -- which triples the basic  salary of the national agreement in the household goods metal  sector -- on a variable scale starting at 120 percent and  increasing 20 percent per month, reaching 310 percent in one  year. [figures as received]    The agreement's approval by the majority of the metalworkers  put an end to 18 days of conflict including picket lines and  threats of repression by Tierra del Fuego police.    At the assembly's end, Sosa said that "the workers decided  to  obey the agreement" reached in Buenos Aires on 3 June. Sosa  accused businessmen by saying "we ran into an intransigent  position by businessmen."    Sosa confirmed, however, that a new round of negotiations  between workers and businessmen for the payment of the days not  worked [salarios caidos] will begin in this city on 6 June, and  that the talks will be held with each company.    The businessmen agreed to rehire the 127 workers dismissed  from the Continental factory and the 63 dismissed from the Crown  Mustang plant, which is located in Rio Grande, about 200 km from  this capital.    The only unresolved point is the 15 days not worked, but it  was learned here that an agreement probably will be reached to  pay the days not worked during the conflict, but businessmen  would demand that the workers compensate for the days not  worked.

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Italian unions win Amato concession on pensions cap ITALY'S trade unions, which staged a four-hour general strike over welfare cuts on Tuesday, have won limited concessions from the Amato government. The government agreed to a slight lifting of the ceiling on pensions proposed for next year and said pension payments would rise a total of 3.5 per cent next year in two tranches. To compensate, the government introduced measures to cover the extra expenditure. In a second concession, the government replaced the proposed ceiling of L40m (Pounds 18,000) annual income which would trigger a cut-off in health service benefits. This would have excluded 20m people, according to the unions. A formula has been introduced lowering the ceiling to L35m for single people but raising it to L65m for large families. The semi-indexation of pensions, at just over 1 percentage point below inflation, will cost an extra L3,600bn. However, the government insisted the overall target of holding the public sector deficit to L93,000bn remained in place. Extra revenue of L1,500bn would be raised by two main devices: a 1 per cent increase in national insurance contributions from those with incomes over L52m; and L800bn by making ENEL, the electricity authority, cover itself the cost of servicing debts contracted during 1986-89. The government yesterday converted into a decree law the bill ending the dockers' monopoly in Italy's ports, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The European Commission had set a September 30 deadline for ending the monopoly and the decision, though it will be welcomed by port employers, may trigger fresh industrial action. Prosecutors are examining government files on Italy's aid operation for Albania after members of parliament alleged some food suppliers had been overcharging, Reuter adds from Rome. Italy donated 125,000 tonnes of food to help Albania through the winter of 1991 after an exodus across the Adriatic of 45,000 refugees fleeing hunger and poverty the previous March and August.</p>

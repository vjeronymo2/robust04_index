			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Fee of Dollars 4,000 an hour 'not unreasonable' - Legal Briefs Who said Britain's top commercial lawyers were the most expensive in the world by charging an average of Dollars 585 an hour? The Delaware Chancery Court has just approved a New York lawyer's fee in a 1991 shareholder action which amounts to more than Dollars 4,000 an hour. According to America's National Law Journal, the judge who approved Mr Arthur Abbey's Dollars 8.5m contingency fee, Vice-Chancellor Carolyn Berger, said Mr Abbey should not be penalised for achieving an easy victory. The judge said the fee, which amounted to just over 16 per cent of the sum recovered for the shareholders, was 'generous but not unreasonable'. The decision appears to run counter to a 1980 ruling by the Delaware Supreme Court, which said a fee amounting to Dollars 437 an hour was the highest it could approve.</p>

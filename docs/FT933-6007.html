			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (5): On the road to development - Pahang and Terengganu THE mountain range that runs from north to south in peninsular Malaysia serves more effectively than any border in carving out separate nations of the east and west, writes Jenny Luesby. Peninsular Malaysia's largest state of Pahang is only 40km from Kuala Lumpur at its western border, but in terms of development the distance is far greater. Where much of the west coast is heavily industrialised, the east remains an agricultural economy where timber and rubber are supporting the first tentative moves into resource-based industry. The development of oilfields off the east coast at Kemaman, in the coastal state of Terengganu, has given the region a leg-up, and its natural beauty has brought in the tourists, but its growth remains in its infancy. The official line is candid: 'Ten years ago, Terengganu had virtually nothing to offer,' says Mamat Ghazalee bin abd Rahman, chairman of the state committee for petroleum, industry and human resources. But, things have changed, he says, with the arrival of oil and gas. And they have. The state has built a port, upgraded its roads, expanded power and water supplies, improved communications and set up the obligatory crop of industrial estates. The oil revenue has also brought ornate local government, police and state assembly buildings, heavy with marble. Mining and quarrying, which includes the oil industry, accounted for 63.8 per cent of Terengganu's Gross Domestic Product in 1990. Manufacturing remains thin on the ground. So too does employment. 'We have had many inquiries,' says Haji Mohd Zaki bin Haji Yusoff, director of the Terengganu development corporation, 'but people generally locate elsewhere.' In neighbouring Pahang, more than 40 per cent of investments up until December 1991 fell within the public sector, highlighting further the investors' shyness. The less educated population on the eastern side of the peninsula and the limits on its infrastructure may have deterred some, but the states of Pahang and Terengganu probably have a point when they suggest that people do not come because they do not know what is there. Both Pahang and Terengganu have abundant supplies of power. They also have products such as polyethylene, for producing plastics, which have come with the petrochemicals industry. The states seem to have the potential for developing a sound industrial base. 'We see Vietnam and China as competitors really,' says Haji Mohd Zaki. But facing them across the South China Sea, the region may find its location an added advantage. Serviced to western standards in every area from legal and accounting services through to cargo facilities, the east coast offers a haven of order next door to what could be the world's fastest growing markets in years to come. The east coast's facilities include two new ports, a deep-water natural harbour at Kemaman, capable of taking vessels up to 120,000 dwt, and a small and efficient operation at Pahang's state capital, Kuantan. These could be used as transshipment centres. And while the official downgrading of Kuantan airport from international status has brought irritation in Pahang, and a degree of inconvenience as air cargo heads to Kuala Lumpur, the decision could be reversed if air traffic picks up. In the meantime, local ambitions are subdued. There is the occasional mention of electronics and high-technology, but conviction is absent. The area's real thrust for development is through industry rooted in the region's ample resources. Agriculture is expected to account for nearly 40 per cent of GDP in Pahang in 1993, and more than 40 per cent of employment. Oil palm, rubber and timber made up its bulk, with oil palm alone accounting for an estimated 20 per cent of the state's GDP. Both Pahang and Terengganu also offer an enviable range of minerals, which as well as tin, include mercury, silica, tungsten and graphite. 'We do not want loggers, we want chipboard, and even furniture manufacturers,' says a local official. Unlike the west coast, the region is also interested in heavy and labour-intensive industry. But, for now, the region's manufacturing is small - in 1992, manufacturing accounted for 14 per cent of GDP in Pahang. In the somewhat information shy state of Terengganu the most recent figures available are for 1990, when manufacturing accounted for just 8.2 per cent of GDP. Tourism has been the states' true testing ground. Tourist arrivals in Pahang rose by 77 per cent between 1986 and 1991, to reach 1,712,647. The length of stay also increased, and hotel occupancy rates improved from an average 50 per cent to 80 per cent. In this context, the states, both predominately Moslem, are at pains to emphasise their religious tolerance. The balance is a delicate one, especially with the recent switch to a more fundamentalist government - opposed to the federal authorities - in the state of Kelantan, north of Terengganu. But the fact that nearly half of Pahang's tourist spending is in the rural Genting highlands, notable for the fact that it houses the one and only gaming casino in Malaysia, would tend to bear out the assertion that tolerance is high: gambling is contrary to Islamic teachings. The rural casino is not the region's most off-beat venture. There is also an eel farm set up by a Taiwanese investor, which boasts of being the largest in the world. Odder still is the imminent arrival of the kit from the recently closed Ravenscraig steel plant from Scotland.</p>

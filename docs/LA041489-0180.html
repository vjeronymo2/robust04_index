			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILKEN POSTS $1 MILLION, SETS ASIDE $600 MILLION  </P> <P> Michael Milken agreed today to set aside more than $600 million in assets and  post a $1-million bond in connection with wide-ranging racketeering and fraud  charges against the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier.  </P> <P> Saying Milken was not a threat to flee the country before an expected trial,  U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood denied the government's request that Milken  post $250 million in bail money.  </P> <P> In addition, Milken's brother, Lowell, who also faces fraud and racketeering  charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets under racketeering statutes  and was ordered to post a $1-million bond secured by other assets.  </P> <P> The ruling means the Milkens -- who left the courthouse to applause from about  100 supporters -- will be free pending a trial prosecutors say is expected to  last more than six months and should mark a high point in the government's  nearly three-year crackdown on Wall Street fraud.  </P> <P> The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg were charged in a  98-count racketeering and fraud indictment handed up March 29 that seeks about  $1.8 billion in forfeitures.  </P> <P> Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, the  government could have sought to freeze all of the defendants' assets before a  trial as a guarantee they would not sell or otherwise dispose of them to avoid  massive penalties if convicted.  </P> <P> The agreement announced at a Manhattan federal court hearing requires Michael  Milken to place $300 million cash in an account to be monitored by the  government and to sign a note securing $300 million more in less liquid assets.  </P> <P> Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings in Drexel --  which total 6% of the investment firm and are estimated at about $100 million  -- as soon as the firm's settlement of separate civil charges with the  Securities and Exchange Commission officially takes effect.  </P> <P> That deal, announced Thursday, resolves a range of separate civil charges  against Drexel and requires the Wall Street giant to dismiss Milken, sever all  business dealings with him and force him to give up his Drexel holdings.  </P> <P> "In substance, your honor, we expect the security for forfeiture in this case  will amount to $700 million," Assistant U.S. Atty. John K. Carroll said.  </P> <P> Flanked by a group of defense lawyers, Milken and his brother attended the  hearing but did not address the judge.  </P> <P> "The defendants not only contest the indictment but they seriously, expressly  contest the government's theories on forfeiture," said Arthur L. Liman, Michael  Milken's attorney.  </P></p>

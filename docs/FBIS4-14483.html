			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Yuriy Kukanov under "Crime" rubric: </F> "`Black-Market Business With a Foreign Accent"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- Acting jointly with Finnish  police officers, a Petersburg special service has neutralized a  gang consisting of Russian and Finnish citizens. It had  committed a string of serious crimes, including a murder on  Finnish territory.    In the last year or two reports of this kind have been  filling the pages of criminal summaries more and more often.  The criminal world is closely monitoring foreign capital's  penetration of Russia's northwest border region. There are  currently 7,285 joint enterprises registered in St. Petersburg  and Leningrad Oblast. Foreign investment totals 7.5 billion  rubles. According to information from Sergey Sidorenko, chief  of the Regional Organized Crime Administration, around 20  percent of foreign business on St. Petersburg's territory is  controlled by local criminal structures. Last year 1,576 foreign  citizens -- tourists, businessmen from joint enterprises,  diplomatic mission staffers, and students -- fell victim to  criminal transgressions.    A special militia service has been formed in the St.  Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs Main Administration in  order to ensure foreign subjects' personal security and the  security of their property. Vladimir Karpankov, this subunit's  chief, reported that it is responsible for protecting 494  facilities at which foreign citizens work. Five protection  enterprises and four security services have been set up jointly  with German, British, U.S., Belgian, Finnish, and Swedish  criminal experts. The special service staffers admit themselves  that foreign businessmen are reluctant to cooperate with local  law-enforcement organs, preferring to come to an agreement with  criminal groupings. There is information that some Finnish  firms, for example, are paying racketeers up to 100,000 markkas  per month.    An increasing number of cases is coming to light where  foreign businessmen, on coming into contact with the criminal  world, are being actively involved in breaking Russian law.  Thus, St. Petersburg criminal experts have halted the activity  of the "LST-Metall" Russian-Finnish joint enterprise, which  specialized in the duty-free export of aluminum abroad.    Incidentally, the special services note that it is the  foreign party which most often suffers when Russian laws are  broken. The St. Petersburg Administration for Combating  Organized Crime has detected the theft of 2.6 million bottles of  liquor belonging to the Spanish firm "Codimport International."  During the investigation it was ascertained that, in order to  avoid paying taxes and to obtain maximum profit, an entire  consignment of liquor was not registered at the firm's Moscow  branch but handed over for resale to Russian "businessmen," who  swindled their Spanish partners.</p>

Yi, exchanging New Year's greetings with Stephen Cardinal  Kim  Su- hwan at Myongdong Cathedral, said Monday [17 January] he  will propose an inter-Korean summit and a tripartite meeting of  Pyongyang, Washington and Seoul if he meets with North Korean  President Kim Il-song.    Frequent inter-Korean exchanges, including cultural  exchanges  and economic cooperation, will help resolve inter-Korean  problems and achieve national reunification, he told the Roman  Catholic primate of South Korea.    "My reason for visiting North Korea is that we remain in the  cold-war framework of reasoning, though we are living in the  post- cold war era," Yi said.    "The political approach to the reunification issue so far  should now be shifted to an economic approach, and I believe the  opposition party has a role to play in creating an environment  for such a shift and in arranging inter-Korean talks for  solution of the nuclear issue."    The cardinal said visiting North Korea is not always as  simple as Yi made out because North Korea may try to make use of  such a visit for its own political objectives.</p>

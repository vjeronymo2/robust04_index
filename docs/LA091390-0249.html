			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> COURT OVERTURNS EMBRYO RULING  </P> <P> The Tennessee Court of Appeals today granted joint custody of seven frozen  embryos to a divorced couple, overturning a landmark ruling that had granted  custody to the ex-wife.  </P> <P> The intermediate-level appeals court ruled in the divorce case of Junior Lewis  Davis of Maryville and his former wife, Mary Sue Davis Stowe, now of  Titusville, Fla.  </P> <P> "It would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional principals to order Mary  Sue to implant these fertilized ova against her will," Judge Herschel P. Franks  wrote for the three-member court.  </P> <P> "It would be equally repugnant to order Junior to bear the psychological, if  not the legal, consequences of paternity against his will."  </P> <P> The court ruled that both Stowe and Davis should "share an interest in the  seven fertilized ova" and should have joint control and an equal voice over  their disposition.  </P></p>

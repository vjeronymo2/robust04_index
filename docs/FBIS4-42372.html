			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MTH/ALB/GGD: "Troika: Algerian </F> Government's Sincere Will To Initiate Reforms"]    [Text] Algiers, 30 May (BELGA) -- "We are coming back to  Belgium with the firm belief that the Algerian Government is  determined to reinforce the national political dialogue and to  proceed with its economic reform program," Belgian Foreign  Minister Claes said in Algiers on Monday [30 May], after a round  of talks between the European Troika (past, present, and future  presidents of the European Union [EU]) and the Algerian  authorities. "The meeting was an instructive and a constructive  one," Mr. Claes added.    The Troika (which also includes the head of the Belgian  Foreign Ministry, the Greek and German state secretaries for  foreign affairs, Messrs. Kaltrut and Papandreou, respectively,  and European Commissioner for External Relations Hans van den  Broek) is to report on the political, economic, and social  situation of Algeria before the Twelve in the context of  European financial support for that country's economic recovery.  The EU wants to contribute to the political stability of that  country, which has endured Islamic violence.    At a press conference, Mr. Papandreou welcomed the Algerian  Government's sincere will to take up the political and economic  challenge. "This sincere will is the basis of a successful  cooperation between the EU and the Algerian Government," he  added.    The EU representatives who met with the Algerian Prime  Minister Mr. Mokvad Sifi, Foreign Ministry head Salah Bendri,  and President Lianine Zerouan had a message of support for the  ongoing reforms in Algeria. "We want you to know that Europe is  on your side and supports your reforms," Mr. Papandreou said.  He also firmly condemned violence and terrorism and called for  the respect of human rights.    Besides the political message, the Twelve have recently  earmarked ECU150 million for Algeria (as the second part of a  larger credit of ECU400 million aimed at sustaining the Algerian  balance of payments) and should soon grant another ECU200  million which has already been approved in principle by the EU  finance ministers.    A group of European experts is expected in Algiers next  month  to examine the terms and conditions for implementing the  economic recovery program. Algeria also wants to conclude a  partnership agreement with the EU, similar to that between the  Twelve and Morocco and Tunisia. The Algerian foreign minister  hopes that this will lead to the creation of a free-trade zone.    "We are anxiously waiting for a decisive step to be made in  favor of Algeria at the Corfu Summit," he added.    Mr. Bendri said that Algeria had "turned its back on those  who have hindered its development so far" and that it was  heading for a democratic, pluralistic society which is open to  democracy and solidarity. He expressed the desire that "all  political and social forces that reject terrorism should adhere  to the principle of a pluralistic society that respects human  rights and take part in the national dialogue to prepare the  future together."    Furthermore, the Algerian minister invited the international  human rights organizations to come to see for themselves how the  Algerian authorities are ensuring their implementation.</p>

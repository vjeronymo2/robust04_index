			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US steel's dumping complaints sound familiar - It will be hard to prove injury to the domestic industry when production is rising FOREIGN steel manufacturers could be excused a sense of deja vu with the filing in the US last month of a formidable array of trade cases alleging that they have been dumping subsidised steel products in the US market. The same tactic was used or threatened in 1977, 1982, 1984 and 1989, and in the end foreign competitors agreed to provide protection for US steel producers through 'voluntary' quotas. This time around 12 steel producers - including the six largest in the country - have filed 84 cases against companies in 21 countries. But because many mills have withdrawn from other production, the complaints target only flat-rolled carbon steel, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of all steel shipments (sales) in the US. The tenor of the complaints is familiar. Worldwide overcapacity and a softening steel market has made it attractive for producers to 'routinely and systematically' dump in the US market 'far below fair market value and often below the cost of production'. This along with 'massive foreign subsidies' helped the US industry to a Dollars 2.2bn loss last year. While foreign governments have been aiding their industries to restructure, US steel has had to do it alone. In just 10 years it has slashed employment by 58 per cent - 225,000 jobs. The last decade has brought other changes which make questionable any assumption that the trade complaints will bring the industry the beneficial results they have in the past. Although the US economy is weak, it is in better shape than in 1982. Interest rates are low; inflation is under control. After 7 1/2 years of the 'voluntary quotas', the industry - aided by the weak dollar - has become an exporter. Lawyers representing foreign clients are much more confident that this year they will not be drowned in the tidal wave of complaints. They say it will be difficult to prove that the US industry has been injured by imports when American exports have risen steadily since the mid-eighties. Meanwhile, according to Eurofer, the EC steel industry organisation, US imports have dropped from 26m tonnes in 1984 to an annual 17m tonnes. During the last three years, the EC exported no more than 70 per cent of its quota share. The 'heart' of the American 'problem', Eurofer claims, is low prices, driven by domestic competition and indirect subsidies, such as tax breaks. Mr Pierre F. de Ravel d'Esclapon, who represents France's Usinor-Sacilor, says the US International Trade Commission (ITC), the body which determines injury, has become 'much more professional, more lawyerly and judicial'. By often overruling the ITC, the district courts and the Court of International Trade have forced the commission to pay close attention to the evidence that is in the record. Meanwhile, the commerce department - which determines the existence of subsidies or dumping - has also been disciplined by the courts. In 1982, it was 'a babe in the woods' playing politics, said Mr de Ravel. Its proceedings are more court-like and its rulings more consistent and less 'arbitrary and capricious'. Although it costs the US industry between Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 1m to bring a trade complaint, the investment has in the past always paid off in higher prices and, ultimately, protection. This time, however, it is taking more of a gamble. It has faced an outpouring of indignation from its closest trading partners  -many of which, such as Japan and Korea, provided much of the Dollars 23bn for the US industry's new investment over the past several years. American steel exports must now face 27 countries with their own dumping laws. Canada filed four cases immediately after the US action; Mexico had two already under way. (Trade lawyers say that, because of its weak currency and industry losses, the US is particularly susceptible to charges of dumping and that the industry could be found guilty of receiving indirect subsidies.) President George Bush has virtually sworn that no more protection will be forthcoming. He might be vulnerable to election-year pressure, but this time, before agreeing to voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs), the defendants are more likely to see the entire complaint process to the end. That will not come until after the November election. US steel prices, in real terms, are lower now than a decade ago, according to Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel, who yesterday told the US International Trade Commission (ITC) yesterday that 'pernicious' trade practices have been injuring the US industry, Matt Kaminski writes from Washington. 'The agony of the American steel industry has become part of the national folk lore,' said Mr Alan Wolff, an industry lawyer. The ITC was weighing testimony from US and foreign steel manufacturers for its preliminary ruling on injury, due next month. Although US exports have been rising, they face closed markets in the EC and eastern Europe, American steel officials said.</p>

Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC  Committee, held discussions with some of the representatives to  the meeting prior to the conclusion of the meeting.    The forum was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy  secretary of the provincial CPC committee. Following the  briefings presented by representatives from Sixian County,  Fuyang Prefecture, and Wuhu city on current political and legal  work, Lu Rongjing delivered a speech in which he emphasized the  need for various levels of party committees to enhance in a  down-to-earth manner political and legal work in the new  situation.    Lu Rongjing said it is necessary to seriously study  political  and legal work, which are confronted by new conditions and new  issues in the new situation, and to pay attention to exploring a  pattern for political and legal work. Increasing economic  activities and an increasing flow of people have created  opportunities for criminal elements whose sole purpose is to rip  people off. Touching on the policy of "promoting the reform and  opening drive with one hand and cracking down on severe crimes  with the other," Lu Rongjing noted that some localities and some  comrades have still been unable to properly put theory into  practice; they have failed to crack down really hard on  criminals. Some localities are weak in grass-roots work and  fail to do a good job in the comprehensive management of social  order, which create loopholes in social order work. Problems in  the readjusted relationship between interests brought about by  reform and increases in the number of ideological and  work-related problems could produce new contradictions if they  are not properly dealt with. Generally speaking, the quality of  the contingent of political and legal workers is good. But in  ideology, in work, and in work style, there still are areas  which have not adapted to the needs of the times. All levels of  party committees and political and legal departments must remain  sober-minded. To be sure, they should be aware of the excellent  situation in the current efforts to deepen reform and to  accelerate development, but they should also make full  preparations to cope with factors of instability, to formulate  good countermeasures in advance according to changes in the  situation, to maintain political stability using all possible  means, and to help to ensure the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and modernization construction.    Lu Rongjing said that to strengthen the political and legal  work in the new situation, it is necessary to persist in the  policy of a "two-handed approach" and to use Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to unify our thinking and to guide our actions.  We need to get really serious about the "two-handed approach."  We should, on the one hand, stress the building of material  civilization, and on the other hand, we should emphasize the  building of spiritual civilization. While persisting in the  policy of a "severe crackdown," we should step up efforts to  enhance the comprehensive management of social order; namely, we  should deal with the root cause and symptoms of crime at the  same time. While making efforts to improve the greater social  environment, we should strive for personal improvement. It is  necessary to stress grass-roots work. The macro- and  micro-level relationship should be handled correctly. It is  also necessary to stress building a legal system on the one hand  and to emphasize building up organizations on the other.    Lu Rongjing used the two Chinese characters "jia qiang"  [enhancement] to emphasize the need for the party committee to  strengthen leadership over political and legal work. He urged  all levels of party committees to do a good in the following  areas: first, enhance leadership of political and legal cadres  in their theoretical study, and use theory to arm them and help  them increase their understanding of the importance of political  and legal work. Second, enhance investigation and study; analyze  the state of political and legal work in localities; formulate  problem-solving measures; and improve work. Third, devote more  efforts to political and legal work and adopt a comprehensive  view on political and legal work. Fourth, show concern for  cadres involved in political and legal work; support them  ideologically; give them support in work; help them to solve  practical difficulties in daily life; and help political and  legal departments solve difficulties encountered in enforcing  the law. Fifth, improve the management and education of  political and legal cadres and constantly raise the overall  quality of those involved in political and legal work. It is  necessary to seriously treat and deal with problems that exist  among those who are involved in political and legal work. We  must be resolute in removing a small minority of people who are  not adapted to the work of political and legal departments.    When coming to the issue of giving full play to the  functions  and roles of political and legal departments, Lu Rongjing  pointed out that the political and legal committee is entrusted  by the party committee with taking charge of political and legal  work. In addition to fulfilling the primary task of  implementing the party's principles and policy on political and  legal work, the other tasks of the political and legal committee  include doing a good job of organization and coordination in the  day-to-day work of the political and legal system as stipulated  by the law; supervising and checking matters related to law  enforcement according to the law; carrying out massive amounts  of investigative and study work; and helping party committees to  manage cadres working in the political and legal departments.  At present, priority should be given to doing a good job in  building up the contingent of political and legal workers and in  building up grass-roots organizations. It is also of great  importance to stress the building up of leading bodies at  various levels of political and legal departments.    Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee  and Anhui governor, who is now inspecting work outside the  province, sent a written message to the forum. He called on all  levels of party committees and governments to voluntarily put  political and legal work at the top of the agenda, to help  safeguard social stability, and to maintain by every possible  means the current excellent momentum of development in our  province. Fu Xishou stressed the need for all levels of  government to attach importance to helping political and legal  departments solve funding difficulties.</p>

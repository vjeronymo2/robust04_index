			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Government has demanded that the Japanese  Government set up a Investment-Promotion Agency [IPA] designed  to facilitate foreign firms' direct investment in Japan. It has  asked Japan to set up an agency which specializes in carrying  out intermediary work on foreign investment in Japan and in  providing foreign companies with information on loans by the  Japan Development Bank [JDB] and other banks. It has also  demanded that Japan promote the deregulation of investment with  a new agency playing a leading role.    The establishment of the new government agency is one of the  U.S. demands in connection with the Japanese-U.S. economic  framework talks. The U.S. Government has maintained that in  order to increase direct investment in Japan, the Japanese  Government needs to find foreign firms which are enthusiastic  about doing business in Japan, as well as to provide information  on JDB loans and favorable treatment in terms of taxation. It  has demanded that the Japanese Government set up a general  agency designed to provide such services and to formulate new  programs for promoting investment.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Government has rejected the U.S.  demand, saying: "The establishment of the new government agency  runs counter to the current move to promote administrative  reform." It has claimed that the United States should set up a  contact office for promoting investment in Japan.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MIGRANTS TO GET AID FROM RED CROSS  </P> <P> One day after a North County minister criticized the Red Cross for doing too  little to assist residents of a migrant camp burned out by last week's Black  Mountain brush fire, the agency offered new assistance and said it is  re-evaluating its performance during the blaze.  </P> <P> The Rev. Rafael Martinez, executive director of the North County Chaplaincy,  also learned Thursday that the San Diego Housing Commission has set aside  $10,000 to help the laborers.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the minister charged that the Red Cross had refused to assist  hundreds of migrant laborers of the Los Diablos migrant camp, many of whom had  lost all their possessions in the blaze.  </P> <P> A Red Cross spokesman said the group did not offer the workers the customary  emergency services because there was no way to verify if the laborers indeed  lived in the canyons blackened by the fire. On Thursday, the nonprofit agency  changed its mind about helping the laborers.  </P> <P> "We called Rev. Martinez this morning to find out exactly what his needs are  and how they fall under the services we provide," said Tom Custer, a Red Cross  spokesman.  </P> <P> "We've been criticized for our role in assisting the migrant workers during the  recent blaze. After every disaster, we review our performance to see how we can  improve. And that will happen again after this fire."  </P> <P> The blaze burned 4,500 acres in the Black Mountain area near North City West.  Officials have estimated that, before the fire, 400 to 600 people lived in the  sprawling camp in makeshift hooches of wood and cardboard.  </P> <P> However, Joann Johnson, chief administrative aide for Deputy Mayor Abbe  Wolfsheimer, said her office had requested emergency funds from the housing  commission immediately after learning of the fire.  </P> <P> "We asked for the money because we saw that there were 500 to 600 people  standing on a hillside who didn't have anything left," she said. "So we went  looking for emergency funds for blankets and food, things like that."  </P> <P> Mary Jo Riley, a spokeswoman for the city's housing commission, said a check  for $10,000 was sent Wednesday to Catholic Charities, which will disburse the  funds to several groups -- including the North County Chaplaincy -- that are  trying to help the migrant workers. Catholic Charities also will be responsible  for accounting for the money.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Control of Angola beyond Savimbi's grasp: But both sides may have reason not to sign a peace accord now The refugees now occupying Luanda's ruined Hotel Turismo can stand on its rocket-shattered upper floors and view the nearby headquarters of Sonangol, Angola's state oil company and the government's main financial support against the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). The Turismo used to house senior Unita rebel officers following a May 1991 peace agreement with the ruling MPLA government. But its shattered walls now testify to the collapse of that peace. Unita's leader, Mr Jonas Savimbi, who rejected defeat in UN-sponsored elections in late 1992, led his followers back to war, leaving many of his officials stationed at the Turismo to die in the ensuing MPLA onslaught. More than nine months of peace talks in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, have since aimed at ending Africa's longest-running war, which started soon after Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. For more than six months, UN mediator Alioune Blondin Beye has been saying the two sides are close to a deal. Yet some observers in Luanda dismiss the talks as nothing more than a show aimed at heading off tightened UN sanctions and at obscuring events on the battlefield. Both sides may have reason not to sign an accord now. Government generals, advancing on the ground, could win back more land, while Unita's demands to control the governorship of Huambo, their capital, have not been met. The government's capture last month of key diamond areas around the north-eastern town of Cafunfo dealt a powerful blow to the rebels, who use diamonds to buy weapons. Last year some Dollars 250m (Pounds 166m) worth of diamonds came out of Angola, mostly from the Cafunfo area. The loss will not cut off all of Mr Savimbi's funds. The diamond fields are huge and lawless; they swarm with small-time but well-armed diggers, many of whom will remain loyal to the Unita cause. But the defeats around Cafunfo, the loss of the northern provincial capital of Ndalatando in early May, and other government victories underline the rebels' weakness. The government thrusts into the north have been led by freshly trained Angolan counter-insurgency commandos, with help from South African and other mercenaries. The besieged government garrison in the central highlands town of Cuito, in the heart of traditional Unita territory, surrounded, starved and pounded by heavy artillery for a year and a half, last month blasted rebel forces from positions in the town centre and scattered them into the hills. Mr Savimbi's western cold-war supporters have now gone home. The collapsed 1991 accords were part of a wider regional deal which linked the departure of 50,000 Cuban troops, who had fought alongside the MPLA since 1975, with the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia, Angola's southern neighbour. South Africa and Namibia are now ruled by traditional MPLA allies. The government produces more than 500,000 barrels a day of oil, last year worth some Dollars 2.75bn, more than 60 per cent of which has gone directly into the defence budget. Arms shipments from Spain, Israel, Brazil and the former Soviet Union are being unloaded openly at Luanda's airport while military units press gang teenagers onto army trucks in the streets of the capital. Unita's representative to the UN, Mr Gardo Muekalia, last week said he expected a government offensive on Soyo, Angola's second-most productive oil town which produced some 35,000 b/d before Unita captured it last year. Yet Huambo still remains the key diplomatic and military prize. Unita refers to Huambo as its 'Jerusalem' and sees control of the city as the key to any peace agreement. But the government says its refusal to accept a Unita governor in Huambo is 'not negotiable'. Mr Savimbi appears unwilling, or unable, to concede what is demanded of him. To be denied governorship of Huambo, after nearly 20 years of civil war, may be impossible for him to sell to his generals and to his people. He also knows the battle to control all Angola, by military or by electoral means, is beyond his grasp. He may thus think his best hope is to carve out a kingdom of his own centred on Huambo, its borders frozen in place by UN peacekeepers called in, should a peace agreement be signed. But the Luanda government and the outside world, afraid of a de facto partition of Angola, want to avoid such Unita control at Huambo. UN sanctions already ban supplies of fuel and arms to the rebels and they also threaten to close down Unita bank accounts and offices abroad if the rebel group does not give up demands to install its own governor in Huambo. Mr Savimbi has said new sanctions will scotch the talks and the UN has repeatedly backed down from applying them. The clear knowledge on both sides that the war is unwinnable may prove enough incentive to find peace. The government knows Mr Savimbi cannot be fully defeated. Even on a shoestring budget his rebels can continue to make the countryside ungovernable. But diplomats in Luanda also believe an agreement in Lusaka could be one of the smaller hurdles on the road to a lasting peace in Angola. The UN is trying to work out a formula for peace involving revival of the 1991 accords. But the extent of mistrust stirred up by the disaster of those very accords has severely damaged chances of real peace. When Mr Savimbi lost elections in 1992, he used stockpiles of weapons hidden in the bush to storm back across much of Angola, overwhelming the largely demobilised government forces in town after town. Neither side will find it easy to disarm this time. Many Unita soldiers who were in the Hotel Turismo and other parts of Luanda when the war broke out again were hunted down and killed. 'They shot me in my office,' Unita general Mukumba Gato, who escaped from Luanda with a bullet in his arm, said in Huambo earlier this year. 'I am afraid to go back.'</p>

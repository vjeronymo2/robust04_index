			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Bentsen may modify bank proposals: Fed is fighting its corner Plans to consolidate the multi-layered US bank regulation system will face a crucial test this morning when Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, presents the administration's proposals to the Senate banking committee. Three months after he outlined plans to draw the four federal bank regulatory agencies into a single federal banking commission, Mr Bentsen is expected to offer some flexibility in order to meet the complaints of the Federal Reserve Board, which is fighting to preserve its regulatory authority. But the Treasury and the Fed have not yet reached a deal, and the Fed has won considerable support from an array of bankers and state banking supervisors who fear the concentration of too much regulatory power in a single agency. At the moment, the Fed oversees bank holding companies, foreign banks, and state chartered banks which belong to the Federal Reserve system. Other state banks are monitored at the federal level by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which runs the fund guaranteeing depositors in the event of failure. The separate category of nationally chartered banks comes under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, while savings and loan institutions are overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Fed argues that its ability to keep in close touch with the financial system and prevent banking catastrophes would be diminished if it were reduced to an observer's role in bank supervision, although some banking observers point out that well respected central banks like the German Bundesbank have no regulatory role at all. To general surprise, bank reform legislation is now widely expected to pass Congress this session. It is likely, however, to concentrate on measures allowing banks to open branches outside their home states, not on regulatory consolidation. An interstate banking bill passed the Senate banking committee last month by a unanimous vote after Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who has held up similar legislation for years by linking it to restrictions on banks' ability to sell insurance, abandoned his opposition. The House banking committee, whose influential financial institutions subcommittee has already passed similar legislation, is expected to take up the inter-state banking bill next week.</p>

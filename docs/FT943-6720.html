			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Plans for third Forth bridge divide Scots: A new road link seems inevitable in spite of fears about congestion in Edinburgh The two bridges spanning the Firth of Forth - the railway bridge, opened in 1890, and the road bridge, opened in 1964 - are likely to be joined in a few years by a second road crossing. It is a prospect that pleases people on the north side of the estuary in Fife, but arouses foreboding on the south side, especially in Edinburgh, 10 miles to the east, where they fear that it will choke the city with extra traffic. The new bridge would stand just up-river from the existing link. Four consortia of UK and Continental construction companies and banks have registered their interest in building it as a privately funded project financed by tolls. Including its associated roads, it would cost about Pounds 400m and be Britain's biggest privately funded infrastructure project after the Channel tunnel. Traffic on the Forth road bridge has been growing by 4.5 per cent a year in the past decade. Last year it carried an average of 49,800 vehicles a day and exceeded its designed capacity of 60,000 a day on 15 days. Consultants for the Scottish Office said last month that without a second road bridge - and with minimal other traffic improvements - the expected increase in daily traffic flows of about half by the year 2010 would cause peak-time tailbacks of five to eight miles, north of the existing bridge. The consultants looked at several options for improving the Forth crossing, including not only a new bridge but also more investment in the railway system in Fife and enhanced bus and rail services on the Lothian side. They concluded that congestion would only be relieved by schemes including a new bridge. Scottish Office ministers are waiting for a final roads study and the outcome of consultations before announcing their intentions, probably in November. The choice of a new bridge, coupled with investment in better public transport, seems inevitable. Mr Alastair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said the bridge was 'a solution to a political problem rather than solving a traffic or environmental problem'. The government wanted 'a flagship project for its private-finance initiative, which is faltering'. He said that since 60 per cent of traffic going south across the bridge was travelling to Edinburgh, with a quarter of that going to the city centre, a new bridge would only encourage more people to drive there. Mr Darling supports a grouping of environmental organisations called the Forthright Alliance, which opposes a new bridge and wants a small number of road improvements and a large investment in public transport, including a rapid transport system in Edinburgh. Mr David Begg, an Edinburgh University transport economist who chairs Lothian region's transportation committee, believes rail traffic across the Forth could be increased substantially by further investment in trains, stations and new signalling in Edinburgh. The government is allowing Fife region to borrow Pounds 9m to spend on station improvements, but Mr Begg said this was not enough. These arguments are rejected by Forth Connect, a consortium formed this month to press for a second road bridge. It is backed by chambers of commerce including those from Fife, Dundee and Aberdeen, but also Edinburgh, and has support from Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, and the CBI in Scotland. Mr David Waring, director of strategy with Fife Enterprise, said improved public transport around the Forth was desirable but would never remove the need for a second bridge. He quoted a study for the Scottish Office which showed that 70 per cent of people travelling from Fife to central Edinburgh already used trains or buses. Even if opponents become resigned to the new bridge, one aspect of the project is certain to be unpopular. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said last year that higher tolls would probably be charged on the existing bridge to help fund construction of the new one. He envisaged tolls of at least Pounds 1.25 instead of the present 40p.</p>

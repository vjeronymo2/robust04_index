			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Marks gets a measure on stress - Health Everywhere you look, someone is promising to take your stress away. Consultants and health centres offer hypnotherapy, relaxation tapes or mud baths. In this atmosphere, it is easy for companies to assume that their employees will take care of stress on their own time. But when does stress become so severe that it is a company's responsibility to take notice? 'The scenario when someone disappears from work, or when the men in white coats show up, is an extreme sign that stress has become unbearable,' says Paul Litchfield, assistant registrar at the Faculty for Occupational Health in the Royal College of Medicine. But stress is something that mounts, and some companies believe that the time to act is long before things get bad. Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, has just piloted a 'Managing Pressure' programme, designed to teach employees, from senior management through to the shop floor, how to cope with an 'unprecedented' set of pressures from inside and outside the job. 'We thought it would be better to get to people in training programmes while it was still pressure and not stress,' says Sally Young, executive for health and welfare at M and S. Dr Celia Palmer, a former member of M and S's head office occupational health staff, and Steve Williams, an organisational psychologist at Resource Systems in Harrogate, Yorkshire, designed the programme, which was piloted last October among 17 supervisors and sales assistants in one of the company's Midlands stores. Palmer and Williams based the programme on the Occupational Stress Indicator*, a questionnaire that gives individuals a comprehensive picture of their 'stress profile'. Respondents answer 167 questions on job satisfaction and personality, such as: 'Generally and at work, do you usually feel relaxed and at ease or do you tend to feel restless, tense and find it difficult to settle down?' Resource Systems produces a three-page report on all the sources of an individual's stress. For M and S, Williams and Palmer have developed a 'workbook' which would advise employees on how to deal with the pressures identified by the OSI, and a workshop to advise employees on how to cope with the issues raised in the OSI and the workbook. M and S plans to train managers and occupational health advisers to facilitate the programme. The workbook offers some familiar stress reduction methods: relaxation techniques, physical exercise, hobbies, tapes, yoga. It also suggests strategies for time management, improving relationships with colleagues, and coping with corporate change. Litchfield warns against companies using such programmes to let them off the hook. 'It is very easy to concentrate on how stress affects the individual,' he says. 'But really you have to go back and see how the company exacerbates stress. Just telling the person on the shop floor to listen to some relaxation tapes is not going to address the source of the problem.' Palmer says, in M and S's programme, workshop facilitators will find out what employee concerns are and feed the information up to management. In March, participants in the pilot filled in the OSI again. Williams found that their job satisfaction had improved by about 9 per cent. Now the company has to figure out how to evaluate the programme's effectiveness. Individual progress can be measured by the OSI, but measuring the bottom-line return on investment for the company is more difficult. To date, the company has spent Pounds 40,000 on developing the programme and expects to spend another Pounds 100,000 for a full launch. M and S ultimately hopes to measure changes in sickness absence, staff turnover, accident rates, customer satisfaction, and employee productivity. But Williams says: 'There are not any panaceas here. We are not trying to remove all stress or pressure. The programme has limited objectives to help people manage pressure. We know there is a relationship between pressure and productivity so we are hoping that these kinds of things will come out in the measurement figures as we put these programmes into more stores.' *The Occupational Stress Indicator is available from Resource Systems, Claro Court, Claro Road, Harrogate HG1 4BA TEL: 0423 529529</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Sales of new cars in December up nearly 30% NEW CAR sales soared by nearly 30 per cent in the first 20 days of this month compared with last December. They provided much the firmest indication so far that one of the steepest slides in the industry's post-war history may be coming to an end. As the month's sales reached the 60,000 mark - up from just over 46,000 in the first 20 days of December 1991 - one of the industry's most respected analysts said that conditions were emerging for a 'very much more rapid' market recovery next year than virtually anyone in the industry had bargained for. Prof Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, said sales might recover next year to 1.7m. That would compare with 1.59m in 1991 and what is expected to be an almost identical level this year. As recently as a month ago, some manufacturers and even the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had been predicting a further fall this year, to 1.55m units or fewer. The society described the sales upsurge yesterday as 'exciting' and said it seemed 'to confirm the trend established since the (October) motor show that UK car sales are set on a recovery'. Prof Rhys, who is motor industry adviser to the Commons trade and industry committee, emphasised that he was not making a firm forecast that sales would rise above 1.7m. Much would depend on a return of confidence in the economy. 'Last year, the so-called green shoots of recovery were subsequently killed off by frost,' he said. 'But it does seem that the latest ones will survive. All we need now is a change of sentiment. That should become apparent by the second quarter and then the speed of the recovery could surprise us all.' His calculations that the market might rise once more above 1.7m are based on recovery rates from previous recessions and the growth in the total car population. In 1985, the 6 per cent sales increase was the highest recorded for a first year of recovery, representing nearly 90,000 vehicles. That, though, represented only a 0.43 per cent increase in the car population of 18m. The car population has now grown to 23m. If the industry comes out of recession with sales expanding on the same scale, Prof Rhys says, that would mean a sales increase of 98,000 next year. Yet the 1985 recovery did not begin until several months into the year. 'In addition,' Prof Rhys said, 'there is a huge amount of pent-up demand in the form of overdue replacement of cars bought in the record sales year of 1989, when 2.3m cars were sold.' This month's surge follows a year-on-year increase of 6.3 per cent in November. New car registrations have been higher than a year ago in four of the past five months.</p>

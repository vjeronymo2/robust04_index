			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Heath attacks 'sleaze' over Lloyd's Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, yesterday accused Labour of running a 'sleazy' campaign to undermine Conservative MPs facing losses in the Lloyd's insurance market. Sir Edward spoke out after detailed estimates of the alleged losses faced by 14 Conservative MPs appeared in a Sunday newspaper. The figures were extracted from an unpublished version of a parliamentary early day motion tabled last week by Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath. The details were removed by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker. However, Mrs Boothroyd allowed publication of figures suggesting that Conservative Names face losses totalling Pounds 6m. The motion also suggested that Conservative MPs had benefited from a 'special arrangement' with Lloyd's intended to avoid bankruptcies. Any MP judged bankrupt would be required to resign from the Commons after six months, triggering a difficult by-election for the government. Sir Edward said Labour MPs had a 'sleazy desire to brand certain Conservative members as being on the way to bankruptcy, if not bankrupt'. He said losses attributed to him were 'entirely untrue'. They bore 'no relationship whatever to the proper provision made for loss'. Further details of the Conservative MPs' exposure to losses are expected to be published later this week in a supplement to the Commons register of members' interests. MPs are not , however, required to declare details of their personal wealth, or their provisions for limiting their exposure. Mr Hain said he had not sought to conceal that the losses attributed to MPs were based on average premiums. They also failed to take into account reinsurance by MPs. He said that the MPs concerned should clear up the confusion by declaring the extent of their losses and how they were being paid. He said: 'Scores of other Lloyd's names have been driven to destitution, bankruptcy, and some have even committed suicide. It seems inconceivable that all of the Lloyd's Tory MPs should have miraculously escaped these catastrophic losses.' Lossmaking names can apply to the so-called 'hardship' relief scheme, which reschedules their debts under terms which vary according to circumstances. Through the scheme Names are allowed to retain an income of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year. Lloyd's takes a charge over any property but the Name can continue living in a 'modest' home.</p>

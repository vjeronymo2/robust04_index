			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP, Suez end four-year struggle over Colonia UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Groupe Suez, two of the most powerful groups in French finance, yesterday ended their four-year battle for control of Colonia, the German insurance company. Under yesterday's agreement, UAP - France's largest insurance group and a prime candidate for privatisation - will take control of Colonia by buying a majority stake in Vinci, the holding company that owns the international activities of Victoire, a French insurer in which Suez has a majority stake. UAP has valued the 59 per cent holding in Vinci - which owns a controlling stake in Nieuw Rotterdam, the Dutch insurer, as well as 55 per cent of Colonia - at FFr11.4bn (Dollars 2bn). As payment, it will cede to Suez its 34 per cent minority stake in Victoire, valued at FFr11bn. In a parallel agreement, Victoire will cede its remaining 14.6 per cent stake in Vinci to UAP, in return for a 5 per cent stake in the French insurer. UAP, which owns 5 per cent of Suez, has pre-emptive rights to buy the 21.2 per cent of Vinci owned by the Oppenheim group for DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m). UAP and Suez have agreed to keep their 5 per cent cross-shareholdings for three years. The agreement marks the end of years of wrangling as Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman of UAP who is tipped as the next head of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, has manoeuvred to win control of Colonia and fulfil his ambition of taking UAP into the large German insurance market. The negotiations have been marked by the personal tension between Mr Peyrelevade, who was chairman of Suez during the late 1980s, and his former subordinate, Mr Gerard Worms. UAP and Suez late last year almost agreed a deal, only to fall out over the price. Mr Peyrelevade, anxious to resolve the potentially embarrassing Colonia affair before UAP's privatisation and his possible move to Credit Lyonnais, pressed for the talks to resume. Suez announced static profits of FFr516m for the first half of this year, against FFr528m for the same period of 1992. The group, which made a FFr1.87bn net loss in 1992, confirmed Mr Patrick Ponsolle was resigning as chief executive. Lex, Page 18</p>

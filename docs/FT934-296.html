			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banesto: walking on a razor's edge It is rare for a bank to lose its entire board less than four months after raising nearly Dollars 700m from the international financial community. It is rarer still for such an upset to happen to an institution publicly embraced by JP Morgan, the bank most admired by other bankers. Yet that is what happened yesterday to Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest bank. Its board was replaced at the orders of the Bank of Spain, because, said the central bank, Banesto needed restructuring on a scale which required 'the support of the entire banking system'. If that implies serious, longstanding problems in Banesto's loan portfolio, it was a concern brushed aside by the investors who put up Dollars 670m for Banesto's rights issue this summer. Individual Spanish investors pinned their faith to Mr Mario Conde, the bank's youthful chairman, who was demonstrating his faith in the bank he had run since 1987 with a personal purchase of shares worth Pta6.4bn (Dollars 47.4m). Institutional investors round the world were comforted by the presence of JP Morgan as adviser to the bank and co-investor. Banesto was the first target of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio set up by Morgan to invest in undervalued banks. Corsair put Dollars 175m into Banesto. Though Morgan was providing only Dollars 17.5m of that, it was publicly setting the seal of respectability on the Spanish bank. 'We must get it right because we are investing our reputation,' said Mr Roberto Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman. 'That is the biggest kind of risk we can take.' Mr Conde had no illusions about the value of Morgan's name. 'Would there have been a capital issue without JP Morgan? The answer is no,' he said. But the Morgan name was not enough to see the capital-raising plan through to completion. Last week, Banesto cancelled the final stage of its capital-raising exercise, a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue. The cancellation was accompanied by the resignation from JP Morgan of Ms Violy de Harper, managing director of the US bank's corporate advisory arm, who masterminded the deal with the Corsair fund. In retrospect, Banesto has been walking on the razor's edge ever since Mr Conde's plan to sell shares in the bank's industrial empire, Corporacion Banesto, fell foul of the market slump that accompanied the Gulf war in 1990. Banesto needed the capital to shore up its balance sheet. The sale would have met the regulator's new rule requiring Spanish banks hold down the proportion of industrial assets in their shareholders funds. With the Corporacion Banesto sale postponed, Banesto was reduced to finding individual buyers for its industrial assets. These include stakes in Acerinox, Spain's leading stainless steel producer; Union Carburos, an industrial gases group; Tudor, Europe's third-ranked battery producer; Agroman, the big domestic building group and Asturiana de Zinc, a mining business. With most of these businesses weakened by recession, successful sales have been hard to find, though shares in Acerinox were successfully placed last autumn. Banesto solved its balance sheet weaknesses with this summer's rights issue. However, finding new capital has not been enough to satisfy the Bank of Spain. JP Morgan must now be hoping that Banesto's new management finds nothing that undermines its judgment earlier this year. In the summer, Mr Mendoza summed up his perception of the chance Morgan was taking with Banesto. 'My own sense is that this is very low risk, although you can argue as to how good the returns will be.'</p>

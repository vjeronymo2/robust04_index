These mandatory standards may be exceeded only when the PHA determines that it is necessary or highly desirable for the long-term physical and social viability of the individual development. If demolition or disposition is proposed, the PHA shall comply with 24 CFR part 970. Additional dwelling space may be added to existing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costs for Turnkey III developments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Eligible physical improvement costs for existing Turnkey III developments are limited to work items which are not the responsibility of the homebuyer families and which are related to health and safety, correction of development deficiencies, physical accessibility, energy audits and cost-effective energy conservation measures, and lead-based paint testing and abatement. In addition, management improvements are eligible modernization costs for existing Turnkey III developments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a PHA may substantially rehabilitate a Turnkey III unit whenever the unit becomes vacant or is occupied by a non-homebuyer family. A PHA that intends to use funds under this paragraph must identify in its needs assessment the estimated number of units that the PHA is proposing for substantial rehabilitation and subsequent sale. In addition, a PHA must demonstrate in its needs assessment that the PHA has homebuyers who are both eligible for homeownership, in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 904, and who have demonstrated their intent to be placed into each of the Turnkey III units proposed to be substantially rehabilitated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A management improvement requires more funds than the PHA may use under its 20% limit for management improvements (except as provided in paragraph (m)(1) of this section), and the PHA needs to save a portion of its annual grant in order to combine it with a portion of subsequent year(s) grants, to fund the work item;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preventive maintenance system. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The establishment of a preventive maintenance system or improvement of an existing system is strongly encouraged.

A PHA (including a PHA that has been designated as mod troubled under PHMAP) may obtain funds at any time, for any eligible emergency work item as defined in &sect;968.305 (for PHAs participating in CGP) or for any eligible emergency work item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;968.205) (for PHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve established under &sect;968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under &sect;968.103 (e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;968.310(a)(3). A PHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;968.320 before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have the necessary funds available from any other source, including unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This NPRM would also permit FAA recovery of transportation and subsistence expenses that may be incurred in the administering of airman tests, approvals, and ratings outside the United States. Generally, written airman tests are given at the FAA Flight Standards Office (FSO) and practical airman tests are conducted at a nearby airport where transportation and subsistence expenses are not incurred. When inspectors give airman tests at locations outside of the FAA duty station city, those tests are typically conducted in conjunction with a scheduled inspection. Since the fees charged for airman tests do not offset the costs associated with travel, the FAA currently does not send its inspectors to locations outside their duty stations solely for the purpose of conducting airman tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An occasion may arise, however, where an individual or group of individuals, such as a flying club, may be willing to pay the transportation and subsistence expenses of an FAA inspector to permit him or her to travel in order to administer airman tests. In instances of this type, this notice of proposed rulemaking would permit the FAA to recover transportation and subsistence expenses in addition to the established airman fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current rule, the FAA may charge only foreign nationals when it administers airman tests or performs similar services outside the United States. This NPRM would remove that limitation by permitting the FAA to charge all applicants for these services, regardless of country of citizenship, as authorized by the IATC Act. The removal of this limitation will correct the current inequity of FAA charging U.S.-owed foreign repair stations for certification actions but not charging other U.S. citizens for airman certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost to the FAA of providing airman certification services outside the United States is the same for all applicants for the same type of test regardless of the citizenship of the applicant. Because Federal law prohibits charging anyone, a foreign national or a U.S. citizen, more than the cost of services provided, the application of fees only to foreign nationals effectively precludes full recovery of costs. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that costs of services provided abroad to U.S. citizens could be recovered through the indirect user taxes that provide most of the FAA's funding. These taxes_assessed on the value of domestic passenger tickets, domestic freight charges, passengers departing the United States, and aviation fuel sold in the United States_are not paid by airmen living abroad, whether U.S. citizens or foreign nationals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most U.S. citizens already pay for airman testing services provided outside the United States by using FAA designated test examiners for obtaining airman certification services. Under this proposal, U.S. citizens would pay the same fee as anyone else for the certification services described in this NPRM, regardless of whether a service is provided by an FAA designated test examiner or by an FAA inspector. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Repair Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would also revise the hourly billing rate paid to the FAA for the certification of repair stations. The current rate, found in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A, would be increased from $47 per inspector hour to $80 per inspector hour to cover the FAA's current costs incurred while performing this service. In addition to the hourly fees for inspector services, this proposal would permit the FAA to recover transportation and subsistence expenses that may be incurred in connection with repair station and services. The transportation and subsistence expenses incurred by FAA inspectors represent a large portion of the costs incurred by the FAA when performing repair station certification work. Most of this work must be performed on-site and, therefore, requires that an FAA inspector travel to the repair station facility to be inspected. Repair stations facilities range from 20 minutes to 30 hours in travel time from FAA FSO's and, in some instances, lack of funds to cover the FAA's transportation and subsistence costs may prevent the agency from sending inspectors to perform needed repair station certification evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would delete the existing hourly fee of $14 for clerical time devoted to repair station certification activities listed in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A. Instead of computing a direct fee for clerical time, clerical costs have been included in the hourly base rate that would be charged for the FAA inspector's time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

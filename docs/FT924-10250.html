			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Still fumbling for first gear: The government must restore confidence before the British economy can shrug off recession 'A year that began in uncertainty is ending in perplexity' - Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, starting his Mansion House speech in 1933 Neither Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, nor Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present bank governor, chose to echo Montagu Norman's words in their own Mansion House speeches on Thursday. But they could well have done. Six weeks after Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, much remains unclear about government policy and baffling about the true state of the UK economy. Mr Lamont in his speech went some way to removing uncertainty by putting himself and the Treasury behind the prime minister's goal of returning the UK to growth. But as City analysts and industrialists picked over his words yesterday, it became clear that the government still faces a struggle to restore the business and consumer confidence on which economic recovery will hinge. Each partial unveiling of government economic policy-making since Black Wednesday has produced more questions than answers. The Mansion House speech was no exception, making all the more important the government's full exposition of its post-ERM strategy in the Autumn Statement on November 12. At first sight, Britain presents a picture of almost unrelieved economic gloom. The Confederation of British Industry this week reported a sharp fall in business confidence in the third quarter while the British Chambers of Commerce say the economy is entering a 'second leg' of recession. Unemployment rose 32,200 to 2.85m in September and the underlying trend is upwards. According to Gallup, the polling organisation, more than half of Britons expect economic conditions to deteriorate over the next 12 months. House prices, that vital measure of middle-class well-being, registered their largest ever monthly fall in September, according to the Halifax building society. Little wonder, therefore, that some high street banks are now placing solicitors among their high-risk borrowers. The turns and twists of government policy since Black Wednesday have added greatly to the sense of despondency. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the decision on September 16 to push base rates up to 15 per cent gave a surprisingly long-lasting shock to many consumers even though it was reversed within 24 hours. The spectre of rising unemployment helps explain why the planned redundancies in the coal industry earlier this month unleashed such a wave of anger and proved such a debacle for the government. On the other hand, there are some more hopeful aspects to the economy. Many mocked Mr Lamont's welcome for September's small 0.2 per cent volume increase in retail sales, which the chancellor said marked a 'clear upwards trend'. But according to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at S G Warburg Securities: 'The resilience of consumer spending until September was the best-kept secret in town.' Retail sales in the third quarter were 0.6 per cent up on the previous three-month period and 0.8 per cent higher than a year ago in a period when bank base rates were mostly at 10 per cent. The two percentage points cut in base rates since late September should soon begin to boost individual spending power when mortgage rate cuts take effect. Recent business surveys may also be overdoing the gloom as they were completed too soon to include the October 16 base rate cut to 8 per cent. Businesses can now borrow at interest rates well below continental European levels, while sterling has experienced a substantial 13.4 per cent devaluation against the Bank of England's trade-weighted basket of currencies since leaving the ERM. As the chancellor made clear on Thursday, this devaluation - far greater than would have been allowed in an ERM realignment - should greatly enhance the export competitiveness of British industry. But the world business climate has also deteriorated sharply in the past six weeks. Germany seems to be sliding towards recession while independent growth forecasts for both the US and Japan next year have been scaled back. As Mr Leigh-Pemberton reminded bankers in his Mansion House speech: 'The risk of a further world downturn resulting from debt deflation is real.' In the present unpredictable climate, no one, least of all the Treasury, can foretell whether the British economy is on the verge of continuing recession or faltering recovery. The interplay of forces pointing in either direction has never been more finely balanced. Mr Lamont insisted on Thursday that the government can neither talk the economy out of recession nor 'press a button and see the economy spring to life'. But he also recognised that government has a key role to play in rebuilding confidence. His promise of greater openness in economic policy-making is a useful adjunct to this goal. But the individual proposals - to set up a panel of independent economic forecasters to help inform the Treasury and give more information on monetary policy - are modest compared with provisions in countries such as the US where freedom of information is a right. And how accountable UK policy-making will be remains to be seen. The sections of Mr Lamont's speech that most excited the chancellor's City audience were those about supporting infrastructure investment, putting capital spending at the top of public spending priorities and reviewing every policy option as to whether it would benefit industry. Although yesterday the chancellor played down the idea of a 'dash for growth', the tone of his earlier remarks marked a significant break with Treasury rhetoric over the previous decade. The stress on public investment was redolent of the 1970s before Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher came to power. But the lack of detail about specific projects also disappointed bankers and industrialists. This vagueness has boosted speculation that the Autumn Statement will be accompanied by a substantive 'package of measures' - even a mini-Budget - to boost the economy and raise the morale of Conservative backbenchers. The government's imprecision has so far only fostered uncertainty, bordering on perplexity. Mr Lamont spoke only of maintaining public spending on infrastructure in a time of recession, raising doubts in the building industry as to whether the planned moves would be sufficient to staunch rising unemployment and cuts in capacity in the sector. His talk of finding ways to give the private sector a greater role in financing capital projects cut little ice. 'How do you get the private sector involved in capital spending if companies are worried whether they are going bust or not?' asked Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, the City stockbroker. It is also debatable how far the government's promise to support capital programmes is compatible with its determination to hold its planned spending total at the pre-set level of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94. In nominal terms, the planning total for the coming financial year is a generous 7.9 per cent more than the current year's planned spending. The faster than expected fall in inflation this year should mean that spending growth in real terms will be more than the 4 per cent increase estimated by the government in January. On the other hand, existing spending plans assume that unemployment will average 2.4m in 1993-94. Since the summer, UK industry has been shedding labour at an accelerating rate, making it likely that unemployment will be about 3m by the new year. As every 100,000 extra on the average jobless total adds Pounds 345m to government spending in a financial year, government outlays on unemployment alone could be some Pounds 2bn more than anticipated in 1993-94. In addition, the government will have to find money to finance redundancies in the coal industry, is under pressure to ease the introduction of the council tax, and faces ever-rising costs in the health and social security fields. While a freeze on public sector pay has been widely touted as a possible outcome of the Autumn Statement discussions, such a course of action is fraught with difficulty. Pay arrangements and bargaining procedures differ throughout the public sector. The government could find itself in confrontation with unions representing 3m public sector workers and face large-scale problems enforcing its will on the review bodies that recommend pay rises for a further 1.5m employees. It is hardly surprising that the negotiations among ministers in EDX, the public spending committee chaired by Mr Lamont, are reportedly proving very difficult. It appears that no ministers disputed the need to keep within the 1993-94 planning total when spending plans were discussed in cabinet this week. But the decision to discuss public expenditure in the full cabinet on Monday points to serious difficulties in reaching a consensus on how share the burden. From today's perspective, the government looks ill-placed to give substantial support to the economy through public works. Spending on some carefully selected projects - the extension of London's Jubilee Underground railway line is often mentioned in this context - could boost confidence. But short of a radical departure from existing policies - through short-term tax incentives, perhaps, which would have to be financed by increased borrowing - it is difficult to see how fiscal policy can meet the expectations being vested in it. Those rising expectations summarise the problems that have confronted Mr Lamont and the Treasury in the six weeks since sterling left the ERM. Each faltering step in the so-called 'rebalancing' of policy has been signalled in advance, stoking up hopes that have not been fulfilled. It is always possible that the Autumn Statement will break this pattern, and, through measures as yet unknown, boost confidence and tip the UK in the direction of recovery. That would get the government off the hook. But for the UK economy as a whole, it would be only the beginning of a long rehabilitation after the inflationary excesses and de-industrialisation of the past 13 years.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOTS SEEN 'ROUND WORLD VIA PHONE LINE  </P> <P> With video transmissions from Beijing banned, the networks have had to resort  to Vietnam-era methods of covering the violence there, with news footage flown  by courier to outside satellite points for relay here.  </P> <P> But this time, the networks can also do what the wire services routinely did  from Saigon even at the bloody height of the 1968 Communist Tet Offensive --  transmit still pictures of the carnage, bravery and brief moments of peace.  </P> <P> Such pictures, including ABC's dramatic shot Monday morning of a lone Chinese  civilian boldly stopping a line of tanks in Tian An Men Square, have become  American viewers' first glimpse of the stories that network correspondents are  describing live by phone from Beijing.  </P> <P> The pictures are aired well before videotape footage makes the five- to  seven-hour trip from Beijing to Tokyo and Hong Kong for satellite relay to the  networks and subsequent broadcasts in the United States.  </P> <P> According to network officials, the still pictures are taken from the videotape  footage and transmitted from Beijing via phone lines by image-scanning  "pixelator" devices -- pixel is shorthand for "picture elements" -- that are  similar in operation to a fax machine, digitally transforming the picture into  information bits and reassembling them at the other end of the line.  </P> <P> ABC sent its dramatic man-against-tank still picture (Associated Press also had  a similar shot from one of its photographers) via a Sony-developed PromaVica  that the network sent to Beijing only last Friday, said Robert Seigenthaler,  ABC technical operations president.  </P> <P> It was promptly put in use to send still shots of the army crushing the long  demonstration of students and others in Beijing over the weekend, with the  video footage aired several hours later.  </P> <P> A similar image-scanning device used by CBS is a Quickpix machine, jointly  developed by CBS and Kodak, and has been used by Beijing staffers for about a  month, CBS News vice president Don DeCesare said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The technology is about two or three years old, network officials said. Some  broadcasters also are using an electronic still camera that records images on  video tape rather than film.  </P> <P> Wire services such as Associated Press also still are able to transmit  black-and-white and color photographs via phone lines from Beijing. The  networks use some of those photos as part of their coverage.  </P> <P> But not many, DeCesare said. Since the CBS machine "is working so well and we  get such high-quality, high-resolution photos that are our own, we obviously  tend to use our own pictures."  </P> <P> During the Vietnam war, there was no satellite transmission facility in Saigon  and the networks, which then used film, not tape, shipped their news footage to  Hong Kong or Tokyo for satellite relay. There are satellite facilities in  Beijing, but save for a one-day respite on May 22, Chinese authorities have  banned all video transmissions from them since martial law was declared May 20.  </P> <P> The Chinese, however, haven't cut off phone communications that allow broadcast  and written reports and still pictures to reach the outside world.  </P> <P> Network executives are both puzzled and relieved that that last electronic plug  hasn't been pulled. All are keeping their fingers crossed that, whatever  happens this week in Beijing, Chinese authorities won't cut off phone lines to  the outside world.  </P> <P> As John Chancellor, who covered China's bloody cultural revolution years ago,  put it Tuesday on NBC's "Today" show, "we may never have this access again if  they decide to shut it down."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 YEARS' PROBATION GIVEN IN SECURITY SCHEME;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE EX-OWNER OF A SECURITY FIRM MUST ALSO PAY $220,000 IN FINES AND  RESTITUTION. HE WAS CHIEF WITNESS IN THE CASH-FOR-INFLUENCE CASE AGAINST TWO  DEPUTY MARSHALS.  </P> <P> The former owner of an Orange County security company was placed on probation  Wednesday and ordered to pay $220,000 in fines and restitution for funneling  cash to two deputy U.S. marshals who helped him keep a lucrative security  contract.  </P> <P> Joseph Rydzewski, 34, of Santa Ana, admitted participating in the  cash-for-influence scheme and emerged as the chief witness against the two  ex-deputy marshals. According to Rydzewski's testimony, the two accepted more  than $7,600 from him in exchange for their assistance in getting and keeping  Ryszewski's no-bid, $400,000 contract to protect evidence and guard witnesses  in federal cases from 1982 to 1984.  </P> <P> The two former deputy marshals, Joseph Gieniec of Santa Ana and Gordon Tornberg  of Tustin, who worked at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles, were convicted  in September of accepting illegal gratuities. They face sentencing Dec. 6.  </P> <P> As a result of Rydzewski's guilty plea in July to three counts of paying  illegal gratuities to government employees, prosecutors recommended Wednesday  that U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts place him on probation, a move that  surprised the judge.  </P> <P> Letts said he considered the recommendation "extraordinary" in light of the  seriousness of the crime. Letts said he wondered if Rydzewski had "colored" his  testimony to suit the government.  </P> <P> "I'm very troubled at the prospect that judicial justice might bear no relation  at all to what really happened," Letts said. "Was I listening to the version of  the truth most favorable (to the government) or was I listening to what really  happened?" Letts asked.  </P> <P> Jackie M. Bennett Jr., a lawyer from the Department of Justice's public  integrity section, said he believed that Rydzewski told the truth on the stand  and that he had been very helpful to investigators.  </P> <P> Letts then turned to Rydzewski, saying he was willing to trust the government  and release him without jail time, but he said it was a "very difficult"  decision.  </P> <P> "You're getting all there is and perhaps more than you're entitled to," Letts  said. "I'm trusting them, just about as much against my best judgment as I ever  have. I don't want to be wrong. . . . If I ever see or hear a bad word about  you, I'm going to be stricken."  </P> <P> With that, Letts placed Rydzewski on three years' probation, fined him $10,000  and ordered him to pay $210,000 in restitution to the government. Defense  attorney Ronald G. Brower said Rydzewski agreed to the restitution to cover  overcharges he submitted to the government on his contract.  </P></p>

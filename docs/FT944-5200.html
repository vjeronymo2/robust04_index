			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Personal View: Signals herald growth, not inflation Is inflation about to take off in the UK? The broad picture of output levels suggests that it is. The most recent Confederation of British Industry quarterly survey revealed that 51 per cent of companies reported their current level of output as below capacity - compared with an historic average of 58 per cent. This trend is widely perceived as a sign of a resurgence of inflation - even though rising investment will partly alleviate the problem. However, the aggregate numbers - even for manufacturing - disguise a widely varying picture at the sector level. Indeed, the main implication of the survey results on capacity utilisation is for relative profits growth in different manufacturing sectors. This means that fears of a resurgence in inflation are overstated. It is clear that capacity shortages are heavily concentrated in basic industries at the early stages of the production process, such as chemicals and metal-manufacturing sectors. Only 23 per cent of chemicals sector respondents reported that they were working below capacity compared with an historic average of 51 per cent. Only 19 per cent of metal manufacturers were working below capacity compared with 46 per cent in January 1994. The percentage of metal manufacturers reporting that a shortage of plant and machinery is 'likely to limit output over the next four months' has risen from 6 per cent in January 1994 to 64 per cent in October. Not only is plant capacity utilisation much higher in basic industries than in the rest of manufacturing, it is much higher than at similar stages of previous cycles. This is not generally the case for the rest of manufacturing - those industries at the more intermediate stages of the production process. In 'engineering and allied sectors', which account for about 40 per cent of manufacturing output, 60 per cent of respondents still report they are working below capacity, in line with the historic average for this series. The further along the production process we look and the closer we get to the final consumer, the more spare capacity there appears to be. In the last survey 83 per cent of drink and tobacco manufacturers reported they were working below capacity. It is not surprising, therefore, that the price pressures which were evident in the last survey were heavily concentrated in the basic industries. A balance (the percentage of respondents replying 'up' minus the percentage replying 'down') of +55 per cent of metal manufacturers reported higher prices, compared with +9 per cent for the survey as a whole, even though their unit cost balance was - 39 per cent, implying that margins are expanding rapidly in these sectors. In the official producer output-price series, the highest rise over the past 12 months has been in the basic metals sector. In chemicals, a survey balance of +21 per cent reported higher prices in October 1994. In the engineering sectors, the price balance was - 2 per cent and the cost balance +8 per cent, implying margins are being squeezed. The picture that emerges is that because basic industries - at the early stages of the production chain - have much higher-than-average (and higher than is usual for this stage in the cycle) rates of capacity utilisation, they have greater price-setting ability than previously. The more intermediate manufacturers, meanwhile, with much more spare capacity, are being squeezed between their suppliers and the still-competitive final markets, to which they are closer. This picture is consistent with that which emerged from the recent company-results season, resulting in quantum profit-upgrades for the likes of British Steel and ICI going hand-in-hand with downgrades for companies such as BTR. Eventually the capacity and price pressures in the basic industries may get passed through the production process, but there is currently no sign from the survey that this will happen to any significant degree in the foreseeable future. The main implication for the next one to two years continues to be for relative sectoral profits growth rather than macro inflation. Even then, rising producer prices will be partly absorbed by the highly competitive retail and distribution sectors, particularly if consumer demand weakens further in the face of the second tranche of tax increases next spring.

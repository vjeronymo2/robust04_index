			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POPE AND ANGLICAN ARCHBISHOP MEET  </P> <P> Archbishop of Canterbury Robert A. K. Runcie met Pope John Paul II on Friday  during the first day of a visit marked by controversy over the issue of  Anglican-Catholic reunification.  </P> <P> The Pope embraced the archbishop at the beginning and end of the meeting, and  Runcie said he was happy to visit the "engine room" of Catholicism.  </P> <P> "No theological disagreement will permanently divide us when we know each other  no longer as strangers but as friends," he added.  </P> <P> Runcie's trip, his first official visit to the Vatican, caused a stir in  England after he said in a magazine interview that he would accept some kind of  papal authority "linked to a renewed ecumenical and universal primacy."  </P> <P> In response, some conservative Anglican leaders demanded his resignation.  </P> <P> Runcie, spiritual head of the world's 70 million Anglicans, will meet with the  Pope for two more discussions during his four-day visit.  </P> <P> On Sunday he will become only the second Archbishop of Canterbury to attend a  papal Mass since England split from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 over King  Henry VIII's refusal to accept papal authority.  </P></p>

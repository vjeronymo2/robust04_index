			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Senior civil servants asked to consider pay curb SENIOR civil servants have been asked to consider forgoing part of a pay rise announced in July as part of the government's squeeze on pay. The government also an-nounced yesterday that top civil servants, judges and members of the armed forces will join MPs in getting no salary rises next year. Meanwhile Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, urged the private sector to observe the 1.5 per cent pay ceiling being imposed on the public sector. He said yesterday: 'What happened in the past when the pound has been devalued is that some of the benefits have been thrown away in higher wages and it would be very good to avoid that this time.' The idea of a voluntary pay curb for senior civil servants comes from Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, in a letter to colleagues. He says many permanent secretaries 'will choose either not to draw some or all of the 3 per cent increase due . . . until April 1 1994 or will contribute it to good causes'. He says he is 'not asking colleagues to act similarly', and 'any decision is up to them' but the letter's tone suggests Sir Robin wants high-ranking officials to consider self-imposed restraint. The 3 per cent is due from April 1993 as part of a government decision to phase in this year's pay award for the top three grades of civil servants. The effect of the pay freeze announced yesterday for workers covered by the Top Salaries' Review Body, including senior civil servants, is that there will be no additional sum representing a pay award for 1993. Sir Robin's comments came as Labour challenged Mr John Major, the prime minister, over the effect of the pay restraints announced in the Autumn Statement on Thursday. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'While everyone else in the public sector receives less than 1.5 per cent in the coming year, judges, admirals, generals and top civil servants will actually receive a rise of almost 3 per cent on April 1 1993.' He said the government had to explain why the pay restraint, caused by the recession, 'should apply in its entirety to the lowest paid in the land but not the highest paid in the land'. Sir Robin acknowledges there would be 'a particular problem for those in charge of departments who will be asking their staff to accept a policy which will inevitably bear heavily on them'.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: MASON'S IS NOT GONE AND NOT FORGOTTEN  </P> <P> Mason's in Brentwood has not closed its doors, contrary to rumors and a report  in the current issue of Los Angeles magazine. Management and administration of  the restaurant have, however, been taken over by a new company, Hospitality  Management Services -- an offshoot of Kennard, Herbage &amp; Associates, the  Santa Ana-based architecture firm that designed the restaurant's interior.  </P> <P> Robert Herbage, a Hospitality Management principal who said he's always felt a  vested interest in Mason's, named Roger Mathys (formerly of A Fine Affair) as  chef. Mathys, who has been in the kitchen since March 27, is about to unveil a  new menu. Meanwhile, the two unrelated Masons who founded the restaurant --  former White House deputy protocol chief Morgan Mason (a.k.a. son of the late  actor James Mason and husband of singer Belinda Carlisle) and entertainment  attorney John Mason -- remain involved as partners.  </P> <P> ON THE FIRE: Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Feniger of City Restaurant and the  Border Grill combine a cooking class and book signing for their new (and  excellent) cookbook, "City Cuisine," on Wednesday evening, April 26, at the  Epicurean Cooking School in West Hollywood. The class fee is $60 per person,  and books will be on sale at the school. Information: (213) 659-5990. . . .

Also,  eleven chefs from around the country will participate in a chocolate sculpting  contest. . . .

The ordinarily private Regency Club in Westwood opens its doors to  any and all local wine lovers who have formal garb and $175 per person to spend  on Tuesday, May 2, for a Bordeaux wine dinner featuring first-growth wines from  the 1986 vintage.

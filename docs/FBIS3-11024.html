			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The National Organization for the Defense of  National Interests [ONIN], which came out publicly on 14 March,  denounces the irresponsibility of Haitian leaders toward the  crisis. The movement, which favors the lower chamber's plan,  called on all the sectors of national life to reach a compromise  for a solution to the crisis.    ONIN, which openly opposes foreign domination of the  country's internal affairs, on 14 March launched a petition  throughout the country seeking signatures to support the plan  proposed by the deputies, a petition that the members of the  organization intend to submit to Army Headquarters on 29 March,  the anniversary date of the 1987 Constitution. The members of  the National Organization for the Defense of National Interests  met with the press on 14 March. [passage omitted]</p>

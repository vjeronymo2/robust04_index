			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean university  science team has developed the country's first satellite  transponder and the world's seventh after such nations as the  United States, Japan and France.    After nearly four years of research and financial aid of 500  million won from the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, an  electronic engineering department team at Kwangun University led  by Prof. Na Kuk-hwan said Friday it has developed a satellite  transponder for broadcasting on the tricky Ku frequency band.    Industry sources say a Ku-band transponder is designed to  operate in space for more than 10 years and can be installed in  a satellite anytime for satellite broadcasting as well as  communications.    "We will be able to install Korean-made transponders in  satellites and save some 800 million won for every unit in doing  so," Na said. He said the transponder can be widely applied in  satellite receivers, ground stations and cellular facilities for  satellite broadcasting. Na's development will be awarded the top  prize in the government-sponsored industry-academy-research  cooperation.</p>

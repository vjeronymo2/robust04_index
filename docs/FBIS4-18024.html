			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Hoping for Mutual </F> Understanding"]    [Text] What is your view of this highly important document  for the future of Russia and Russia's citizens? The following  answer this question:    Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation [RF] Government vice  premier and leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord:    If there were no political confrontation in society, if it  had traditions to ensure the automatic operation of the  Constitution, and if the mechanisms of juducial power were in  operation, there would have been no need to devise this  document. But we have a very acute form of political  confrontation, a profound socioeconomic crisis, and a lack of  institutions of power, including judicial power, capable of  defending civil rights and peace in society. There is therefore  no alternative to the Treaty on Social Accord.    Petr Filippov, head of the RF Presidential Administration's  Information Support Administration:    It would be the height of naivete to expect the Treaty to be  signed by all the opposing forces. The Treaty is a text that  will enable public opinion to identify those people who are in  fact in favor of settling disputes by means of civil war. If  there are two major political camps in the country that switch  to hostilities without finding a compromise, that is a  catastrophe. But Russia is not threatened by that situation  today. However, if the chance of accord is missed, that will  postpone and complicate the positive economic changes in the  country.    Economist Pavel Bunich:    A host of reservations can be made about the text of the  Treaty, but they can be made throughout life, till the end. The  Treaty is a fairly realistic basis for further work.    Georgiy Satarov, RF presidential aide:    Any democracy has two foundation stones. The first one being  the Constitution and the laws, the second -- political culture  and political traditions. Permanent mechanisms for accord will  train us in normal political culture. When we speak of the  Treaty's tasks, we bear in mind the second foundation stone,  which is based on democracy and the culture of seeking accord  and compromise.</p>

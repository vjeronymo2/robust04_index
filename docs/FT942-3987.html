			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Improvements on Adolf and Uncle Joe - How the press viewed the anniversary of the D-Day landings Does this passage ring a bell? 'At the academy, we were woken in the middle of the night to be given the news that another old boy had won the Knights' Cross, with Oak Leaves. And an entire street would celebrate when a boy or girl from it gained entrance to the Gymnasium.' This passage leads up to a complaint that the German empire was lost without the consent of the German people. Well, it comes from Deutschland, Erwache ('Wake up, Germany'), which rather gives the game away. In fact, all the above is taken from last week's off-putting review in these pages of a new book by Paul Johnson called Wake up, Britain, and has been transposed into German, as it were. Pretty disagreeable it is, too, in this week of all weeks. You might argue that this is a cheap point - but then, cheap points are the specialites de la maison of this column. Clearly, British nationalism is much less unpleasant than the German variety, and little that Johnson writes would be out of place in a golf, or working men's, club. In Germany, the expression of similar views would lead to public condemnation. So it was that the press there treated the D-Day celebrations as part of the continued 'burden of being German', as a book title of some years ago had it. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said it was right that the Germans received no invitation to the Normandy beaches. 'On the contrary: it is justified in historical terms, understandable in human terms, and considerate even in German terms. It is worth taking another look at the end of the Hitler dictatorship and the darkest chapter in our history. And the clear dividing line between the National Socialist regime and the democratic present of close partnership is to be welcomed.' Die Welt asked, shrewdly, where Chancellor Kohl would have stood had he been there: 'In the bow of Queen Elizabeth's yacht, on the bridge of the US aircraft carrier George Washington steering towards the one-time German positions, or perhaps standing in the ruins?' On television, a presenter in Bonn asked his reporter on the beaches what they were saying about Germany. 'In talking about the invasion, nobody mentions Germany,' the reporter said. 'Nor does one hear the words Wehrmacht or Nazi. It is all very diplomatic.' Only the Queen subsequently let the dreaded N-word pass her lips. The other absent friend was Russia. The government daily, Rossiiskaya Gazeta, wrote: 'It is only the two major foes in that war - Germany and Russia - who are not invited. One can understand why Germany will not be present . . . The reason for not inviting Russia also seems clear: it would be hard for the participants in the festivities to praise their own feats in battle in the presence of those who made the major contribution to the victory over Hitler's Germany.' The paper concluded that the allies had postponed the landings deliberately for two years after the original date in 1942 and preferred to 'snap off pieces of the Wehrmacht in Africa or peripheral areas'. It continued: 'The second front was opened just in time for the division of the spoils of war.' Russia has, perhaps, not changed that much since the collapse of communism. There were comments from elsewhere that might have jolted Anglo-Saxon celebrants had they read them. In Paris, Le Figaro wrote on Monday: 'Without De Gaulle, France would have been liberated by Anglo-Americans anyway . . . (but) Paris would not have been liberated by its people and the second armoured division.' It concluded that there was an historical lesson here: 'History is made by gambles, by appeals, by answers and silences, by will and inertia. Men . . . are not mere cogs, they are the players.' History is made by myths, too. Few in France, however, look back to the good old days of comradeship and patriotism. This week, there was instead a certain desire to wrap together the anniversary of D-Day and the European elections. As one paper in the Pyrenees put it, western Europe today is much better than other places, in spite of its faults. It added: 'The politics of the middle way, which has eliminated extremes and whose programmes resemble each other, is terribly lacking in conviction, as is shown daily by the pusillanimity of pro-European discourse in this electoral campaign.' Outside Britain, most people are quite glad that there are no Victoria Crosses being handed out and that the empires have disappeared. Few elsewhere lament that the political figures who led the invasion of Normandy last week are not the giants of 50 years ago. Others are more likely to be encouraged by the fact that Messrs Kohl and Yeltsin represent a substantial improvement on theirs. But without Adolf and Uncle Joe, Britain can hardly be expected to wake up. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World service.</p>

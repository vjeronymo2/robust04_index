			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: A Lame Agreement That Does Not </F> Guarantee Protection for the Hebron Inhabitants"]    [Text] The recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement on  Hebron's security is an impotent and lame agreement. It cannot  guarantee the protection of Hebron's inhabitants from settlers  or occupation troops. An international protection force that  does not have a deterrent weapon, even to defend itself, cannot  protect Palestinian citizens from settler terrorism and  occupation troop bullets.    The alleged Israeli withdrawal will be nothing more than a  redeployment of Israeli forces. They will still be able to  interfere and kill Arab citizens at any moment. It is  inconceivable that the international protection force will be  confined to only one of many occupied Palestinian cities and  that its inhabitants will be left subject to continued Israeli  attacks that are escalating in a flagrant brutal manner.    Wide popular and official Palestinian and Arab circles have  criticized the recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement. They  regarded it as a result of tough Israeli and U.S. pressure on  the Palestinian side. What draws our attention is the fact that  the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership has  not affected the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in  any way whatsoever, nor has it reduced escalating Israeli  campaigns of terrorism, repression, and killing of Arab  citizens. It has not limited mass arrest campaigns among the  sons of Palestine.    Numerous Palestinian martyrs and wounded Palestinians fall  every day at the hands of Israeli occupation authorities. The  Palestinian police will deploy in Gaza and Jericho this week,  according to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. This police  force will be linked to the occupation authorities and under  their supervision and orders. It is feared that this force will  become a tool of repression against the inhabitants of Gaza and  Jericho and strike at the glorious intifadah there. If this  occurs, the Palestinian people will have lost a strong  bargaining chip.    The Palestinian leadership's involvement in signing the  recent agreement with Israel only gave vent to a wave of  Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic wrath triggered by the massacre  at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. No doubt, Israel's  isolation of the Palestinian leadership in the absence of Arab  coordination has led to such tragic results.</p>

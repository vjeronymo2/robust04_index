			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (17): Tough challenge for team - Enfe state railway system Along with the state airline, one of the toughest challenges for Bolivia's capitalisation team will be Enfe, the aged state railway system. Resistance may also expected from the 4,000 workers still on the company payroll despite successive lay-offs of more than 3,000 employees over the past three years. The World Bank estimates that Dollars 27m will be required for post-capitalisation severance payments. Bolivian railways date from 1877 when construction started on the first Antofagasta stretch. The La Paz to Arica section was inaugurated in 1913 after settlement by treaty of the war between Bolivia and Chile. The eastern section, joining Santa Cruz to Santos in Brazil and Rosario in Argentina, dates from the 1940s and 1950s. The three sections have a total 3,466km of track. The national railway company Enfe was created in 1964 - at which time the company operated 102 steam locomotives. Only in 1976 was the switch made to diesel-electric engines. In the run-up to capitalisation, the fleet comprised 57 locomotives, only 34 of them operational. Of the 134 passenger carriages, less than two-thirds were serviceable, and last year Enfe carried only 750,000 passengers. Minerals transport has traditionally been Enfe's staple, accounting for some 40 per cent of the 1.4m tonnes of freight hauled last year. Enfe has made some attempt to move into the fast-expanding business of transporting soya. But much of its capacity is in the form of converted box cars - there are no hopper trucks - and soya producers complain bitterly about the quality of service. Wood, meanwhile, is hauled almost exclusively by road. If, as Bolivian government officials and many entrepreneurs believe, the 'interoceanic corridor' - from the Atlantic (Santos in Brazil) to the Pacific (Arica in Chile) - represents their country's trading future, the most immediate investment will have to be some Dollars 200m building the missing rail link between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Jica, the Japanese international agency, came up in 1991 with a master plan for upgrading the Bolivian railway system. It envisages investment of Dollars 1.46bn over 30 years and predicts an internal rate of return of 11 per cent. Building the missing Cochabamba-Santa Cruz link would be a priority, as would the extension of the eastern network to Puerto Busch, now projected as the principal outlet for Bolivian exports to the Atlantic via the Paraguay-Parana waterway. By late October, discussions were still in progress about whether to split Enfe into three for capitalisation or offer it as a complete package. Most international consultants have advised against including the track itself in the transfer: Enfe is unlikely to fetch its book price at capitalisation and retaining ownership of the track would explain away an otherwise unacceptably low offer. 'It's a politically sensitive issue,' admits Mr Edgar Saravia, capitalisation secretary. But he is adamant that the state will have no future role in running the capitalised business: the new operator would simply lease the track under concession and assume responsibility for its maintenance. Enfe's future shape will depend on the capitalisation team's decision. Smallish regional companies from neighbouring Chile, Argentina and Brazil could be interested if it is divided, while three US companies - Burlington Northern, Conrail and Pacific SouthWest - might be convinced to bid for the railway system as a whole.</p>

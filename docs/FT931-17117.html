			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Unified Budget timetable outlined MR STEPHEN Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, has moved to reassure MPs that the new unified Budget arrangements will not mean a reduction in parliamentary time for the finance bill, Alison Smith writes. In a letter to Mr Nick Brown, a Labour Treasury spokesman, Mr Dorrell says that this year's second Budget will be in early December. The finance bill will be published early the following January and will complete its passage through parliament by May 5. Labour is likely to be satisfied with the timetable which means that, as now, there will be just less than four months between the publication of the finance bill and its enactment.</p>

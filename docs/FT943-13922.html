			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Private View: The gentle touch in a tough business - Valerie Strachan, chairman of the board of Customs and Excise, says she has 'no difficulty' with the changes proposed for the civil service in this week's white paper After work, mandarins are supposed to go to Covent Garden for the opera or, at a pinch, the ballet. Valerie Strachan, the most senior woman in the British civil service, likes to go Scottish dancing. Times are changing at the summit of the Establishment, and will change again as a result of a white paper published this week. Strachan is a symptom of that change. The chairman of the board of Customs and Excise is a woman, but she is a woman who does not waste time pretending to be a man. Appearances, we all know, are deceptive. So encountering an eager, chatty, smiling and feminine Permanent Secretary, Grade One, I was immediately on my guard. Valerie Strachan is tall with a strong handsome face, wide mouth and innocent brown eyes. There is a look about her of those rangy female tennis players who used to bound about Wimbledon in the old days. Or one could imagine her as a painter and artist's model from the free-thinking, free-loving Bloomsbury Group. Whatever the comparison, she appears altogether too jolly, too nice, to be running a government department charged with hunting drug-dealers, pornographers and smugglers, let alone enforcing the collection of VAT. There was something girlishly naive about the way, at the end of the interview, she confessed to a love of Highland dancing. Or was the naivety just a little bit calculated? I asked her first if she had thought of feminising her title in order to reflect current fashion. She had thought about it, she said, and was committed to equal opportunities but had decided against. 'It's a traditional title and to have changed it would have been making a much louder statement than I wanted to make.' Her staff have been told to call her 'Valerie' or 'Mrs Strachan', according to how well they know her. By coincidence - if it is coincidence - the three top women in Whitehall all run law-enforcement agencies. The other two are Barbara Mills, Director of Public Prosecutions, and Stella Rimington, head of MI5, the domestic intelligence service. Did they talk to each other, as women? 'We do have chats about things,' she said. 'But it's sort of on the hoof, as it were . . . me saying to Stella as we go into permanent secretaries (the Wednesday morning meeting at the Cabinet Office): 'I know where you've got that jacket from; I must remember not to get the same one.' That sort of thing. Or talking a bit to Barbara about some equal opportunities issues.' Do the male permanent secretaries call you 'The Girls'? 'No.' She laughed scornfully. 'No, nor do we call them 'The Boys'. I don't think they see us a little tightly-knit group. Nor do we see ourselves as being a threatened minority. All of us have been around for a long time and know each other really quite well. So it's not an issue between us.' Does it not feel like a men's club? 'Mmm. Not particularly, no. There is a clubby atmosphere but it is the club of 20-however-many-it-is people, each of whom is at the top of an organisation, all of the organisations having something in common. It is not like the Reform Club or whatever I imagine other clubs might be like.' Clubmanship, public school and Oxbridge are no longer essential qualifications for the mandarinate. Strachan herself comes from Hull, went to the local girls' high school and to Manchester University, is married to another civil servant and has two children. She joined Customs and Excise straight from university (the Department of Education was her first choice) having little idea of what it did. ('I thought they were the people that chalked your bags when you came into the country.') She has spent time at the Home Office and Treasury. Some say that if any woman can make it to the very top as Cabinet Secretary and head of the home civil service, Valerie Strachan can. Customs and Excise is not a typical government department: it has its own matey atmosphere and has escaped a lot of the pain of civil service reform. But Strachan is, with qualifications, a promoter of the new business culture. When I suggested that her title, chairman of the board, might be getting uncomfortably close to the truth, she claimed that the white paper reinforced the traditional virtues of the British civil service. Is she a traditionalist or a young Turk? 'Am I allowed to be both? In my time I have been as young Turkish as anybody, including pushing the financial management initiative and being a supporter of the basic concepts of Next Steps. But I don't see there is a necessary conflict between that and between maintaining public service values.' It would be unsuitable to privatise VAT inspectors, for example. Traffic wardens had been, I said. Why not VAT inspectors? 'I think VAT inspectors are having to exercise discretion and judgment all the time, every day of their lives. I think it is quite important that they should be publicly accountable.' Was there nowhere where efficiency was being won at the expense of public service? 'I think you have trade-offs, but there are all sorts of trade-offs. In real life there are trade-offs between efficiency and collecting the last penny of revenue, between obligations to get off the back of small business and tax morality.' So you are not going to be put on either side of this debate? 'I would like, please, to have my cake and eat it.' Vatwoman's main worry at present is the Vatman's public image. Do you mean, I said, that the department is hated by business? 'That's not what I mean, no. What I mean is . . . You haven't mentioned the Citizens' Charter.' I don't want to mention it, I said. 'No, I daresay you don't' She sounded sympathetic. 'But we have got a lot of charter obligations. The tax man is never popular, the taxwoman is never popular and I don't expect them ever to be. But I have felt that we could usefully soften the image we present while not losing our effectiveness. We are law enforcers, but we can be friendly law enforcers.' Are you prepared to say the department has been heavy-handed in the past? She paused and sighed. 'No, that wouldn't be quite right.' Do you want to supply a better word? 'Let me think. Um. We have sometimes had a reputation for being heavy-handed. The reputation has been based on remarkably few instances. When we go out and actually ask people what they think of us and what they think of the service, people are on the whole pretty satisfied. What I am trying to do is not so much remove causes for complaint but be positively more helpful.' This week's white paper would put senior civil servants on personal contracts, with salaries set according to performance as judged by a company-style remuneration committee. They would no longer get a fixed rate according to seniority, and their jobs - some of them - would be open to outsiders. The head of customs said the proposed reforms only made explicit what was already implicit in the mandarin's terms of employment. She had 'no difficulty' with the changes, she said, but was very anxious that her and her staff's performance should not be judged in crude terms - say, by the amount of revenue the department brought in. Hoping to discover the steel behind those candid eyes, I said: You smile a lot. Or is it just today? 'No, I think I smile a lot. This may be, I have to say, a terrible character weakness.' She smiled. So people think 'She's a nice girl. We can swing this one past her.'? 'No, I don't think they think that. They have probably learned that if I think something ought to be done, then I will be quite persistent in making sure that it does get done. 'I like working with people, and working in a co-operative way. But at the end of the day, once I've heard everybody's views and formed a view about how we ought to go forward then I will be quite persistent.' Can you be a brute when required? 'I don't set out to be a brute. I set out to achieve the desired result, preferably while making people feel . . . You mean they don't feel it while you kick them? 'I really do try not to kick people,' she laughed, 'because I never think bruises are the best way of achieving results. I mean, there will be times when I run out of patience and people are aware of the fact.' Do you mind confrontation? 'No, I confront if I need to confront. But I prefer to operate without, you know, pinning somebody in a chair and saying 'You have done wrong.' 'I'm quite patient - most of the time.' She laughed again and reached for a homely example. 'Don't try me in the hairdresser's. I'm not patient there. One of the chief virtues of the man who dresses my hair at the moment is that he does it on time. I hate being kept waiting.' I struggled to regain a footing. The art of dissembling, I said, must be in the armoury of any top civil servant. 'I don't think that's the way I operate. I suppose I would lie if I had to for my country. But on the whole I try and negotiate straight.' (She led the negotiations on the European Union single market changes in VAT and excise duty collection, and is chairman of the world customs co-operation council.) 'I do try not to dissemble. I'm not sure I could keep it up for long enough.' She paused. 'I don't suppose I always show all my negotiating cards.' I'm sure you don't, I agreed. You probably play poker till late at night wearing a green eyeshade. 'No, no.' She laughed. 'I hate card games. It's a lovely picture, though, isn't it?' When, finally, I asked her if she had eyes on the pinnacle of the civil service, the Cabinet Office, she said she had not even begun to think about it. There were 'hordes' of people - well, several at least - who would be obvious candidates. But I got the strong feeling that Valerie Strachan would not be suffused with maidenly blushes if the job were offered to her. Meanwhile, it was time to pack up and get off to dancing class.</p>

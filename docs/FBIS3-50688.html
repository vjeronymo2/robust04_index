			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The latest message to the nation from the  president-in-exile is the object of comment, notably in  Parliament. The watch words "mobilization iron cuts iron" were  launched by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who maintains the hope of  returning.    Deputy Evans Beaubrun thinks that the president-in-exile  fluffed his entrance into the new year. The legislator  interprets President Aristide's statements as a sort of  convocation to civil war. He hopes that the population rejects  this proposal of indian wrestling, just as they reject a  solution of a clean sweep advocated by other sectors. The year  1994 is the year for compromise, according to Deputy  Beaubrun.[passage omitted]    Another legislator, close to the National Front For Change  and Democracy [FNCD], interprets differently the statements made  by the president on 1 January. Isaac Garcon, from FNCD, sees  the message as an encouragement to the people in order to keep  them mobilized in favor of democracy. [Passage omitted] Mayor  Evans Paul also reads differently the watch-words "iron cuts  iron": [Begin Paul recording in Creole] I do not know what the  president meant by "iron cuts iron," but I know, considering the  framework of democracy in the country, iron also could mean the  Constitution. Iron also could mean the law, respect for  democratic principles that we have always defended. I do not  want people to interpret the word iron as violence because the  president always speaks in images. For someone who always  respects principles, the law, the Constitution is iron.

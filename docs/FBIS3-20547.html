			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lin Yifu (2651 3015 1133) and Yang Jianping </F> (2799 1696 1627) from the State Council's Development Research  Center and the Office for Investigation and Research under the  CPC Central Committee's General Office: "Perfecting the Land  System, Developing the Land Market"]    [Text] A major problem in China's countryside today is the  zero or even negative growth of the rural people's income. Now,  the rural people's complaints about excessively heavy burdens  have become a serious matter seldom heard of in the past. It is  a direct reaction to the lack of growth in income. Lack of  growth in income has dampened the rural people's initiative,  shaken agriculture's position as the foundation of our national  economy, and aroused the concern of all quarters. This state of  affairs has prompted our country to dig into the root cause of  the problem.    Whether the rural people's income can grow steadily  depends on whether the mix of rural products and the proportions  of rural people engaged in different fields of work are kept  reasonable and are adjusted from time to time with the  development of the economy. Agricultural products, especially  grain, have a low Engel's coefficient. In the entire national  economy, the proportion of needs for agricultural products,  grain in particular, falls with the progress of economic  development. This means that, as the economy grows, the only way  to steadily increase the rural people's income is to adjust  their product mix and occupational makeup so as to turn out more  high-value-added products and have more people engaged in  non-agricultural production. The problem that in recent years  our grain production has increased but the rural people's income  has declined is exactly an inevitable result of our failure to  make the above adjustments in time.    In a market economy, the adjustments of the mix of  products and the proportions of people in different occupations  are automatic and quick. In China's rural areas, however, such  adjustments do not occur as a quick reaction to signs of changes  in the market condition. There are many reasons for this. One of  the chief reasons is that, following the implementation of the  land contract system, property rights are not clearly defined  and, accordingly, cannot be transferred smoothly from one person  to another. In other words, the imperfect land system and the  slow development of the land market are main obstacles to  improving our agricultural returns and raising the income of the  rural people.  <H3>  I. Accelerating Land Market Development Is an Urgent Task in  Rural Reform </H3>   A radical measure taken by our country for its rural  reform is the implementation of the output-related contract  responsibility system based on households. The prime  significance of this responsibility system lies in that it  changes the old land system and distribution system. The  tremendous achievements of our rural reform are universally  acknowledged, but no reform can give benefits forever. In recent  years, with the development of the rural economy, more and more  hidden shortcomings in our present land system have been brought  to light. While we have set the goal of building a socialist  market economy, these shortcomings are placing hurdles in our  way toward fostering a market economy in rural areas.    Since 1984, a variety of new problems have cropped up in  China's rural areas. The crux of the problems is the conflict  between the market mechanism pursued by the commodity economy  and the administrative interference relied upon by the planned  economy. From an objective viewpoint, the fast growth of  agricultural production and the rural people's income before  1984 was abnormal. It was due to an immense surge of the  farmers' productive enthusiasm, and hence a sudden eruption of  the rural productive force, triggered by the change in the  system. Such a fast growth had its limitations, and there is no  reason to expect it to persist. After 1985, agricultural  production and the rural people's income entered a stage of  regular growth -- a normal economic phenomenon. At a time in  this stage, the grain output did not go up. On the one hand,  this was inevitable when intra-agriculture adjustments were  under way. On the other hand, it reflected the spontaneous need  of farm households to act in accordance with the law of value  after they had become the main elements in rural economic  operations. With the decontrol of the markets for certain farm  products and the rapid development of non-agricultural  undertakings in rural areas, farmers, who could work on their  own, would inevitably choose to produce those farm and sideline  products that were relatively high-priced and had a high added  value or would go to work in township enterprises or do their  own businesses. That is to say, the market mechanism lured the  rural people to spur the adjustment of the agricultural  structure. It was due to this adjustment that the rural  per-capita income increased rather quickly between 1984 and  1988. Unfortunately, we did not take advantage of that situation  by using the market mechanism to adjust our supply and demand,  allocate our resources, and guide our production. Instead, we  judged the whole situation by the ups and downs in grain output.  This led to the reinstatement after 1989 of a series of  traditional measures to artificially adjust our agricultural  structure, such as strengthening control over the agricultural  production and input plans, increasing subsidies to farmers for  purchase of means of agricultural production, and raising the  government's grain procurement prices. At the same time, we  restricted the flow of the agricultural labor force to urban  areas and non-agricultural sectors, and controlled the  production of farm products not included in the unified  distribution plan in an effort to ensure a higher grain output.  In so doing, we have forced our labor, land, and financial  resources to go from the lucrative undertakings and products  back to less profitable grain production. The results: On the  one hand, our grain production no longer remains unchanged, but  hit one record high after another. On the other hand, however,  our gross agricultural output has not increased as noticeably as  we expected, while the farmers' income has declined remarkably  and the government's burden caused by subsidies has become  heavier and heavier. What is more, the government's heavy burden  has only invited the farmers' complaints about their declining  income. This fully bears out the fact that the traditional  policies and measures can no longer meet the needs of the new  rural situation, and we must have a new mindset and seek a new  way to solve the issue of agricultural development. The new  mindset and new way is to deepen our rural reform by fostering  the market so that the market mechanism, under the government's  macro-guidance, will play a real fundamental role in the  allocation of agricultural resources.    There are two tasks in fostering the rural market: One is  to foster a product market. Here the main task is to do away  with the unified and fixed-quota purchase system and to  facilitate direct contact between producers and consumers so  that the rural people can manage production in accordance with  changes in social demands. The other task is to foster a  production-element market. The principal work is to establish a  mechanism for the free flow and optimum allocation of such  production elements as labor, funds, and land. An active  production-element market is a prerequisite for timely  adjustments of the production structure in line with market  demands. Only when production elements are exchanged and  transferred freely between farm households and are combined in  an optimum way based on their relative advantages, is it  possible to adjust the rural production structure and  occupational makeup in line with economic development.    Now, the governments at all levels have done a great deal  of work toward building the product market. Contracted purchase  is very popular, the grain price has been by and large  liberalized, and pace is being quickened to foster the product  market. In contrast, the development of the product-element  market is comparatively slow. Now, in our rural areas, a number  of limitations still exist on the flow of the labor force. The  financial market is small and chaotic. In particular, due to  delay in the formation of a rural land market, the household  contract responsibility system has become an objective factor  restricting the development, exploitation, and transfer of our  land resources. Because of this, quickly fostering a land market  should be a breakthrough point in our next move to deepen the  rural reform.    Now, in our rural areas, the productive force is still at  a low level, and nothing other than land can provide so many job  opportunities for the people. Under such circumstances, land not  only has the function of developing production, but also plays a  social security role; that is, it has a welfare nature. For this  reason, when the output-related household contract  responsibility system was first introduced, land was allocated  according to the number of household members. This was  objectively necessary. Nevertheless, since land is one of the  most fundamental elements of production, without a land market  to invigorate it, the mobility of other production elements will  be greatly hampered. So, even though fostering the land market  is the most thorny task, we must do it in order to pave the way  for an all-round and in-depth rural reform.  <H3>  II. The Present State and Problems of the Land Ownership  System </H3>   The household contract responsibility system was quickly  popularized in the tide of rural reform with the main goal of  correcting the over-centralized control and the separation of  labor and means of production inherent in the old system. It was  correctly oriented and did tackle the vital points of the  problems. However, practical experience over the past few years  has revealed the following drawbacks of this land system:    With regard to the land use rights, there are three major  problems: First, the instability of land contract periods has  affected farmers' investment expectations. To avert the negative  effect of short contract periods on farmers' investment zeal,  the CPC Central Committee clearly stated in its No. 1 Document  of 1984 that the term of a land contract is 15 years, and it  cannot be changed. This did set farmers' minds "at ease."  However, the statement that the term of the contract is so many  years and is unchangeable or it can be extended implies, in  itself, that after this number of years, eventually it may be  changed. This means that the output-related contract  responsibility system is still an expedient measure and cannot  help stabilize farmers' long-term investment expectations. As  farmers dare not provide too much input into the land, the  reserve productive capacity of the land tends to diminish,  resulting in the deterioration of production conditions. It is  quite likely that with the approach of the termination of their  15-year contracts, farmers will all the more aim at short-term  profits rather than long-term benefits in using the land.  Secondly, the frequent readjustments of the contract  responsibility land has led to numerous land-border disputes.  The land distribution system based on household members has, in  itself, the problem of frequent readjustments to cope with the  change in the household size. The longer the time, the more such  changes will occur and the more frequently the land has to be  readjusted. A survey reveals that all rural areas have made  remarkably more readjustments of their contracted land since  1985, and that an almost complete reshuffle has taken place in  land distribution in a span of four or five years. The principle  of "overall stability, minor readjustments" established by the  central authorities has been invoked by grassroots units as a  basis to readjust their contract policies. The primary goal of  such readjustment is to solve the land problem for the increased  population. However, too frequent readjustments have added to  the fragmentation of the already-divided contracted land and  created a number of land-border disputes. This is another factor  affecting farmers' investment in the contracted land. Thirdly,  the fact that collectives such as township and village  enterprises can use land without giving compensation has  resulted in a waste of land resources. With the concept of the  collective ownership of land, when setting up a new enterprise,  a village collective may use, without paying anything, the land  designated for contracting to farmers. Township enterprises may  use contracted land freely or by paying a nominal fee as  compensation. In many localities, when a township or village  enterprise wants to take over a piece of land already contracted  to a household, all it needs to do is to hire the main laborers  of that household as its employees, and there is no further  obligation. According to a survey of 280 villages conducted by a  department concerned, under the condition that no state tax was  levied on transactions involving the change of farmland into  non-farmland, the compensation on 56.8 percent of the  village-requisitioned land was less than 10 years' land rental,  and the annual interest on the per-mu compensatory fee was below  the bank's interest on savings deposits. The losses to the  farmers were grave. The result of little or no compensation for  land taken from farmers is that township and village enterprises  have indiscriminately taken up large tracts of farmland, thus  seizing resources from the hands of farmers and wasting the  already-scanty arable land. However, because we have not formed  a land market, land is apt to be viewed as a no-price resource,  and even if we want to give it a reasonable price, it is hard to  do so.    Two main problems exist with regard to land revenue: One  is that various "covert taxes," levies, and income retentions  have affected farmers' revenue from the contracted land and led  to unequal financial burdens. After the land contract system was  put into effect, no improvement has been made on the complicated  and ambiguous land tax system formed at the time when all  purchases and sales were monopolized by the state and when the  people's communes still existed. Now, farmers are the main  producers. They hope to see a simple and clear-cut land tax  system. In their words, what they want is that "after paying  enough to the state and giving enough for collective retention,  all that remains is ours." Yet the current land tax system  actually consists of two kinds of taxes--an overt tax (collected  by the state) and a covert tax. The latter can be further  divided into a hidden tax, which is actually the fixed-quota  purchase of farm products by the state, and a concealed tax,  which is the extra financial burden shifted onto farmers (in the  form of various levies and income retentions). The covert tax is  a highly flexible and arbitrary burden and often damages the  interests of farmers. For this reason, it often induces farmers'  complaints and resistance, and directly dampens their enthusiasm  about agricultural production. Now, many localities have adopted  a "two-land system" which divides land into contract  responsibility land and food-grain land. They use the contract  responsibility land to guarantee the land tax revenue, but in  doing this, they concentrate and aggravate the tax burden on one  part of the land. The policy of using industry to subsidize  agriculture is aimed at offsetting part of the hidden costs of  farming. But, because different localities may give different  subsidies to agriculture, this policy can add to the inequality  in the distribution of burden. In fact, the principle of  fairness, targeted by the equal distribution of land, has often  been marred by the unequal land tax burden. The other problem is  the unfair distribution of revenue from the increase in land  value. This has directly affected farmers' interests. With the  expanding scale of urban construction and the rapidly increasing  numbers of large-area development zones, large tracts of  farmland have been diverted to non-agricultural purposes. Now, a  lot of farmland is being transformed into industrial and urban  land. This is actually a shift of the primary industry's capital  to the secondary and tertiary industries. Inevitably, such a  shift will raise the value of land to a considerable extent. In  our rural areas, land belongs to collectives, while farmers are  members of the collectives and they get a share in the  distribution of collective revenue on the basis of the land they  are farming. For this reason, any revenue from the increase in  land value should be reasonably distributed among the  collectives, the farmers giving out the land, and the new land  users. Nonetheless, the fact is that without a land market and  effective government control and guidance, it is hard to decided  on a reasonable land price, and it has become a common  phenomenon that land is transferred at too low a price. What is  more, a large amount of revenue from the increase in land value  is enjoyed by new land users or small groups, while very little  goes to collectives and farmers. In 1984, with the surging of  township enterprises, there appeared a tide in using farmland  for non-agriculture projects. At that time, a large part of the  extra profit created by rural industries through the use of  farmland was retained in the rural community either for use in  subsidizing agriculture or for public welfare purposes. Now, a  new tide of this nature is coming into being. Although industry  and real estate business have created large amounts of extra  profits from land, including revenue from the increase in land  value, basically these profits do not benefit farmers at all.  According to surveys in Guangdong, Hebei, and other localities,  fees paid to farmers as compensation for use of their land, for  making up for their loss of crops, and for subsidizing their  resettlement expenses total only 2,000-20,000 yuan per mu,  whereas land that has "roads, running water, and electricity and  has been leveled" generally sells for 200,000-300,000 yuan per  mu. Such a high revenue from the added land value is almost  entirely enjoyed by the government departments or the real  estate companies concerned. This has brought about a situation  where government power is used to exploit the rural collective  property. Such a situation has drawn farmers' complaints and  often led to their conflicts with the government department or  the real estate company.    On the land-disposal right, the chief problem is the  various subjective and objective restrictions on the  subcontracting and transfer of land. These restrictions have  three negative effects: In the first place, they affect the  development of non-agricultural undertakings. To those farmers  who wish to switch to industrial or commercial jobs, their  contract responsibility land is a big hurdle because after they  have given up farming, in most cases they still have to pay tax  on the land and may even be fined for leaving the land idle.  Further, because of the land's social security function and  their inability to exchange the land for anything valuable, they  can hardly come to a determination to leave the land. Secondly,  these restrictions affect the development of land operations of  scale. Appropriate-scale land operations is one of the  significant measures to raise agricultural productivity, while  the subcontracting and transfer of contracted land is a  necessary condition for such operations. Now, on the one hand,  in some rural areas there is no lack of high-caliber farmers,  but due to the insufficient land contracted to them, their  productive capability cannot be fully utilized. On the other  hand, some farm households, for one reason or another, are  unwilling to do farming with the result that large tracts of  contract responsibility land are lying idle. Thirdly, the  above-mentioned restrictions hinder the development of the rural  financial market. With the continued change in the rural  production structure and occupational makeup, rural people have  an ever-increasing need for long-term loans from banks or other  financial institutions so as to invest in new production  projects. International experience and lessons show that  long-term loans for agricultural production are possible only  when there is an appropriate mortgage. The mortgage should not  be subject to depreciation and should be immovable and  invulnerable to damage. From this perspective, the land-using  right is the most appropriate thing that rural people can use as  mortgage. Failure to liberalize the land disposal right is bound  to hinder the development of the rural financial market, thereby  obstructing the readjustment and optimization of the rural  production structure.  <H3>  III. Enact and Perfect Relevant Laws and Regulations To  Speed Up Land Market Development </H3>   A sound land system should meet at least two requirements:  One, a clear-cut property right; two, a self-adjusting and  self-changing mechanism. The essence of building a land market  is to set up and make perfect a system for the selling and  reselling of the land-using right during the land contract  period and to put this system within the framework of laws and  regulations after we have clearly distinguished the land  ownership from the land-using right.    In fact, whether our attitude toward fostering the land  market is active or not, farmers have already acted in this  direction, driven by their market-oriented initiative. In those  areas where the economy is relatively developed and more new job  opportunities exist, there are considerable instances of  subcontracting the land or asking others to farm the land,  either openly or secretly. Meanwhile, some local governments  have implemented more active policies to protect farmers'  interests in line with the development of the situation. In  certain localities, the land contract period has been extended  to 20-50 years--in Hainan Province, the contract period is as  long as 70 years. In other localities, farmers who no longer  want to farm their contracted land are allowed to subcontract or  transfer their land-using rights to others as long as this does  not affect the agricultural tax, the villages' income retention,  and the fulfillment of the local farm labor plan. As an  alternative, they may return their contracted land to the  collective, which will give it to new contractors. Still other  localities have adopted a "two-land system," which divides land  into "food-grain land" and "contract responsibility land." The  basic goal is to liberalize the transfer of the contract  responsibility land while maintaining a stable guarantee for the  people's food requirements. Now, it is rather common that land  owned by rural collectives finds new applications or enters the  market. This is especially noticeable in coastal developed areas  and in the suburbs of inland cities. In most cases, this  phenomenon finds expression in the utilization of land as a form  of capital for industrial or real estate ventures, including  joint and cooperative projects. At the same time, however, the  practice of using various pretexts to indiscriminately divert  farmland to other purposes is becoming an increasingly serious  problem. Now, the farmland used for building development zones  alone has exceeded 200 million mu. In the absence of a proper  land market rule, this practice is causing more and more losses  to the state, collectives, and farmers. This state of affairs,  coupled with the problem of farmers leaving large tracts of  farmland idle, indicates from another perspective the necessity  and urgency of building a land market and making it perfect as  soon as possible.    After introducing the small peasant-owner land system to  replace the feudal land system and with the development of  productive forces and the increase in employment opportunities,  Japan, Korea, and some West European countries have all  traversed a course from restricting to encouraging the transfer  of land and finally to the development of appropriate-scale  family farms. This shows that building the land market is a  matter common to all countries.    In view of the land's dual function of production  development and social security, we should comply with three  principles, namely, efficiency, development, and fairness, in  fostering our rural land market. The efficiency principle means  that we should do our best to achieve the most rational and  efficient use of land so that our limited land resources will  give us more benefits. Through the transfer of the land-using  right and with the adjustment by the market force, we may  develop appropriate-scale operations to raise our agricultural  productivity. By the development principle, we mean that through  the subcontracting and transfer of the land-using right, we  should adjust and optimize the product mix and occupational  makeup and develop non-agricultural production in the  countryside as a way to spur the development of the entire rural  economy. The fair principle means that in the course of transfer  of the land-using right, we should ensure that farmers leaving  their land will not be deprived of security for livelihood, and  those transferring their land-using right to others will not  lose the benefit from the increase in land value to which they  are entitled. We should acknowledge the fact that the rural  people are the natural beneficiaries of the collective-owned  land. We should also give due recognition to the investment they  put into the land during their contract period. This way, we  will not only maintain social stability in rural areas, but also  ensure equitable competition on the land market.    Now, we may start with the following five measures to  foster the land market:    First of all, it is necessary to make clear that the  output-related household contract responsibility system is a  basic system, which will remain stable and unchanged for a long  time to come. Practical experience shows that this contract  responsibility system is a way of production suited to the  current level of our rural productive forces. It must be taken  as a foothold to proceed to the next stage of our rural reform.  If the farmers do not request a change, the state should respect  their choice and should not use administrative measures to  impose any other rural cooperative system upon them. Now that  the 15-year contract period, as stipulated in the CPC Central  Committee's document, is running out, it is imperative to  announce as soon as possible that the output-related contract  system will remain unchanged and the farmers can continue to use  the land for a long time to come. It would be best if something  could be done to assure them that the land they are using "would  not change whether there are births or deaths in their  families." Only by deepening the reform toward improving the  contract responsibility system and by clearly defining the  relationship of land ownership versus the land-using right, can  we avoid going astray in improving our land system.    Secondly, we should, by means of law, clearly define  and protect the integrity of the rights to the use, revenue, and  disposal of land. The integrity of these three rights means  the integrity of the farmers' rights and interests under the  contract responsibility system. It is also a fundamental  condition for pushing land to the marketplace. The various acts  at present infringing upon farmers' rights related to land  operations can only be checked by a clear-cut land law. Since  1984, we have encouraged the buying and selling of the contract  responsibility land but without noticeable success. One of the  reasons is that we have not clearly specified the land-using  right. Once we have a clear-cut land administrative law, we  should issue land-using right certificates so as to give a legal  protection to the output-related household contract  responsibility system.    Thirdly, we should establish a system allowing  land-using right certificates to be used as mortgage so as to  facilitate the transfer of such right in rural areas. When  the land-using right can be transferred in association with the  use of certificates for the land-using right as mortgage and  when the land-using right can be mortgaged through the transfer  of such certificates, transfer of contracted land will be a very  simple process. Once certificates for the land-using right can  be transferred, it is possible to increase the average scale of  land-related operations and raise the efficiency of land  utilization. Mortgaging these certificates for loans will  quicken the development of the financial market and the  readjustment of the production structure in rural areas. Of  course, specific requirements on such certificates should be  established so as to facilitate the transfer of the land-using  right and prevent farmers from using land as a value-guaranteed  saving rather than a production element they should earnestly  work with.    Fourthly, we should accelerate the formulation of  laws and regulations on the land market so as to set a standard  for its normal development. To meet the obvious needs and  comply with the principle of land market development, we should  work out as soon as possible a perfect legal system for the  management and operation of the land market and check those acts  that hurt the interests of the state and farmers in the lease or  sales of the land-using right. The most urgent task at present  is to levy a value-added tax on land at a progressive rate so  that benefits from the increase in land value--as reflected in  differential land rentals--will not go enormously to a few units  and individuals. By doing so, we can put the inappropriate "real  estate craze" to an end.    Fifthly, it is imperative to reform the land tax  system so as to combine the overt and covert taxes into one  tax. Now, our country's actual revenue from agriculture is  gradually declining with the abolishment of the state monopoly  system for the purchase and sales of agricultural products. The  diversified rural economic activities, in particular the  operations conducted by farm households, require socialized  services provided by the government and other related  organizations. This requires that townships and villages have a  stable revenue. After the reform of the agricultural products  procurement system, the covert tax should be turned into overt  tax, and all kinds of expense apportionment and the special  products tax should be abolished. Instead, a unified land tax  system should be put into practice.    In coordination with the land tax reform, efforts should  be made to improve the rural social security system so as to  reduce the impact of market competition on farmers.    Though the above-mentioned tasks are interrelated, some of  them can be started earlier than the others. However, we must  have a proper overall plan for these tasks in order to ensure  the integrity, orderliness, and equality of our land market.    Moreover, the silent emergence of the land market in our  rural areas is a fact that we must acknowledge. This is a worthy  attempt to better use land so as to achieve a higher marginal  productivity. It is also a significant way to raise the rural  people's income through the readjustment of their production and  occupational structure. The government should act in accordance  with this trend to speed up the development and improvement of  the land market. This is a vital part of the current work in  building a socialist rural market economy as well as an  effective way to break through the predicament of no growth in  the rural people's income.</p>

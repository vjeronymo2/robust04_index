			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 June, the government decided on a package of  measures to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons. Under the package of measures,  1) Japan will strongly urge North Korea to cooperate fully with  nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) to clear up suspicions about its development of nuclear  weapons; 2) Japan will study steps it must take in response to  economic sanctions if the UN Security Council votes to impose  them, while watching how the UN Security Council handles the  DPRK nuclear issue; 3) If the UN Security Council decides to  take appropriate measures including economic sanctions to force  North Korea to change its behavior, Japan would support the  measures and take the maximum steps possible within the  framework of the Constitution; and 4) As a member of the  international community, Japan will make maximum diplomatic  efforts to urge China to exert influence on the DPRK while  maintaining international cooperation.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will visit South Korea on 11  June to affirm with his South Korean counterpart that both Japan  and South Korea will work together cooperatively to settle the  DPRK nuclear issue. His visit to China on 12 June is being  coordinated by the two countries, and he intends to seek the  Chinese Government's understanding for the four-point measures  if his visit to that country is realized.</p>

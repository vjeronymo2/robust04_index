			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Kinkel Expresses Understanding for </F> Poland"]    [Text] Bonn, 9 Jan -- Foreign Minister Kinkel has met  Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski in Berlin to discuss Warsaw's  wish to join NATO. Kinkel expressed understanding for Poland's  calls for clear-cut prospects regarding NATO membership. Germany  sees itself as an advocate acting on behalf of the reformist  states of Central and East Europe. Kinkel said Poland's  admission to the alliance could be the result of an  "evolutionary process" first of all, but at the NATO conference,  Germany would urge that an unmistakable sign be given "that the  alliance is essentially open to new members." Chancellor Kohl  has said NATO's offer of Partnership for Peace should not just  amount to a diplomatic formula, but must contain "a clear-cut  statement of future prospects for admission to NATO." It is  also being said in Bonn that Kohl is counting on bringing the  Central European states Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic  into European Union structures. Even if they are not full EU  members, Kohl is evidently thinking about involving those  countries in European political cooperation with their status to  be established at some later date.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Alive but ailing: Nato is not the solution to the future security needs of Europe In theory this week's Nato summit in Brussels has breathed new life into the organisation. In fact, the European allies have now been given notice that the US does not intend, either in Nato or in any other way, to take any significant leadership responsibility which would get it bogged down in Europe's new security uncertainties. One senior European defence analyst put it bluntly: 'Nato is dead. The corpse is twitching, but there is no life in it.' Such a harsh judgment seems at odds with what has happened this week in Brussels. First, in the cause of stability and closer relations with former members of the Soviet bloc, the alliance leaders have offered them 'partnerships for peace', involving military co-operation now, together with the possibility of Nato membership at some unspecified date in the future. Second, Nato has set up new 'combined joint task forces' into Nato's military structures, which should give the European member states more weight in the alliance, and make it easier for them to tackle Yugoslav-type conflicts. Third, Mr Clinton has reaffirmed a commitment to Europe's safety, and promised to keep about 100,000 US troops on the Continent. These apparently constructive moves conceal an exercise in fudge and deception. The east Europeans do not want 'partnerships for peace'; they want full membership of Nato and the security guarantees that go with it. They fear Russia still threatens their security, and their fears have zoomed since last month's Russian elections and the extraordinary showing of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Americans have ruled out full membership for the east Europeans, ostensibly because they do not want to aggravate the unstable political situation in Russia. Moscow has made clear that it would consider the enlargement of Nato a hostile act, virtually amounting to a revival of the cold war; and the US claims that the west must avoid any move which would play into the hands of the ultra-nationalists in Russia. As President Bill Clinton put it in a speech on his arrival in Brussels on Sunday: 'We cannot afford . . . to draw a new line between east and west that could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of confrontation.' This sounds statesmanlike. What it means in plain English is that Washington has decided that Russia not only takes priority over eastern Europe, but that it has an effective veto over US links with eastern Europe. From the leader of the western world, this is hardly bold, considering that the prospects for democracy and market reform are moderately good in eastern Europe and getting better, but dire in Russia and rapidly getting worse. The fact is that there is no way that any rational US Senate will agree to give eastern Europe an American security guarantee, at a time when the US is fast running down its forces in western Europe. For Mr Clinton to guarantee 100,000 troops in western Europe sounds good; but it is nothing like good enough if the troops are meant to back up an additional nuclear guarantee to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic if Russia is even potentially expansionist. And the more the east Europeans need such a guarantee, the less their chance of getting it. The east Europeans have cavilled at the 'partnership' proposal as a second best, but they have obviously got the real message. The Americans imply airily that Nato may one day be enlarged, depending on how the east Europeans respond to the 'partnership' plan: if they get lots of practice at joint military exercises, they will have earned their Nato stripes. This is hooey. The essential condition for Nato enlargement is that Russia must first establish a record as a peaceful and stable market democracy. At that point, anybody can join Nato, because it will no longer matter whether the organisation is wound up, or converted instead into a knitting circle. Amid so much hypocrisy, there was one nugget of truth-telling which crept into Mr Clinton's Sunday speech: 'We must build a new security for Europe. The old security was based on the defence of our bloc against another bloc. The new security must be found in Europe's integration - an integration of security forces, of market economies, of national democracies . . .' There you have the new US policy in a nutshell. Not merely is Yugoslavia Europe's problem, but so, too, is the security of eastern Europe; and it all depends on Europe's integration. Traditional UK Atlanticists, who would much rather believe in Nato than in Europe, must have a sad premonition that the US is about to betray them. They may even see, through the fog of the special relationship, that the plan for 'combined joint task forces' is really an advance warning that America plans to tip-toe out of Nato's back door, leaving the European allies to hold the baby of European security. Unfortunately for the Atlanticists, Nato cannot escape the limitations of a defensive military alliance: it can only deal with enemies; it can only mobilise integrated forces; it has no majority voting; it cannot engage in multi-dimensional, pre-emptive diplomacy. Nato membership for Poland and Hungary is not available; they need membership of the European Union. The EU does not now have a credible security policy. But it is a flexible, multi-policy group with majority voting; and if it were to extend to the frontiers of Russia, a majority of its members would insist on an effective security policy. Nato may not be dead but it isn't the solution to Europe's future security.</p>

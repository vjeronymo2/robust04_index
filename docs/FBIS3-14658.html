			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 23 March  issue of Cairo AL-NUR summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  NOTE ON AL-NUR'S PUBLICATION, FORMAT: </H5>   The current editorial report describes the contents of the  23  March 1994 issue of AL-NUR, the first issue of this publication  received by Nicosia Bureau since January 1994.    The last issue received of AL-NUR, which has the serial  number 599, does not give a day of publication, only naming the  month of publication as January. The current issue, with serial  number 600, is presumably consecutive to the January issue. In  an inscription added to the front page's top right-hand square  carrying the paper's title, the paper describes itself as an  "Islamic Weekly," which did not appear in earlier issues in the  Bureau's files. The paper does not give a reason for the hiatus  in its publication.    The current issue displays no notable change in AL-NUR's  format. The front page caption still cites al-Hamzah Di'bis as  chairman of the board and 'Ali Faruq as chief editor. The paper  is still "issued by the Liberal Party," but the caption fails to  display the information that Mustafa Kamil Murad is the "party  leader," as it did in the previous editions on file here.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Television programs denounced    2. Al-Azhar Schools Close Down    3. Red Cross Publication Praised    4. Muslim Figures Interviewed    5. Co-ed Colleges Denounced    6. Extremist Disavows AL-AKHBAR Interview  <H5>  TELEVISION PROGRAMS DENOUNCED </H5>   An 800-word commentary by "AL-NUR's political editor"  appears  on page 1 under a triple headline: "Television Assails Islam and  Its Tenets Under the Pretext of Fighting Terror; What Shall We  Tell Our Children About the Television's Edict Banning Cucumber  and Zucchini? The Solution in the Television's Opinion is That  an Unveiled Girl Should Lead the Muslims Into the Desert."    The political editor begins his commentary by lauding the  Islamic propensities of slain President Anwar al-Sadat and  denouncing what he sees as the secular policies of the current  government. He writes:    "The late President Anwar al-Sadat, God bless his soul,  struck at communism, expelled Russian experts from Egypt, and  issued presidential decrees liquidating the Vanguard  Organization of the Arab Socialist Party, the Youth  Organization. Having led the nation to victory in the  October/Ramadan [1973] war, he restored freedoms and the  multi-party system and began to Islamize the laws, a goal that  he entrusted to al-Azhar professors, law experts, and members of  the judiciary. Meanwhile, communists and members of the defunct  Vanguard and Youth Organizations lurked in the dark. No sooner  had al-Sadat passed on then those communists and Vanguard and  Youth Organization officials returned to office with only one  object in mind: killing al-Sadat's memory and accomplishments  every living day."    The editor then expands on television dramas that, he  claims,  "poke fun at Islam" by ridiculing religion among youth and the  Islamic dress code.  <H5>  AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS CLOSE DOWN: </H5>   A 600-word report on page 1 by Safwat al-Sandafawi cites  Shaykh Muhammad Bashir 'Abd-al-'Al, director general of al-Azhar  institutions, as saying that "1,500 al-Azhar institutions have  been closed down due to a lack of funds needed to rehabilitate  the school buildings that cracked in last year's earthquake."  Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Al says that 294 million pounds [approximately  $80 million] are needed to put the schools back in working  order. Al-Azhar has petitioned the government for these funds,  but "the government did not oblige," the al-Azhar official says.  <H5>  RED CROSS PUBLICATION PRAISED </H5>   Chairman of the Board al-Hamzah Di'bis writes a 1,500-word  editorial on the front page entitled, "International Committee  of the Red Cross Applauds Islam's Global Rules of War and  Peace." Di'bis says that Liberal Party leader Mustafa Kamil  Murad gave him a Red Cross publication called, "From the Records  of Arab Islamic History." He then reviews this publication,  commending its favorable view of Islamic traditions.   <H5>    MUSLIM FIGURES INTERVIEWED </H5>   On page 2, the paper carries interviews with Chief Bosnian  Ulema Shaykh Mustafa Ibrahim and a U.S. physician, Barbara  Klein, who converted to Islam. The Bosnian official deplores  the attacks on Muslims in his country and says that there is "an  orchestrated policy to eradicate Islam from Europe." Dr. Klein  praises her adopted faith and denounces U.S. support for Israel.  <H5>  CO-ED COLLEGES DENOUNCED </H5>   A 3,500-word report by Sayyid Farghal appears on page 3. He  interviews a dozen students from various universities, all of  whom believe that mixed education is both unnecessary and  unethical and that all-male and all-female colleges are morally  commendable and educationally superior to co-ed universities.    "Distinguished Islamic scholar" Dr. 'Abd-al-Rashid Saqr,  "Islamic scholar" Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah; Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-'Adawi, Professor of religious studies at al-Azhar  University; Dr. Majdi Hasan, professor of Civil Law at 'Ayn  Shams University; Dr. Muhammad Farahat, professor of shari'ah at  'Ayn Shams University; and 'Uthman Muhammad 'Uthman, an  education expert, concur with this view.    Farghal's interviews include no co-ed supporters.  <H5>  EXTREMIST DISAVOWS AL-AKHBAR INTERVIEW </H5>   Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi writes a 2,000-word "Rebuttal of  Sabir Shawkat" on page 5. Al-Samawi, a one-time friend of  Shawqi al-Shaykh and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, co-founders of  al-Shawqiyun group, is rumored to have issued the license  [al-istihlal] edict by which Muslim extremists are encouraged to  steal from infidels, i.e., anyone that is not an extremist.    Al-Samawi had been interviewed by an AL-AKHBAR journalist  named Sabir Shawkat who published an account of that interview  in AL-AKHBAR's issue at the beginning of Sha'ban [around 12  January], which al-Samawi vehemently disavows.    For example, Shawkat wrote that he "faced al-Samawi with the  details of his crimes against Egypt and the youths whom he sent  into the dark tunnels of extremism." Al-Samawi says "he did not  face me with one crime."    Al-Samawi writes: "What crime have I committed against Egypt  and its youth? Is it that I urged youth to stick to Islam and  be proud of it? Is it that I made them turn to God and attend  prayers? Is it that I made them desert the disreputable haunts  and head to the places of worship? Or, is it that I made them  follow the path of God and pray for his blessing?" He adds: "I  have been imprisoned for 12 years without being indicted,  without a court ruling, and without doing any wrong or  committing any crime."    Al-Samawi says: "The AL-AKHBAR journalist has cited me as  saying, `I do not deny that I am the first who called for amirs  to lead the Islamic groups in Egypt, 20 years ago, and the first  who formed religious groups since the Muslim brotherhood, but  now I call for paradise.' I ask you, journalist, is this what I  said or what you invented?"    Al-Samawi adds: "The journalist wrote, `concerning the  extremist ideas that he [al-Samawi] inculcated into thousands of  youth, he [al-Samawi] said: I have never sanctioned license  [al-istihlal].'"    Ridiculing Shawkat, al-Samawi writes: "If I have not passed  the license edict, then what brand of extremism have I  inculcated into the minds of thousands? Or is it that I am  accused of having spread moderation through failure to pass that  edict?"    Al-Samawi denies having told Shawkat that "al-Shawqiyun and  other groups have sanctioned the practice of license." He also  denies having said that he "indoctrinated thousands of youth who  then deserted me and joined other groups where they became a  fuel for terror, and I am opposed to their terrorist operations."    Al-Samawi continues his defiant rebuttal of Shawkat's  account  of the interview, but refrains from expressing his opinion on  terrorism or giving any clear statement on his current political  position.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WATER SHORTAGE  </P> <P> With the growing water shortage in California, specifically Southern  California, I am concerned about a procedure that takes place in the restaurant  industry.  </P> <P> I work at a chain restaurant where, at the end of each night, while cleaning up  the kitchen and dining area, we are to melt down the remaining ice with hot  water.  </P> <P> This same procedure was used at my previous job. Is this done for health  reasons? Couldn't the ice be used to water plants inside and around the grounds  of the restaurant?  </P> <P> Each night at closing I think of the water rationing that is taking place in  parts of California, and I feel that some action should be taken to stop the  restaurants from the tremendous waste that occurs.  </P> <P> E.

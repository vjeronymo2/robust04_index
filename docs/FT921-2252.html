			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Tatars challenge Yeltsin doctrine: Russian Federation's nationalist enclaves watch breakaway vote VOTERS in Tatarstan, a small autonomous republic east of Moscow, will tomorrow determine the fate of President Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation with a referendum on whether to break away from it. More than four centuries after Ivan the Terrible set fire to Kazan and destroyed the last independent Tatar state, an expected 'yes' vote could trigger the collapse of Russia by setting a precedent for the other 19 semi-independent enclaves within the Federation. Russia's constitutional court ruled earlier this week that the Tatar referendum was illegal and Mr Yeltsin yesterday appealed to Tatar officials to halt the vote. Supporters of President Yeltsin also fear that if seen to allow the disintegration of Russia, the man who once invited autonomous republics to 'take as much sovereignty as you can' could be overthrown and the whole course of Russian reform reversed. Conversely, any attempt to use force will only provoke a violent reaction from Tatars, and jeopardise the fragile stability needed to pursue economic change in Russia. Tatarstan's once staunchly communist leadership, which embraced last August's coup but then turned nationalist to stay in power, denies that the poll amounts to a vote on independence. The referendum asks whether Tatarstan should be 'a sovereign state, a subject of international law, which builds its relations with the Russian Federation . . . on an equal basis'. Both the Russian government and the local opposition say the question is deliberately ambiguous to fool inhabitants who want more rights but who would never vote for outright secession. It is hard to see what the point of the referendum is if not independence - as Tatar officials obliquely admit after some questioning. 'We don't want national independence, but state independence,' says the Mayor of Kazan, Mr Kamil Iskhakov, who promises equal rights for Russians and other non-Tatars who make up 51 per cent of Tatarstan's 4m inhabitants. While some Tatars see independence as a chance to redress the injustice of centuries of Russian domination, most of the nationalism is spawned by economic conditions. With most of the former Soviet Union's natural wealth, including Tatarstan's oil, under state control, independence becomes a means of keeping wealth for the local population rather than giving it to Moscow. Mr Insaf Rakhimov, deputy director of Tatneft, the republic's state oil company, complained bitterly that at present he can only sell 5m tonnes of oil for the benefit of Tatarstan. The rest of his annual output of 30m tonnes is handed over to Russian authorities for export or for distribution within the rest of the country. To add insult to injury, 50 per cent of the hard currency he makes from his 5m tonnes has to be sold to the Russian central bank for roubles. 'What is this if not theft by Russians?' he asked. Decades of centralised management from Moscow have also meant a wasteful exploitation of deposits and the running down of equipment, now badly in need of replacement. 'If I could sell all the oil myself, Tatarstan could be a new Kuwait,' he argued, claiming that the profits would be enough not only to finance independence but to buy equipment without having to give oil to foreign investors. Russia's dilemma is that it is too late to reverse nationalism, even if it deals with economic grievances. Tatar leaders say that even if they get economic independence now, as Russia is offering, it will not be enough to soothe radical Tatar opinion. The relative calm in Chechnya, the other autonomous republic which is refusing to sign the federal treaty, shows it may be more sensible, however painful to Russian pride, to let the republics go their own way. As Mr Zinnur Latipov, an opposition deputy, told workers at a Kazan factory this week, the only hope is that the outside world will also ignore Tatarstan. 'Not one civilised country in the world will recognise us - perhaps just Libya and Saddam Hussein.'</p>

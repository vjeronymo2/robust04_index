			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (3): A more personal service - Private banking Guests to lunch with Coutts &amp; Co's bank in Bristol's Corn Street, the historic business quarter of the city, are greeted by a frock-coated Mr Bruce McColl, its manager, and asked to sign the visitors' book with a quill pen. While this welcome sets Coutts apart from the usual reception that customers receive at a bank, it is evidence more of traditional values than its present-day way of conducting business. Coutts, founded in 1692, is anxious to show that private banking, far from being outdated, is gaining appeal with people who want a more personal service. In recent years, it has been opening branches in several UK cities. The big banks - and Coutts is owned by National Westminster - have been coming round to the same opinion. Lloyds Private Banking, second to Coutts in terms of total funds under management, began as an adjunct to the retail bank but adopted that name in 1992 to gain a distinct identity. It has 31 offices and, last year, moved its Bristol branch to new premises in Clifton. For Coutts, Bristol was only its second branch outside London (the first was at Eton). It opened in 1976 and subsequently a small office was established in Bath. The south-west is seen as having a big potential for private banking. Lloyds says that in the first half of 1994 it gained more than 600 clients at its offices in the south-west and south Wales and Pounds 145m in additional funds. This brought the total to more than 8,500 clients and Pounds 1.4bn, accounting for a quarter of its national business. Private banking aims to provide a more personal service than the high street banks. It is, Mr McColl says, about 'getting close to people and understanding their needs and we have the time to do this.' There is an increasing emphasis on asset management, with the vast majority of clients opting to give the bank discretionary management of their funds. Inevitably, many existing customers are elderly, but Coutts says new clients tend to be in their 40s and, often, have made large sums in selling or floating a business. Mr Nigel Richardson, manager of Lloyds Private Banking in Clifton, says: 'Bristol produces a very high volume of new business. There is a lot of wealth in the area. It used to be old ladies and widows, but is now tending to be younger people who have made their way in business but don't have time to look after their own affairs.' The branch has 1,400 clients with Pounds 200m under management. In the case of Coutts, which has 1,200 accounts at its Bristol branch, an average balance of at least Pounds 3,000 must be kept in a current account to avoid charges. Mr McColl says: 'People are buying a relationship, and are not terribly excited by what Pounds 3,000 would earn in the Halifax, after tax at 40 per cent.' For fund management, the usual entry point is Pounds 250,000 and charges are negotiable. Lloyds has a minimum for fund management of Pounds 75,000 in free assets. Mr Geoffrey Bailey, chief manager of investment services, says: 'One thing we don't sell is our own products - if we did, they would have to be better. We would have a very slim defence if they didn't perform well.' The fee is determined by the value of the funds - in Lloyds' case, it is an annual 1 per cent and subscription charge of Pounds 140. Coutts and Lloyds are both anxious to stress that the personal touch is not at the expense of professionalism. Coutts comments: 'We have a global expertise and depth of knowledge - we're in 17 jurisdictions around the world and have fund managers in five key locations investing money.' Lloyds, like Coutts, cultivates an image to distinguish it from ordinary retail banking. In Clifton, it occupies a large Victorian house, only identified by a discreet brass plate. The house, complete with conservatory, has domestic furniture and aims to create an atmosphere in which clients feel at home. It is in sharp contrast to most people's main contact with their bank - a hole-in-the-wall cash dispenser.</p>

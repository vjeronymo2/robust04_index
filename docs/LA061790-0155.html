			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOS GAIN IN SOUND-BITES BUT DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY  </P> <P> Democrats have reason to celebrate this month. They nominated a woman to run  for California governor and a black to challenge Sen. Jesse A. Helms in North  Carolina. They watched a front-running anti-abortion candidate for Iowa  governor go down in flames. Each result gave the party a big opportunity to  expand its base in November.  </P> <P> Back in Washington, it has been a different story. Gorbymania is gone and a  sullen Congress is back in town. President George Bush is again jousting with  Congress over the mushrooming federal deficit.  </P> <P> Democrats also quietly observed this month an anniversary that few wanted to  recall: the June, 1989, resignation under fire of House Speaker Jim Wright  (D-Texas). That downfall, which paralyzed Capitol Hill for much of last year,  has apparently left few visible wounds for his party. Like so many recent  miseries for the beleaguered Democrats, however, his departure has brought a  new pile of problems and self-doubts.  </P> <P> When Wright left town, many Democrats breathed a deep sigh of relief. They no  longer had to bear the burden of his ethics-tarred reputation, of his cozy  connections to Texas savings-and-loan swindlers that have forced Democrats to  share the blame for the S&amp;L mess. Democrats were also grateful they would  not have to contend with Wright's Lone Ranger leadership style, in which he  often made impulsive decisions or forced members to make tough choices.  </P> <P> Under the leadership of Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who also acquired his post in 1989,  Democrats have more-telegenic spokesmen who can speak in sound-bites for TV  interviews. And their leaders are capable lawmakers willing to roll up their  sleeves to identify specific problems and tasks and achieve those goals. But it  has become embarrassingly clear to congressional Democrats that they lack an  agenda to unify themselves or rally the nation. When they have tried to promote  some issues, they have either been so split internally that their message was  blurred or they have been preempted by the President.  </P> <P> Consider: The House and Senate this spring have both passed broad clean-air  bills, to which many lawmakers have devoted months of work. But Democrats have  been dogged by divisions, barely papered over, between environmentalists led by  Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the party's organized-labor wing led  by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). The likely result is that Bush will get much  of the credit when he signs the law later this year.  </P> <P> Similarly, on the child-care bill, House and Senate Democrats are working to  resolve differences between competing versions approved in the past year. One  reason party leaders have not sounded a fanfare is that their committee leaders  working on the bill have failed to agree among themselves about the bill's  rationale. Should child care be a hodgepodge package expanding current federal  programs, such as Head Start and school aid, emphasizing low-income children?  Or should it be targeted more toward tax credits for middle-class families  trying to balance demands of home, school and workplace? Whatever the answer,  it is not likely to do much for Democrats who wanted to cast their lot with  "the family."  </P> <P> Democrats were gloating last fall that they had Bush and the GOP on the run  following the Supreme Court decision that approved restrictive state laws on  abortion. But this year appears to be different: Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.),  the GOP nominee for governor, has lined up with the pro-abortion-rights side.  And three of the hottest Senate Republican challengers -- Patricia F. Saiki of  Hawaii, Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island -- are  House members who, like the incumbents, favor abortion rights. (Granted, other  Republicans, such as Clayton Williams, running for Texas governor, either  oppose abortion or have made sexist comments. But the Democrats' message has  been blurred by their own anti-abortionists, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Robert  P. Casey.)  </P> <P> The Supreme Court last week handed down a decision that has caused more  Democratic division. In overturning the federal flag-protection law, the court  reminded Democrats of how the Pledge of Allegiance issue dogged their 1988  presidential campaign. Both Foley and Mitchell repeated their earlier vow to  oppose any proposal abridging the Bill of Rights. It remains to be seen whether  they will prove more skillful than was Michael S. Dukakis in minimizing the  political costs.  </P> <P> The Democrats' biggest frustration has probably been Bush's continuing high  popularity in public-opinion polls. For that, they have themselves partly to  blame, simply because they have done so little to present a coherent message  that describes his shortcomings.  </P> <P> In their search for more effective attacks on Bush, some Democrats have  recently targeted his handling of the S&amp;L disaster. They contend that he  has become vulnerable both because of his initial failure to propose a  sufficiently large financial package to resolve the problem and the Justice  Department's failure to prosecute the wheeler-dealers aggressively.  </P> <P> "The biggest case we have for 1992 is that we flushed the peace-dividend down  the S&amp;L toilet, because of the Bush Administration," said a Democratic  strategist. He contends that the public's short attention span will cause most  voters to forget about Democrats' misdeeds that fueled the crisis.  </P> <P> Congressional Democrats are also seeking ways to force Bush to address the  S&amp;L issue in the coming budget summit. Many Democrats are convinced they  will be able to force the President to tell the public that the economy has  gone sour or that he won't be able to keep his no-new-taxes promise -- or both.  </P> <P> The success of this confrontational strategy is uncertain. But an important  signal that many Democrats have growing doubts is the persistent talk in  Capitol lobbies that the party's Senate and House control will be in serious  jeopardy in 1992 because of the combined impact of Bush's reelection, House  redistricting and the expected large number of retirements.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of fear in the cloakroom," a House Democrat said. In this  political environment, the Democratic imperative has increasingly become  individual self-protection. That is generally not a recipe for resurrecting a  party.  </P></p>

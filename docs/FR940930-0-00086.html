			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We included ``not given birth prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age 30'' as a factor indicating a high risk of developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breast cancer in the interim final rule based upon advice we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from NCI, and, in response to the comment, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consulted further with NCI. NCI staff have advised us that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relative risk of women who have ``not given birth prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to age 30'' developing breast cancer is 1.4; that is, a woman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who has not given birth prior to age 30 has a 40 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher chance of developing breast cancer over her lifetime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than would otherwise be the case. This elevated risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies over the age range of 40 to 49 that is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the high risk factor provision specified in the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute. Based on the advice of NCI, we have decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain in this final rule ``not given birth prior to age 30''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a factor indicating a high risk of developing breast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that there is a need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify the meaning of the term ``personal history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breast cancer'' that is cited in &sect;410.34(b)(4) as one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors indicating a high risk of developing breast cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also requested clarification as to whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biopsy that reveals a lump to be benign is reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of ``a history of breast cancer.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The use of the term ``a personal history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breast cancer'' in &sect;410.34(b)(4) of the interim final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was intended to mean that there is documented evidence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the woman's medical record that she has tested positive for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breast cancer. Thus, a woman who has a biopsy of a lump in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her breast that is determined to be benign would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to have ``a history of breast cancer.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule made no reference to the possibility that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Medicare program may pay for certain medically necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammograms that are performed more often than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequencies stated in the statute and the interim final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for screening mammograms. The commenter suggested that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter is correct that the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program may pay for certain medically necessary mammograms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (also referred to as diagnostic mammograms as distinguished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from screening mammograms) that are performed more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently than the frequencies stated in the law and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule for screening mammograms. We stated this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact in the interim final rule (55 FR 53511). Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy, mammograms are covered if medically necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnose a specific complaint or medical problem that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been identified by the patient or her attending physician,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including medical problems that may have been identified on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of a previous screening mammogram. This coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on sections 1861(s)(1) and (s)(3) of the Act, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for Medicare coverage of interpretation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic X-ray tests by a physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters observed that a diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammogram requires essentially the same level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional attention and professional expertise as does a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammogram, and one of these commenters suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that similar quality standards be applied to both types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography services under the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree. As we noted in response to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous comment, a diagnostic mammogram and a screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammogram are similar in many respects, and the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized this fact when it enacted the MQSA, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized the application of quality standards to both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of mammograms, effective October 1, 1994. Accordingly, we are including a condition for coverage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule at &sect;410.34(b)(2) that, in order to qualify for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for diagnostic mammograms under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, suppliers of these services must meet the same FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements that we are adopting in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule for screening mammograms. (These certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are set forth in section 354 of the PHS Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented by 21 CFR part 900, subpart B.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

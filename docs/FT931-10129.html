			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT plan would hit food industry and the poorest Sir, So Lex (February 3) believes that imposing standard-rate VAT on all food will have little consequence for consumers, employment or the food industry] This conclusion verges on the glib, in assuming that the British economy and the food industry have infinite capacity to absorb inflationary pressures. During a period of recession the UK food industry could not confront such an economic shock with equanimity. To absorb price increases it would have to cut back further on investment and pare overheads and operating costs even closer to the bone. Lex has also ignored the 18 per cent increase in key raw material prices imposed on food and drink processors by the devaluation of the green pound since last September. This compounds the problem of remaining competitive with overseas suppliers and any additional price pressures could well sell UK jobs abroad. Imposing standard-rate VAT on food will hit the poorest sections of society hardest. How can those who already buy the lowest-priced food trade down even further, as Lex suggests? The article recognises the 'knock-on' effects of reduced consumer expenditure in other sectors but fails to specify that this means deeper recession still and yet more unemployment. These consequences have to be confronted squarely. Food is essential to life and no food should be taxed, on principle.

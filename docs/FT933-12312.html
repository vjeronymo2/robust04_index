			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: The Week Ahead ON THURSDAY, Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports its first interim results without its bioscience business, Zeneca. Industry analysts' forecasts reckon pre-tax profits will be down from last year's Pounds 159m (excluding exceptionals) to about Pounds 140m. Figures will also be given for the old ICI, which included Zeneca. The performance of the industrial chemicals division will also be watched closely. Its titanium dioxide and caustic businesses are struggling, but chemicals and polymers are expected to post significant improvements. Zeneca also reports its half-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect it to report pre-tax profits at between Pounds 330m and Pounds 340m. Of particular interest will be the performance of the pharmaceuticals division. Reuters, the international information and news group, is expected to report an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 187m to about Pounds 210m on Tuesday. Interest will centre on whether the group plans to distribute some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to shareholders - and on the progress of new dealing systems such as Globex, for financial futures and options markets; and Dealing 2000-2, the automated foreign exchange product. BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, is expected to show increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Despite concerns about the prospects for the group's US tobacco business, profits are predicted to rise to Pounds 710m-Pounds 780m (Pounds 672m a year earlier). Eagle Star, the non-life insurance subsidiary, is gradually recovering profitability following increases in premium rates and a fall-off in weather-related claims. The interim reporting season for clearing banks starts on Friday with Lloyds, which is expected to show less of a rebound in profits than others because of greater consistency in earnings in the past two years. Lloyds is also expected to be under pressure in its net interest income because its UK loan book has been contracting. But analysts expect it to benefit from around Pounds 100m of release of less developed country debt. Analysts expect a rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 450m-Pounds 560m (Pounds 369m). Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are expected to fall to between Pounds 250m and Pounds 270m from Pounds 347m. British Telecommunications is reporting first-quarter results on Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 780m (Pounds 731m) are likely.</p>

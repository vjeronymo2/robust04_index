			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Rodime reduces loss to Dollars 644,000 RODIME, the one-time pioneer of 3 1/2 -inch hard disk drives, reduced its pre-tax losses from Dollars 1.49m to Dollars 644,000 (Pounds 337,000) in the six months to March 31 and announced that trading in its shares, suspended in August at 4p, would be resumed today. Once a disk drive manufacturer which never achieved critical mass and was spread over three continents, the company has metamorphosed into an intellectual property company, deriving its revenues from the licensing of its patents. This stems from late 1990 when IBM paid Rodime an out-of-court settlement of about Dollars 13m. Mr Malcolm McIver, non-executive chairman, said that Rodime's aim was to restore shareholder value. It had: to dispose of its assets successfully. It has still to receive Dollars 4.4m, mainly from the sale of the factory in Boca Raton, Florida, from an expected Dollars 16.9m; to achieve new licensing agreements. At 15, it has so far come to terms with less than half of all the companies which have infringed its patents; to renegotiate certain obligations of its subsidiaries which it had guaranteed; to maintain the support of its bankers. Rodime's total liabilities stood at Dollars 30m at June 1992, against Dollars 63m in October 1990. Mr Peter Bailey, managing director and one of only five full-time employees, said that in the year to September 1991 revenues from patent licensing totalled Dollars 30m. He added that Rodime was perhaps a year away from the granting of patents for its digital servo, which could extend the life of the company in its current form beyond 2004, when the disk drive patents expire. Mr Bailey said Rodime could also consult on other companies' intellectual property, or could buy technologies and their patents rights on a percentage or joint venture basis. In May Rodime had net negative worth of Dollars 27m (Pounds 15.2m at that time) and to qualify for the relisting, the company had to secure an unqualified opinion on the working capital adequacy review from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the auditor. Operating profit was Dollars 1.99m (loss Dollars 373,000). Losses per share were 0.4 cents (1 cent).</p>

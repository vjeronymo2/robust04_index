			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhou Qing (0719 1987) and XINHUA </F> reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)]    [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The main topic of a  national telephone conference on antipornography work held here  today was earnestly implementing the guidelines of the  conference on propaganda and ideological work convened by the  party central committee, and continuing to campaign against  pornography in a thorough and sustained way in order to create a  good social and cultural environment for reform, opening up, and  economic construction.    According to the telephone conference, marked progress was  achieved in antipornography work last year thanks to leaders of  various localities who personally attended to the work. In  addition to deploying concentrated forces according to  requirements set by the central committee, many provinces and  cities also made corresponding arrangements to deal with book,  newspaper, magazine, video, and audio product markets in their  areas. Antipornography work last year focused attention on key  areas and important links. As a result, breakthroughs were made  in the investigation and handling of major cases involving the  manufacture and sale of pornography, and a number of criminals  were dealt with. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993  the country confiscated 332.18 million copies of banned books  and publications, of which 288,000 were pornographic; 499,700  banned videotapes, of which 11,300 were pornographic; destroyed  170 pornography-manufacturing and retail bases, including some  illegal publishing houses; investigated and handled 1,675 cases  involving the manufacture and sale of pornography and illegal  publishing activities; and investigated and punished 5,991  offenders. The conference noted: Despite the marked  achievements made in antipornography work throughout the  country, we must be fully aware of the chaotic condition of the  publication market and realize everyone shoulders heavy  responsibility in the struggle to combat pornography.    The conference analyzed the reasons for the resurgence of  the  "poison of pornography." It also mapped out a specific plan to  deal with antipornography work in 1994 in accordance with  requirements set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. The conference called on all localities to  further promote understanding of antipornography work among  cadres and the masses, to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and to make unremitting efforts to grasp the  work. The conference said: We must continue to make the  handling of major cases the priority in antipornography work.  In 1994 we must focus on raising the number of cases handled.  It is also necessary to further enact and improve relevant laws  and administrative regulations to manage book, newspaper,  publication, audio, and video product markets according to the  law.    The conference was presided ver by Yu Youxian, deputy head  of  the National Leading Group for the Rectification of Book,  Newspaper, Publication, Audio, and Video Product Markets. Liu  Zhongde delivered a speech and Gui Xiaofeng presented a work  report to the conference. Responsible people from various  departments under the central committee also took part in the  telephone conference.</p>

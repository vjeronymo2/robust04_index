This proposed action would bring the equivalent market value of the live animals from which such imported pork and pork products were derived in line with the market values of domestic porcine animals. This proposed rule also would revise the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) numbers which identify imported live porcine animals, pork, and pork products to conform with recent changes in these numbers made by the United States Customs Service (USCS). These proposed changes will facilitate the continued collection of assessments on imported porcine animals, pork, and pork products.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send two copies of comments to Ralph L.

This proposal is not intended to have a retroactive effect. The Act states that the statute is intended to occupy the field of promotion and consumer education involving pork and pork products and of obtaining funds thereof from pork producers and that the regulation of such activity (other than a regulation or requirement relating to a matter of public health or the provision of State or local funds for such activity) that is in addition to or different from the Act may not be imposed by a State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1625 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, a provision of such order or an obligation imposed in connection with such order is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption from the order. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in the district in which person resides or does business has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination, if a complaint is filed not later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 20 days after the date such person receives notice of such determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action also was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Order upon small entities was discussed in the September 5, 1986, issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 31898), and it was determined that the Order would not have a significant effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Many importers may be classified as small entities. This proposed rule would increase the amount of assessments on imported pork and pork products subject to assessment by two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of a cent per kilogram. Adjusting the assessments on imported pork and pork products would result in an estimated increase in assessments of $143,000 over a 12-month period. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule would also revise HTS numbers for imported porcine animals, pork, and pork products subject to assessment from 11 digits to 10 digits to conform a change in those HTS numbers made by USCS. The change made in the number of digits in HTS numbers is merely a technical change and will not impose any new requirements on importers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act (7 U.S.C. 4801&hyph;4819) approved December 23, 1985, authorized the establishment of a national pork promotion, research, and consumer information program. The program was funded by an initial assessment rate of 0.25 percent of the market value of all porcine animals marketed in the United States and an equivalent amount of assessment on imported porcine animals, pork, and pork products. However, that rate was increased to 0.35 percent effective December 1, 1991 (56 FR 51635). The final Order establishing a pork promotion, research, and consumer information program was published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 5, 1986, issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 31898; as corrected, at 51 FR 36383 and amended at 53 FR 1909, 53 FR 30243, 56 FR 4, and 56 FR 51635) and assessments began on November 1, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

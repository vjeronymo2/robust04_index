			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Fashion: How to survive as a couturier 1 Set or confirm trends. This spring, these are: a) short fluid skirts under long fluid jackets, in pale tweed (Chanel) or pale crepe and lace (Valentino). b) short, metallic and modern (Versace). c) short, elaborate and historic (Lacroix). d) tiny, short jackets with very wide trousers (Chanel, Lacroix, Dior). e) chiffon for evening: short layers (Chanel), long layers (Ungaro), high waists (Lacroix). f) new tights - black lace, silver metallic or glossy sheer. 2 Achieve wonderful, wearable tailoring (St Laurent, Dior, Givenchy, Balmain). 3 Make very grand but not extreme evening gowns (St Laurent, Balmain, Ricci). 4 As white is THE colour, use masses of white or cream evening dresses which could also be wedding gowns, the couturier's lifeline (all designers). 5 Add some Eastern promise gold-beaded chiffon tunics and pants, particularly for the Arab and Asian markets (Scherrer, Ungaro). 6 Grab the headlines, with: a) strategic transparency (Chanel, Scherrer, Ricci). b) a controversy - Chanel's surreal feather helmets which obscured both supermodel faces and some good clothes, or Lacroix putting Directoire-inspired dresses on a suedehead model. 7 Launch a potentially lucrative perfume this season (Scherrer, Dior, Ungaro).</p>

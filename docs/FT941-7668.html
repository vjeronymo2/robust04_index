			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / BT plans 'superhighway' services British Telecommunications is set to announce a massive investment programme aimed at creating 'information superhighways' capable of delivering a range of inter-active video, banking and shopping services into homes across the country. The investment programme, the largest since the introduction of digital exchanges in the mid-1980s, could involve replacing much of BT's local 'copper wire' networks with fibre-optics. Estimates suggest the total outlay could exceed Pounds 10bn over more than a decade, although large-scale investment would be unlikely to start for at least three years. Dr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development and procurement, told the FT yesterday an announcement about extending fibre-optics to BT's local network was likely 'in the next few months. 'What we really want to do is to deliver services on demand - not just video. We believe there is a much broader range of services which could be delivered.' As well as videos, shopping and banking, he cited estate and travel agency, travel and holiday services and health and educational programmes as important markets. 'There is no way we could justify an investment of this kind on just one service,' he said, adding that the step required 'vision' but was little different in kind from that taken for digitalisation in the early 1980s when the costs 'looked horrendous'. Most of BT's long-distance network is already fibre, but most of its local network is copper, which has limited transmission capacity. Dr Rudge said BT might be able to take fibre right into the home - not just to street level - if the cost of the necessary electronics continued to fall. BT's move comes on the back of similar announcements by US and Japanese operators, who see consumer and public sector markets, not just business demand, for new inter-active services. Last April NTT, the Japanese domestic operator, announced plans to invest Dollars 396m to install fibre to all subscribers by 2015. Most of the US regional Bell operators have plans to extend fibre into their local networks. Ameritech, which has 12m customers in the Midwest, last month announced plans for a 'digital video network' extending to half its network by the end of the decade. US West, which covers 14 western states, earlier this month announced plans to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial network. BT hopes soon to offer a video service over existing copper wire, using technology about to be piloted at Colchester in Essex. But Dr Rudge said copper-based methods were only 'an interim solution'. Last night BT said an initial trial with fibre-optics would take place in the spring using the homes of 60 BT employees at Kesgrave, near Ipswich. If it proved successful, the experiment would be extended to 2,500 BT customers around the country, possibly in the autumn. The system might then be introduced nationwide.

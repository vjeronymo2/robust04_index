			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UN and Iraq in oil sales talks UN AND Iraqi officials began negotiations yesterday on the possible resumption of oil exports from Iraq that, if successful, could add more than half a million barrels a day to the current glut, further depressing prices. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said he hoped that an eventual agreement to ship up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of Iraqi oil over six months would be 'a first step in building confidence between the UN and Iraq'. He was instrumental in reviving the talks during a meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, in Geneva last month. The earlier rounds in the first half of 1992 ended in failure, in part because of Baghdad's objections to a requirement that oil be shipped through a Turkish pipeline in order to facilitate UN moni-toring of the quantities sold. Mr Carl-August Fleisch-hauer, German head of the UN legal office, is leading the negotiating team from the UN secretariat. Mr Riyadh al-Qaysi is the principal Iraqi negotiator.</p>

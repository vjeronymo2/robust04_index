			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures came down with a bump, unwinding much of the recent rally in another session of relatively thin volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,041 at the official close, down 52 points. The premium to the cash market was less than two points, or about half fair value. Turnover was the same as on Wednesday at 12,828 contracts, so the volume of selling was not heavy but dealers said sentiment was at times distinctly negative. The absence of volume drive was reflected in a wide 48-point trading arc, with the day's low of 3,036 comparing with the session's peak of 3,086 touched during the early morning. In late screen-based trading the market took its cue from midsession weakness on Wall Street, pushing the December contract down to 3,036, with trading volume rising to in excess of 14,000 lots. Traded options were active, with turnover reaching 32,365 contracts, against 27,102 on Wednesday, with the bias on the upside and calls outstripping puts by more than 1,000 lots. FT-SE option trading was 20,557 but with the Euro FT-SE barely dealt. HSBC was by far the most active individual stock option with 3,073 lots transacted. Land Securities and National Power both topped 1,000 contracts traded.</p>

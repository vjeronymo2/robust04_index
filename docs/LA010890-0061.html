			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MUSTER KEEPS WORKING HARD AND DEFEATS ARIAS  </P> <P> Thomas Muster of Austria rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the final set to beat  Jimmy Arias, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5, Sunday night and win the $150,000 Australian  Hardcourt championship at Adelaide.  </P> <P> Muster is coming back after being seriously injured when hit by a drunk driver  in an auto accident last April in Florida.  </P> <P> The third-seeded Muster twice broke Arias' serve in the final set en route to  his first tournament victory since the career-threatening knee injury. He  earned $18,000.  </P> <P> "There were times when I wanted to give up, but I kept working," Muster said of  his comeback.  </P> <P> Arias, a former top 10 player whose ranking has dropped to 88th, made an  increasing number of errors as the match progressed.  </P> <P> Arias, whose last Grand Prix victory was in 1983, took a 3-0 lead in the third  set and later was serving for a 4-1 lead. But Muster broke serve, then broke  again in the 11th game before wrapping up the win.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain twice rallied from a set down to beat Richey  Reneberg, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, in a $150,000 tournament at  Wellington, N.Z.  </P> <P> The victory in the 3 1/2-hour match was the 100th of Sanchez's career and his  second in a week.  </P> <P> Last Monday he teamed with his sister, Arantxa, to beat John McEnroe and Pam  Shriver in the final of the Hopman Cup team event at Perth, Australia.  </P> <P> Soviet teen-ager Natalia Zvereva won her first tournament title by defeating  Australia's Rachel McQuillan, 6-4, 6-0, in the final of the $150,000 Australian  Hardcourt championships at Brisbane.  </P> <P> "This was a good feeling," said the 18-year-old Zvereva, six times a runner-up  on the women's tour.  </P></p>

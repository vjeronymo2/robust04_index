			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luis Garasino] </F>   [Text] The Armed Forces yesterday conveyed to the  government their "concern and uneasiness" about the arrival of  Italian court officials who are conducting a trial against  Argentine military officers on charges of having kidnapped,  tortured, and disposed of 65 Italian citizens during the  National Reorganization Process days.    The military unrest was more clearly expressed in the report  Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief of the Armed Forces  Joint Staff, handed yesterday to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion  after consulting the heads of the three Armed Forces branches by  phone.    Diaz reported to Camilion on a legal detail which, according  to the military, nullifies the Italian court officials'  procedures.    Military sources reported to CLARIN: "The situation has  created intense uneasiness among military leaders, who are  alarmed at the decision to reopen a process they believed to  have been definitively closed. We reported this yesterday to  the political branch."    Lawyers Marcelo Gentili and Giancarlo Maniga arrived in  Argentina on 13 February. Judge Antonio Cappiello and attorney  Antonio Marini are expected to arrive on 15 February. They will  hear testimonies by 30 relatives of the missing Italians, while  a trial of those who are allegedly responsible for their  disappearance is being prepared in Rome.    If the Italian courts find the Argentine officers guilty, an  international order for their arrest may be issued. Although  such order is not applicable in Argentina, it will be complied  with abroad.    According to the Convention for Legal Assistance on Penal  Matters, which was signed by Argentina and Italy on 9 December  1987 and ratified by Law 23707 on 13 September 1989, the Italian  court officials cannot conduct investigation in Argentina, but  can act under federal government supervision. In this case,  Federal Court Judge Gustavo Adolfo Literas will hear the  witnesses' testimony and decide on the extent of participation  in the lawsuit. This evidence may be given to the Italian court  officials.    The Argentine military believe the government should only  assist the Italian courts when these are investigating crimes  perpetrated in Italy and not those committed in Argentina, where  the Law of Expiration, the Due Obedience Law, and the  Presidential Pardon Law have been enforced.</p>

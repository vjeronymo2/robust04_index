Jabbar Firman told AFP that the build-up of army troops and  artillery began three days earlier south of the 36th parallel,  above which the Gulf war allies enforce a "no-fly zone" to keep  out Iraqi aircraft.    Further north, tribal militias are being deployed in  strength  near Irbil, which is home to 800,000 people and where the Iraqi  Kurds have their capital, said Firman, who is in charge of  Kurdish military affairs.    He gave no details on the build-up.    "In the no-fly zone, Iraq would not dare to attack the  Kurdish-controlled region with its official army, therefore it  is sending the militias," he said.    Firman charged that Iraq was planning an attack to distract  public attention from the country's economic crisis, brought on  by the UN embargo in place since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.    The Kurds have controlled a large chunk of northern Iraq,  under the allied security umbrella, since an uprising following  the 1991 Gulf war which evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait.    An Iraqi opposition group based in Tehran charged Wednesday  that the army had launched a new offensive against Shiite Moslem  villages in the marshlands of southern Iraq.</p>

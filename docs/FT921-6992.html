			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: BAe in pact for fighter jet McDONNELL DOUGLAS of the US and British Aerospace have agreed to develop and produce a new strike fighter-aircraft, Daniel Green reports. It will be capable of short take-off and vertical landing like the Harrier jet which is also produced under an agreement between the two companies. The new project is independent from the Harrier. McDonnell Douglas said yesterday technical demonstrations should be made by 1999 and it should be operational between 2005 and 2010. The initial programme would be to define the aircraft's capabilities and what missions it would be asked to undertake. This could lead to manufacture of a demonstration aircraft, in turn used to test new propulsion and manufacturing techniques. The deal depends on approval from the US government. It needs to give the go-ahead to the required transfer of technology. McDonnell Douglas makes the Harrier under licence from British Aerospace, but has improved its performance and specification for US military use.</p>

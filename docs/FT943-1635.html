			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Swans suitor unveils proposals Organisation Management and Survey, the Manchester-based consulting engineers, yesterday announced details of its proposals for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure. OMS, which has been in discussion with receivers Price Waterhouse for some time, said it was leading a consortium which had received expressions of interest from potential customers in immediately placing two orders at Swans worth a total of up to Dollars 360m (Pounds 225m). Mr David Tristram, OMS managing director, said the orders were from a US corporation for diving support vessels and from Olympic Seas Maritime for two large catamaran ferries for use on the Athens-Brindisi route. OMS said it had reached agreement in principle with an unnamed 'experienced Anglo-American marine company' which would become the shipyard's operator. OMS envisages acquiring all Swans' assets. It would focus on merchant shipbuilding, and also proposes ship refurbishment, repair and engineering, and diversification into alumin-ium extrusion manufacture. Mr Tristram said he expected to make a firm offer within 10 days. 'Significant interest is being shown from leading financial institutions to provide the necessary funding,' he said. The consortium's advisers include Cornhill Commercial Services. OMS would aim to buy Swans after its last vessel - a Type 23 frigate - leaves in November. It would wish to recruit Swans employees. It faces competition for the assets. The receivers have already received firm bids for the Hebburn site, and for Swans' intellectual property. OMS's high-profile launch of its proposal met a cautious response from the receivers. Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said: 'I am able to confirm that an approach was made a number of weeks ago by OMS to acquire all the assets of Swan Hunter but to date no acceptable offer has been put to the receivers, nor have we yet seen any evidence of a capability to fund such an offer were it to be made.' The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday called on unions to mount a rescue buy-out bid for Swans.</p>

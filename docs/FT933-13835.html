			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Not everyone can win in the real world - A scheme to allow retirement benefits to be taken in stages is exciting salesmen. However, the drawbacks need to be clearly understood / Staggered vesting STAGGERED VESTING, or phased annuities, is sweeping through the personal pension field. Every life company and intermediary is taking advantage of this latest fashion, to boost new business and secure commissions well into the future, when other sources of business are drying up. The concept has been developed from the original idea of using the flexibility of personal pensions to phase in an individual's retirement. As such, the concept is attractive, but it needs to be correctly applied, and the drawbacks understood. But salesmen's hype in promoting staggered vesting is presenting it as a 'win-win situation' all round - a condition that rarely exists in the real world. When an individual takes his benefits under a personal pension contract, the usual procedure is to take the maximum cash and buy an annuity with the balance. If he is looking beyond the value of the first month's payment, the annuity will be an increasing annuity with a 50 per cent spouse's pension, and with payments guaranteed for five years. The individual will be forced to accept the level of annuity rates at the time of taking the benefits - currently low, because interest rates are low. In addition, only the lump-sum element is available to pass on to the next generation. This is a very rigid approach, and does not use the flexibility of benefits available with personal pensions. But staggered vesting makes maximum use of it, by taking the benefits bit by bit over a number of years, leaving the balance of the fund to continue to grow. The table shows how this concept works for a man aged 60. A target income is set for the first year. This can be any value the individual desires, but in presentations it is the annuity secured by the full fund at age 60. The annuity payments increase at a certain rate, are guaranteed for a minimum period and contain a spouse's pension. This target income is secured by cashing in sufficient of the contract, so that the tax-free cash sum plus the net amount from the annuity equals the net target income. The amount to be cashed in can be ascertained by solving a straightforward equation. The annuity bought is usually a level one on the life of the individual, though ideally it ought to be an increasing one. But usually no spouse's benefit is provided. The balance of the contract continues to accumulate. The process is repeated in the second and subsequent years - the existing net annuities, plus the tax-free cash sum and the new net annuity, equals the net target income. At age 75, the remaining value of the contract has to be cashed in - the maximum cash sum is taken, and an annuity bought with the balance. This annuity would contain a spouse's benefit, if required. If the investment performance is sufficiently high, the fund should drop for six successive years, and then start to climb again until age 75, as seen from table 1. Under these circumstances, the investor has won hands-down from staggered vesting. He has had the same net income up to age 75 as would have been purchased at outset, and a higher income thereafter plus a cash sum. Had he died before age 75, the balance of the fund would have been available for a spouse's pension or passed on to the next generation. However, if the investment performance is dull, there is a danger that the fund will just continue to fall and be used up before age 75. The tables are prepared on the Lautro illustration basis, using the higher investment rate of 13 per cent and the lower rate of 8.5 per cent. At 8.5 per cent, in Table 2, the fund just reaches age 75 - making 8.5 per cent the break-even rate. In September, the Lautro illustration basis will be changed to 6 per cent and 12 per cent. On this new basis, a more realistic picture will be presented to investors. At 6 per cent return on the fund, it will be used up before age 75, and a different picture will emerge. This highlights the crucial factors in a staggered vesting operation - the fund return, and the levels of annuity rates. The illustrations assume a steady, constant investment return each year. But life is not like that. Investment returns vary considerably from year to year, and pound-cost-averaging works against the investor when cashing-in units. Indeed, if investment returns are negative in a year, the number of units that have to be cashed-in rises considerably, eating deeply into the fund. This does not mean that an individual should not phase out his cash-ins by staggered vesting, but that it cannot be pre-planned for several years ahead. The individual must be flexible in his planning, particularly in the underlying investments. Some of the units should be held in cash, to cover those negative returns. These points tend to be glossed over by intermediaries. So each plan should be tailor-made to the individual's own requirements and reviewed each year, when it can be decided how much income is needed for the year. As such, the initial fund value should be high - at least Pounds 250,000. In these circumstances, the adviser's remuneration should be for the work done - that is, fee-based, and not commission-based relating to the high amount invested.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    STAGGERED VESTING: HOW IT WORKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Man aged 60: initial fund value Pounds 500,000.

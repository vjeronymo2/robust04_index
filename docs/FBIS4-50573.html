			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Briefing the press and  relevant departments on China's economic situation, State  Planning Commission spokesman Wei Liqun said today that this  year, under the guidance of the party Central Committee's  general policy of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development,  and maintaining stability," the nation has made new headway in  reform, opening up, and economic construction. He said: On the  whole, the state of economic development is improving, and the  fast growth in industrial production, investment, consumption,  and commodity prices has slowed down somewhat. This is a good  trend. However, great attention must be paid to certain  economic problems. Efforts to control inflation, in particular,  should not be slackened.    Wei Liqun said: The many major reform measures announced  this year are being carried out normally. The plans that the  State Council put forward early this year for reforming  financial operations, taxation, monetary affairs, and the  systems governing investment, foreign exchange, and foreign  trade are being implemented. Central and local taxes have been  separated in most prefectures and counties. Tax reform is  proceeding steadily. Under the new tax system, receipts and  payments maintained their normal growth during the January-April  period, and the budget was being executed according to plan.  The reform of the monetary system was proceeding on the basis  of the principle of separating policy-based [zheng ce xing 2398  4595 1840] monetary affairs from commercial monetary affairs.  The National Development Bank has been officially established,  and preparations for setting up other policy-based banks have  been intensified. Foreign exchange reforms during the first  quarter included the consolidation of foreign exchange rates,  recalling foreign exchange coupons, and establishing counter  accounts [tai zhang 0669 1600] for export businesses. The  exchange rate between the dollar and the renminbi has been  maintained at approximately 1:8.7. The nation's foreign  exchange revenue has grown quite substantially. Banks have been  converting and selling foreign exchange since 1 April. Ever  since it began to operate on 4 April, foreign exchange dealings  between domestic banks and foreign banks have been active at the  Chinese Foreign Exchange Trade Center, whose main traders are  banks authorized to provide foreign exchange service; and the  amounts of foreign exchange converted have been greater than the  amounts of foreign exchange sold. Pilot reform projects of  establishing modern businesses have also started.    On the whole, the economy is developing according to  requirements set for the exercise of macroeconomic regulation  and control. Since early this year, the economy has continued  to maintain its fast growth, with some decline. The first  quarter's GDP was 12.7 percent higher than the same period last  year. That included the 5.5-percent increase for primary  industry, the 15.8-percent increase for secondary industry, and  the 7.9-percent increase for tertiary industry.    -- Agricultural production is warming up. Following the two  conferences sponsored by the central government to discuss rural  affairs and the national conference on "food basket" projects,  all local authorities have grown grain and cotton on all  designated acreage, have increased investment in projects that  support agricultural production, and have hastened to build  vegetable and nonstaple food bases in large and medium cities.  Farmers' enthusiasm for production has been aroused.    -- Industrial production has been maintaining its relatively  fast growth. The value added of the nation's industrial  production during the January-April period topped that of the  same period last year by 16.4 percent, and the sales rates of  goods were maintained at 92.2 percent. The excessively low  growth of state-owned industrial enterprises has also started to  change. In April, the total industrial output value of  state-owned industrial enterprises increased 5 percent, or  nearly three percentage points higher than the figure for the  first quarter.    -- The monetary situation has been stable. By 28 March,  the amount of currency issued from New Year's Day to the period  around the Spring Festival had all been withdrawn from  circulation, and the withdrawal was still continuing at the end  of April. Compared with the same period last year, savings  deposits by urban and rural residents during the January-April  period increased by more than 130 billion yuan. Since the  treasury bonds were floated to the public on 1 April, over half  had been purchased by 10 May.    -- The sharp rise of investment in fixed assets has been  somewhat restrained. The increase in investment in fixed assets  has continued to decline. During the January-April period, the  amount of money which state-owned units invested in fixed assets  was 38.4 percent higher than that of the same period last year,  but the size of increase [zeng fu 1073 1607] was 30.5 percentage  points lower than that of the same period last year. On the  whole, the investment structure was better than that of the same  period last year. Compared to last year, the capital needed for  priority projects was more readily available.    -- The domestic market is basically stable. Total retail  sales of consumer goods during the January-April period were 25  percent higher than for the same period last year. After being  adjusted for price factors, the actual growth was 4.2 percent.  Currently, the supply and demand of at least 90 percent of  commodities are basically balanced, or with the supply being  greater than the demand. Owing to the strict control of the  size of investment, sales of capital goods have been stable.    -- Foreign trade has been growing steadily. During the  January-April period, total exports reached $28.04 billion, or  22 percent higher than for the same period last year. The  growth in April -- the month in which the growth of exports  exceeded imports for the first time since September 1992 -- was  29.6 percent higher than for April 1993. Total imports during  the January-April period increased 20.3 percent, reaching $29.79  billion.    -- The dramatic rise of commodity prices was brought under  preliminary control. The rise of commodity prices slowed down  noticeably in March. The monthly link relative index [yue huan  bi zhi shu 2588 3883 3024 2172 2422] dropped from over 3 percent  in January and February to 0.9 percent. As result of tightening  the monitoring of the prices of basic necessities and services,  promoting the practice of marking prices openly, and carrying  out a nationwide price check, prices have become less disorderly  than before.    Wei Liqun said: According to preliminary estimates, compared  to the same period last year, the GDP of the first six months  will be about 12 percent higher, the total industrial output  value will grow by about 18 percent, state-owned units'  investment in fixed assets will grow by about 30 percent, and  total retail sales of consumer goods will increase by about 22  percent, and the price rises will continue to slow down during  the second quarter.    He added: The current economic situation shows that while  certain problems appearing during the fast economic growth in  the past two years have become less serious in one way or  another, the foundation for balancing economic aggregates is not  very strong, and the leeway for macroeconomic regulation and  control is limited, and thus considerable time is still needed  before structural problems and ineffective operating mechanisms  created over a long period of time in the past can be resolved.  Thus, over the next few months, the intensity in exercising  macroeconomic regulation and control must be maintained and all  plans must be carried out cautiously, meticulously, and firmly.</p>

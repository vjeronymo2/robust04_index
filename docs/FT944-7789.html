			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Observer: Bright sparkle Nice touch. Harry Oppenheimer, the elder statesman of South African business, has handed in his notice and plans to retire as a director of world diamond giant De Beers on December 27 - the diamond anniversary of his joining the board - in 1934. Oppenheimer, 86, succeeded his father, Ernest, as chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd in 1957 and held the chair until a decade ago. Oppenheimer said yesterday that he realised that 'many people will think - and not without reason - that I became a director when I was far too young and continued as a director until I was far too old'. Maybe so. But it will be a long time before South Africa produces another industrial leader to match his contribution.</p>

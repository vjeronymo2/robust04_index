			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (4): Thorp jobs bubble bursts - The nuclear industry KEEN GARDENER though he is, Mr Terry Byrne is spending more time these days than he would wish among his plants. Last month, he became one of the thousands being made redundant as construction work at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site winds down. At 53, Mr Byrne, who lives in nearby Egremont, thinks his only hope of working again lies in possible future Sellafield developments. Prospects of finding work elsewhere locally are grim; his 28-year-old stepson, whose construction contract at Sellafield ended two years ago, has been job-hunting ever since. The Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant, a massive, world-league complex in one of England's most isolated areas, dominates the economy of Copeland borough. More than 8,000 people are on the permanent Sellafield payroll and last year contractors on the site, carrying out an investment programme worth Pounds 1.5m a day, employed a further 7,500. Even allowing for 'travelling men' - contract workers hired from outside the county - Sellafield was employing more than one in three of Copeland's workforce. But this figure is now nosediving as construction work, especially on the new Pounds 2.8bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP), due to begin operating commercially next year, tails off. Contract construction employment at Sellafield, already down to 4,700 in mid-1992, is expected to drop to 1,500 by the end of 1993. As this bubble bursts, it is becoming clear that Sellafield's presence has been masking serious deficiencies in the local economy. To make matters worse, the construction rundown has coincided with closure of some significant local employers and the collapse of newer companies which, it had been hoped, would diversify West Cumbria's employment base. 'Our failure rate this year will be worryingly high,' says Mr Alan Williams, business manager of the West Cumbria Development Fund, set up by Copeland, Allerdale and Cumbria councils and BNFL to try to diversify the local economy. Four companies, employing in total more than 100, have closed since March forcing the fund, into which BNFL puts Pounds 1m a year, to write off Pounds 250,000. A number of others which the fund has assisted are 'on the edge', says Mr Williams. 'It's extremely frustrating, it's undoing a lot of the work we're doing,' he says. 'With the BNFL lay-offs, the size of the problem is such that it can't be resolved simply by business development; there's got to be a significant level of inward investment.' That view is widely shared in Copeland. Ironically, it was Sellafield employment which contributed in the 1980s to keeping down Copeland's jobless figures, resulting in loss of development area status in 1983. Since then, says Mr Bob Metcalfe, the council's development and services director, Copeland's sole new inward investment of any size has been a Scottish supermarket. Chemicals manufacturer, Albright and Wilson, the borough's second largest private sector employer, is in Whitehaven. Now American-owned, the company has shed jobs recently but invested heavily, spending Pounds 20m over the last three years alone, largely on effluent discharge reduction. Its Marchon works, dominating the Whitehaven skyline, provides 1,200 much-needed jobs; a recent advertisement for two Pounds 3-an-hour part-time canteen staff to fry chips for the nightshift yielded 400 applications. Works director John Markham says Copeland's economy is fragile, even though it has companies at the leading edge of technology. The problems have various causes, one of which is poor transport infrastructure. The main A595 running down the coast is in parts little more than a country lane; the M6 motorway is an hour's drive from Whitehaven, on very variable roads. A one-day return visit to London for a Copeland-based businessperson is extremely difficult, and the A66 trip across the Pennines to the A1 can be tortuous, especially for heavy lorries. Another difficulty has been competition from Workington which has development area and enterprise zone incentives. Local economic development bodies are pushing for development area status for the Whitehaven travel to work area, too. Its jobless rate, they predict, will rise from 9.6 per cent now to 16.5 per cent at the end of 1993, largely due to the Sellafield construction rundown. History, too, has bequeathed problems. Having moved from dependence on extractive industries, now largely defunct, to reliance on Sellafield, Copeland has little tradition of enterprise culture. Its 1991 6.4 per cent self-employment rate compares with 10.4 per cent for Cumbria overall and 11.2 per cent for the UK. Cumbria's lack, prior to this autumn, of higher education facilities has also led many of its brightest young people to leave the area. The new Westlakes science and technology park, just south of Whitehaven, aims to reverse this brain drain, and to build on the purchasing power of Sellafield and its technology transfer potential by offering an attractive base for knowledge-based companies. The first phase is 60 per cent occupied but has so far brought in only one business from outside Cumbria, south coast engineering company Gravatom, a BNFL supplier. BNFL is heavily committed to Westlakes. It has relocated its cytogenetics and analytical services departments to a new Pounds 6m laboratory complex in the park and invested Pounds 0.875m in the business space development. The Rural Development Commission has also spent Pounds 0.875m, its largest-ever single investment, and Pounds 1.1m has come from the European Community. BNFL is also spending Pounds 2.5m on a new research institute at Westlakes. Headed by Dr Roger Berry, formerly BNFL's director of health and safety, the institute aims to become an independent unit, working for BNFL and other clients as a centre of excellence for the study of genetics, biotechnology, occupational health and environmental subjects. The institute's first graduate students arrive this month; Dr Berry, who is pursuing research contracts, is establishing links with Lancaster and Newcastle Universities and has recruited microbiologist Professor Derek Ellwood from Durham University to join the Westlakes research team. BNFL's importance in West Cumbria cannot be overestimated but its presence has negatives too. Local economic development bodies mostly deny Sellafield exerts a deterrent effect on potential inward investors, but Copeland council's Mr Metcalfe describes the nuclear industry as a double-edged sword. While it is the bedrock of the local economy and a potential attraction to some companies, he says he has evidence of industrialists who have decided not to come, or have withdrawn investment, because of it. Copeland people have generally defended Sellafield against what they see as ill-informed attacks by environmentalists and outsiders. But feelings are more mixed about the underground nuclear waste repository proposed by Nirex, a nuclear industry body which does not enjoy the high regard locally in which BNFL is held. Why, many locals are asking, should they be expected to shoulder a national, indeed international, problem which other communities in Britain have vociferously fought off, and yet still suffer deficient infrastructure? If the repository goes ahead, it promises to create 3,000 temporary construction jobs, and up to 400 for operators on completion. Before then, however, stretch years of controversy and emotive publicity about the burial of radioactive waste deep underground. It is just the publicity Copeland could do without.</p>

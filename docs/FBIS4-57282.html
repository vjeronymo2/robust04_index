			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares met  Thursday with Roberto Eisenmann, owner and president of the  daily LA PRENSA. The meeting, which lasted more than 30 minutes,  has been described as positive. The two discussed matters of  national interest in the short and medium term. They also  discussed the current Constitution and the need to make changes  to it. Media laws inherited from the recent past were also  discussed.    [Begin recording] [Eisenmann] He is doing everything  possible  to secure a consensus. Ten days before the elections I wrote an  article saying that I was optimistic. There is evidence now that  supports this optimism. The big test is always in what is done,  not in what is said, but so far all of us can feel that this is  a president for all Panamanians.    [Reporter] What about a national agreement?    [Eisenmann] I think that one of the most important  components  of a democracy is a vigorous opposition. I don't believe in just  talking about national unity. This is a favorite thing for  dictators. I think that in vigorous diversity there is the clear  possibility of national consensus. I think that if he stays on  the road down which he has started this will be possible. [end  recording]    Later, Perez Balladares visited EL SIGLO in the company of  Raul Arango, who is the future presidency minister, and other  important advisers. During his visit, Perez Balladares met with  EL SIGLO's director, Jaime Padilla Beliz, and other members of  the board of directors of that enterprise. He was invited to  tour the installations and was able to talk to the personnel,  who greeted him enthusiastically.    Dr. Perez Balladares also visited the offices of the weekly  EL CAMALEON, where he signed autographs and was photographed  next to the equipment of this popular media organ, which has a  high circulation.    Dr. Perez Balladares said that these visits are part of his  campaign promises.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] This is a serious  position, a commitment. I want to reiterate to the media that  there will be absolute respect for freedom of expression,  including the media that has aggravated me in the past,  including the media opposed to me, which can continue opposing  me with complete freedom.    [Reporter] What do you think about the way you have been  received?    [Perez Balladares] Fine. I think that it is most important  for people to maintain communications, to see each other, not to  go separate ways. I plan to continue doing this now as  president-elect, and you can be certain that as president I will  also be visiting the media and talking to them.    [Padilla Beliz] I think that these actions by the  president-elect are very positive. Let's hope the other people  in his party share this attitude. He is trying to comply with  and consolidate his promises for a national agreement. This is a  source of much enthusiasm. [end recording]</p>

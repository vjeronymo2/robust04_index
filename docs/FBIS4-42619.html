			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eberhard Wisdorff: "Between Arguments and </F> Emotions"]    [Text] The appointment of a successor to Jacques Delors,  chief of the European Union [EU] Commission, has developed into  a political event of the first degree. In the last few days,  the debate on the subject of a successor has called up many  emotions, some of them old ones.    The office of EU Commission chief, at the head of Europe, is  more important today than it was 10 years ago when Delors took  up office -- not just because the Frenchman himself has set new  standards for European unity, but also because the Brussels  leadership has assumed greater political significance, not least  because this year is the first time that the European parliament  must approve the new EU Commission chief in accordance with the  Maastricht treaty. Notwithstanding this, activities in Brussels  will continue to be in the limelight because the constant EU  expansion calls for further reforms, despite the widespread  Europe-weariness of the citizens.    Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, and  Jean-Luc  Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart, both of them Christian  Democrats, are two serious candidates for Delors' post.  Irishman Peter Sutherland, former EU secretary for economic  competition issues, and a successful GATT general secretary  linked to the Uruguay Round of talks, might also stand a chance  as a sort of compromise. The significance of Sir Leon Brittan,  former British secretary of state for foreign trade, lies in his  own ambition.    Whoever is appointed as the new EU Commission chief, who  would normally have to wait six months before assuming his new  office, must be viewed in the light of numerous other personnel  appointments, such as that of the new OECD general secretary, a  new head of the Western European Union, a new chairman of the EU  Council, and a chief of the new World Trade Organization.    What is certain is that German conduct in the question of a  successor of Delors' has caused undue sharp tones in the debate.  At quite an early stage, Bonn let it be known that, with  France, it was lending its support to the Belgian Dehaene, from  whom one expects a determined course of integration and who,  during his country's duty presidency of the EU in the second  half of 1993, proved himself to be a master of the art of  reaching a compromise in talks. Lubbers, on the other hand,  will long be negatively remembered for his hesitation during the  Brussels candidacy, as well as for his misinformed remarks about  Dutch problems caused by German unity.    What speaks in favor of Lubber's chairmanship of the EU  Commission is that his country has never been duty president of  the EU, apart from a six-month interim chairmanship held by the  well-known Agriculture Commissioner Sicco Manshot; has only just  surrendered its chairmanship of the European Monetary Union to  Germany; and has otherwise not been given very generous  treatment regarding the tenure of other EU posts.    In the last few days, Lubbers has taken the offensive and  with reference to the old fears in the smaller EU countries, has  stubbornly affirmed his candidacy. By supporting Dehaene, Paris  and Bonn might be expressing their disapproval of The Hague's  courtship of the British, who are not willing to integrate. It  will be difficult for Bonn to escape this cul-de-sac without any  damage.</p>

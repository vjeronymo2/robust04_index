			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The U.S. Scheme for Provoking a </F> Korean War Is More Conspicuous Than Ever"]    [Text] According to a foreign press report, U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry said in an NBC television interview on 3 April  that if the situation in the Korean peninsula does not change in  six more months, the United States would consider its so-called  diplomatic approach has failed and hinted that they would move  in the direction of imposing heavy pressure, including economic  sanctions. Then he added that he would not preclude the  possibility of a preemptive military attack if their diplomatic  and nonmilitary pressure proves unsuccessful.    This bellicose outburst by the incumbent U.S. defense  secretary is very out of the ordinary, and we must regard it as  grave. Perry's provocative outburst coupled with his recent  remark that they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war,  shows that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to provoke a new  war in Korea any time they choose.    This bellicose violent remark was not made accidentally.  Although the United States has raved that it is interested in  the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, this is false, judging by  the violent war remarks made recently by the U.S. military  leader. Perry's remarks also show that the United States has  only been scheming for a policy of crushing [apsal] the DPRK by  force.    Let me take a few instances. According to a recent  WASHINGTON POST issue, war fanatic Perry, babbling about our  so-called nuclear development, said that the United States would  stop our so-called nuclear weapons development even if it had to  pay the price of starting a war on the Korean peninsula again.  Saying that the U.S. strategy is taking step-by-step measures  while isolating North Korea, he stated that the United States  would take more serious measures.    Perry also disclosed that the parts and maintenance  personnel  of the U.S. forces' fighter planes are being dispatched to the  military bases in South Korea and Japan, that the South Korean  puppets are being prepared with some kind of weapon, and that  preparations are underway to deploy to South Korea the second  lot of launching pads for Patriot missiles. Moreover, he  unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent remarks of war  that the United States will deal an overwhelming air strike  against someone else's provocation within 24 hours.    What should be noted seriously is that he openly disclosed  that he will have in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets  during his forthcoming junket to South Korea on not only simple  military countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the  military measures should be taken. Perry's remark shows that he  himself undisguisedly disclosed that the purpose of his visit is  examining the preparations for the Korean war on the spot and  giving a new war order. Worse still, this time he once again  raved that he would not preclude the possibility of a preemptive  military attack. This vividly shows that they attempt to crush  our republic through a surprise armed attack. The military moves  perpetrated around the Korean peninsula clearly prove this.    After a spokesman of our country's Foreign Ministry on 4  April issued a statement rebuffing the so-called 31 March UN  Security Council president's statement urging us to accept an  additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  the imperialists' attempts to crush us militarily are all the  more stepped up.    First of all, extremely bustling moves are being perpetrated  in Japan. In a U.S. Air Force base in Yokota, the U.S.  imperialists' countless warplanes are preparing to make a sally  while assuming a posture for offense and defense, simulating  attacks on our Republic. Furthermore, the United States and the  South Korean puppets are staging joint aerial war exercises  against us in South Korea almost every day. The number of  planes that have taken part in the daily exercise have totalled  700 on the average. Warplanes of various types brought in from  overseas to South Korea are aimed at increasing their  capabilities of making a surprise attack on the North and at  enhancing cooperation between various flying corps.    The extremely hazardous situation, which resembles that of  the eve of 25 June 1950, is prevailing on the Korean peninsula  these days. The then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had  inspected the 38th parallel before the outbreak of war.  Likewise, today, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry tries to crawl  into [kiodulda] South Korea with the same intent.    All these facts show that the United States is driving the  situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war while  expanding its policies aimed at crushing us in a step-by-step  manner. However, the United States should know very well that  this kind of policy of power would never get by to us.    For us, we have strong defense capabilities that could stamp  out any aggressor in a stroke and the might of single-hearted  unity among the party, the leader [suryong], and the people.    The U.S. imperialists should squarely see the power of our  single-hearted unity, the invincible faith, and the steel-like  will, and not run amok recklessly. Only death will be given to  those who play with fire.</p>

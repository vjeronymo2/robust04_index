			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Voters left in no doubt about 'historic choice' - One member of the French electorate explains her referendum dilemma to Alice Rawsthorn EVEN when Ms Marie Bertrand arrived yesterday at the entrance of her local mairie, or town hall, in the fourth arrondissement of Paris to cast her vote in the Maastricht referendum, she had still not decided whether it would be Oui or Non. 'I just can't make up my mind,' she said. 'For years I've been pro-European unity, but the Germans make me really nervous. They're too powerful. I'm going to wait until the very last moment to decide. It's between me and the polling booth.' A brief glance at the weekend press on the corner news stand would have left Ms Bertrand with no doubts about the importance of her decision. The French newspapers, which have for weeks been swamped by articles on the merits and demerits of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty, all emphasised the drama of the knife-edge end to the referendum campaign. Un choix historique - a vous de dire ('An historic choice - it's up to you') was splashed across the front page of Le Journal de Dimanche. The weekend edition of Le Monde was more restrained, but no less resonant, with the headline Trente-huit millions d'electeurs francais decident de l'avenir de l'union europeenne' ('Thirty-eight million French voters decide the future of European union'). Voters, like Ms Bertrand, filed in and out of the fourth arrondissement town hall throughout the day. Its facade, like that of every other mairie in France, was covered with huge screens bearing posters from the various political parties. The Greens restricted themselves to a stark blue and white Oui a l'Europe. The extreme right National Front opted for a soft focus shot of its leader, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, trying his hardest to look avuncular, with the slogan Non a l'Europe. Non a Mitterrand. The surrounding streets were littered with the pale grey vans of the CRS riot police. Ordinary police, clad in their pale blue summer shirts, stood around the town hall entrance. 'It's not that we're expecting trouble,' said one. 'But we're here just in case.' Police were stationed around all the other polling stations and political buildings in Paris. The National Assembly on the Quai d'Orsay was shrouded by riot barriers, as was the Socialist party headquarters a few streets away on rue Solferino, where Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the party, gathered in the evening with other pro-Maastricht Socialists to hear the referendum results. On the other side of the Seine the 20 volunteers who had turned a small suite of offices on rue Francois Premier into the headquarters of the No camp, spent the day preparing for an evening reception for Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR politicians who have spearheaded the No campaign. The volunteers will today leave rue Francois Premier and the suite will revert to its usual role of Mr Seguin and Mr Pasqua's private offices. The centre of Paris, usually peaceful on sunny Sundays, was packed with cars as Parisians drove back early from their weekends on the coast or in the country to cast their votes. They returned to find the Oui and Non posters plastered along the main roads freshly defaced by graffiti and bright blue European community flags fluttering from the flagpoles of the grand hotels. Back at the mairie of the fourth arrondissement, Ms Bertrand may have procrastinated all the way to the ballot box but her fellow voters seemed more decisive. 'I voted No,' said Mr Didier Proffit, a 22-year-old advertising executive. 'The French people haven't been given enough information about the Maastricht Treaty and we haven't had long enough to consider it. In any case it's a question of history. There are certain things the French should treasure, like our currency. Who could treasure the Ecu?' Mr Guy Darouste, a 59-year-old engineer, disagreed. 'The French should say Yes to Maastricht,' he said. 'Europe is the future and we have to secure that future for our young people. I voted Yes for my children and grandchildren.' 'I voted Yes too,' said his wife, Christiane. 'We've been married for nearly 40 years and the Maastricht Treaty is about the only political issue we've ever agreed on.'</p>

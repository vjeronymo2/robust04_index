			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension proposals are a good start Sir, John Maples's pension reform proposals (Personal View, November 12) deserve a more thoughtful response than the knee-jerk defence of the status quo by Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds (Letters, November 16). John Plender has highlighted some of the problems of an unreformed system. Maples's ideas do not go far enough. The pensions industry is bedevilled by rules and regulations running to 1,600 pages, much of it unintelligible even to experienced practitioners. The Maples reform should be completed by removing totally the limitation on the level of occupational pension that an employer can provide. The restriction should be solely on the percentage of salary that an employer and employee can contribute to a pension fund. The levels should be set at a percentage at least as high as those available to the self-employed on an age-related basis under the personal pension rules. If the pension fund performs well, why should not the employee benefit? One more reform is needed. Employers should also be obliged to make minimum pension contributions on behalf of all employees with more than two years' continuous employment, and they should be obliged to pay this either to the company scheme or to an employee's personal pension plan, if that is the wish of the employee. In this way we would begin to move towards real portability and transparency and reverse the creeping corporatism of the pension industry. The present system, with its concentration of such vast wealth and power in the hands of very few unaccountable institutions, is the antithesis of Tory philosophy, be it wet, dry, left or right. The late Philip Chappell understood this only too well and John Maples's proposals are very much in the spirit of Philip's ideas. At the moment the pensions debate is bedevilled by too many corporate vested interests and too many government departments tinkering with ad hoc reforms. Responsibility for reform must be centred in one ministry, either the Treasury or Department of Social Security, but not both and a raft of quangos. One minister at minister of state level should be given the task of restructuring state and private pensions over the next couple of years. All bets should be off and the aim should be for simplicity and less not more legislation and regulation. John Maples has provided an excellent start.

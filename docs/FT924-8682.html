			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / People: Dales succeeds Hodson at Nationwide Now is not the optimum time to become the finance director of a building society. The best hope of Alistair Dales, who will become finance director of Nationwide Building Society in January, is that things will have calmed down by then after what he expects will be 'a rocky couple of months'. Dales' short-term pessimism about society results due before the end of the year is balanced by a suitably caut-ious optimism about the longer term. He believes societies are 'on the way to the road to recovery' from difficulties created by the slump in the domestic housing market. He will succeed Daniel Hodson, deputy chief executive and finance director of the society, whose appointment as chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange was announced at the end of last month. But he is keen to dispel any notion that the change will lead to a radical change of direction. The most that Dales, aged 43 and currently divisional director for finance and controls, contemplates is 'tweaking a couple of things at the edges'. He expresses determination to carry on the policies of Hodson, who recruited him from Morgan Guaranty to Nationwide in 1989. But he is not above expressing public admiration for the 'degree of creativity' shown by other societies in trying to stimulate sales, and rent repossessed properties: 'There is a lot to be done, but there is a lot of creativity out there, and a commitment to get things sorted out.' Tim Melville-Ross, the society's chief executive, is full of praise for Dales' range of experience at Morgan Guaranty in Brussels, Amsterdam and London. But his main task for the moment will be the hard graft of cutting costs and improving operations in the traditional domestic business.</p>

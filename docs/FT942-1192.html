			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Heseltine ready for postal sell-off Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has resolved his differences with the prime minister over the drafting of the green paper on the future of the Post Office, now expected to be published next week, Roland Rudd writes. Mr John Major rejected the first draft, believing Mr Heseltine had not given sufficient weight to the option of leaving the Post Office completely in the public domain. The Department of Trade and Industry believes its preferred option of selling 51 per cent of the shares in Royal Mail and Parcelforce is still given prominence over the other two options. These are to make the Post Office more commercialised in the public sector or to sell 49 per cent of the shares in Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Mr Heseltine wants 10 per cent of the shares reserved for the workforce, the maximum number allowed under Stock Exchange rules. He proposes a regulatory structure aimed at strengthening rural services and uniform letter delivery.</p>

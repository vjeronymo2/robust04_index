			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Sex-case tribunals may curb publicity INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS are to be given the power to restrict press reporting of sexual harassment cases, following a late government amendment to the employment bill, which is going through the House of Lords. The amendment, due to be tabled today, is certain to be accepted. It will prevent either alleged victims or alleged harassers from being identified while a case is being heard. The measure could also be extended to protecting witnesses. The Equal Opportunities Commission has been arguing for some time that many women are put off from bringing harassment cases because of what is seen as sensationalised reporting by the tabloid press of the evidence. It knows of cases where women have received hate mail and have even been attacked after their addresses have been published. Any reporting restrictions imposed will last only until a tribunal reaches its final judgment, unless the case involves allegations of indecent assault or rape, when protection for the alleged victim would last for life. Judge Timothy Lawrence, president of the industrial tribunals in England and Wales, wrote to the government last year to express his concern about the lack of protection for sexual harassment cases. Other bodies, including community law centres, have also put forward evidence of distress and embarrassment caused by the reporting of tribunals. Hammersmith and Fulham Community Law Centre in London wrote to the Department of Employment: 'It is our experience that many clients simply do not make applications to the industrial tribunal because of their anxiety about the hearing. 'In many of the cases that we deal with, the woman has never spoken about her experiences before, and even discussing the harassment in private presents difficulties . . . It is our view that any steps which could be taken to increase the privacy of the hearing would encourage applicants to proceed with their claims.'</p>

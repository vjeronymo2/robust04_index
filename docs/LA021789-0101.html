			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. J. DIAMOND: NOTARIES, PUBLIC CAN BE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER  </P> <P> Anyone needing something notarized used to go to the corner bank or savings and  loan or maybe a neighborhood realty office. Now those places often say there is  no notary public in the office.  </P> <P> This may not be the case. They're there, "but they're hiding," says Charles  Faerber, vice president of the National Notary Assn. in Canoga Park. Notaries,  like everyone else, have had their share of lawsuits, and to limit their  liability, says Faerber, they limit their work to documents involving their  employer.  </P> <P> Notary work, oddly, takes little training or expertise and makes little money,  but is indispensable. Like the ancient scribes from whom they're descended (the  Roman "notarius" among them), modern notaries serve society as official  witnesses to oaths and contracts. Indeed, says Faerber, "every civilized nation  has some kind of government-appointed impartial witness to make sure that  somebody is who they say they are on important documents."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Varies by State  </P> <P> Notaries of old also drew up documents and later stored them, and in many  countries today, notaries have similar authority and commensurate training. In  the United States, the field, it's said, has been "democratized"; most of our 4  million notaries just take oaths and affidavits, or witness signing of trust  deeds, loan papers and other documents, checking the signer's identity.  </P> <P> But it's variable. In several states, notaries can perform marriages; in  Louisiana, they can draft legal documents (indeed, many are lawyers); in  Pennsylvania, they handle transfers of car titles. Similarly, to become a  notary in some states, says Milton Valera, president of the NNA, "you just buy  a stamp." Florida's 350,000 notaries fill in an application and pay $25.  California's 150,000 notaries must be fingerprinted, can miss only two  true-false questions on a 15-question, open-book test of information from a  printed pamphlet, and need a surety bond of $10,000.  </P> <P> Easily won and ill-paying (top fees run $5 per notarized signature), the  notary's position is nevertheless sensitive. If notaries are willing to  notarize when the wrong person, or no person at all, appears before them, they  can abet a lot of white-collar crime -- illegitimate title transfers, odometer  fraud, boat theft (this a Florida problem), insurance fraud. In border cities,  unscrupulous notaries capitalize on the quasi-legal role of the notario in  Latin American countries, charging for immigration "counseling" and documents  available free elsewhere, even promising immigrants legal status they can't  deliver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Careless  </P> <P> Some notaries are not criminal, but careless. A few years ago, California's  Secretary of State March Fong Eu reported that of 4,000 cases of alleged  notarial misconduct, "over 90% . . . stem from carelessness on the part of the  notary public." Typically, said the report, the notary failed to require the  signer's presence (often, says Faerber, taking a boss's word about the  signature) or failed to establish the signer's true identity, or to keep the  notary seal out of strange hands.  </P> <P> Complaints to California's Notary Division about alleged misconduct are  investigated, and a notary's license could be suspended or revoked. In many  states, however, the entity that grants the commissions has neither  investigative personnel nor authority to suspend.  </P> <P> Notaries everywhere have been subject to lawsuits, threatening in both number  and size, and resulting in higher premiums for the liability insurance that  many notaries now buy. Some challenged industry practice -- a 1981 California  appellate decision, for example (Allstate Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Lotito),  which found a notary negligent for notarizing a signature on a grant deed that  was later labeled a forgery. Lotito, like most notaries, relied on such paper  proofs of identity as drivers licenses and passports: The court, drawing on an  1872 statute, said a notary must personally know the signer.  </P> <P> "For several weeks," says Valera, "notarization essentially came to a halt,"  given the impossibility of knowing all customers in today's society. The case  left a residue of anxiety about the nation's outmoded notary statutes, although  California's Legislature, among others, immediately passed a law allowing  notaries to rely on such documents for identification.  </P> <P> Even more threatening were the lawsuits "where notaries were thrown in just  because their name appeared on a document," says Faerber. The largest was a  $660-million suit involving a San Diego notary who had notarized a project  manager's signature on legal interrogatories involving an accident at a  construction firm. The honesty of the interrogatories was later challenged, and  the notary included among the defendants only because his name appeared on the  document in question; although he was ultimately dismissed from the suit, he  had to hire a lawyer and defend himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defensive Notaries  </P> <P> One result of all the questions about notaries' activities is more aggressive  state regulation. Thirty three states now require surety bonds that give  customers some recourse when a notary is negligent, and some are increasing the  value of the bond required, says a spokesman for Western Surety Co. in Sioux  Falls, S.D. Many states are revising their laws or regulations on notaries: In  Florida, for example, a governor's commission is looking into complaints  against notaries, whose positions have no educational requirements and whose  activities are not policed.  </P> <P> Another result is defensive notaries, those notaries-in-hiding who "have heard  of other notaries being sued," says Faerber, "and are very wary." There seems,  however, to be some ambivalence about this wariness; trade press and trade  experts continually warn of the danger of unjustified lawsuits, while they  reiterate that notaries who mind the P's and Q's of required procedure have  nothing to fear.  </P> <P> None of this explanation is much help to the person who needs a notary on some  business that doesn't directly involve his bank, his attorney or his realtor.  Preferring to deal, as before, with an impersonal but familiar institution, he  must look around his own company for notaries, or try one of the independent,  on-call notaries who advertise in the phone books in larger cities.  </P> <P> The public might well question how many notaries now are really notaries  public, while notaries ask how public they can be when they're held liable for  making reasonable judgments about the identity of strangers.  </P></p>

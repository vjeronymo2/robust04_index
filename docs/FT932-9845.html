			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords setbacks for leasehold plan MR JOHN MAJOR's attempts to unite his party suffered a further jolt last night when a revolt in the House of Lords led to ministers being defeated on a Conservative peer's amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Bill. Peers voted by 114 to 57 in favour of an amendment tabled by Lord Cavendish of Furness that exempts about 60 stately homes from the government's proposals for allowing leaseholders to buy their freeholds. Later the government accepted an amendment imposing a residency requirement  -so at least half of leaseholders seeking to buy a freehold must have lived in the property for 12 months or more. Ministers suffered a further setback when a technical hitch allowed through a Labour-backed amendment on leases for some Housing Association properties intended for elderly and disabled people.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECADE ENDED IN BLAZE OF HATE;  </P> <P> CRIMES: THE NUMBER OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST BLACKS, JEWS AND GAYS LAST  YEAR WERE TOPS IN THE '80S, THE COUNTY'S HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION SAYS.  </P> <P> In January of last year, a black family in Tujunga discovered a noose hanging  from a tree on their front lawn. A racial epithet was chalked on the tree  trunk.  </P> <P> In February, a young "skinhead" in La Crescenta threatened his Jewish teacher  with a gun.  </P> <P> In June, two "gay bashers" attacked a man in Hollywood, beating him with bricks  and rocks until his leg and ribs were broken.  </P> <P> Those were just three of 378 hate crimes -- those motivated by race, religion  or sexual orientation -- that were reported in Los Angeles County in 1989,  making it the worst year for such activity in the past decade, according to two  studies released Thursday.  </P> <P> The reports, released by the county's Commission on Human Relations, say hate  crimes rose throughout the county last year, with racially motivated crimes  outnumbering those prompted by religion for the first time since the commission  began collecting statistics a decade ago.  </P> <P> In 1989, the commission said, 167 race-related crimes were reported,  representing a 75% increase over 1988. Meanwhile, crimes against religious  groups went up 12.6% in the same period, from 111 to 125. The panel also  documented 86 hate crimes based on sexual orientation, a 41% increase from  1988.  </P> <P> Eugene Mornell, the commission's executive director, described the findings as  "extremely disturbing." However, he noted, the studies did reveal one bright  spot: authorities made 90 arrests for hate crimes in 1989, three times the  previous record for annual arrests.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who held a press conference  Thursday to announce the findings, added: "There is both bad news and good news  in these reports, although unfortunately the bad news outweighs the good."  </P> <P> The commission, created in 1944, is one of the oldest agencies of its kind in  the United States. It is charged with promoting racial and religious harmony as  well as monitoring violence between ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Although the commission believes hate crimes are still vastly under-reported,  Mornell said the rising statistics may be attributed in part to increased  reporting by victims. But mostly, he said, population shifts have caused ethnic  tensions to rise, particularly as whites have become a minority in many areas  of the county.  </P> <P> Moreover, Mornell said, the problem is likely to get worse before it gets  better.  </P> <P> "The population is changing," he said, "and people will continue to feel  fearful and threatened."  </P> <P> Although hate crimes against Latinos, Middle Easterners and Asians are  increasing, blacks and Jews are by far the most frequent targets, the  commission reported.  </P> <P> "The commission believes that anti-Jewish and anti-black bigotry are perhaps  the most firmly entrenched forms of prejudice in our society," the panel wrote  in a review of the past 10 years called "A Decade of Bigotry."  </P> <P> Indeed, during the 1980s, 62% of all racially motivated crimes were directed at  blacks, while 92% of all religious crimes were directed at Jews. By comparison,  Muslims were the second-most frequent target of crimes against any religious  group, accounting for just 3% of all such incidents in the past decade.  </P> <P> David Lehrer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith,  said the county's findings generally parallel those of his organization. Lehrer  cited skinhead youth gangs -- who are often associated with white supremacist  causes -- "trash TV talk shows" and a "decline in public civility," as reasons  for the rise in crimes against Jews.  </P> <P> The commission reported that young white men are most often responsible for  hate crimes, and that graffiti -- insulting remarks scrawled on homes,  businesses and houses of worship -- is the most common form of such crime.  </P> <P> But violent acts certainly played a role in the statistics, especially in  crimes against lesbians and homosexuals.  </P> <P> During 1988 and 1989, the only years that the commission has gathered  statistics on crimes motivated by sexual orientation, assaults accounted for  nearly two-thirds of such crimes.  </P> <P> The commission reported that some victims suffered long-term disability from  the attacks. "The term gay-bashing," it wrote, "is unfortunately accurate."  </P> <P> Thomas J. Coleman Jr., coordinator of an anti-violence hot line run by the Los  Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, agreed. He said verbal abuse  against gays is decreasing but violence is on the rise.  </P> <P> "People are being shot at, being beaten, being robbed and during the robbery,  during the beating, people will make references to sexual orientation and that  really does concern us," he said. "It represents not only a problem as far as  individuals but it's also an attack against us as a community."  </P> <P> HATE CRIME RECORD  </P> <P> Hate crimes-those motivated by race, religion or sexual orientation-reached  record highs in 1989, according to the Los Angeles County Commission on Human  Relations.  </P> <P> In two reports released Thursday, the commission documented 378 hate crimes  last year, up from 267 the year before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HATE CRIMES BY RACE/ETHNICITY OF VICTIM  </P> <P> Black: 96  </P> <P> Latino: 22  </P> <P> Asian: 19  </P> <P> Armenian: 10  </P> <P> Arab: 7  </P> <P> Other White: 6  </P> <P> Multiple Races: 5  </P> <P> Iranian: 2  </P> <P> </P> <P> GROWTH IN HATE CRIMES  </P> <P> '81: Racial Hate Crimes: 4  </P> <P> '81: Religious Hate Crimes: 61  </P> <P> '82: Racial Hate Crimes: 15  </P> <P> '82: Religious Hate Crimes: 101  </P> <P> '83: Racial Hate Crimes: 11  </P> <P> '83: Religious Hate Crimes: 81  </P> <P> '84: Racial Hate Crimes: 13  </P> <P> '84: Religious Hate Crimes: 70  </P> <P> '85: Racial Hate Crimes: 13  </P> <P> '85: Religious Hate Crimes: 71  </P> <P> '86: Racial Hate Crimes: 58  </P> <P> '86: Religious Hate Crimes: 95  </P> <P> '87: Racial Hate Crimes: 79  </P> <P> '87: Religious Hate Crimes: 115  </P> <P> '88: Racial Hate Crimes: 95  </P> <P> '88: Religious Hate Crimes: 111  </P> <P> '88: Sexual Orientation Crimes (Data available for two years only): 61  </P> <P> '89: Racial Hate Crimes: 167  </P> <P> '89: Religious Hate Crimes: 125  </P> <P> '89: Sexual Orientation Crimes (Data available for two years only): 86  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMMER HINTS  </P> <P> This is in reference to the article, "Tooling Up: A Rookie's Guide on What to  Buy" (Sept. 3).  </P> <P> The author, Charlyne Varkonyi of the Baltimore Sun, put forward some misleading  and potentially dangerous recommendations concerning the purchase of a hammer.  </P> <P> Varkonyi states, "Look for a cast rather than forged-steel claw hammer of  smoothly polished steel. . . ."  </P> <P> Fortunately, I doubt that any consumer would be able to find a hammer with a  cast head. Any good hammer is always drop-forged steel. Cast metal breaks  easily and can send chips flying. Forging is a process that strengthens steel  and is necessary for any tool subject to stress and pounding, such as a claw  hammer.  </P> <P> I find it hard to believe that Michael DiMenna, owner of Schumann Hardware in  Baltimore, who is quoted by Varkonyi, would tell her to select a cast rather  than a forged hammer. She must have lost something in the translation.  </P> <P> EARL A. WORCESTER  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P> <P> Editor's note: The letter writers are correct: Forged-steel claw hammers are  safer than cast types. Varkonyi reports that the information on hammers was  transposed in the article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

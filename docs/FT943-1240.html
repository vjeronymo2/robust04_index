			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Salinas campaigns tolead world trade body President Carlos Salinas of Mexico today launches his public campaign to become head of the proposed World Trade Organisation with a call for governments to intensify efforts to ratify the Uruguay Round trade agreement. Mr Salinas is one of two leading candidates to head the WTO, which is expected to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade early next year. The appointee will be chosen by consensus later in the autumn. The other main candidate is Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, who is being backed by the EU. Mr Salinas, who is expected to receive US support, says the new organisation has to be: Representative of world trade. The 20 countries, including Russia and the Ukraine, seeking admission to the world trading system should be admitted promptly; A reliable institution for its members, which requires that all governments be committed to its rules and be engaged in the WTO at the highest level; Responsive to the evolving needs of the international economy.

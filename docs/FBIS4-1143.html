			<p>BFN     [Text] Accra, 23 Apr (PANA) -- Ghanaian intelligence  officials have uncovered a coup plot that would have been  executed in the West African country between 7th-15th April, the  state-owned [DAILY] GRAPHIC newspaper reported yesterday. In a  front-page report citing intelligence sources, the GRAPHIC said  the "attempt to destabilize the country" included threats of  assassinations of editors of two private newspapers who have  been critical of President Jerry Rawlings. "Highly placed  ghanaian intelligence sources have confirmed that they believed  the reported threats were part of a destabilization plan. The  attempt had been slated for between 7th and 15th April", the  newspaper said.    The STATESMAN, the newspaper of the opposition center-right  New Patriotic Party (NPP), said in a story on 17th April that  its editor, Haruna Attah, the editor of the FREE PRESS, Eben  Quarcoo, and a former close aide of Rawlings, Major Courage  Quarshigah, had received death threats. The GRAPHIC said these  threats were being treated as part of investigations into  alleged plots to oust the government.    The reported threat was either intended to provide a decoy  or  a pretext for whatever action had been intended, it quoted  security officials as saying.    "Ghanaian intelligence had become aware of intense efforts  to  infiltrate the conflict areas in the north and to use the  conflict as a cover for an attempt to overthrow the government",  the GRAPHIC said.    The newspaper quoted security documents which stated that  there were "increased dissident activities designed to take  advantage of the northern conflict and to link up with  like-minded forces inside the country". It said attempts to  oust the government, which ceased following Rawlings' victory at  the polls in 1992, started again late in 1993.    "From January (1994), persistent reports filtered through of  intense activities along the West African coast by retired  service personnel and others who remained in exile to renew  their illegal actions against the government", it said.    The GRAPHIC reported that the security sources told it that  some known dissidents had made attempts to obtain support from  sources in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. "Contacts had been  established in Accra with some retired service personnel and  some politicians. There were meetings in and around Accra and  Kumasi attended by high- profile politicians", it said.    The report did not say whether there have been any arrests.</p>

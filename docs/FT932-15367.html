			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Manufacturing output prices remain steady THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving factories rose only marginally last month, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that output prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in March compared with February. The year-on-year rate of increase was unchanged at 3.7 per cent. The slackness of price rises was highlighted further by the very small rise in output prices excluding food, drink and tobacco. This index - which gives a better picture of underlying trends - rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent month-on-month and 2.6 per cent compared with the same month a year ago. The CSO estimated that excise-duty changes in the Budget added about 0.2 per cent to the output price index last month, compared with 0.4 per cent for March last year. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations and suggest that manufacturers remain reluctant to pass on the higher costs of raw materials to other industries and retailers. Input prices - mainly raw materials and fuels - continued to rise. On an unadjusted basis they rose 0.1 per cent last month, taking the year-on-year rate of increase to 8.3 per cent, the highest level since July 1987. The latest rise compares with 7.2 per cent in the year to February and suggests that the effects of sterling's devaluation in September are still coming through, with imported materials accounting for about 60 per cent of manufacturers' raw material costs. Seasonally adjusted, the input prices index rose 0.5 per cent month-on-month. Many economists expect input prices to continue rising for the rest of the year although a stronger pound should slow the upward movement. Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS, the investment bank, said: 'While sterling should enjoy a mild appreciation in the second half of the year, a sustained rise in commodity prices should push up input prices.' The CSO said rises in the prices of food materials were largely offset by seasonal falls in the costs of electricity to industrial consumers. A breakdown shows that the sharpest increases in input prices have been in petroleum products, and food manufacturing materials. In the year to March prices of petroleum products rose 16.7 per cent, while imported food manufacturing materials rose 14.2 per cent.</p>

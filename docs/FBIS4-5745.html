			<p>BFN     [Report by Tran Trong Chuy]    [Summary] The 15th Executive Committee of the Quang  Nam-Danang Province party organization recently held its midterm  party conference to discuss socioeconomic targets to be achieved  during the 1994-95 period.    "All those who spoke unanimously agreed with a political  report presented at the conference. They said: Over the past  two years, particularly in 1993, Quang Nam-Danang Province  continued to maintain its socioeconomic stability. Its  socioeconomic situation, in certain areas, continued to develop.  Its economic structure is shifting in a positive direction.  The latent potential of various economic components is being  generated. The province's gross social product increased from  1,000 billion dong in 1991 to nearly 1,120 billion dong in 1993  while its budget revenue rose from 190 billion dong in 1991 to  over 500 billion in 1993. Its average industrial output value  increased 8 percent per year. A number of economic sectors  developed fairly well such as marine products, import-export,  and tourism service."    Thanks to the growth of foreign economic relations, the  industrial sector of Quang Nam-Danang Province is improving.  "The construction of many industrial projects has started such  as the Hoa Khuong cement factory and a local branch of the Hoang  Thach cement factory. Various new industrial zones, including  the An Don-Nuoc Man processing zone, are taking shape in Dien  Nam and Dien Ngoc Districts, and in the southern part of Hai Van  Pass."    Weaknesses discussed during the conference consisted of  "Quang Nam-Danang having fallen behind economically when  compared with other localities. Its economic development is  slow because there still exist many backward areas, particularly  those in the mountain region. Delegates from Que Son, Tien  Phuoc, and Tra My Districts reported that 50 to 60 percent of  their local populations are now still in a state of food  shortage due to the absence of farmland irrigation projects and  other grass roots facilities."    The conference unanimously held that "the main reasons for  this situation were a failure on the part of the provincial  party standing committee and people's committee to meet new  development requirements." All participating delegates shared  Comrade Vo Chi Cong's views expressed at the conference that  Quang Nam-Danang does not lack talent. The problem is how to  gather all the wisdom of this talent.    In the period ahead, the province needs to promptly shift  its  economy in the direction of industrialization; achieve an  industrial output value increase of 45 percent by 1995;  specialize its agricultural, forestry, and fishery production;  create more exports; step up the program to do away with hunger  and reduce poverty; increase the annual export value to $50  million; and reduce the agricultural workforce to 60 or 65  percent of the total population in order to save manpower for  the processing industry.    "The midterm party conference of the Quang Nam-Danang  Province party organization called for an annual gross domestic  product increase from 10 percent upward."    The issues of party building and internal unity were also  fervently debated. "Many delegates pointed out that party  building and party management at various echelons have displayed  many shortcomings. A number of party cadres and members have  suffered a dereliction in quality. Their knowledge is not  current and their sense of discipline is poor. Personal  jealousy has led to prolonged disunity among a number of cadres.  Many delegates held that far from being an ethical problem of  party cadres and members, corruption has become a political  problem that has caused a loss of confidence among the people.  This has been exploited by the enemy and has, of course,  adversely affected the party's popularity." The conference  regarded this as a central issue to be settled immediately in  order to ensure the unity of thoughts and actions in the entire  party organization.</p>

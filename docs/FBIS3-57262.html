			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 15 feature] </F>   [Text] The Azeri parliament is still to give its assessment  of the January 1990 tragedy in Baku. Last Friday the opposition  deputies blocked again the parliament's decision on the issue.  Opposition deputies believe that only a new, democratically  elected parliament is able to evaluate the events of three years  ago when over 100 Baku residents died.    The leader of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov  and representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan believe  that the present parliament formed under ex-president Ayaz  Mutalibov demonstrated more than once its unprincipled approach  and took decisions to please each leadership. The Front's  faction demands the disbandment of parliament and the holding of  new elections.    The opposition disagrees with the point of view of President  Geydar Aliyev and other leaders who are convinced that the  former First Secretary of the Azeri Communist Party Central  Committee Abdurakhman Vezirov, the then Chairman of the  republic's Council of Ministers A. Mutalibov and the then KGB  Chairman Vagif Guseynov are to bear responsibility for what  happened January 20, 1990. The deputies of the People's Front  of Azerbaijan and of the Party for National Independence believe  that the political leadership of the former Soviet Union who  took the decision to bring in troops in Baku are the main  culprits of the tragedy.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential Mr Mick Newmarch has spent the best part of three years clearing dead wood at the Prudential. Even Mercantile and General, the reinsurance business which blighted yesterday's figures, has been chopped down to size since the year-end. Earnings growth from here on may depend on the core life and pensions business. It remains an open question whether Mr Newmarch will prove as adept at delivering organic growth. But the Pru may now be inclined to look at acquisitions. Its stubborn refusal to reveal the state of its balance sheet yesterday - hardly the standard of disclosure one might expect from a large institutional investor  -suggests an unusual degree of sensitivity. Still, the Pru is right that a conventional balance sheet would ignore the value of its life fund. Making an acquisition through the fund could be one way of unlocking that value for shareholders.</p>

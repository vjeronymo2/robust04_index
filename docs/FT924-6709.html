			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Growing markets for 'green' goods TIGHTER environmental standards offer business 'huge opportunities' in the fast growing market for 'green' goods and services, a conference on European business and the environment heard yesterday. Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, said the market for environmental goods was already worth more than the global aerospace industry, at some Dollars 200bn a year. Over the next eight years, he said, the total market would be worth Pounds 850bn in the EC and Pounds 1,000bn in the US. The conference coincided with the publication of a survey for the European Commission, showing that 86 per cent of EC citizens are concerned about the effect of industry on the environment. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC environment commissioner, underlined that it was 'in the interests of industry to pursue a policy which fully integrates environmental considerations.' Mr Van Miert, later reiterated that the Commission remained 'fully committed' to its proposal for an energy tax, equivalent to up to Dollars 10 on a barrel of oil by the year 2000.</p>

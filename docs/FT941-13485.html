			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4.9% after reform bill rejection The Nikkei average plummeted 4.9 per cent as political uncertainty following last Friday's rejection of the political reform bill in the upper house triggered heavy selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index lost 954.19, its biggest one-day drop, to 18,353.24 as investors and brokers who had bought stock ahead of the vote rushed to adjust positions. The Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 70.85, or 4.5 per cent, to 1,499.06 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index recovered 5.77 to 1,243.67. 'It was total confusion,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities, describing the panicky selling which wiped out 4.3 per cent of the market's total equity capitalisation. However, he added that foreign investors were buying some of the shares which domestic investment trusts and financial institutions had unloaded. The vote in the upper house came after the market had closed last Friday, stunning investors who had bought heavily in expectation of the bill's passage. Overseas buying of Japanese shares this year is believed to be on a medium to long term investment basis, offering a relatively low risk of selling on a snap fall in share prices. But an increase in political uncertainty could stall further support from foreign parts. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that although prospects of lower interest rates were positive for the stock market, he was cautious on the short term due to the possibility that the cabinet would be forced to resign, which would be followed by a general election next month. The Nikkei opened at the high of the day of 19,294.43 and hit a low of 18,320.33 just before the market closed. More than 80 per cent of first section stocks were left untraded in the first hour of the session due to mounting sell orders and lack of buyers. Volume totalled 360m shares, against 462m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,105 to 15, with 17 issues unchanged. Bank shares, which had recently been firm on arbitrage-linked buying, were among the heaviest losers, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y170 to Y3,080. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gave up Y40,000 to Y840,000, ending its 17-day rising streak. East Japan Railway shed Y35,000 to Y461,000. High-technology stocks faced heavy selling from dealers. Sony retreated Y200 to Y5,660 and Fujitsu Y41 to Y888. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 874.22 to 20,200.56 in volume of 49.8m shares. Roundup If anything, Tokyo's woes diverted funds into other Asian markets, although some brokers said that an extended fall in Japanese stocks could depress the region. BANGKOK forged ahead 3.8 per cent in moderate trading, speculators concentrating on the finance sector in anticipation of strong 1993 earnings. The SET index closed 53.13 higher at 1,461.59 in turnover of Bt13.8bn. The finance sector jumped 7.7 per cent, banks following with a 4 per cent gain. Brokers said Thai investors dominated trading, with foreigners continuing to stay on the sidelines. Nava Finance was up Bt18 to Bt226, Asia Securities Bt11 to Bt128, Dhana Siam Bt44 to Bt578 and Finance One Bt34 to Bt384. BOMBAY put on 2.7 per cent, rising sharply in the second half of the trading session on renewed demand from foreign institutional investors. The BSE index finished at a provisional 3,853.1, up 100.6. Brokers said there was aggressive buying, particularly by Morgan Stanley, which recently attracted Rp9bn in a mutual fund offer, and Unit Trust of India, the country's largest fund of this type. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index ended 36.54, or 1.6 per cent, stronger at 2,318.27, with institutional buying again in evidence. Jurong Shipyard moved forward 80 cents to SDollars 14.30, F &amp; N 80 cents to SDollars 17.50 and Keppel Corp 60 cents to SDollars 11.60. HONG KONG ended higher, but off its peak after profit-taking had trimmed early gains. Brokers said Japanese and US investment houses diverted funds from falling Tokyo stocks into other Asian markets, but profit-taking hit afternoon trade and the Hang Seng index closed a net 140.72, or 1.2 per cent, ahead at 11,600.09, down from a morning high of 11,708.56. Hutchison Whampoa led the market higher on news that it was buying out the management contract of the Hong Kong Hilton. Investors interpreted the move as signall-ing that it would cash in on the redevelopment value of the hotel site and Hutch-ison shares advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 41. SEOUL saw renewed interest in asset play counters and the composite index added 10.21 at 887.96. KUALA LUMPUR finished mostly lower on lack of support, although gains in selected blue chips left the KLSE composite index 0.79 firmer at 1,064.55. AUSTRALIA lost ground as a softer gold price and the plunging Japanese stock market encouraged investors to take profits. The All Ordinaries index closed 25.8 down at 2,224.5 in turnover of ADollars 494.8m, gold shares dropping just over 4 per cent to 2,547.6. KARACHI ended sharply lower for the third straight session, the KSE index losing 68.08 to 2,202.21, although it recovered slightly from a fall of 79.04 one hour before the close.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Hopes of rate cut SENTIMENT in the sterling cash and futures markets fell sharply yesterday morning following revelations of a new row between the Bundesbank and the UK Treasury over the sterling crisis. However, the mood in all markets improved after the Bundesbank injected a quick tender allotment of DM15.6bn into the German money market at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent. The Bundesbank's last three liquidity injections have been at declining rates of 9.2 per cent, 9.0 per cent, and 8.9 per cent, leading some traders to think that there will be a cut in German short-term rates at the Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting today. The disagreements between the Bundesbank and the UK Treasury underlined the uncertainty about the future direction of UK economic policy. One discount house director remained confident that there would be another cut in UK base rates before the end of the month, possibly at the Conservative party conference next week. But the prime mover behind a base rate cut would be Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, and his position may have been seriously undermined by the latest turn in the Anglo-German row. A clearing bank dealer said yesterday that the immediate aftermath of Mr Lamont's resignation would be a rise in money market rates, because a new chancellor would be under pressure not to show a lax view on rates in his first months in office. The December short sterling contract opened 12 basis points lower at 91.68, and dropped another 3 points to bottom out at 91.65 in the morning. News of the German intervention brightened the market's mood and the December contract closed at 91.88, 8 basis points up on the day. The December contract on the French futures exchange closed 20 basis points up at 90.70. The Bank of England took most of the day to remove a shortage of Pounds 900m. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 65m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. The Bank later purchased Pounds 7m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 32m in a repo at 8 15/16 per cent, Pounds 16m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 304m of Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 4m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 370m.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores rare good news Wall Street US stock markets ended a difficult week on a negative note yesterday, with share prices finishing slightly lower in spite of some rare positive economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.33 at 3,285.71. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended a touch lower, down 0.48 at 411.60, while the Amex composite closed 0.03 higher at 382.53 and the Nasdaq composite 0.38 firmer at 565.62. Turnover on the NYSE was 165m shares. Overnight losses on foreign markets, notably Tokyo and London, set the tone for a downbeat opening in New York. Concern that the US might have to lead the UN in military action against Iraq added to the market's gloom. The only bright spot on the horizon was the announcement from the Commerce department that factory orders for durable goods rose by 2.3 per cent in June, a bigger than expected increase. On their own, however, the durable goods figures (which some analysts believe volatile and unreliable as economic indicators) were unable to give the market much of a boost, and share prices struggled to make any gains amid quiet trading. Among individual stocks, profit-taking was the order of the day in the banks sector, despite the strong performance registered by most of the country's banks in the second quar ter. Chemical, which said yesterday that it was on target to reduce payrolls by 6,200 over the coming year, did best, rising Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 . In contrast, Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 , Chase Manhattan fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25, BankAmerica lost Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 and Wells Fargo gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 68 5/8 . Frank B Hall plunged Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 2 7/8 after the company agreed to sell much of its operating assets to Aon for Dollars 475m in cash and stock. The news left Aon Dollars 3 lower Dollars 45 1/2 . Great Lakes Chemical firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 after the company said its Octel Associates subsidiary was implementing price increases on its line of alkyl-based fuel additives. W R Grace firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35 7/8 after Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, raised its rating of the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy' and predicted that the shares would benefit from the recovery in quarterly earnings from a disappointing opening three months. McDonald's rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 7/8 in heavy trading as bargain buyers moved into the stock after Thursday's earnings-inspired losses. Canada TORONTO stocks coasted to a lower close as traders abandoned the market early. Weakness overseas and poor second-quarter earnings in Canada sent shares lower in the opening minutes, but the market quickly settled into a tight range. The TSE 300 closed down 11.37 at 3,400.87. Declines led advances 293 to 232 on very slow volume of 20.0 million shares.</p>

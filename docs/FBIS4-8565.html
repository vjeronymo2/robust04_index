			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Daniel Kumermann: "Slovak Future Is Czech </F> Challenge"]    [Text] Slovakia has, once again, found its way onto the  front pages of our newspapers. This time, the story was received  with more than a little malicious joy.    The big pain in the neck is gone at last. Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar has been deposed, losing in almost the same way  that he kept winning.    Although the Czech public is almost unified in its rejection  of Meciar, Czech politicians aren't so sure. At least that's  what an observer might assume from their cautious treatment of  this change in leadership. They seemed more careful than  diplomacy alone would oblige them to be. Another curious sign is  the degree to which politicians' reactions varied, even within a  single party.    Despite all his faults, Vladimir Meciar was a rather  predictable politician. In any political situation one had only  to imagine all the potential options and choose the most  preposterous, and that would almost invariably be the course he  took.    Meciar did not just offend everyone's common values and good  sense. He seemed to reach deeper, confounding the very fabric of  regular life. The only unsolved mystery is whether he did all  these things according to some ingenious plan or whether his  method of leading by the force of sheer personality--untainted  by reason--happened to be just what Slovakia wanted at the time.    Whatever his intention, Meciar's troubling ways have been a  rather useful tool for Czech policy-makers. Enough has been said  about our leaders' open dislike of Central European integration,  specifically among the Visegrad nations of Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. Slovakia itself always helped to  fuel the argument against cooperation: "Do you really want to be  in an association with a so-and-so like Meciar? Can a country  with the least bit of self-esteem team up with him?"    From this point of view, the upcoming coalition government  in  Slovakia--and especially its prime minister--may eventually  prove to be more problematic. First of all, the new leadership  will be hard to pin down because it seems to comprise so many  differing views. And secondly, Meciar's removal has thrown the  whole political process off kilter.    If the new Slovak government does manage to hang on,  however,  the Czech Republic might have to learn to live side by side with  Slovak leaders who are partners on an equal footing and who  cannot be as easily dismissed in the public eye for their  dubious pasts.    Worse yet, one part of the new coalition is the Democratic  Left Party (SDL), the direct descendant of the former Communist  Party. That may be particularly painful for our side to deal  with. Just try to imagine the scene when our minister of  defense, a true, dedicated Christian, meets a Slovak counterpart  with a godless red past. How can they possibly be seen agreeing  on something such as peace in Bosnia?    The fact is that the Slovak ex-communists have managed to  cut  themselves off from their past much more effectively than their  Czech brethren have. They are rather closer to what is  understood to be the modern European left. For Czech leaders,  however, this is where the danger lies.    If the Slovak coalition survives and its SDL ministers  eventually prove themselves, they might be politically much more  difficult to deal with than Meciar. Remember our officials'  shocked reaction to the current Polish center-left government.  Their approach has developed into a very cautious "friendliness"  mixed with distrust. Now we may be forced to go through the same  process east of our border. On top of that, there are signs that  next month's general elections in Hungary may produce a  government that includes part of the ex-communist Socialist  Party.    Any compromises would be hard to swallow after so many of  our  political leaders made presentations to the West, explaining  that the only possible way out of the post-communist marsh is  the firm road of a liberal market economy and libertarian  society. There cannot be any sidetracking, they said--no "third  way" for us.    We can hardly back up now. There are center-left governments  within the European Union too, and we know they are watching us  closely. If we cannot make it work with Visegrad, it will be  harder to become buddy-buddy with the Westside gang.    The members of this club seem unwilling to appreciate our  quiet sacrifice in tolerating such neo-socialism. They keep  telling us that we cannot play in the big leagues unless we make  it in our local one first. If Slovakia, be it left or right, is  functioning well, it will be even harder for them to understand  why we can't be better team players.</p>

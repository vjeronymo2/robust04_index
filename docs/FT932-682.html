			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Row intensifies over political donations LABOUR WAS forced on to the defensive yesterday in the continuing row over party funding, with the leadership preparing for the quick return of Pounds 11,000 donated by a businessman wanted for questioning by the Serious Fraud Office. The Conservative party also faced fresh embarrassment, following more claims over the weekend about large-scale, secret funding from prominent foreign businessmen. Names linked to the Tory party as big donors included Mr T. T. Tsui, the Hong Kong businessman, and Mr Octav Botnar, the former chairman of Nissan UK. The Inland Revenue has issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Botnar, who is safe from extradition in Switzerland. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, gave an assurance that the party would return Pounds 11,000 donated in 1987 and 1990 by Mr Charilaos Costa, a Greek Cypriot businessman, if it was found to be stolen. She denied press allegations that funds had also been given by Mr Costa to the office of Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader. But it seems likely that this Wednesday's meeting of Labour's national executive committee will decide to return the Pounds 11,000 without delay. Mrs Beckett also said it was 'about as near certain as you can get' that her party would now decide unilaterally to disclose details of all 'substantial' donations. Labour has previously maintained that it would do so only if other parties agreed, but a change to its rules now looks likely in the autumn. While Labour believes that its message on 'sleaze' in Tory party funding has been effective, some of its MPs believe that the intensified public disillusion with politicians generally has damaged opposition parties as well. Some also believe it unfortunate that the issue has been a further example of the party reacting to Tory mistakes rather than focusing the agenda on areas where Labour could be seen in a positive light. Ministers insist that the party does not intend to alter the rules which provide anonymity to all financial backers, although a growing number of Tory MPs now support publication of more detailed Tory accounts. Lord Parkinson, a former party chairman, yesterday backed the idea, saying he believed 'in having these things out in the open'. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, defended the right of contributors not to have their donations publicised. He claimed that they had no influence on party policy or on the choice of candidate. He repeated the pledge to return Pounds 440,000 given to the party by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, if it was proved to be stolen, while Lord McAlpine, the former Tory treasurer, said the money should be put in trust until its source was established.

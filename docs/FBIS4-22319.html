			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Dubinin by Ivan </F> Zasurskiy; place and date not given: "Sergey Dubinin Will Pursue  Last Year's Government Policy: The Government Contract at  Enterprises of the Military-Industrial Complex Is Six to Seven  Times in Excess of the Ministry of Defense's Ability To Pay"]    [Text] Following the resignation of Boris Fedorov,  everything in the Ministry of Finance has been slotted into  place. Having handled the work of a minister in the times of  Fedorov (who was preoccupied, in my view, more with ideology and  political struggle than routine ministerial matters), Dubinin  became a full minister, virtually. The protracted probationary  period is, according to him, hampering his work, but not  influencing the nature of the decisions he makes.    Dubinin does not consider himself a politician. He is a  government official. And he maintains that the sole reason why  he agreed to the office of minister is that he will have an  opportunity to do his work. As soon as this opportunity  disappears or he is asked to leave the cabinet, Dubinin intends  leaving the government. And I would not be inclined to doubt the  sincerity of these words. But this is not what is most important.    The greatest optimism in the acting finance minister is  inspired by his arrangement of his work priorities. I would like  as a significant contrast for those who recall the dramatic  nature of the situation connected with Fedorov's speech in  parliament to quote Dubinin's composed words on his "production"  topics: "That lobbying for one's interests in the government and  the State Duma goes on is normal, but only as long as we can  discuss these demands at a professional level, as long as we can  come to some arrangement. But as soon as the decisions are  politicized, the budget discussions assume a different  character, as a rule, becoming a catalyst of confrontational  political processes."    According to him, Dubinin has no intention of being a  striking figure and is not about to "develop a fondness or not  develop a fondness" for Chernomyrdin, Zaveryukha, Soskovets, or  Gerashchenko. "I have a wife, whom I love very much, and all  these others will remain working relationships, as will possible  disagreements also."    His following semi-culinary statement may be considered  fundamental for Dubinin's position both in respect to the budget  and in respect to economic policy: "Whenever the question of the  distribution of expenditure arises, there is always with us the  `zero-sum game' problem--we can give to some only by having  taken away from others. But this game, inasmuch as it is played,  should lead us to some end result in the form of economic  growth. In this case the pie which we divide up would grow. Now,  however, the pie is diminishing: In real terms we are observing  not growth but shrinkage."    Lobbyists who have called Dubinin--who is demonstrating a  total absence of political ambitions--"Mr. No Money" will  hardly, it would seem, be struck by the difference between  Fedorov, who had made a political career out of "refusals," and  Dubinin--the "man of compromise."  <H5>  The Budget as a Concentrated Expression of Economic Policy </H5>   "There is, in fact, no budget message as yet. There is a  report of the Ministry of Finance on the draft budget with  calculations elaborated in the form of an international  classification.    "It is a very serious report and it was worked up over a  long  period in the Ministry of Finance, and we in the Ministry of  Finance are absolutely convinced that we are offering the sole  possible balanced path. Following the consideration of certain  amendments and criticisms expressed at a meeting of the  government and not affecting the most prominent calculations and  important proportions, we were instructed to submit the draft  for examination by the State Duma.    "In drawing up the budget for 1994 we proceeded from the  fact  that our budget revenue really needed to be collected. The  revenue figure contained in the draft, therefore--R120.7  trillion (16 percent of gross domestic product)--is realistic.  And the main task of the Ministry of Finance this year will be  organization of the collection of receipts totaling this amount.    "I can already see the main points of the criticism of our  draft message in the State Duma. One of them has been criticism  as regards the practicability of the revenue for which we have  allowed. That is why it should be added to what has been said  that the collection of receipts will be impossible without  elementary financial discipline having been instituted. We must  ultimately know the money path and the number of enterprises'  accounts and fight tax evasion.    "The situation taking shape as regards expenditure is quite  typical. When we began to work on the budget, applications for  funding totaling about R600 trillion were received. This despite  the fact that the forecast level of our GNP is R725 trillion.    "After quite laborious work on the applications, we managed  to knock their level down to R230 trillion. But this was still  very high, it represented too serious a deficit against our  revenue, which was less by a factor of two almost than the  residual total.    "We had to make an uneven reduction in expenditure in terms  of items of the budget. Not in terms of all items, it is true  (our foreign and domestic debt could not, for understandable  reasons, be touched), but in terms of very many we `contracted  funding' 5-10 percent. But individual items were cut far more  significantly. I could, as an example, cite the Ministry of  Defense, where we reduced expenditure from R87 trillion to R37  trillion. We cannot, in fact, have an army whose manning level  is not supported by the birth rate and whose cost is equal to  the sum total of taxes collected in the country.    "In this way we gradually managed to reach the compromise  level of expenditure of R183.1 trillion. The largest expenditure  items within this framework were support for the sectors (R33  trillion), Ministry of Defense expenditure (R37 trillion),  assistance to other levels of power (R18 trillion), and the  funding of social and cultural programs (following insertion of  the corresponding proposals, we increased the funding from R11.4  trillion to R12.5 trillion)."    Commenting on Viktor Chernomyrdin's directive in respect to  support for the agrarian sector, Sergey Dubinin declared that  "this is a large amount of money, of course, for which we had to  provide additionally in the budget--over and above our original  proposals. All this was, it is true, accommodated in the draft  message. But the additional demands have no real foundation, in  my view. That is, we reached the level originally requested by  the agrarians: They said that this was perfectly sufficient for  them. And if voices are now being heard to the effect that this  is still not enough for them, it is essential, in my opinion,  that the government adopt the toughest position possible on this  issue: This is all that we can give them."    "The deficit constituted R62.4 trillion, which it is  contemplated covering by Central Bank credit (R37.9 trillion),  external sources (R19.4 trillion), and securities transactions  (R3.5 trillion), and we hope to cover a further R1.5 trillion  from other sources." According to Dubinin, the Ministry of  Finance is planning this year, aside from work with state  commercial associations, to begin floating medium-term bills.    "From our viewpoint, the draft budget message contains the  algorithms of a resolution of macroeconomic problems and takes  account of the available possibilities for the pursuit of a  structural policy, which is undoubtedly necessary," the acting  finance minister said in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Reference Points </H5>   "The macroeconomic aspects of the budget are that with the  budget deficit that we have determined and provided that we  display restraint in the allocation to the economy of Central  Bank credit (R15 trillion, approximately, is the critical level  here, in my view), we may confidently forecast a reduction in  inflation to a level of 15 percent and, subsequently, to 10  percent a month and, perhaps, even lower on a quarterly average.    "The draft budget we have submitted for government  consideration is not `fundamentalist.' It is not even purely  monetarist inasmuch as such measures as the suppression of  inflation within one quarter are absent. Although this is not  that intricate an undertaking, we possess the set of instruments  and could within a quarter reduce inflation to nothing. Just as  we could also, if necessary, drive it up to 1,000 percent a  month--both could, from the professional viewpoint, be done in  such a timeframe. But this is not the point.    "The point is that our tasks, reference points, and range of  activity imply the pursuit, more precisely, the continuation of  our policy of last year. That is, there is no `shock  therapy'--there is quite a strict monetary policy.    "I would like to emphasize that the budget is a concentrated  expression of economic policy. Aside from the priorities from  the sphere of macroeconomic stabilization, the tasks of support  of production and its structural reorganization have been added  here this year.    "Going further than we have gone to satisfy the need for  money would be just as bad as a further reduction in spending.  In the latter case we would have to abandon many fundamentally  important items of expenditure, in the social sphere  specifically."  <H5>  Structural Aspect </H5>   "We believe that within the framework of the gradually  declining level of inflation there is for industry, and the  economy as a whole, a certain clearance, in which it should  structurally reorganize. We are not putting it in a catastrophic  position all at once--this, strictly speaking, is the  `structural' aspect of our draft budget message.    "Very little money is being provided from the budget for  specific enterprises--we are giving almost nothing. The sectors  of the economy will receive less, appreciably less, I would say,  than they would like.    "We understand full well an important feature of Russia's  enterprises today. What would happen, say, were we to say to  them: Here is your government support, reorganize as you please,  and we will combat inflation later. They would do absolutely  nothing--they would live as they did before."    The creation of financial and industrial groups could, in  Dubinin's opinion, be an element of selective support for  industry. But the process of the allocation of financial support  and tax privileges should be of a planned nature, Dubinin  believes. "Such groups may enjoy support to some extent. But the  main thing is that they be viable without a handout from the  budget also."    "The sectors are an unsuccessful (under present conditions)  form of association and management. They represent a vertical  association, which can do nothing but divide up a market between  itself. If, however, we could combine these enterprises on the  basis of production cooperation, we would get a normal  industrial concern, which would operate in accordance with  economically expedient principles."    In Dubinin's opinion, work exclusively for the foreign  market  is not a compulsory condition of the efficiency of a financial  and industrial group. "The Russian market is potentially so  great that this is sufficient stimulus for economic growth for  any structure. The sole condition is that there must be a  struggle to cut costs. Lowering prices or not lowering them is,  strictly speaking, secondary." A reduction in costs, according  to Dubinin, is a most powerful "nonmonetary" method of combating  inflation.    Commenting on the propositions of the president and the  prime  minister concerning an increase in government investments,  Sergey Dubinin declared that the budget of R33 trillion in  support of the sectors makes provision for R15.7 trillion for  government investments. A further R12.7 trillion will be  invested along the lines of foreign economic activity, thanks to  tied credit.  <H5>  The New Role of the Unions and the `Destructive Approach' </H5>   "I have met recently with representatives of the unions and  the strike committees--pragmatic and intelligent people are  assembled there, according to my observations. And the question  is: On what will their energy be expended? Were they to acquire  an opportunity to really influence the situation at their own  enterprises, an appreciable part of their energy would be geared  to bringing order to bear there. They would also be very much  helping both the government and the country as a whole, what is  more, having put their own management under supervision."    This, according to the acting minister, "does not mean that  management should be denied any rights at the enterprise. But  opponents in the shape of the unions, which know the whole  situation at the enterprise `from within' and could demand an  accounting, are necessary. This could only be to the good."    "If, on the other hand, these people (I emphasize once  again:  very energetic and competent people, who have a pretty good  grasp of all our economic problems, incidentally) opt for the  line of opposition to the government and the shaking loose of  privileges for their own interest group, this will be a  destructive process."    Dubinin is very much concerned that the strike movement  "could assume a destructive nature both politically and for  Russia's economy." The acting minister believes that not all the  demands being made by the strikers are realistic and that,  consequently, not all of them should be satisfied. "The  government cannot endlessly give in to blackmail." But does the  government today have any choice?    "Yes. But, please understand, our strength lies not in some  power methods of the resolution of disputes but, occupying a  sensible and substantiated position, in conveying its content to  those who participate, in this way or the other, in budget  discussions.    "For every `we-want'-from-the-government argument there  should be a counterargument: Let us take at look at and consider  what we are realistically capable of doing. It is for this  reason that the budget should be relatively widely known: People  must think and say where to cut, where to add," Sergey Dubinin  believes.  <H5>  Parliament </H5>   "In principle, work on the allocation of priorities and the  careful weighing of society's needs is the function of  parliament. Parliament must determine whether it will adopt the  budget that we propose. It will thus act as an inspector on  behalf of the people by whom it was elected."    Commenting on his style of work with parliament during  consideration there of the budget message, Sergey Dubinin said:  "I state with all due responsibility that we are instructed by  the prime minister to work with parliament with complete candor,  respond to inquiries, and so on and so forth. When each deputy  forwards his inquiry on an individual point and demands a full  response, this is another matter--our ministry simply is not in  a position to cope with this entire avalanche of information.    "For this reason we request that parliament somehow organize  work with the ministry to ensure that it be performed as  productively as possible. We are prepared to provide any  information, to the Budget Committee, say--and let it further  distribute it to the deputies. We are prepared to create a  special department--not to fence ourselves off from contacts but  to ensure that work proceed in organized fashion.    "Time is weighing on us, we submitted the budget late, this  was our fault, it should have been submitted in this form in  December. But we recomputed the budget for last year three times  and made innumerable adjustments and revisions and we simply  physically lacked the forces for 1994."  <H5>  The Expert Center in Staraya Ploshchad </H5>   Commenting at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the  formation of the Finance and Budget Department under the Office  of the President of the Russian Federation, Sergey Dubinin  declared that he finds this fact logical and sees nothing  surprising in it, to put it mildly.    "The office of the president should necessarily have an  expert center, which should make an independent evaluation of  the state of the economy--based on all that is put at its  disposal by the government, science, and so forth."    Answering questions concerning the possible development of  relations between the Ministry of Finance and the department,  the acting minister said: "What we send the president will in  the office obviously be readdressed quite often to this  department. For the president's response to this economic  situation or the other to be as well-founded as possible  analysis is essential. This analysis will be made in this  department. This is how I see it, in any event.    "Because the president could give us an order, set the  government an assignment--this is his function. And these  instructions could be prepared with the participation of the  Finance and Budget Department."  <H5>  Money for the Republic of Belarus </H5>   "I was involved in these matters for quite some time, and  this is quite a painful subject for me, therefore. I would like  to hope that all will end normally and that the necessary  documents will be signed."    But the existence of the National Bank of Belarus is an  insurmountable obstacle to the signing of the treaty, in his  opinion. "Prior to the start of the process of the conclusive  concordance of the agreement on the Republic of Belarus entering  the ruble zone, its parliament adopted a decision on support for  the agrarian sector in quite a large sum. Naturally, the  National Bank is bound to comply with parliament's order. Let us  assume that we allocate the Republic of Belarus a lending quota.  What if parliament adopts a decision on above-quota lending?" In  Dubinin's opinion, it can only be a question of a branch of the  Bank of Russia on the territory of Belarus. But Dubinin hopes  that the adoption of such a political decision is possible, for  all that. "The politicians, who have doubts about sacrificing  some sovereignty in exchange for the ruble, should, probably,  somehow learn the people's opinion here. The adoption of a  decision by parliament representing the people's interests or  putting the issue to a referendum, as was done in the EEC,  appear entirely legitimate, in my view."    At the same time, on the other hand, Dubinin considers far  from unequivocal the question of the likely price ratio of the  "rabbit" to the ruble.    "This is purely an economic question. We should not  politicize it or attempt to give it an emotional coloration. The  current rate has taken shape as the rate of the currency of an  independent state against a stronger currency. And this rate is  not one for one, of course, although for Belarus' enterprises  exchange at a high rate would mean a loss of competitiveness.  For this reason Belarusian industrialists do not aspire to such  a rate, incidentally. As distinct from the populace, which is  already attuned to this.    "The rate remains a matter for separate consideration, and  various options are possible here: higher for the public, for  example, lower for industry. But not one `rabbit' for one ruble."  <H5>  The Tatarstan Compromise and Budget Federalism </H5>   Responding to the question as to what compromises had to be  made by the center for the sake of preserving the multichannel  system of budget receipts with Tatarstan, Sergey Dubinin said:  "Strictly speaking, abandonment of the single-channel system was  itself a compromise. Because in the past Tatarstan had said that  a single-channel system was the sole acceptable option.    "We, in response, recognized two things. First, the fact  that  for the time in which Tatarstan had not paid money to the  federal treasury it had maintained federal structures on its  territory. We should compensate this somehow.    "Second, as of this year Tatarstan will begin to pay many  taxes on a general basis (in accordance with the presidential  edict on transfer payments). We, in turn, for the funding of  programs of a federal purpose in Tatarstan will leave on its  territory the receipts from certain taxes." Specifically,  according to the acting minister, this applies to receipts from  taxes on natural resources.    "We shall not settle this question identically for everyone,  but it should be emphasized that the negotiating process with  Tatarstan proceeded in a general channel. I am speaking in this  case of the presidential edict on transfer payments, by which  real federalist budget reform was undertaken."  <H5>  Tax Federalism </H5>   "The essence of this reform (and the renunciation of budget  unitarism) is that we are abandoning the policy of the  harmonization of spending and switching to revenue-sharing. We  are making arrangements such that there be federal taxes and  taxes collected on a territory and paid into the local budget.    "Some federal taxes, primarily the profits tax, will be  shared. A maximum rate of the local profits tax (25 percent) and  a strict federal rate (13 percent) will be established. Thus  with the maximum profits tax at 38 percent the local authorities  may vary its rate from 13 to 38 percent.    "Value-added tax [VAT] will be shared. Twenty-five percent  of  VAT will remain on the territory. Land and property taxes  should, most likely, simply be made local taxes because they  will go to the territory in full. Individual income tax will be  established as a federal tax, although only 1 percent will be  paid into federal coffers."    According to Dubinin, tax evasion remains a huge problem,  and, specifically, it is altogether elementary to evade  individual income tax. "You can pay in on deposit R10 and accrue  R1 million in interest on it, and you pay nothing here. We must  combat this. Certain taxes on interest, if only at a rate of 5  percent, have to be imposed. Although, with the change in the  status of the Savings Bank to a state bank, provision for  certain privileges for its depositors could be made here. But  this is an open, albeit urgent, question."  <H5>  The Nonpayments Crisis </H5>   In Dubinin's opinion, the arrears "are the result of the  fact  that demand limitations really did emerge. But the response in  1992--when this problem became particularly serious--was  inadequate and nonmarket. The producers continued to drive up  prices and wait for the government to finally untie this knot in  some way.    "Inasmuch as the entire economy was nonmarket at that time,  the government had to intervene--and we established that  `swollen' price level. We thereby involuntarily encouraged the  antimarket policy of the producer, who, according to these  rules, can drive up prices because he is sure that they will  some day be accepted.    "We are now in roughly the same situation. If we intervene,  we cause a most powerful spiraling of inflation. And no one  would any longer believe that we would not pay all costs once  again the next time."    The Ministry of Finance's proposals amount to the "complete  exclusion" of the possibility of a reciprocal settlement thanks  to special money issue. "But we support, in principle, the  possibility of the use to this end of resources which within the  framework of public funding are allocated for the defense  contract, for example. We believe that in purchasing grain or  meat products the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and other  departments are required to build a chain in order that this  money pass into the economy as deeply as possible. But only  defense industry and the Ministry of Railways are prepared to  undertake this as yet. The rest are so much not in possession of  their sector that they could not propose anything practicable.    "The second necessary set of measures is connected with the  institution of strict financial discipline (about which I spoke  earlier). The creditor must know for what he can bring suit--and  if there is no money, he can take assets. It is obvious that it  is essential to introduce bills of exchange as soon as possible  also."    In Dubinin's opinion, the time allotted for the solution of  this question is already slipping away, although there are  entirely objective grounds for procrastination also. According  to him, for the introduction of the calendar sequence of  payments it is necessary to revise the decision of the Supreme  Soviet. Other legislative instruments need to be adopted also,  in his opinion. "The proposals of the tax office, the Ministry  of Finance, and the Central Bank of Russia have now been sent to  the State Duma."    According to Dubinin, the formation of a new problem in the  style of the nonpayments--a recurrence of last year's problems  with the failure to pay for supplies of finished products--is  emerging. In this case the culprit is the Ministry of Defense,  which placed at the enterprises a defense order of a size six or  seven times in excess of the budget's ability to pay for these  items.  <H5>  Negotiations with the IMF </H5>   As a result of Fedorov's efforts to concentrate the  functions  of participation in international affairs in the Ministry of  Finance, the role of the ministry in negotiations with the  Seven, the EEC, and international economic organizations has  grown considerably.    "The Ministry of Finance is having to take an active part in  the assurance of favorable foreign economic conditions for the  activity of the Russian economy. Negotiations on debt  rescheduling, formulation of the optimum formats of the receipt  and repayment of foreign credit--this is one aspect.    "The second consists of negotiations with the IMF, the World  Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and  other financial organizations."    In Dubinin's opinion, Russia has today found itself involved  in quite an intricate interweave of problems, to which the  departure of symbolic figures from the cabinet has been added  also. In this connection Dubinin is quite sharply critical of  those who advocate a dismissive attitude toward international  financial organizations. "Without harmonization of positions  with the IMF Russia could not obtain normal conditions for debt  deferral. The debt burden, which has built up since the times of  the Soviets, would be simply insupportable. We would be  threatened constantly by a total embargo and, if not a blockade,  a serious deterioration in the climate of foreign economic  relations." At the same time Dubinin observes that negotiations  should always be of a mutually respectful character. "Russia  itself formulates its evaluation of economic policy and its  basic directions within the framework of current possibilities.  International experts only offer us their opinion on these  matters."    Dubinin described in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  the trip of a Russian delegation under his leadership to  Frankfurt, to a get-together of finance ministers of the Seven.  Present on the Russian side, aside from Dubinin, were  Gerashchenko and Shokhin. According to Dubinin, Shokhin had been  invited in order to "space out the format" of the Russian  delegation and to emphasize its special status. "It seems to me  that we accomplished our `three-man' mission--to explain the  essence of the economic policy we are pursuing and its  continuity at the level of figures and specific measures."    Negotiations with IMF, in which the Ministry of Finance and  other departments responsible for the pursuit of economic policy  are participating, are being conducted in Moscow at this time,  according to Dubinin. "Their successful completion in the very  near future is possible," according to the minister.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fiat bounces back into black in first six months Fiat, the Italian industrial and automotive group, yesterday said it had put last year's heavy losses behind it, and announced a return to profit of L727bn (Dollars 453m) before tax in the first half of 1994. The company confirmed it was on course for a full-year net profit, bouncing back from the record loss of L1,783bn in 1993, and that 1994 sales should rise to L63,000bn, up 15 per cent on 1993. Fiat's share price has risen strongly in recent weeks, and the results were in line with most analysts' expectations. The company said it would continue to improve efficiency and develop new products 'with unvaried determination', but sounded a note of caution about the depth of the recovery, particularly in the 'very weak' Italian car market, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales made by the group's principal subsidiary, Fiat Auto. When it released interim figures a year ago, Fiat heralded the blackest year in its 95-year history by announcing a pre-tax loss of L982bn, and a complex restructuring and capital-raising exercise. Since then, improved trading conditions in most of Europe outside Italy, the successful launch of the group's new small car, the Fiat Punto, and pressure to reduce costs has helped to reverse the group's sudden slump into the red. In the first half, Fiat's net consolidated sales rose to L31,363bn from L27,153bn, restated to account for the sale of La Rinascente, the retailer, last year. As a proportion of turnover, the group has managed to cut overheads from 16.4 per cent in the first half of last year, to 13.6 per cent in the first six months of 1994. Net debt has been reduced to L3,447bn - 15 per cent of net equity - compared with L6,983bn on June 30, 1993, and L5,247bn at the end of last year. Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, director-general of the group, said: 'We're obviously satisfied by the results we have achieved, both because the speed of the recovery is good, and because it's better than our long-term forecasts.' Mr Garuzzo warned that the market, particularly in the automotive sector, had still not entirely emerged from recession. In the first half, car deliveries in Europe rose an average of 6.6 per cent, while figures from Italian automotive associations indicate that deliveries of all makes in Italy have slipped by an average of 2.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Excerpts] At the 13th Supreme Soviet session, deputies  have managed to adopt the basic law of our state -- the new  Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- and the electoral  law. They have also managed to authorize presidential power,  and adopt legislation on the Constitutional Court. In my  opinion, however, economic issues have not been resolved. The  Republic still does not have its own, concrete economic program.  We are going into the future blindfolded, and looking for a  shining path in the darkness.    The so-called personnel issue, which was addressed by  Alyaksandr Lukashenka, chairman of the Interim Commission for  Combating Corruption, proved to be conclusive at the current  session. Yesterday, the interim commission handed over to the  deputies a draft resolution on dismissing National Bank Chairman  Stanislaw Bahdankevich, Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw  and Stanislaw Bryl, Uladzimir Radkevich, chairman of the State  Committee for External Economic Relations, and Defense Minister  Pavel Kazlowski. All in all, Alyaksandr Lukashenka accused more  than 60 state officials.    Today, following a debate on miscellaneous matters, the  discussion on the report delivered by Lukashenka continued. The  floor was taken by People's Deputies Syarhey Antonchyk, Viktar  Kuchynskiy, Henadz Lavitskiy, Frants Minko, all of whom were  members of the interim commission, and as a sign of protest,  they announced their intention to leave the commission headed by  Alyaksandr Lukashenka.    Later, the floor was taken by Bahdankevich, Bryl, Kostsikaw,  Radkevich, and Kazlowskiy. They all refuted the accusations  presented by Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Attorney General Vasil  Shaladonaw provided a legal assessment. Alyaksandr Lukashenka  delivered the concluding speech. [passage omitted] This  concluded the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / R-R and Westinghouse forge power generation alliance ROLLS-ROYCE and Westing-house yesterday forged a strategic alliance to challenge General Electric of the US for leadership in the large power generation business. The 15-year agreement between the UK aero-engine company and the US power systems group will provide Westinghouse with advanced aero-engine technology for new large power generating systems and strengthen Rolls-Royce's position in industrial power generation. The deal will make the partnership the world's second largest power generation group after GE. Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce are already collaborating in the development of a gas turbine engine for the US Navy after winning a Dollars 160m (Pounds 89m) engine development contract in January. The agreement announced yesterday extends this co-operation across the whole field of large power generation systems. The partnership will also introduce Rolls-Royce into the gas turbine alliance between Westinghouse, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and FiatAvio of Italy. Rolls-Royce, which acquired Britain's Northern Engineering Industries (NEI) three years ago, has been seeking to expand its industrial power activities which already account for about 40 per cent of the group's annual turnover. Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive, indicated last week that Rolls-Royce's long-term strategy was to reach a 50-50 balance between aero-engines and industrial power. Yesterday's deal underlined the increasing demand for aero-engine technology by makers of power generating systems, which operate under similar conditions of extreme heat. GE has large aero-engine and industrial power divisions, while Siemens of Germany has teamed up with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US. Under yesterday's agreement, Rolls-Royce said it would transfer aero-engine technology to Westinghouse for use in existing and future industrial combustion turbine designs. In return, Westinghouse will transfer selected steam turbine, combustion turbine and combined cycle technologies. The two companies will also co-operate in marketing Rolls-Royce aero-derived gas turbine engines including the RB211 and the Trent for power generation applications. The Westinghouse agreement raises questions over Rolls-Royce's relationship with ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss group. Rolls-Royce already co-operates with ABB in the UK market and there has been regular speculation that the two groups would forge closer links. Rolls-Royce said last night that the Westinghouse deal would not affect that relationship. Mr Fritz Gautschi, general manager of ABB's gas turbine and combined cycle power division, said his group had not talked in detail with Rolls-Royce about its new alliance. He said the joint venture with NEI would continue.</p>

The  suspense prevailing in the country lasted only about 48 hours  after Mr. Oye-Mba recently presented his resignation and that of  his cabinet to the head of state. His reappointment was  expected since Mr. Oye-Mba was the chairman of the  electioneering campaign commission of Omar Bongo, candidate for  the December 1993 presidential elections. Thus, Mr. Oye-Mba is  again head of the Gabonese Government. Let us listen to the  prime minister after his reappointment:    [Begin Oye-Mba recording] My first impression is that of  responsibility. I am extremely honored by President Bongo who  has renewed his confidence in me the fourth time. This means a  heavy responsibility on my shoulders; I have to deserve this  confidence and serve Gabon which is in a difficult situation,  especially concerning its development in economic sector and  other sectors. [end recording]    After giving his impressions, Mr. Oye-Mba explained how he  intends to form his new cabinet:    [Begin Oye-Mba recording] The head of state said he wanted  the new cabinet to be formed as soon as possible. So, we will  try not to waste time, but a government is not made up of only  one person. A government is formed with other citizens and the  political forces on the ground. This means that I will begin  now to try to get in touch with the representatives of all the  Gabonese political forces to put in place a cabinet capable of  facing our country's situation and resolving the problems  confronting Gabon. [end recording]    The meeting between the Gabonese prime minister and  representatives of political parties is in response to President  Bongo's appeal for a one-year priority program of action. The  agenda for this meeting is expected to center on the devaluation  of the CFA franc and its consequences on the economy and on  Gabonese's revenues, health, employment, and training.

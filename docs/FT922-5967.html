			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US and EC in fresh move to end farm subsidy row US AND EC officials met in Washington yesterday to try to end their farm subsidy impasse that has blocked a 108-nation effort to reform the world's trading system, Reuter reports from Washington. EC members last week agreed to reform their farm policy by cutting government payments to farmers, but the US said there also had to be cuts in government export subsidies and fewer curbs on food imports. A US official acknowledged the importance of the cuts in internal subsidies, but said: 'We're anxious to see if there can be progress on export subsidies and market access'. EC refusal to agree to deep cuts in farm subsidies, as demanded by the US and other food exporters, has hampered progress towards an overall Gatt accord. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, was yesterday pressing the case that the EC had been flexible on subsidies and it was now the US's turn. Mr Andriessen yesterday met US Secretary of State James Baker, Mr Edward Madigan, agriculture secretary, and Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative. A US official said a further meeting might be scheduled for today if warranted. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said on Monday that time was running out for meeting a December deadline to wind up the talks successfully.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Timeshare rules open to abuse A LEADING timeshare resale company has called for the adoption of a charter to protect vendors and purchasers from a range of alleged abuses. The company, PrimeShare International, says many sellers and buyers of existing timeshares are not protected by the new Timeshare Act, which came into force last week. The act gives timeshare buyers 14 days to withdraw from purchases and to claim their money back, provided the contract was concluded in the UK. Sharp practice in the reselling of existing timeshares is widespread, according to Mr Peter Lewis, PrimeShare managing director, and Miss Diana Hanks, consumer services manager at the Timeshare Council.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLEMENS PUTS SORENESS TO REST, WINS 19TH  </P> <P> Right-hander Roger Clemens started complaining in midseason that his pitching  shoulder was tired. It brought about a decision by Boston Manager Joe Morgan  that might mean a division title for the Red Sox.  </P> <P> It was decided that henceforth, Clemens would always get at least four days'  rest between assignments.  </P> <P> The results have been sensational.  </P> <P> With five days' rest, Clemens pitched a five-hitter Saturday at Toronto,  beating the Blue Jays, 1-0, and increasing Boston's lead in the American League  East to three games.  </P> <P> Another well-rested player, Dwight Evans, hit his 12th home run in the seventh  inning to beat David Wells (9-4).  </P> <P> Evans, bothered all season by a back problem that is eased only by rest, had  not played in five games. Before he homered, Evans had two singles. In eight  innings, Wells gave up only two other hits. He left shortly after a line drive  by Wade Boggs hit him in the wrist.  </P> <P> "I was thinking it would be good to hit a home run for the way he was  pitching," Evans said.  </P> <P> The extra day's rest probably came in handy for Clemens in the ninth inning. An  error by third baseman Boggs, a double by Fred McGriff and an intentional walk  loaded the bases with one out.  </P> <P> Clemens then got Greg Myers on a fly ball to short right field and struck out  Manny Lee.  </P> <P> "I felt pretty comfortable once I got Myers," Clemens said. "I wasn't tired."  </P> <P> It was Clemens' seventh consecutive victory and fourth shutout in the string.  His record is 19-5.  </P> <P> In seven starts beginning with a three-hit shutout at Milwaukee July 25,  Clemens has pitched 58 1/3 innings out of a possible 63. He has given up 47  hits, four earned runs, walked only six and struck out 56.  </P> <P> "This game gave me the opportunity to pick the guys up and take the focus off  them," Clemens said. "They've been picking it up for me all year.  </P> <P> "Because it was against these guys, it was probably the best game I pitched."  </P> <P> Seattle 6, Kansas City 3 -- Ken Griffey Jr. singled to drive in the tiebreaking  run in the seventh inning at Kansas City and Edgar Martinez stole home to end  the Royals' five-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Jay Buhner tied a major league record by striking out for the eight consecutive  time. He had a two-run single in the sixth, then struck out two more times.  </P> <P> With one out in the seventh inning, Storm Davis (7-9) walked Harold Reynolds  and Martinez before Griffey singled to make it 4-3. Martinez went to third on a  fly. Then he and Griffey worked a double steal, Martinez just beating the  return throw home.  </P> <P> Although he gave up 11 hits in 7 1/3 innings, Erik Hanson improved to 12-9.  </P> <P> Cleveland 11, Baltimore 5 -- Jerry Browne had four hits, including a home run,  and drove in four runs at Baltimore to lead an 18-hit assault.  </P> <P> It was a 4-4 tie when Browne hit a two-run shot in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Sandy Alomar also homered for the Indians, who dropped the Orioles 8 1/2 games  behind Boston.  </P> <P> Steve Olin (2-4) pitched five scoreless innings of relief for his first victory  since May 11.  </P> <P> Mike Devereaux had two hits and drove in three runs for the Orioles.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, New York 3 -- At New York, the Yankees led, 2-1, there were two on  and two out in the ninth inning and bullpen ace Dave Righetti, a left-hander,  was facing Greg Brock, a left-handed batter.  </P> <P> Brock homered to win the game. The Brewers' Paul Molitor had three hits,  extending his hitting streak to 19 games.  </P> <P> Minnesota 8, Texas 5 -- Brian Harper had four hits and drove in two runs at  Arlington, Tex., to help the Twins end their second nine-game losing streak  this season.  </P> <P> The Twins were behind, 4-1, after two innings and pulled even in the sixth.  </P> <P> In the seventh, Harper singled with two out to score Dan Gladden from second  base. They added two more in the eighth to end the losing streak. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

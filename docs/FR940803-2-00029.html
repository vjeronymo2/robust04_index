			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Should the Commission consider options other than full rolled-in or incremental pricing of new facilities? The following are some options to be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Rates for expansion customers could be set based on the sum of incremental costs and a share of pre-expansion costs to reflect the benefits expansion customers receive from existing facilities. The rates for existing shippers also could be adjusted to reflect benefits received from the expansion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Rates could be set on an incremental basis, with the costs rolled-in after some specified period of time or rolled-in gradually over time at a pre-determined level each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Incremental rates could be used for the expansion customers, but as lower priced contracts for existing shippers expire, their capacity would be rolled-in to the expansion capacity, thus reducing the incremental rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Rolled-in rates could be used for expansions (or portions of expansions) built to serve existing markets and incremental rates for expansions (or portions of expansions) used to serve new markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. If more general criteria are to be used in individual cases, what should the tests or criteria be? Among the issues to be considered are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Should the Commission adopt a rebuttable presumption in favor of a particular pricing method and what test should be used to overcome the presumption?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Should the commensurate benefits test be used for approving rolled-in pricing or is it sufficient that existing shippers obtain positive benefits?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each test, or is another formulation more appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Do benefits need to be measurable? What weight should be given to various criteria, and how should non-measurable criteria be valued?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. How should the Commission handle multiple expansions, in particular when an initial, expensive addition makes subsequent additions less costly?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, pure incremental pricing could cause customers to seek to delay making commitments until the later, less expensive expansion in order to obtain lower rates, while rolled-in pricing could discourage construction of the less expensive expansion because rates would be above the incremental cost of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Which of the options is preferable?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Are there methods that could avoid both problems?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Should the Commission adopt a policy under which the costs for expansions starting from a particular date are cumulated or ``rolled-up'' to yield an average expansion rate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Should The Commission Revise Its Policies To Provide More Guidance On Construction Approvals And Rates In &sect;7 Certificate Proceedings?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is interested in reviewing its current policies relating to granting at-risk certificates and determining the rate methodology for new projects to determine if changes in these policies are needed. For example, if the Commission adopts more general policies for recovering the costs of new facilities, rather than a bright-line test, pipeline customers may need notice of the rates they will be paying prior to the completion of the &sect;4 proceeding in order to make better informed decisions about the amount of capacity for which to contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is interested in receiving comments on the following questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What pricing methodology is most consistent with the Commission's at-risk certificate policy?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Is there any reason to differentiate between at-risk construction and fully subscribed construction in terms of the pricing methodology used for facility cost recovery?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. If rolled-in pricing is used, how should the at-risk condition be maintained?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. In light of the Commission's at-risk policy, should the optional certificate regulations be continued?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: HARRIS E. KERSHNAR;  </P> <P> FIRING BACK AT EX-EMPLOYER;  </P> <P> ATTORNEY DISCUSSES LAWSUITS OVER WRONGFUL TERMINATION  </P> <P> Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente claimed he was terminated from his 17-year job  as Santa Ana's director of personnel in 1983 because of his age and his efforts  to expose wrongdoing in city hiring. Six months ago, a jury decided it didn't  believe him. But last week, Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein said he did  and overturned the jury's verdict, awarding Bott $1.8 million.  </P> <P>  The case is a good example of the difficulties involved in proving a wrongful  termination lawsuit. Courts and legislatures are providing an increasing amount  of protection for employees from indiscriminate firings but many of the laws  are complicated. Nearly all require anybody terminated to act quickly if he or  she hopes to win a verdict against a former employer.  </P> <P>  Tustin attorney Harris E. Kershnar has represented more than 100 individuals  who have sued their former employers for wrongful termination. He spent the  early part of his career defending employers from such suits but changed sides  in 1985.  </P> <P>  "I'm philosophically more comfortable representing the underdog," he said.  </P> <P>  Kershnar, 36, now serves on the American Bar Assn.'s Equal Employment  Opportunity Committee and is a former chairman of the labor law section of the  Orange County Bar Assn. He graduated from the law school at UC Berkeley. He  recently spoke with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch about how fired employees  can vindicate themselves in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. What types of wrongful termination cases have you typically argued?  </P> <P> A. They are a varied lot. One was a case involving a large oil company that  conducted searches of employees' vehicles and lockers as well as the employees  themselves. The employee I represented was discharged because a marijuana  cigarette was found in his car. The jury reached a verdict in favor of the  employee on the grounds the employer violated an expressed agreement not to  discharge people without good cause. Plus, there was an inadequate showing that  the marijuana was his. And there wasn't much in the way of precedent to  establish that drugs found inside a car amounted to grounds for terminating  someone when there was no indication he had ever used drugs at work or ever  reported to work under the influence of drugs.  </P> <P> On a different subject altogether, I handled an age discrimination case against  a trucking company where there was a manager who thought my client was too old  to be a driver and didn't hesitate to communicate that in front of other  employees. My client was fired for a minor driving accident, which would not  have typically resulted in the termination of a driver. The case was settled on  terms we thought were quite favorable. And I had a case where an employee was  fired for refusing to fire somebody else who declined to take a lie detector  test. It's illegal to require someone to take a lie detector test, and my  client was told to fire an employee who exercised his right to decline such a  test. My client told the president of the company it was illegal for him to  fire this person and, in turn, my client was fired. My client won a verdict on  the basis his firing was contrary to the public policy of the state of  California.  </P> <P> Q. How common is it for somebody to get fired?  </P> <P> A. Exceedingly common. People who feel they have been improperly terminated  call up virtually on a daily basis. Nearly everyone who is fired feels that it  was improper or unfair, but the real question is how many have a legal remedy,  because what's unfair does not equal what is unlawful. I don't have a  percentage for you, but a small percent of the unfair terminations fall into  categories where the law provides a remedy.  </P> <P> Q. So what are the different categories?  </P> <P> A. The primary area is in civil rights laws covering age, race, sex, religion,  national origin and physical handicap. Firings based upon any of those  categories is prohibited based upon the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which  is a California statute. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is  not prohibited by the terms of the acts but there are serval cities that have  municipal ordinances that prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians,  including Laguna Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Q. What if the reason for somebody's dismissal doesn't coincide with one of the  civil rights classifications?  </P> <P> A. There are a number of individual pigeonholes. It's illegal to fire someone  because they have brought a wage claim before the labor commission. It's  illegal to fire an employee for disclosing his wages to a fellow employee. You  cannot be fired for reporting to state or federal authorities any illegalities  that you plausibly believe are occuring at your employer. For example, if you  think your employer is violating environmental laws by dumping petroleum  products into sewers instead of disposing of them in a proper manner and your  employer fired you for blowing the whistle on them, that would be unlawful. If  you are fired because you attempt to organize a union, that is unlawful under  the National Labor Relations Act. If you are fired by the company to try and  deprive you of your pension, that is prohibited under the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act. Finally, if you are fired because you performed jury  service when summoned, that is unlawful.  </P> <P> Q. What if you were simply fired without warning or good cause?  </P> <P> A. The category most people fall under is that involving an expressed or  implied employment contract which limits the employer's right to terminate. For  instance, if an employer has a progressive discipline policy requiring warnings  or other procedures prior to termination but does not follow that, an employee  can bring a contract-based action for improper termination.  </P> <P> Q. How can an employee find out whether his or her company has such a policy?  </P> <P> A. Many employers issue employee handbooks which would contain such a policy.  And if you're a supervisor you have probably received instruction from your  employer as to the discipline of employees. If a policy is not in your employee  handbook, ask your supervisor or the personnel department.  </P> <P> Q. Besides what's contained in the employee handbook, are there other things a  company does that imply a contractual relationship?  </P> <P> A. Aside from written policy there is also the issue of actual practice. Even  if there is not a piece of paper that says a company will follow progressive  discipline but the way the employer disciplines employees amounts to a practice  of progressive discipline, then employees are entitled to be treated in the  same manner. There is an aspect of what's called the implied covenant of good  faith and fair dealing which holds that like cases should be treated alike. For  example, if employees who are tardy or absent are normally cautioned at least  two times before being fired and a prospective client walks into my office and  says he was absent once and was fired for that absence and there had been no  other infractions committed by him, the employer would not be treating like  cases alike.  </P> <P> Q. What about performance appraisals?  </P> <P> A. Verbal and written communications by superiors are important. For example,  if your boss told you that you had a bright future with the company and you  bypass opportunities elsewhere, that would strengthen the claim for you based  on an implied contract. Make sure performance appraisals are done because they  will document whether you are or are not doing a good job and that is another  factor looked at in implied contract cases. If you have a series of favorable  evaluations and then all of a sudden you are told your performance warrants  termination, that is not going to carry the day unless they can show some very  specific misdeeds on the employee's part. The handbook, appraisals and length  of service are all building blocks of an implied contract.  </P> <P> Q. Should an employee ask to see his personnel file if he smells trouble?  </P> <P> A. Yes. Every employee in California has a statutory right to inspect his  personnel file and ought to exercise that right so the employee knows whether  he or she has been written up. The employee should send a written response to  the head of the personnel department and ask that a copy be placed in his  personnel file while the incident is fresh in his mind and he has an  opportunity to clear it up. Because employees come and go, it might be  important for the employee to speak to other employees at the time this occurs  because other employees' input may be critical to substantiating the employee's  version of the incident.  </P> <P> Q. Are there some firings that cannot be challenged in court?  </P> <P> A. If an employee was truly what is called "at will," that employee can be let  go for no reason. Someone who is an at-will employee doesn't have a contract,  implied or expressed. The United States is very unusual in that regard among  Western nations. In Western Europe there typically must be some legitimate  basis for termination. Otherwise, employees can obtain some monetary  compensation. But in California, if an employee is truly at will and doesn't  fall into any of the pigeonholes of the civil rights laws or specific statutory  prohibitions, he can be fired because the employer wakes up on the wrong side  of the bed.  </P> <P> Q. Are at-will firings common?  </P> <P> A. I screen out many more cases than I accept because the circumstance don't  seem to be such that the law will provide a remedy. There are many times when  people describe circumstances which strike me as unfair but they don't have any  legal recourse.  </P> <P> Q. How soon must a fired employee decide whether he will sue?  </P> <P> A. It's important for individuals to act in a timely manner because even if you  fall into a category where the law would permit relief, if you wait too long  you lose your rights. The time frames for each statute vary but an employee  should never let a full year lapse before proceeding against an employer.  Ideally, you should act more promptly than that, while witnesses are available  and recollections are fresh. Employment cases are almost always hard-fought.  And employers typically have much greater resources than individuals. The  typical plaintiff is by definition unemployed and suffering disastrous  financial consequences.  </P> <P> Q. Can an employee with a medical condition be fired?  </P> <P> A. When employees have been on a substantial medical leave because of a  non-work-related condition which does not amount to a physical handicap, they  can be fired. The man in the street feels it's grossly unfair, yet there is  nothing unlawful about it. Take somebody who was seriously injured but not  crippled in an automobile accident that wasn't work-related. The person is not  considered handicapped in the strictest sense of the law because they don't  have a permanent disabling condition. The employer might say you are fired  because it won't wait until you are ready to come back and the employee has no  recourse. The person may be entitled to state disability insurance but that  doesn't force the employer to retain the employee. Those two are not tied  together.  </P> <P> Q. How much is the fired employee going to have to spend on legal fees?  </P> <P> A. Typically employment attorneys, including me, handle cases on a contingency  basis. And that's another reason why it's important for plaintiff practitioners  to carefully evaluate cases. You can't make a living unless you win a fair  percentage of the time. If there is a valid claim, I'm willing not to bill the  client but take a contingency when and if we prevail.  </P> <P> Q. Is there anything an employee can do to make a wrongful termination case  airtight?  </P> <P> A. The best thing to do if you can is to have an expressed contract, and almost  the only time you will get that is when you are coming on board with a company  because that is the honeymoon period when an employer wants someone with a  specific skill or talent. Short of that, it's important for an employee to  document any agreement or promises that an employer makes. Take a sales  employee who is told verbally that if he reaches $150,000 in sales in a  specific time period he will receive an extra 10% bonus. If I were that  employee I would write a memo to that effect and send it to the person who sent  it to me -- "In accordance with our discussion if I reach X dollars in sales I  will be entitled to X percent extra commission." So as not to be too crass,  because tact is always important, the employee might do that in the text of a  memo about the extra sales efforts they intend to pursue to achieve the  company's goal.  </P> <P> Q. What kind of employees realistically could get such an agreement?  </P> <P> A. I think executives are the people who typically have an agreement of this  type.  </P> <P> Q. What should prospective employees look for in an employer?  </P> <P> A. Employees considering joining a company should ask the personnel department  to see a copy of the employee handbook and procedures. Carefully read what that  employer says in its official documents regarding how it's prepared to treat  its employees. Also, employees should be very wary of forms placed in front of  them which may vary from what they have been told are the terms of their  employment. For example, a manager recruiting an engineer from another  aerospace company may make all sorts of promises regarding bonuses, career  opportunities, et cetera, and yet the day they come on board they may have a  document placed in front of them saying something like, "I am aware no one has  authority to make any promises to me regarding length of employment and I can  be terminated at any time for any reason." Six or seven months later, that  employee is fired under circumstances which the employee believes to be  unlawful and, lo and behold, the management lawyer takes out Exhibit 1, this  preprinted form which says the employee can be fired any time for any reason  and says "Didn't you sign this," and "Of course you read it and understood it,  didn't you?" If you are asked to sign such a document, read it very carefully  and scratch out anything that contradicts what has been promised you.  </P> <P> Q. Should a fired employee accept severance pay if he is thinking of suing?  </P> <P> A. Employers do not have a legal obligation to pay severance. The fired  employee presented with a severance package needs to assess whether the money  being offered is worth accepting in exchange for giving up your potential  claims. The average employee would probably need to consult counsel to  determine whether they had a claim and its likely worth compared to the  severance package being offered.  </P> <P> Q. If your case does go to trial, how much can you win in damages?  </P> <P> A. That depends on the law the suit is based on. In an implied contract claim,  punitive damages -- those designed to punish and deter similar treatment in the  future -- are not available to you regardless of the outrageousness of the  employer's conduct. You can get all out-of-pocket losses -- lost wages and lost  benefits plus any catastrophic losses which flowed from the termination. For  example, an employee out of work might lose his home because he can't make the  mortgage payments. Emotional distress damages can also be pursued if such  distress foreseeably resulted from the termination. Under the Fair Employment  and Housing Act, you can get everything I just described plus punitive damages  and attorney's fees. So if a person was sexually harassed at work and brought a  claim under the FEHA, the remedies are potentially much greater than someone  whose contract was breached.  </P></p>

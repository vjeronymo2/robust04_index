			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China's WTO talks go to brink Concern is being voiced in western capitals that unless a basis for agreement can be reached early next year in China's negotiations to join the new World Trade Organisation, the talks may be headed for irretrievable breakdown. Western diplomats have long stressed that many obstacles stand in the way of agreement. But they now concede that, without a breakthrough, outright failure is a possibility. Their gloomy prognoses appear in part to signal a sharp escalation of brinkmanship by the protagonists in the eight-year-long negotiations, as they enter what is widely acknowledged to be a crucial phase. Last week, Mr Long Yong-tu, Beijing's chief negotiator, raised the stakes by seeking to set a year-end deadline for agreement. He said his government would offer no further substantive concessions and seek no more talks with Gatt members after that date. Mr Long's statement was designed to add impetus to an eleventh-hour negotiating push by Beijing. But though he said he was ready to continue bargaining in Geneva until the end of the year, if necessary, there have been few signs yet of progress. Though Mr Long did not to rule out an extension of talks into next year, his statement appeared to rebuff suggestions by the US and the EU and they would be ready to confer WTO founder member status on China if it joined the organisation next summer. Mr Long has suggested that the US, which China regards as the biggest obstacle to its WTO entry, might use the extension to spin out the membership talks indefinitely. However, some western diplomats say they are worried that if no substantive agreement has been reached by early summer - and more probably by Easter - the opportunity for political manoeuvre needed to achieve agreement will have vanished. As one put it bluntly yesterday: 'If the gap in negotiating positions has not been closed by then, the talks will probably be dead in the water.' Such anxieties are greatest in Brussels, where EU officials argue that a successful outcome will require high-level political decisions in Washington as well as in Beijing to override the positions of hard-liners in the two capitals. 'The tone of recent Chinese statements suggests we are now in a very tense end-game,' a senior EU official said. 'If they don't come off their positions and there are no western concessions soon, agreement will be hard to achieve.' It is feared that little time remains for President Bill Clinton to impose a change in the US approach before the new, Republican-dominated Congress takes office next year. Congress does not have a decisive say in China's WTO negotiations. But any big concessions by President Clinton could expose him to accusations of weakness by political opponents and by US business, which sees the WTO negotiations as the best hope of opening up China's markets. In Beijing, meanwhile, room for manoeuvre may be limited by the reluctance of economic reformers to press the case for flexibility at a time when positions are being staked out over the eventual succession to Deng Xiaoping.</p>

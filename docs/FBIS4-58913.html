			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 7 May (KUNA) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC] member-states have called on the Yemeni leaders to respond  "to the initiatives calling for an end to the fighting and to  resort to reason and dialogue to solve their differences".    A statement issued after the meeting of the GCC foreign  ministers or their representatives, which was held here today,  called on the leaders of Yemen to put the interests of Yemen and  its people above all considerations and stop the battles,  fighting and practise utmost self-restraint to spare blood and  protect lives and property.    In the statement, the GCC member-states expressed their  strong anxiety and regret "about the dangerous and painful  impending breakdown witnessed by the Republic of Yemen as a  result of the battles and fighting that broke out between  brothers."    The foreign ministers of Kuwait, Bahrain, the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the ambassadors of the State of Qatar  and the Sultanate of Oman -- who acted for the foreign ministers  who will arrive here later -- met here at midday today.    Diplomatic sources said that the meeting tackled the  preparations for the 5th meeting of the GCC's foreign ministers  and their counterparts in the European Union, which will be held  here tomorrow, in addition to the current situation in Yemen.    They pointed out that the final statement, which will be  issued tomorrow, will include reference to the events that  erupted in Yemen last week.    The sources added that the meeting dealt with some of the  points included in the EU's proposals and will be discussed  tomorrow.    They said that the Council's foreign ministers had  coordinated among themselves to respond to these points so that  an agreement, which would contribute to the development of  relations between the two sides, could be reached.</p>

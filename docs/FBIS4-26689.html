			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten: "Why My </F> Reforms Are Right"]    [Text] This Wednesday the Legislative Council will be  asked to make one of the most important decisions in Hong Kong's  150-year history. After almost two years of debate in the  community, in the Legislative Council chamber and across the  negotiating table, the time has come to decide exactly how we  are going to conduct the elections due in the autumn of this  year and next. Despite some ungracious language in the columns  of one or two of the minority- interest newspapers, the debate  has been characterised more by common sense than controversy,  more by rational discussion than by rhetoric. Few communities  would have conducted such an important debate with such  restraint. But I now detect a weariness. A feeling of "OK, we  have had the debate, there is nothing more to be said, now let's  make up our minds and get on with it".    In essence, the Legislative Council will be asked to provide  answers to two fundamental questions:    -- Should our electoral arrangements be consistent with the  Basic Law or should we move immediately to a fully directly  elected Legislative Council in 1995? This is the issue at stake  with the bill to be proposed by Emily Lau Wai-hing.    -- Should the 1994 and 1995 elections be open and fair or  should we adopt arrangements which, to put it gently, remove  some of the uncertainty from the outcome of the democratic  process? This is the issue at stake when the Government's bill  and the Liberal Party's amendments are debated.    The Government's position on these two fundamental questions  is unequivocal, unambiguous and unanything else the conspiracy  theorists care to name. It has been suggested that we are  somehow conniving to water down our own proposals. But let me  make it clear what we have been saying to members of the  Legislative Council for months. The Government will go on  lobbying and arguing for the proposals contained in its bill and  at the end of the debate on Wednesday you will find the three  official members of the council leading the voting in favour of  the bill.    The case for the Government's proposals is compelling.    -- Our proposals are consistent with the Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law. No one has been able to point to a single  instance in which they offend against either document. On the  contrary, independent legal opinion has confirmed that they meet  the requirements of both. China would therefore have no reason  to change the composition of the legislature in 1997.    -- They have received widespread support in the community. I  do not think anyone seriously doubts that they provide for free  and fair elections and that they would command the confidence of  the community.    -- They would be workable because we would be able to define  electorates, draw up voting registers and conduct the elections  efficiently. In contrast, there are serious doubts about the  fairness of the arrangements proposed by the Liberal Party.  Their practicability has also not been established.    -- The Government's proposals have another great advantage.  They will allow Hong Kong to move on from the debate about  electoral arrangements, while both the Liberal Party amendments  and the Emily Lau bill would simply prolong it.    -- It is quite simply an illusion to assume that a vote for  the Liberal Party amendments is a vote for political harmony and  a quiet life until 1997.    Almost every directly-elected member of the Legislative  Council regards the Government's proposals as the absolute  minimum they could accept. Does anyone really expect them to  acquiesce in the drastically watered-down version which the  Liberal Party wants us to accept? Would passing the Emily Lau  bill actually bring the debate to a close? Does the community  really want electoral arrangements which are so clearly at odds  with the Basic Law?    The council's debate this week will be long and complex.  Members will have to work their way through the details of the  functional constituencies and the election committee. But the  details matter:    -- Are we to rectify the faults with the existing functional  constituencies by expanding their franchises and bringing in a  breath of democratic fresh air? Our proposals would raise the  electorate in these constituencies from 110,000 to 185,000.    -- Can we insulate the nine new functional constituencies  against corruption and unfairness right from the start by making  them more broadly-based and representative of everyone employed  in the major sectors of the economy. [punctuation as published]  Our proposals provide for a franchise of up to 2.5 million in  the nine new constituencies.    -- Is the election committee to be composed of people  genuinely elected in Hong Kong and will its internal voting  procedures be fair?    Our proposals would result in an election committee made up  of all of the elected members of the district boards. The  single transferable vote system we have devised would ensure  that the seats are allocated in proportion to the preferences of  the electors.    Meanwhile, the Liberal Party's answer to all of these  questions is "no". Their amendments would not enhance the  credibility of the electoral process. For example, their  proposals for the nine new functional constituencies would  result in a maximum franchise of only about 120,000. Their  proposals are heavily weighted in favour of employers and  professionals. They give no recognition to the contribution of  the great mass of men and women who make our economy the  outstanding success that it is. If the Liberal Party's  amendments were passed, the result would be that the great  majority of Hong Kong's working population would be represented  in only four of the 30 functional constituencies.    Some of the new functional constituencies proposed by the  Government's opponents seem to have more to do with protecting  vested interests than producing fair electoral arrangements.  For example, why propose a functional constituency limited to  retailers when the closely-related wholesale sector has an  equally strong case for inclusion? Why is the Liberal Party  proposing a new insurance functional constituency when the  insurance industry is already covered in the financial services  functional constituency?    The Government's opponents' amendments on the election  committee display a similar reluctance to accept the community's  desire for openness and fairness. They have proposed a  first-past-the-post voting arrangement which could result in any  political group which could control a mere 50 per cent of the  votes winning a full 100 per cent of the seats! The  Government's proposals were drawn up after our consultations in  Hong Kong made it clear that the community wanted open and fair  electoral arrangements and that it wanted these arrangements to  be consistent with the Basic Law. That is exactly what the  Government's bill would achieve. We shall go on making the case  for these proposals because we believe that the people of Hong  Kong want and deserve electoral arrangements which offer them a  genuine choice. We believe that the integrity of the electoral  process matters because Hong Kong needs a credible Legislative  Council if the rights and freedoms described in the Joint  Declaration are to be preserved.    Ultimately, the decision rests with the Legislative Council.  That is right and proper. The electoral arrangements are a  matter of enacting new laws and it is, after all, the  Legislative Council's role to enact our laws. But members will  be well aware that they will be making a decision on behalf of  the whole community.</p>

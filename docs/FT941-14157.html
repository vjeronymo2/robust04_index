			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / London and Dublin try to revive Northern Ireland peace process London and Dublin last night tried to breathe new life into the Northern Ireland peace initiative by addressing Sinn Fein's demand for clarification of the Downing Street Declaration. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, used separate speeches to encourage support for the joint statement agreed last month. Republican leaders are insisting on clarification before making up their minds on whether to embrace the peace process. Their demand has been repeatedly rejected by London as an attempt to secure further concessions - a stance reiterated by Sir Patrick yesterday afternoon when he told MPs there was no justification for clarifying the joint statement. An apparent stalemate has resulted, with London vowing to intensify political talks with Ulster's constitutional parties, aimed at restoring devolved government to the province. In last night's speech, Sir Patrick balanced a passage offering reassurance to nationalists with a strong affirmation of the unionist veto over any constitutional change in the province's status. In his message to nationalists, Sir Patrick said the government would do 'everything in our power' to facilitate agreement. Emphasising that 'no outcome is ruled out', Sir Patrick said the key was 'agreement between the people living in the island of Ireland, north and south'. He set out the ground that would be covered in exploratory dialogue between London and Sinn Fein that would begin within three months of the IRA renouncing violence, saying: 'That is where clarification could be appropriate.' He told unionists the government would uphold the democratic wish of 'a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' on whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland. Mr Reynolds sought to clarify Dublin's position on self-determination, saying it was vital that doubts or confusions about the document should be cleared up. He said the island of Ireland and 'not just Northern Ireland' made up 'the framework for self-determination'. There were 'no short cuts' to the need for majority consent to change in Northern Ireland. Those wanting unification 'should persuade those that do not'. The end result of self-determination was not necessarily unification, but rather 'any comprehensive settlement that would constitute an agreed Ireland'. In West Belfast, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams hinted to party workers that if the right signals flowed from the declaration an IRA ceasefire could not be ruled out. 'There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is committed to ensuring the British government does not squander that opportunity,' Mr Adams said.</p>

Politicians must restore public trust by conducting "moral  and salutary politics and productive, efficient and high  value-added politics," he said in a policy speech at the  National Assembly plenary meeting.    Kim stressed the need for both the ruling and opposition  parties to produce "a mature image of parliament" through policy  confrontation at all of their meetings.    For reform of the electoral system, the election law  amendments which are being reviewed by the two parties must be  passed by parliament during its current session, he said.    This year, the ruling party will pursue a plan to revise  administrative districts for improved administrative services to  the people and successful local autonomy.    He said the ruling party would develop a new social welfare  model suitable to the realities of the country and work to  prepare a basic social security law based on this model.</p>

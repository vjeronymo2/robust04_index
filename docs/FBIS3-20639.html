			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sichuan Province, China's largest natural gas  production base, produced 6.796 billion cubic meters of natural  gas in 1993, an increase of 4.5 percent over the previous year,  setting the highest record in history.    Sichuan produces over 40 percent of all the natural gas  produced in the country. The Sichuan Petroleum Administrative  Bureau collected scarce funds to speed up the exploration of the  Datianchi, Wubaiti, and other new gas fields of the Chuandong  Drilling and Prospecting Corporation. Many natural gas reserves  were found, and not only did last year's natural gas output at  the Chuandong gas field reach 3.9 billion cubic meters, it made  Sichuan the leading contributor to the nation's natural gas  reserves.</p>

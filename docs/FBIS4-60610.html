			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian policemen tried to prevent Brigadier  General Doron Almog, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commander of  the Gaza Strip, from entering the autonomy. Our correspondent  Shlomi Eldar reports that a Palestinian policeman stopped Gen.  Almog near Netzarim and told him to go back from where he came  or he would shoot at the wheels of Almog's vehicle. The general  telephoned Brig. Ziyad al-Atrash, who arrived at the site.  After talking to the Palestinian policeman, al-Atrash informed  them that Brig. Gen. Almog could enter the autonomy whenever he  wished to do so.</p>

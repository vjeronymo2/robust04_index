			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MALATHION OPTIONS NEED BE FOUND  </P> <P> Aerial spraying of malathion in Orange County is expected to increase in  frequency and area in the coming months, as efforts continue to eradicate the  Mediterranean fruit fly. With the introduction of malathion into our  environment come questions, some of which I will try, as a scientist and public  official, to answer.  </P> <P> What Is Malathion?  </P> <P> Malathion is an organophosphate, one of a group of chemicals that functions by  blocking nerve impulses -- in other words, a nerve gas. In 1962, biologist and  writer Rachel Carson pointed out that malathion is considered a less toxic  compound because it can be detoxified by a liver enzyme. However, in 1984 James  Warf reported that each exposure to malathion reduces the body's ability to  detoxify it. And, even before that, in 1969, the U.S. Department of Health,  Education and Welfare warned that "skin penetration by organophosphates may be  substantial. In view of the toxic potential of these compounds, protection of  workers exposed to them assumes the utmost importance."  </P> <P> Does Malathion Cause Birth Defects?  </P> <P> When malathion was injected into the yolk sac of fertile bird eggs prior to  incubation as a test of toxicity, there was "not only a low percentage of hatch  at a low level of the chemical tested, but there are also congenital  abnormalities and other responses that raise extremely serious questions as to  the safety to the consumers of any food contaminated with these chemicals,"  Joseph McLaughlin reported in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology in 1963.  </P> <P> Does Malathion Cause Cancer?  </P> <P> Cancer researcher Melvin Reuber, in reviewing the scientific literature on the  carcinogenicity and toxicity of malathion in 1984, reported that cancerous  growths on the endocrine organs, brain and liver, as well as ulcers, chronic  renal disease and atrophy of the testes in laboratory rats had been reported.  He observed that, "in tests undertaken to date, it has been demonstrated that  virtually every chemical which has been found to be carcinogenic in humans is  also carcinogenic in one or more mammalian test animals."  </P> <P> Does Malathion Affect Other Living Organisms?  </P> <P> After the 1981-82 aerial eradication program in Santa Clara County, gardens in  the area sprayed with malathion had more white flies, aphids and mites than did  unsprayed gardens. Steve Dreistat and Donald Dahlsten, writing in the  scientific publication Environment in 1986, observed that, "Malathion-bait  sprays adversely affect pollinators such as honey bees. . . . Malathion is  highly toxic to aquatic organisms -- approximately 2,000 mosquito fish  (gambusia) in Mission Creek were killed." It should be noted that the Orange  County Vector Control District stocks flood control channels with these fish to  control mosquitoes.  </P> <P> Is Malathion Harmless at the Concentration Used in Spraying?  </P> <P> Dr. Marc Lappe, the principal author of the 1980 California Department of  Health Services report "Assessment of Health Risks From the Proposed Aerial  Application of Malathion in Santa Clara County," refused to sign the final  version, charging that it misrepresented his findings. "Various studies have  suggested several potential adverse chronic health effects from exposure to  malathion. These risks include birth defects, induction of genetic changes in  germ cells and, perhaps, long-term effects on the nervous system. To my  knowledge, none of this information has been made available to the public -- I  have never reached a decision as to what a safe exposure level is. For these  same reasons, the World Health Organization declined to set a 'safe' limit for  malathion in occupation settings. There have been omissions in the testing of  this pesticide, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency,  recognizing that fact, has ordered further studies concerning the long-term  chronic effect of malathion exposure."  </P> <P> Are There Other Means by Which the Medfly Can Be Controlled?  </P> <P> There are about 1 million insect species, and about 100 of those cause 90% of  the damage to food crops. The ideal method of control affects only the target  insect species, and a number of such controls are available. Sterile male fruit  flies are being released, and that number should be increased. Chemical sex  attractants are now available commercially for 30 major insect pests, including  Japanese beetles. Such species-specific chemical attractants, or pheromones,  should be developed for the Medfly. Other biological controls could include the  introduction of predators, pathogens, parasites or viruses that affect the  Medfly. Basic research in entomology should be initiated or accelerated by the  California Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Finally, a program of education that emphasizes personal responsibility for  limiting the spread of the Medfly should be initiated immediately. Local  elected officials, the Orange County Agriculture Department and the State  Department of Food and Agriculture must cooperate with citizens of Orange  County in this effort.  </P></p>

Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee; and  Yue Qifeng, governor of the provincial government, called on the  conference participants and also made important speeches at the  conference.    Gu Jinchi said in his speech that the more we carry out the  reform and opening up policies and develop the market economy,  the more we should strengthen the construction of the spiritual  civilization and pay attention to safeguarding the stability of  society.    He said: The year 1994 is of extreme importance to speeding  up the setup of the socialist market economic system. Many  major reform measures will start to be carried out one after  another. Various kinds of social contradictions and conflicts  increase, which will add pressure on social stability. The  party committees and governments at various levels, particularly  leading cadres, should approach from the high plane of  consolidating the political power and safeguarding the long-term  peace and stability of the country to comprehensively and  accurately analyze the new situation and the new problems,  constantly remain clear-headed, and try every possible means to  safeguard political and social stability. The top party and  government leaders at various levels should take on the  political responsibility for ensuring safety, personally engage  in safeguarding sociality, and really embody and implement the  principle of taking a two-hand approach and being tough with two  hands.    Gu Jinchi pointed out: Under the current situation where the  hot-debated problems are comparatively concentrated, the party  committees and governments at various levels should  realistically organize the departments at various levels to  eliminate difficulties for the people, to do more good and real  deeds for the people, to pay attention to the interests of the  people, to ceaselessly improve the people's livelihood, and to  continuously upgrade their enthusiasm so as to ceaselessly  deepen the progress of reform.    He finally stressed: To safeguard political and social  stability, we should further strengthen and improve the party's  leadership over the judicial, procuratorial, and court work so  as to ensure that the judicial, procuratorial, and court front  should comprehensively implement the party's line, principles,  and policies.    Governor Yue Qifeng pointed out in his speech: Safeguarding  stability is the common task of the whole party and the whole  society, as well as the important duty of the governments at  various levels. Therefore, the principal leading comrades at  various levels and the principal administrative leading comrades  of various responsible departments, enterprises, and  institutions should have the political and legal responsibility  for safeguarding the stability of social order.    He said: On the one hand, the judicial, procuratorial, and  court organs should resolutely safeguard the long-term stability  of social order; on the other land, they should ensure and  promote the normal and sound operation of the market economy  according to laws. Thus, the judicial, procuratorial, and  court departments are required to further emancipate the mind,  change their ideas, firmly foster the idea of considering  economic construction as a key link, firmly foster the idea that  the market economy is the legal economy, and use the arms of  laws to better serve the economic construction and the progress  of reform and opening up.    Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the provincial government,  made a summing-up speech at the conference.    Some leading comrades, including Chen Suzhi, Zhang Lingyun,  and (Liu Guoqun), also attended the conference.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Personal View: Blind faith in R&amp;D It has become part of the conventional wisdom that the level of industrial spending on research and development (R&amp;D) helps to explain international differences in industrial performance, and that one reason for the disappointing performance of British industry is that it spends less than its competitors on R&amp;D. But these beliefs are not supported by the evidence. The most appropriate measure of industrial effort devoted to R&amp;D is industrially financed R&amp;D as a percentage of industrial production. As the table shows, Germany and Japan are the only large industrial countries in which industry devotes a significantly higher proportion of its income to R&amp;D than British industry. French and Italian industry have performed well while devoting less to R&amp;D than does British industry. At the level of the nation, there is clearly no simple correlation between industrial expenditure on R&amp;D and growth. It is naive to imagine that national growth can be closely correlated with research expenditure. Growth depends more on increasing the efficiency with which resources are used than it does on increasing the input of such resources, including R&amp;D. Research activity is only one way in which industry can improve its efficiency; and it is the results of this activity, not the level of expenditure on it that determines its contribution to the growth of industrial efficiency. One explanation of the pattern of British industry's expenditure on R&amp;D over the years could be that the results of its high expenditure in the 1960s proved commercially disappointing, and that the UK increased its expenditure in the 1980s when competition intensified. Economists are tempted to use any available figures when comparing the economic performance of nations, even if the figures are not truly relevant. R&amp;D statistics are among the less relevant figures. The most interesting questions are why companies and industries differ in the success with which they introduce new products and processes to increase sales and reduce costs, and whether changes to the hardware or to the organisation of marketing and production do more to improve efficiency. Expenditure on one means of improving the hardware is not a very useful figure in this context. It is all the less useful because decisions concerning which efforts to improve hardware should be called R&amp;D are partially subjective, so that international differences in R&amp;D expenditure may well reflect differences in the interpretation of what it comprises. Studies of the reasons for international differences in industrial performance therefore need to be analytical and qualitative rather than quantitative. Statistics can only provide a starting point for analysis, not the answers themselves. It is depressing, given the limited significance of R&amp;D expenditure, that the Democratic party of the US - along with the Labour party of the UK - places so much emphasis on tax incentives to encourage more spending on R&amp;D. A company's expenditure on innovative activity, including R&amp;D, is largely determined by the technical opportunities for such activity in its industry and by the intensity of the competition it faces. Tax reliefs will reduce the cost of R&amp;D, but this reduction is unlikely to increase significantly the expected return. The British government is trying to encourage firms to spend more on R&amp;D by promoting the publication of research expenditure by individual companies. But the government's efforts to make companies more conscious of their R&amp;D expenditure are likely to cause companies to place more of their activities in this category, which is what the US tax credit appears to have done. This government intervention may therefore make everyone happy without changing anything but the work of the accountants. If any government wants to improve the performance of its national industries, it should recognise that improvement will depend on getting more output from the available inputs, not on increasing the quantity of the inputs, whether R&amp;D, investment or employment. Performance is a matter of how firms are managed, which governments cannot directly influence. The most relevant role for government is to improve the quality of the labour input through its influence on the educational system, and to maintain a stable macro-economic climate. Attempts to increase the quantity of R&amp;D demonstrate politicians' failure to analyse the problem and their desire to be seen to be doing something.

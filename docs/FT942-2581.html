			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rugby makes Dollars 93m US purchase Rugby, the cement group, has paid Dollars 93m (Pounds 61.2m) to acquire the US building materials distribution business of Bunzl, the distribution and cigarette filters group. To pay for the acquisition, Rugby is placing 48.9m shares with institutional investors at 125p each. The placing is being organised by Schroders. Following the announcement the cement group's share price rose by 3p to 134p. Bunzl said the sale would result in a net goodwill charge of about Pounds 35m in the current financial year. It intends to use the sale proceeds to cut group borrowings. Its share price yesterday was unchanged at 164p. Mr Peter Carr, Rugby's managing director, said the acquisition was expected to be earnings enhancing in the first year. The group is buying a distribution business with 7 branches in north-eastern states; 10 branches in the mid-west and 8 in the west. Products supplied include doors, windows, roofing materials, ceiling and floor tiles, lumber and plywood. It made an operating profit last year of Dollars 6.4m (Dollars 1.2m in 1992) on sales of Dollars 359m (Dollars 364m). The business reported net operating assets of Dollars 76.8m at the end of December. Mr Carr said that the acquisition would complement Rugby's existing US operations involving 22 wholesale distribution branches in the eastern part of the country. 'Where overlap occurs its impact is generally limited by differences in the product range and customer base,' said Mr Carr. The deal would enhance Rugby's purchasing power, allow cross-fertilisation of product lines and increase the company's ability to service national and regional customers, he added. The US was recovering from recession with a consensus forecast of 3.6 per cent economic growth this year. The final purchase price will depend upon a revaluation of Bunzl Building Supply's net operating assets, subject to a ceiling of Dollars 94m.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Securities professionals face exam THE CITY of London's newest professional body, the Securities Institute, is urging potential members to beat a March 31 deadline and escape a nine-hour examination ordeal. Membership will be much easier while the 'window of opportunity' remains open. Until Wednesday former members of the Stock Exchange will be transferred automatically, subject only to a check of their continuing good standing with regulators such as the Securities and Futures Authority. Other experienced practitioners in areas such as corporate finance, investment management, futures trading and back office settlement can also take advantage of the window. They will face an interview, however, and will be required to show 15 years' experience - or 10 years if they have a relevant qualification, such as chartered accountancy. At present the institute, which is less than a year old, has 5,000 members, including about 4,000 from the Stock Exchange - which no longer offers individual membership, following structural reforms last year. The short-term target is for 5,500 members. After March 31 new full-members will be accepted only on passing diploma examinations. To be held twice a year, these will involve three sessions, each of three hours. The institute aims to be the main professional body for the securities industry, promoting standards of skill and ethics. It is involved in discussions about a possible merger with the long-established Institute of Investment Management and Research, a more specialised body.</p>

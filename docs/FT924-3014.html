			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Russian government prepares for walk-on role THE Russian government met last night fully expecting to be asked to continue for three months in an acting capacity. Its daily companion, the economic crisis, will also continue, though in a more permanent capacity. In that sense, the Seventh Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which yesterday failed to confirm the appointment of Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister, has changed nothing fundamental yet. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Gaidar, the acting prime minister, offered important concessions to get support for Mr Gaidar's appointment from the Congress centre - concessions of people and policies. It was understood last night that those concessions will remain. The personnel changes started in November, when in quick succession Mr Yeltsin relieved Mr Yegor Yakovlev of his post as head of the Commonwealth TV service, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin of his post as information minister and moved Mr Gennady Burbulis from the post of state secretary to that of chief adviser. These were seen as bowing to the wishes of the centrist Civic Union bloc with whom he wished to make an agreement: though in fact, Mr Yakovlev was an appointee of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev with no secure base in the Yeltsin nomenklatura, Mr Burbulis suffered no appreciable loss of power and Mr Poltoranin is likely to get another high-level job soon. As compromises they were fairly small beer. The deal offered by Mr Yeltsin on Tuesday was a grander affair. To persuade the deputies to vote for Mr Gaidar, he proposed that the Supreme Soviet, the standing parliament, would have the right to confirm four ministers apart from the premier - defence, foreign affairs, interior and security. This put the unpopularly liberal Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, directly in the firing line: he was to be a sacrifice for the preservation of Mr Gaidar. Mr Gaidar said yesterday there would be further changes in the cabinet - but stressed that this would be on the grounds of ability, not because others wanted their jobs. 'The past year, he said, 'has shown that not everyone in the cabinet can cope with their responsibilities.' The policy changes are potentially more serious. In the last few days, Mr Gaidar or Mr Yeltsin have promised a long delay in rises in the oil price to world levels, the indexing of the billions of roubles in personal savings and an end to the decline in production and living standards. Underpinning their new policy is a document which has been agreed between the government and the Civic Union. Called 'Urgent Measures to Take Russia out of its Crisis', it is in effect an agreement for the government to protect, promote and support Russian industry: in its key phrase, to conduct a 'managed transition' to the market economy. In part, this policy is already in place. Russian companies are protected by fantastically cheap inputs, though their low quality of output means they have not yet capitalised on this - and on the undervalued rouble - by exporting much. The policy also allows for the pumping of credits, more or less indiscriminately, into enterprises, good and bad. As Mr Gaidar put it yesterday, he wished to give the crisis 'a more structural character': that is, he wants the credits to go to the winners, and the losers to go to the wall. It is a policy on which a compromise with the industrialists can be based. But it is not, according to the foreign financial experts in Moscow, a policy for financial stability. Nor, on the face of it, will it help to get inflation down to 2 per cent a week (from 4 per cent) as Mr Gaidar promised yesterday. Mr Yeltsin, Mr Gaidar and his cabinet all stress that inflation, and the fear of hyperinflation, is their main concern: but if it is, they have, as yet, no explicit programme for combating it. No government could survive, unpunished, with such a record as Mr Gaidar's in a fully functioning democracy: the fact that the votes for and against yesterday were so evenly balanced showed that he had won over part of the centre. (There is even the prospect that his premiership might be proposed over and over again until he wins.) Meanwhile, the government is, as it well knows, saddled with the task of allowing most things to get worse in order to clear the space for them to get better. And the Congress has neither been able to affect the likelihood of things getting worse, nor bring forward the time when they will get better.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF PEOPLE'S DEPUTIES 1060 deputies; 4 main groups; 14 factions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PARLIAMENTARY REFORM COALITION, the so-called radical democrats, has 251 deputies and firmly supports the Yeltsin-Gaidar government. The coalition is the successor of the DemRossiya movement which brought Yeltsin to power.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CENTRE is divided into two groups, both of which overlap with the Civic Union, an unstable alliance of 'centrist' political figures who have been negotiating with the government on conditions for supporting it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Democratic Centre grouping has 200 deputies who represent, among others, the Unaffiliated Deputies, the Left Centre and the Popular Free Russia Party (whose honourary chairman is Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi). This grouping is divided over whether to support the government and what policy changes to demand. It is closely identified with the Civic Union.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Creative Forces grouping has 151 deputies and represents, among others, the Industrial Union, a conservative industrialist faction which is not part of the Civic Union, and Smena (Change of Guard), which is officially part of the Civic Union but wants a change of government.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RUSSIAN UNITY has 355 deputies and unites communist and militant nationalists. It includes factions such as the Communists of Russia and the Agrarian Union, which embraces the directors of state farms. Russian Unity virulently opposes the government and its economic reform programme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Russian Parliament Press Centre  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

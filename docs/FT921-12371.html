			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Management: Trading places - Andrew Bolger looks at Inchcape's attempt to shed its traditional British image Charles Mackay, the new chief executive of Inchcape, would like to see more Japanese and Chinese executives in his London headquarters in St James's, opposite Christie's, the art auctioneer. The former colonial trading house is trying to shed its traditional British image. It is setting out on the text-book route of corporate change, and is on its way to becoming a thoroughly 'global' organisation. It has cut layers out of its old hierarchical management and is dividing its activities by business - motors, marketing and services such as insurance and shipping - rather than by location. The new 'global' approach mirrors the changes that have already taken place among Inchcape's customers in the motor and shipping industries. According to Mackay, who pioneered the change when he was head the group's Far East operation, it offers focus and specialisation. Managers in each stream now report to a London-based board director. The change is meant to make the company more professional. 'You can now attract specialists. Inchcape used to be a company of generalists - you did not get to the top if you were a motors person,' says Mackay.' An aim of the restructuring is to cut the layers of executives above line managers and speed decision-making. Mackay says: 'In the old days there used to be five layers of management above the man running one of our industrial companies in Hong Kong. By the time you got to someone who knew about industrial products, he was six levels down - and paid accordingly.' Inchcape believes streaming will speed growth, since people were very parochial when business was organised on a country or territory basis. 'They tended to think of Hong Kong, but ignored Taiwan,' says Mackay. 'One reason that Inchcape Pacific has grown fast is that people were looking at the whole area.' Focusing on individual countries also prevented the easy transmission of best practice across the group. 'Good people in Hong Kong did not pass on lessons - not because they didn't want to do it, but because there was no mechanism.' Business streaming should also counteract the understandable tendency of managers to cling on to their more talented staff - rather than send them to a another territory, where they might be needed more. Despite this move towards running business on a global basis, Inchcape has recognised the need to retain a 'country manager' - a senior executive who will try to co-ordinate all Inchcape activities in any given territory. Mackay says that in communities such as Hong Kong and Singapore, it is particularly important that there should be a 'Mr Inchcape' - someone who can speak and act for the whole group in government and business circles. In most cases, the country manager will be the executive in charge of marketing, since he is likely to have the best knowledge of the local trading environment. Mackay says he envisages the country manager keeping a 'fatherly eye' on smaller outfits as well as looking out for development and opportunities for the group as a whole. Mackay is in no doubt about the relative importance of these changes. 'Globalisation is 80 per cent of it and the country manager role is 20 per cent. Global is the watchword.' He also accepts that success will depend on the personalities of the individual managers involved. 'It may work perfectly, it may get off to a rocky start - but we have to try.' David John, director of the marketing stream, says there is bound to be tension in some cases: 'If a country manager and an executive have a falling out, it will be my job to fly in and bang their heads together.' Before anyone is recruited, prospective executives are introduced to a lot of people in the group, Japanese-style, to ensure they will fit in. Mackay is also aware of the need for the group to 'grow' more of its own managers: 'We're not a big company like Shell - we are a collection of smaller companies.' In attempting to foster an international management culture, Inchcape has used the Euro-Asian Centre of the management school, Insead, at Fontainebleau in France. John said: 'It's not British. We deliberately chose it because Inchcape is not British.' John says the Insead courses are more important in cultural than in educational terms: 'We could hold courses in the Far East - it would be a great deal cheaper - but we must get our executives thinking internationally.' Inchcape organises two three-week sessions a year for high-flying middle managers in their thirties, and a two-week course for senior managers. Despite these efforts, John believes the culture of the group is still far too British. He says it must start bringing more local managers through, without going down the road of tokenism, and hopes to make 70 per cent of appointments through internal promotion. Mackay says sending in an expatriate can often be unjustifiably expensive, when that means the group has to pay for leave passages and the education of children. 'We are trying to move towards a system where people are paid according to their level, not where they come from.' The culture of a group with its roots deep in Britain's colonial past cannot be changed overnight. Change must also reach to the top - and Inchcape's board has only one member who is not British, a French non-executive director.</p>

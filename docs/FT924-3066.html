			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Rowland set to dilute Lonrho stake LONRHO, the international trading group, is close to signing a deal which will result in a significant dilution of the 15 per cent stake held by Mr Tiny Rowland, its 75-year-old chief executive. The deal, which may be announced today, is understood to involve a rights issue to raise cash for the group, which has net debt of around Pounds 850m. Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Fleming Securities, said: 'There is a strong indication in the market that suggests that Mr Tiny Rowland is about to dilute his stake and may eventually sell it to a German financier. 'However, whoever gets hold of Mr Rowland's stake may not necessarily end up in control of Lonrho. There are a number of other companies which are very interested in the group.' The shares yesterday closed 1p higher at 74p, with 1.3m shares traded during the day on market rumours of the impending deal. Genting, the Far Eastern group, has built up a 7.3 per cent stake in Lonrho, and analysts believe it may be interested in the group's hotels and casinos. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman of Gencor, South Africa's second-largest mining group, recently told analysts that he was interested in Lonrho's platinum and coalmining interests in South Africa, and its 45 per cent stake in the Ashanti gold mine in Ghana.</p>

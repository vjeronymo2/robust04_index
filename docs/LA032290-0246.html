			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GM MATCHES CHRYSLER REBATE  </P> <P> The Oldsmobile division of General Motors Corp. announced today a $1,000 rebate  on its new Silhouette minivan, with GM's Pontiac and Chevrolet divisions  expected to make similar offers, all in efforts to undermine robust sales of  Chrysler Corp.'s models.  </P> <P> Oldsmobile's offer, which starts Friday, runs until May 2 and includes an  alternative of low-rate financing.  </P> <P> The move by GM came after Chrysler placed a $1,000 rebate on its front-drive  Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans last December under a program  that expired Jan. 31.  </P> <P> Chrysler saw January sales of those already popular models soar 67% from the  previous month because of the offer.  </P> <P> However, Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said Chrysler had no plans at this  time to offer another rebate on its minivans.  </P></p>

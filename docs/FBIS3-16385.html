			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Data on Ukrainian Weapons Trade in </F> 1993"]    [Text] The number of conventional weapons that remained on  Ukrainian soil after the breakup of the Soviet Union had to be  reduced in three stages. Between 1991 and 1993, 25 percent of  all weapons -- 531 tanks, 422 infantry vehicles, and 140  aircraft -- had to be eliminated.    In 1993, the total export of weapons abroad stood at $29  million, while the total export of goods -- at $5.508 billion  [as published]. The specific proportion of weapons exported as  part of total exports is 25 percent.    As for Ukraine, it sold tanks to Slovakia and Russia for the  sum of $575,000; aircraft, including satellites and  missile-carriers, for $5,199,000, and radio guidance equipment  for $3,651,000. In addition, military and rescue vessels were  sold to Russia and Greece for a total of $721,000. Bombs,  grenades, torpedoes, missiles, and cartridges made up the  greatest portion of military exports ($9,772,000). Ukraine  sold ships as scrap-iron to Turkey, Russia, and Britain for  $579,000.    It is difficult to comment on the benefits of this trade for  Ukraine, because there is no official data on the total amount  of weapons traded. We learned from sources close to the  president that Ukraine sold 80 tanks. We know that the latest  model T-80T, which is being produced in Kharkov, costs more than  $2 million. The cost of this tank as scrap-iron is $4,000 (one  tonne of scrap-iron sells for $100).    We would like to add that in 1992, the Commercial Center  within the Ukrainian Defense Ministry traded 13 military vessels  as scrap-iron. The Ukrainian state coffers received only 5  percent from the sale of this scrap-iron. The Commercial Center  was later disbanded.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Inflation remains the primary factor - European bonds rallied strongly in 1993 while the US caught the jitters after a good start If short-term memory is stronger than long-term memory, 1993 in the US bond market may be remembered more for the jitters that sent prices reeling in the final 10 weeks of the year, than for the proceeding 9 1/2 -month rally that pushed long-term interest rates to the lowest levels in a generation. This would be something of a shame, because for most of this year the bond market has enjoyed a remarkable run. In the first few days of 1993, long-term yields were trading close to 7.5 per cent. By mid-October, yields had plunged to 5.78 per cent, a record low in the modern era. The primary forces behind the bond market's rally - a rally which helped spur stock prices to record highs in 1993 - were low inflation and an economic recovery that was weak compared to previous post-recessionary periods. Worldwide disinflationary forces, including declining oil and other commodity prices and the gradual dismantling of various barriers to free trade, combined with vigorous price competition in the US retail and services sectors, kept inflation throughout the year in a range between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. A stuttering economy, at least in the first half of the year, was also partly responsible for the lack of inflationary pressures. In particular, concern about how President Clinton's first budget (which was designed to shrink the deficit by raising taxes and cutting federal spending) would affect the economy acted as a restraint on corporate and consumer spending. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy was another factor pushing bond yields lower. Although interest rates remained unchanged throughout 1993 - the prime rate and discount rate started and ended the year at 6 per cent and 3 per cent respectively - the lack of strong economic growth persuaded the Fed to keep policy on hold for the year. Meanwhile, low short-term rates forced investors to switch billions of dollars out of bank certificates of deposit and money market funds, which were returning a meagre 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and into assets with higher yields. For conservative investors uncomfortable with the risk inherent in buying equities, bonds became the natural refuge. Finally, technical considerations played a role in the rally, when the government reduced the number of bond auctions from four to three per year, and increased the size of short- and medium-term debt issues accordingly. The move was designed to cut the cost of government financing by shortening the maturity of the federal debt. The result was a shortage of 30-year bonds, which served to drive prices higher in an already buoyant market. However, the rally ran out of steam in mid-October. Within two weeks, the 30-year bond yield had jumped almost 50 basis points to more than 6.2 per cent. Another fortnight later, yields were flirting with 6.4 per cent, and the smell of panic was in the air. The spark for the sell-off was provided by stronger-than-expected economic reports. Although the prices data in the final months of the year did not suggest inflation had revived along with the quickening pace of economic activity, investors were looking toward 1994, and a grim future of surging economic growth, rising prices, and a tightening of monetary policy. This is the gloomy scenario for the bond market. However, not everyone paints such a bleak picture for next year. While economic growth is expected to come in at over 4 per cent for the final quarter of 1993, some economists see a slowing down in growth in the first half of 1994 as the tax increases in President Clinton's first budget begin to take their toll on spending and investment. The optimists expect inflation to remain subdued because of the structural disinflationary forces in the global economy. And they are confident that the Fed will not overreact to the late-1993 growth surge by pushing interest rates sharply higher in early 1994. The expected replacement in January of Mr Wayne Angell, an important Fed governor and the central bank's biggest inflation hawk, with the more accommodating and growth-oriented Ms Alice Rivlin, currently number two at the Office of Management and Budget, lends support to that view. A quick glance at Wall Street's 1994 bond market forecasts finds that the optimists represent the majority. Consequently, the consensus among analysts is that bond prices will rally early next year, and by enough to push long-term yields down below 6 per cent once more. Further out in 1994, however, growth rates are expected to pick up, which could mean that the first half rally will be short-lived.</p>

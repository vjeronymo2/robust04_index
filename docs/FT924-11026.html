			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / El Salvador deal lifts peace hopes EL SALVADOR'S government has agreed to extend to December 15 the deadline by which the country's former rebels demobilise, thereby breaking the impasse that had threatened to scupper peace accords signed in January, writes Damian Fraser. FMLN rebels had agreed to demobilise by October 31, but missed deadlines after claiming the state had not complied with pledges to give them land and reform the military. Under the new guidelines, 20 per cent of the forces will be demobilised on October 31, another 20 per cent on November 20, and the final 20 per cent on December 15. The government has in turn submitted to the UN proposals to purge army officers found guilty of, among other transgressions, human rights abuses.</p>

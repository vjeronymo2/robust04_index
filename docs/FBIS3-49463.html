			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Bratinka, deputy foreign minister of </F> the Czech Republic, by Juergen Gottschlich and Tomas  Niederberghaus; place and date not given: "The Shadows of  Munich"]    [Excerpts] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Bratinka, why is the  Czech Republic so interested in becoming a member of NATO?    [Bratinka] NATO is a tested organization that has protected  Western Europe against Soviet aggression for 40 years. It is an  association of democratic countries that act on consensus. Even  though today it is said that there is no threat in Europe at the  moment, NATO is able to guarantee its members' security,  regardless of where danger comes from. Think of the Gulf war.    No matter how things might look to you from the West, our  region is anything but stable. People do not feel safe. The only  organization that can provide security is NATO. However, we need  NATO for still another reason: It keeps the United States in  Europe. The past century has made it quite clear that Europe is  a very dangerous place without the Americans. [passage omitted]    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is Russia a hostile country for you?    [Bratinka] Not at the moment. Our enemies are the  nationalists, who attack each other and destabilize the region.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this is precisely what NATO cannot  prevent.    [Bratinka] No, that is not true. As an organization, NATO  would be able to intervene in the former Yugoslavia, but it is  not ready to act. However, this is a discussion about what it  should do and not what it would be able to do. Without the  structure and experience of NATO, European security is  inconceivable.    Our current problem is the general insecurity and the  extremists from the various camps. Think of Zhirinovskiy in  Russia. [passage omitted]    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Why does the Czech Republic now try to  pursue NATO membership on its own and no longer as a project of  the Visegrad states?    [Bratinka] Well, because NATO will never accept countries  that do not fulfill certain criteria. This will work only bit by  bit. But this is not so bad. When a former communist country in  Eastern Europe--I hope it will be my country--becomes a NATO  member, this will have considerable effect on the entire region.  Why? The West would then have crossed the Rubicon, would have  moved from the sphere of beautiful words and vague promises to  concrete deeds.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] And you believe that NATO will take the  step across the Rubicon?    [Bratinka] We do not assume that we will get a membership  certificate at the coming summit. However, we expect to see a  light at the end of the tunnel, and this would be an encouraging  development also for the other countries in the region. We  envisage this development in two stages. First, a general  decision. If this is positive, there will be a concrete process  of different duration for the different East European countries.  There, each country has to present itself; there the issue will  be finances, armaments, and other problems, joint training, etc.  We assume that NATO will recognize our accession as a gain for  everyone. We do not want to be a stowaway in NATO, for whom  others pay.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is it conceivable for you that NATO will  change to such an extent that Russia, too, is able to become a  member of the club?    [Bratinka] Of course, NATO must take care to remain capable  of action. Countries that want to be members should examine  themselves as to whether they are willing to adjust to the rules  of NATO and whether they are able to do so. If this is so, they  should become members. No one will seriously claim today that  Russia corresponds to these criteria. Let us wait and see. As  soon as the Russians have concluded their reforms and stable  institutions have developed, this question might make sense.    The West had better support the beginnings of democratic  institutions in Russia now. Zhirinovskiy had $1 million  available for his election campaign, far more than the  democratic parties. Where are the billions and billions of  dollars that the West has given to the Russian Government? The  West should give grants to Russians so that they can accumulate  experiences with the democratic system, so that as many people  as possible learn in practice how parliamentary democracy  actually works. [passage omitted]    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What would be an alternative to NATO? Why  do the East European states not form their own alliance, which  would then cooperate with NATO?    [Bratinka] NATO has the experience and the infrastructure,  and, if every country makes its army compatible to NATO, the  countries can automatically cooperate with each other.  Therefore, joining NATO is the realistic path. Also for  political reasons--think of the conflicts between Slovakia and  Hungary--such an association, an alliance of East European  states, would hardly be possible. In West Europe it worked only  because the United States exerted a lot or pressure and the  Soviet threat was so massive. No, this is no realistic path.    A message by NATO that says "we do not want you, solve your  problems on your own" would be a disaster for the region. Above  all, the reform states would slide into a big crisis. The  democratic movements have all come to power with the slogan: Now  we will again become a part of Europe, a part of the Western  world. If the reformers are now betrayed, the hour of the  nationalists will come--as it happened before in history.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You speak of betrayal. Do we understand  you correctly? You mean that if you now have to remain outside  the door, this would be a repetition of Munich in 1938?    [Bratinka] Yes, exactly. For us it can be compared with the  Munich Agreement and with the Treaty of Yalta. There are so many  political desperados who are just waiting to sow unrest, to play  up the Sudeten German issue, and to accuse the West of alleged  mistakes in history. A rejection by the West would be like a  shadow of Munich.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Would you consider membership in NATO  more  important than membership in the European Union?    [Bratinka] These are two different problems, which cannot be  discussed as alternatives. So far, no one has told us that we  have to choose between membership in NATO or in the European  Union. If this were the case, we would certainly have a heated  debate with quite contrary preferences. So far, however, we have  not been confronted with such a dilemma.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salihovic] </F>   [Text] Last night, the chetniks on the Brcko front  received news of the cease-fire agreement that is supposed to go  into effect on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts at 1200 tomorrow,  by launching fierce attacks on the defense lines of the free  Brcko territory. At 2130, a strong  artillery-reconnaissance-subversive-terrorist group [as heard]  tried to breach the Brcko defense lines in the Vranovaca region.  The defenders responded fiercely and the fighting flared up.  The aggressor ended up with the short end of the stick.    After being defeated and suffering losses, the chetniks  attacked the entire region of Vranovaca from the direction of  Cadjavac with 82-mm mortars. The final outcome of the fighting  in Vranovaca is that the (?situation) remained unchanged.  Between 2000 and 2200, the aggressor attacked the neighboring  village of Bodariste with 60 and 82-mm mortars from the  direction of (?Delimir Ravno). During the two-hour artillery  attack, the enemy fired several dozen shells, but apart from  destroying more civilian residences, no military successes were  scored.    Overnight, the chetniks intermittently shelled the Zukici  area with 82-mm mortars from the direction of Sekulici and  anti-aircraft guns in Lipovac. The aggressor did not accomplish  his aims on this part of the front either. The defense lines of  the free Brcko territory are safe and under the full control of  the fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade, the 108th Infantry  Brigade, and units from other contingents. During the agreed  cease-fire, there are many reasons to remain alert.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--The release of details of agreements reached  between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  on implementing their Jan. 7 economic accord has been delayed  for 48 hours upon the request of the PLO leadership, both sides  said Friday [13 May].    It was not immediately known whether the PLO leadership in  Tunis would seek any amendment to the agreements, which were  supposed to have been formalised and released Thursday through a  joint statement and a press conference.    The delay in the process was attributed to the PLO Executive  Committee's preoccupations with naming members of an "autonomy  cabinet" for the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    Information made available to the JORDAN TIMES indicated  that  the main points covered by the agreements included:    -- The formation of a joint committee for banking and  monetary affairs in the autonomous territories; envisaged under  the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO declaration of principles;    -- Free trade between Jordan and the autonomous territories;  and    -- Maintaining the Jordanian dinar as the "main currency" in  circulation in the occupied territories.    "These are the salient points in the agreement which are of  utmost importance at this point in time," said a Palestinian  source. "Other points cover the technical details of how to  implement these decisions and also touch upon tourism," said the  source, who preferred anonymity.    Jordanian sources confirmed that these were the broad  outline  of the agreements, reached in two days of talks between a  high-level Jordanian delegation headed by Minister of State for  Cabinet Affairs Jawad al-'Anani and a PLO team led by Ahmad  Quray', director of the Economic Department of the PLO.    "It is an implementation-oriented document, and we hope to  launch moves on the ground as soon as it is ratified by the  leaderships of the two countries," said a senior-Jordanian  source, adding that the government had reviewed and endorsed it.    According to the source, who also preferred anonymity, "the  agreements are those we could arrive at, given the peculiar  circumstances of Palestinian autonomy."    "Are the Palestinians free to decide and act as they want?"  asked another official, in a reference to an economic agreement  signed by the PLO and Israel in Paris in April.    That accord details a series of measures that are widely  seen  as confining the PLO's freedom in exercising its economic  options with Jordan, or any other party other than the occupying  power itself. Furthermore, it also closed the door against the  implementation of some of the provisions in the Jan. 7 agreement  signed between Jordan and the PLO in Amman.    Asked whether the agreements reached last week reflected the  Kingdom's acceptance that they were the best that the Kingdom  and the PLO could hope for, given the Israeli-imposed  limitations, the source was non-committal, saying: "That's your  deduction."    The sources said the joint Jordanian-Palestinian committee  on  banking and monetary affairs could meet as early as Saturday,  shortly after the expected release of the details of the  document.    Under the agreements, the committee, which will be headed on  the Jordanian side by the deputy governor of the Central Bank of  Jordan (CBJ) and on the Palestinian side by the deputy  governor's counterpart from the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), will monitor and  control banking and currency affairs in the occupied territories.    Jordanian banks which have already been licensed by the CBJ  to reopen their branches in the occupied territories will also  come under the committee's control and supervision. All future  applications for licensing will be dealt with by the committee.    The sources said Jordan had expressed reservations over a no  ceiling, free-trade arrangement between the Kingdom and the  autonomous territories and but then dropped its reservations.  The Kingdom had suggested a $300 million ceiling for trade, but  the PLO could not meet that volume because of the  Israeli-imposed curbs in the Paris agreement.    "We decided to keep trade open-ended in the initial stage,"  said the Jordanian source. "We hope to develop it further as we  go along further in our economic cooperation."    There were no formal meetings on Thursday. Royal Court Chief  Sharif Zayid Bin Shakir and the King's advisors held talks with  the PLO delegation. No details were available on the  discussions.    "We have forwarded the agreements to the PLO Executive  Committee and are awaiting its response," said the Palestinian  source. "We hope to receive the committee's endorsement anytime  now."    "Hopefully, we could wind up the meetings early Saturday and  release the details," added the source.    The self-rule authority will use the Jordanian dinar in all  its dealing, he source said.    "The dinar will be the main currency in circulation in  autonomous territories as well as the rest of the occupied  lands," said the source.    All other currencies, including the Israeli shekel, will  also  be used, added the source.    The Paris agreement states that the shekel will be "a legal  tender" in he autonomous territories.</p>

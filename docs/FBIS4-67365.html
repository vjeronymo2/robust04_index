			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Sunderlal Bahuguna: "Black Shadow of the Demon </F> Named Development"]    [Text] The threat of the end of the human race caused by  the neglect of our environment has not stopped. The past four  decades of economic development have culminated in a global  awareness, and the "State of the World Report 1994" has  presented additionally some irrefutable and shocking facts.  These became apparent at the meeting of the World Awareness  Group, which has scientifically evaluated the developmental  activities of the past four decades and has adopted the mandate  to direct the course of action for the next 40 years. The  administrators, policymakers, and sociologists of the world have  been using this report as a path finder. It has been translated  into 27 languages. Ten million copies of the English edition  alone have been printed from New York, London, and New Delhi.  Eleven hundred copies were distributed among world leaders  participating in the recent International Financial Forum in  Davos.    The first disadvantage of making economic advancement the  goal of development has been an imbalanced and astounding  grabbing for ownership of the substances that keep the earth  alive. Before human intervention, the production capacity of  earth-related materials from forests and pastures was about 150  billion tons. Humans destroyed about 12 percent of this and used  about 27 percent. Thus 40 percent has already been used up by  humans, leaving only 60 percent for other living things. This 40  percent is from that portion which was easily accessible to  humans. Now, the trend is to reach for more and more.    What will be the result of this? When the forests are  invaded  too much, it impacts the water resources. In spite of the noise  made about the preservation of forests, 130 million hectares of  the world's forests have been destroyed from 1970-90. The  majority of these were tropical forests, which were home to and  a treasury of many varied species of flora and fauna. In  destroying these forests, a delicate balance of biodiversity,  forest resources, and a well-established eco-system of symbiotic  creatures has been irrevocably upset. The procreation and  natural balance has been replaced by a market philosophy of  industrial production, based on human selfishness.  Biotechnology, acclaimed widely as the hope of the future, is  the biggest culprit as it sucks the earth repeatedly, until  there is nothing left.    The same thing that was done to the forests has been  repeated  with farm lands. Four decades of development have been showing  astounding food and other production due to the green  revolution. Along with improved food grain production, meat  production has also increased 2.6 times.    This would have made those pushing for advancement happy,  except that after 1984 there was a sudden decrease in food  production. The increase had been a direct result of  improvements in irrigating and fertilizing techniques. A ton of  fertilizer used to yield 9 tons of produce, but once the  productivity zenith was reached, it fell to only 2 tons. Between  1984 and 1993, the annual food production went down from 29  million tons to only 12 million tons. In the next 40 years, by  the year 2030, should the same condition prevail, the yield  would only be 248 kg per capita, compared to the top production  year 1984 with a per capita production of 346 kg. The  fluctuation in food production directly impacts meat production.  We must not assume wrongly that the per capita growth in food  production has met food demands and has lead to self-sufficiency  and uplifting of living standards of the poor. This  misconception can be dispelled by looking at the per capita  consumption statistics worldwide. The annual per capita food  consumption for Canada was 974 kg, and for the United States,  860 kg, when for India it was 186 kg, and for Bangladesh 176 kg!  This striking difference is because those countries' greatest  use of food products is to convert them into fodder for  obtaining animal-protein in the form of meat, eggs, and milk. An  American's average annual consumption includes 42 kg of beef, 28  kg of pork, 44 kg of poultry, and 271 kg of milk, whereas an  Indian's food consumption is mainly to wipe out hunger, and stay  alive.    There has been an extraordinary increase also in fisheries.  It had increased to an annual production of 100 million tons in  1990, from a mere 22 million tons in 1950. The per capita  consumption had risen from 9 kg per year to 19 kg, but now there  is a marked decrease in this also. This has decreased to only 11  kg per capita. The main reason for this is the pollution of the  ocean floor from where 90 percent of the fish are obtained.    This picture of economic development makes it clear that our  planet is hurtling towards its demise. The dance of death will  be felt more acutely in the poorer nations since the peoples of  these countries are more directly dependent for sustenance on  water, forest, and earth resources. Converting to a market  economy has brought about a basic change in their  generations-old ways of living, and traditions. The temple of  economics is the market and money its god. Even in this the  place for foreign currency, especially the "dollar" has the  highest place. The industrialized nations of the world have  trapped the rest of the world into the spread of this snake's  hood of market economy so that probably there is no nation left  whose leader does not have to supplicate himself to this method.  They are acquiring materials through free trade. Under this  system it really does not matter who rules a country. Those who  accept this way have only one rule -- economic slavery. It is  clear from the examples of Japan and the Netherlands how  countries that make trade their mainstay remain affluent, even  when they lack basic natural resources. Japan sells cars and  computers, and from that income buys food, wood, oil, iron, and  other raw materials. The Netherlands uses 10 percent of its  farm, pasture, and forest lands for production. Japan's annual  per capita national production is $18,000. Japan's trade  stretches far to Canada, whose forests have been leased by Japan  for a long while now. The clearing of the tropical forests in  neighboring East Asia is for its expanding self-indulgence, and  to fulfill its commercial needs. The aborigines, who have  already been rendered poor by deforestation, are being pushed  towards starvation.    The exports and imports of these countries can show us how  they keep their trade balanced. Holland exports milk and  milk-products, while it imports the fodder for its cattle from  far-off Thailand. India is a big importer of crude oil. In  1989/90, we imported 5.460 billion rupees [Rs] worth of crude  oil. There is a permanent goal to improve this. India is also  importing the dung from Dutch cows, since there is a danger of  Holland's rivers becoming polluted by it. These cows are sent to  the slaughter-house anyway once they stop yielding milk.    The increase in population in the next 40 years will be  significant. The world population has doubled in the last 40  years from 2.50 billion to 5.2 billion. And every year it has  increased by 70 million. The next 40 years are likely to see an  increase to 8.900 billion. That means a yearly 90-million  increase. The rate of increase in Western countries will be very  low. In Russia and in Italy, the population will decrease by 1  and 2 million, respectively. In the last 40 years in India, the  population has shown an increase of 307 million, and an increase  of 590 million is expected in the next 40. We will rank second  only to China, as we already do, with a population count of  1.443 billion.    The dreams of a comfortable life that poor nations dream and  the promises of their governments of bright futures all will get  crushed. During 1950-60, the rate of economic growth for the  world was 4.9 percent and per capita was 3.1 percent. During  1990-93 it dropped to 0.9 and 0.8 percent, respectively. It can  be argued that these are global figures, and in a developing  nation like India, the annual rate of growth has been higher. No  matter how good the growth, the benefits from it reach only the  handful of people controlling the power and the economies of  these rich and poor nations.    These developments are issuing a warning to develop new  methods of survival, other than those aimed at economic growth.  It would be foolish to ignore this warning, saying that it may  be a matter of choice for the rich nations to leave the path of  prosperity through economic growth, but a poor country has no  option and cannot give it up.    From the Himalayas in the north to the oceans in the south  and east, I witnessed for one week (17-24 February) the  battleground where this is being fought. In Tehri, the highest  dam in Asia, at 260.5 meters, has been constructed, killing the  effluent Bhagirathi river, submerging a 42 sq km plain, and  uprooting 100,000 people. Why? To sustain big, mainly  export-oriented industries; to provide a few more hours of  electricity at night to the cities; to increase the production  of exportable sugarcane in western Uttar Pradesh, which is  already 100-percent irrigated; and to meet the increased demand  for water of the fun-seeking tourists that come to Delhi's  five-star hotels. In Medhak Zilla near Hyderabad, on 300 acres  of farmable land, an Alkabir slaughterhouse with the capacity  for killing 120,000 cattle has been built. In the seashore city  of Tanjore, the granary of the south, fisheries are set up at  the cost of destroying 10 thousand hectares of farmable land. As  I coursed along the seashore to the north-east towards Orissa, I  found that there also these fisheries have been established,  destroying sealife and forests on the seashore. There is a plan  to commercialize the seashore areas of Puri by constructing  hotels for tourists. Delhi has announced agreements to export  15,000 tons of buffalo meat every year to the Philippines and  buffaloes to Vietnam. Animal and animal-product exports are  going to increase from Rs3 billion to Rs20 billion per year.    Behind all these plans is the clout of influential political  leaders, i.e., the elected representatives of the people of  these regions. In the end, the result of such pressure cannot be  anything other than the consumption of the very last lump of the  flesh of silent nature and the silent millions with their filial  dependence on her.</p>

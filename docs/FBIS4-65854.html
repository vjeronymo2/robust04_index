			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Diary" column by Derya Sazak: "Why Doesn't Papa </F> Come Back?"]    [Text] While observing the True Path Party [TPP] Assembly  group meeting yesterday, in which Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  promised the deputies that the TPP would come to power on its  own in the 1996 elections, we again witness how the TPP members  are suffering.    While half of the group was listening to Mrs. Ciller inside,  the other half was nervously smoking outside in the lobby, as if  they were trying to get rid of the blues in a prison yard. The  reason for the blues is obvious: The intraparty opposition is  proving incapable of getting rid of Ciller, and no solution is  coming from Cankaya, the presidential mansion which has been  turned into a wailing wall.    Recently, scenarios on the establishment of a new government  became prevalent once again as the news spread that Papa  [Demirel] had "pulled out all the stops" to get rid of Ciller.  At yesterday's group meeting, however, Mrs. Ciller challenged  the opposition within the party by criticizing the 49th  government and praising the success of the 50th. She finished  her speech amid applause. This put off the expectation of a  coalition without Ciller until after the Bayram holiday.    In fact, why do those who sweat up and down the road to  Cankaya not opt for an easier way? Would it not be better if  Papa came down instead of them going up? Since Demirel is  complaining that the country is not being run well, he can, in  an Ozal-like move, leave the Cankaya mansion and assume the TPP  leadership. In this way, the deputies who stealthily go to  Cankaya at night to get rid of Ciller will relax, and Demirel  will be able to resume running the country from where he left  off.    We do not know if Tansu Ciller is also thinking of such  solutions, but it was noteworthy that in a defiant tone, the  prime minister listed the victories of the 50th government in  every field -- from banking to terrorism, from foreign policy to  the economy -- and blamed the previous governments, including  the 49th, for not having done what had to be done.    She also tried to push Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut  Yilmaz to the wall by recalling his preelection promise that in  a TPP-ANAP coalition, the leader of the second party would  withdraw. It is obvious that the TPP is drawing up plans to  cause cracks within the ANAP. There is no doubt, however, that  divisions within the TPP are also being planned. Various wings  within the party expect that motions for an investigation with  regard to the banks will put the Ciller family in a difficult  position. (When the deputies criticized Ozer Ciller for the  first time at the group meeting yesterday, the prime minister  was forced to defend her husband. Deputies who complained that  Mr. Ciller was interfering suggested that the prime minister  make him a minister.) On the other hand, it is being suggested  that promises of ministerial posts will reduce the speed at  which dissent is spreading within the group.    The same assessment can be made with regard to the Social  Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]. The lionhearted Social  Democrats are continuing to receive blow after blow.    Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar, who was suspended  after Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya was horribly beaten up by the  police on May Day, has been allowed to return to his post. On  the same day, the SDPP received another unexpected blow from its  partner, the TPP: Neither of the two SDPP candidates were  elected for membership on the Radio and Television Council. The  Left was left out.    What is as interesting as the TPP's moves is the attitude of  the SDPP and the Republican People's Party -- an attitude far  removed from solidarity. These parties cannot even unite on  candidates representing the same views at a vote in the  Assembly. How can they cooperate in municipal elections that  have been canceled and will be held again? Forget it!    The SDPP carries less weight within the coalition with each  passing day, and it cannot even establish coordination among the  party group, cabinet, and party headquarters because of certain  people who are expecting ministerial posts. For example, Fikri  Saglar, who was made SDPP secretary general, insists on the  Culture Ministry (he was offered a state ministry). This  insistence is making artists in various fields nervous.  Ministry officials allege that Saglar's family members are  running it.    The fact that Karayalcin has not been using his "initiative"  in the cabinet since he became party leader and his repeated  postponement of an expected reshuffle are escalating tension  within the SDPP group. It is being said that Saglar has started  preparing for the leadership at the next party congress.    Everything will become clear on 5 July, three months after  the economic package was presented in early April; including the  future of the SDPP.</p>

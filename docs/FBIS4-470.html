			<p>BFN     [Text] The Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, said he  will not enter into any agreements with the ANC which he had not  been party to in drawing up. King Goodwill, in an interview  with the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation],  responded to a draft proposal which the ANC presented to him  during Friday's [8 April] leaders' summit in the Kruger Game  Park. According to the agreement, the ANC has undertaken to see  to it that the king's position, rights, and powers will be  constitutionally recognized and defined.    [Begin Zwelithini recording, in English] I want to put it  clearly to my people that I was not intent to sign any agreement  which was not drawn by all political concerns [as heard]. I was  thinking that everything is going to be supported out,  especially for the sovereign kingdom, with the Zulu monarchy.  But I was surprised to see that the ANC's agreement proposals  were just concerning the status of the king and the royal house.  All what I need is to see that the sovereign kingdom and the  Zulu monarchy and the self-determination of the Zulu people  being looked at before elections. [end recording]</p>

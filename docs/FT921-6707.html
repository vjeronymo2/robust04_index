			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Screen test Harry Turner has been having a tough time lately and yesterday's events did nothing to lighten his mood. The Law Lords took only ten minutes to turn down TSW's judicial review of the loss of its franchise to Westcountry Television. Turner, TSW's flamboyant managing director, is writing a book on the ITV franchise fiasco right up to the denouement in the House of Lords. The unfortunate fellow will also have to confess that he not only lost a franchise by bidding too high, he was also taken in along the way by the notorious conman Joe Flynn. Using a variety of false names, Flynn has been extracting 'expenses' from national newspapers, governments and intelligence agencies for years. His recent targets have included investigative journalist Seymour Hersh and Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, over Robert Maxwell's alleged involvement in the Vanunu affairs. In the middle of the ITV franchise process Flynn suggested that senior members of the TSW staff were in cahoots with the opposition and came up with corroborative evidence in the form of home telephone numbers. In all, Joe Flynn cost TSW Pounds 4,000 - a drop in the ocean compared with the lawyers' bills.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARGUING THE RACE OF 'THE MOST FASCINATING FIGURE IN HISTORY'  </P> <P> Kiela Jamal (Letters, May 7) is incorrect in describing Cleopatra as black.  </P> <P> No ancient writer indicates that she was black. Had she been so, the  propagandists of her arch enemy, Octavian (later Emperor Augustus), would have  publicized this in the most scathing terms.  </P> <P> Writing less than 100 years after Cleopatra's death, the Roman poet Lucan  described her "white breasts" revealed by the Sidonian fabric of her garment.  </P> <P> Three portrait heads of Cleopatra have come down to us. I am happy to own a  cast of the finest of these, which resides in the Antikenmuseum in West Berlin  (see photos). The countenance is emphatically Greek. There is also an ancient  wall painting of her in the National Museum of Archeology in Naples. It depicts  her with fair skin and reddish-brown hair.  </P> <P> In closing, I would like to remind everyone that the color of a person's skin  ought to be an insignificant matter. Whether black, white, red or yellow,  Cleopatra would remain quite the most fascinating figure in history.  </P> <P> KIRK C. DOUGHERTY  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P> <P>  (Jamal's letter was a reply to Bob Stanford's April 30 letter, in which  Stanford reacted to a quote from film maker Spike Lee. Patrick Goldstein's  April 17 article, part of a series on the black experience in Hollywood, quoted  Lee as saying, "Listen, lots of people -- even black people -- think Cleopatra  was a white woman just 'cause Elizabeth Taylor played her in the movie.")  </P> <P> </P></p>

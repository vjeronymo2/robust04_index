			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FORECAST: Housing prices are driving out the county's workers, bad news for  local employers, according to conventional wisdom. . . . Not so, according to  the latest from Martin Brower, publisher of Orange County Report. . . . In the  '90s workers will move to less costly Riverside and San Bernardino counties but  still hold jobs in Orange County, raising employment twice as fast as  population, says the report. . . . Orange County will become the economic  center of the region extending from Carlsbad to the South Bay and 50 miles  inland. David Reyes and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

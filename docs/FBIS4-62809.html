			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 17 -- The commander of the Russian  Pacific Fleet, Admiral Georgiy Gurinov has been released of the  post, informed sources told ITAR-TASS. Vice-Admiral Igor  Khmelnov is now acting commander of the fleet.    Observers say Admiral Gurinov's sacking is due to a sharp  drop in the fleet's combat capability. At a recent press  conference in Moscow, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said the  Pacific fleet ranks last in the Russian armed forces as regards  its degree of battle capability and the command of the fleet  needs reshuffling.    Observers also point out that Admiral Gurinov was not  personally involved in the clean-up operation after the May 14  blast at the fleet's ammunition dump in Nezhino. He was also  notably absent from the welcoming ceremony for the Chinese  warships which arrived for a visit to Vladivostok on Tuesday.    According to official information, the admiral is feeling  unwell.</p>

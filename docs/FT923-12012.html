			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Savage losses reduced by the close THE LONDON stock market shared in the general setback across European bourses yesterday. In early trading, the UK market suffered one of its largest daily falls for nearly a year as worry over the domestic economy and interest rates was fuelled by turmoil in global currency markets. At the day's low, the FT-SE Index was nearly 65 points weaker, but a strong rally was prompted by the heavy support action mounted for the dollar by the US Federal Reserve and European central banks. By the close, the Footsie had rallied to show a net loss of 28.2 at 2,403.7. In the early afternoon, when the stock market was cowering beneath a fall in sterling to a post-ERM entry low, threats of higher mortgage rates ahead, and a gloomy survey of retail sales from the Confederation of British Industry, the index had fallen to 2,367.1, its lowest level since December last year, and traders described the market as 'in disarray'. The early part of the session was a tale of undiluted misery, as London reacted with dismay to the heavy falls on Wall Street and in Tokyo. Dealers had returned from the weekend well aware that the outlook for UK interest rates was at the mercy of the foreign exchange markets and, with sterling falling against the D-Mark from the outset, share prices quickly crumbled. Pressure on equities was increased by very heavy trading in stock index futures, where the September contract on the Footsie fell to parity with the underlying index when it touched its low point. Fears that UK base rates could be forced higher in the wake of the Bundesbank's decision to raise its discount rate were reflected in higher rates in the London money markets. Confidence took a further blow when Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest of Britain's building societies, warned that it might lift its mortgage rate. The announcement of the UK June money supply data was largely overlooked in the general excitement. London took a further tumble when Wall Street opened some 42 Dow points down. Heavy lines of blue chip stocks came on offer but a relatively low Seaq volume bore out comments that it was very difficult to offload share blocks of any significant size. Marketmaking firms, which have long since learned to offer Seaq trade only in low numbers, stuck rigidly to this policy yesterday. Attempts to deal 'in greater size' were rebuffed and share quotations marked down for the next would-be seller. When the US Federal Reserve led the way in support of the dollar, London bounced strongly at this apparent indication of co-ordinated action in global foreign exchange markets. There was a rush of activity in UK equities, but some traders warned that their first move had been to sell into the rising market. Seaq volume was finally 456.3m shares, against Friday's 487.2m, which was worth Pounds 903.9m in retail business. London dealers were last night waiting apprehensively to see how Wall Street would close, and whether UK stocks can extend their recovery this morning.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KAOMA PLANTS ITS FEET AND LAMBADA FIRMLY AT THE PALACE  </P> <P> What's happening with the lambada? Can it be -- oh no! -- that the sexy new  Brazilian dance, the hottest music movement to arrive in years, has already  experienced its 15 minutes of fame?  </P> <P> Rest your fears. Although it's been pretty much an underground phenomenon since  it first arrived in the Southland recently, the thigh-intertwined,  pelvis-to-pelvis dance, with its infectiously rhythmic music, has been popping  up all over the place -- from dance classes and discos to TV news bites and a  New Year's Eve appearance on CBS. But it still hasn't attained the mass market  intensity that has made it such a startling success in Europe.  </P> <P> All that may now be changing. Friday night the lambada entered a new phase with  the appearance in town of Kaoma, the multinational group that started the whole  thing. Its performance at the Palace had all the trappings of an "event," with  an overflow audience and the usual gaggle of celebrities.  </P> <P> As the P.A. system roared out a colorful collection of rhythmic world beat  music, the crowd's energy level sizzled with intensity. On the packed floor,  little pockets of movement kept erupting into anticipatory variations on the  sensuous lambada. Setting the pace, Felix Chavez, one of the pioneer  instructors in the new dance, drew most of the notice. "This is a terrific  dance," he said. "It's a great way for people to get acquainted -- fast!"  </P> <P> With the opening of the curtain, however, attention shifted to the stage, as  the five musicians, three singers and eight dancers of Kaoma came on with an  explosion of aural and visual energy.  </P> <P> Listening to the sunny, virtually impossible-to-resist rhythms, it wasn't hard  to understand why Kaoma's music has been so astoundingly successful. Their  initial single recording, "Lambada," sold 4 million copies in Europe and the  United Kingdom in six months -- the largest-selling single in the history of  CBS Records' European operation. The group's new Epic album, "World Beat," has  also taken off with a rush, selling more than half a million copies in the  first two weeks of its European release.  </P> <P> Kaoma made it clear, from the first pulsating notes of "Dancando Lambada," that  they are a first-class musical ensemble, as well.  </P> <P> The music flowed easily from one song to the next. While pieces like  "Lambareggae" and "Lamba Caribe" may initially have been conceived to broaden  both the rhythms and the reach of the lambada, they were appealingly melodic  enough to fully stand on their own.  </P> <P> Kaoma's eight young dancers were the visual highlight of the performance,  spinning and twirling across the stage with impossible reserves of enthusiasm  and energy.  </P> <P> By the time Kaoma launched into its second encore rendition of "Lambada," most  of the audience was moving in some kind of improvised version of the dance.  "C'est magnifique!" shouted a young French woman, slinking through the  multinational, multiethnic crowd.  </P></p>

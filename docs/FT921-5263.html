			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Minimum wage will be costly, says CBI LABOUR'S proposed minimum wage would raise unemployment by at least 150,000 and add more than Pounds 2.5bn a year to employment costs, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The CBI renewed its onslaught on Labour's plans, warning that they threatened to destroy a number of industries which are already struggling in the recession. Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said that a minimum wage would mean the profits of some sectors were completely wiped out. There was particular concern about textiles, clothing footwear, tourism and agriculture. The CBI's criticisms lend some support to the claims from the government about the impact of a minimum wage, although Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, has said Labour's policy could mean 2m job losses. A CBI document put to the organisation's council estimated that a minimum wage would affect up to 3.4m jobs, including most of the 1.1m part-time jobs created during the last decade.</p>

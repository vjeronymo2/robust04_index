			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Consumer borrowing weak despite interest rate cuts THE LOWEST interest rates for 16 years have done little to entice people to borrow more. Bank of England figures showed that M4 lending rose by Pounds 200m last month, an improvement on the November figure when lending fell by Pounds 600m, but significantly less than economists' expectations. The annual growth rate of M4 - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - was similarly sluggish. It hit a record low and dropped through the bottom limit of the government's recently announced monitor range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent. M4 fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent on the month, to rise by 3.7 per cent in the year to December. This compares with 4.6 per cent in the year to November. In contrast, narrow money - which comprises mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose by 0.2 per cent in December, taking the seasonally adjusted annual growth to 3 per cent - just inside the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. The latest figures on the economy leave the government in a conundrum. The poor credit figures, along with dismal unemployment and manufacturing output figures last week, suggest further base rate cuts are necessary to stimulate activity. Weekly figures for notes and coins in circulation indicate that the buoyancy of M0 has continued this month with some economists estimating that the annual rate for January will exceed 4 per cent. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, said the discrepancy between the two sets of figures could be explained by debt overhang. 'M0 captures those areas of the economy where debt is not a problem, while M4 and M4 lending capture the fragility of those areas of the economy, such as housing and business investment, that rely on expanding credit,' he said. The Treasury said two special factors had depressed the growth of M4 last month - the purchase of debt by the government from British Telecommunications and the electricity holding companies, and the switch by big companies to monthly payments of VAT. Figures from the British Bankers Association yesterday confirmed the sluggish nature of private and corporate sector lending. Total sterling lending by the nine biggest UK banking groups to the UK private sector fell by more than Pounds 1.7bn in December, the second fall in four months.</p>

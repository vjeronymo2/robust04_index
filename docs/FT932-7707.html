			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Russian leaders agree to reforms tied to IMF loan THE Russian authorities yesterday patched up divisions over proposals for economic reform which are linked to a new Dollars 3bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, reached broad agreement to make no new spending decisions for the rest of this year, to increase interest rates, and to maintain quarterly limits on credit expansion. The agreement follows modifications discussed with the IMF. Earlier this week, the measures were criticised by Mr Gerashchenko, who has deep reservations about Mr Fyodorov's strategy for cutting inflation and restructuring the economy. Mr Gerashchenko told bankers that restrictions on credit expansion agreed with the government would be overshot in the second quarter, not to mention the rest of the year. He also challenged proposals for the rate at which the Central Bank gives credit to the economy to track a so-called market rate. But agreement among the three men is by no means the end of internal squabbling in the Russian camp. The proposals for instance run directly counter to the views of old-time conservatives such as first deputy prime minister Oleg Lobov, in charge of the Economics Ministry. Mr Fyodorov, who has sought to make the proposals as binding as possible for his colleagues, said at the beginning of the week he expected the government and Central Bank to make a joint pledge yesterday. But Mr Sergei Vasiliev, head of the government centre to monitor economic reform, said the document would not be ready until Saturday.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Collor vows to hold on to power EMBATTLED Brazilian President Fernando Collor has gone on the attack with a broadcast to the nation in which he pleaded his innocence of massive corruption charges and made clear that he will continue resisting all pressure to resign. 'Those who think they can prematurely end my mandate as president are fooling themselves,' he insisted in his first nationwide address since the end last week of a three-month congressional investigation which accused him of involvement in a multi-million-dollar corruption scheme. Mr Collor's defiance means there will be no early end to the crisis. His insistence on staying in power caused the stock markets to open 4.6 per cent down. The main Sao Paulo index finished above its lowest, 6.7 per cent down. Denying the charges, Mr Collor admitted erring, but said: 'We all make mistakes. Mine was to underestimate the intentions of profiteers.' He attacked rivals in Congress for blocking his modernisation programme, accusing them of trying to 'sabotage my mandate in 10 days when 558 days was not sufficient for them to approve legislation to modernise the port system'. He said his mandate would not be over until all his projects had been passed. Mr Collor's defiant speech came amid mounting pressure from within his own government to oust him, new charges against the first lady, and the emergence of further evidence linking him to Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the businessman accused of masterminding the racketeering scheme. Last night three senior ministers - Mr Marclio Marques Moreira (economy), justice minister Mr Celio Borja and Mr Jorge Bornhausen, the president's political co-ordinator - met amid reports that they might quit, but later said they intended to stay on. Mr Bornhausen had said he was considering resigning because of the president's refusal to incorporate in his speech suggestions from the Liberal Front, the main pro-government party. Reactions to the address were generally negative. 'It was too little too late,' said Mr Bolivar Lamounier, a political scientist. A formal request for impeachment will be made this afternoon to Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of Congress. Opposition leaders say they already have more than the 336 votes necessary for the process to be admitted.</p>

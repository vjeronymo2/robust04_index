			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Far-reaching consequences of paying promptly Sir, Delayed payment by companies for goods and services beyond agreed terms is becoming endemic in the UK. This is causing avoidable business failures, especially among smaller companies. Under the present system, which harks back to the 19th century, payment is normally expected once per month and agreed credit periods vary between 20 days and 60 days, but in reality they have become much longer. There have been extensive discussions about whether companies should be charged interest on overdue payments and how to speed up claims in the courts. But there is an alternative answer, and one which would have massive national advantages. This is to change settlement terms to standard payment 35 days after date of invoice - a practice similar to that in northern Europe - with, of course, continued prompt payments arrangements. Settlement should be once per week, or four times per month (in practice, simple), with some invoices paid within 32 days and some within 38 days. Advantages would be a steadier flow of funds and more effective, and more prompt, credit monitoring and control. Suppliers would more quickly be able to impose delivery 'delays' on later payers - which would be more effective than attempting to apply sanctions when the amount at risk is at least equivalent to goods supplied in previous and current months. Any bad debts would be half those incurred under the present system. Banks would benefit from fewer business failures and should respond with reasonable transaction charges. Ordering would become more even - eliminating the practice of small orders being placed when the credit period is at its shortest and large orders when at its longest. Suppliers would no longer have customers optimising the credit period and would be able to rationalise distribution. Safety and environmental advantages flowing from better transport arrangements are fully appreciated and supported by Sir John Cullen, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission. A major UK manufacturer or professional organisation needs to take the lead in agreeing and speedily implementing a new system along these lines. Martin Simons, 24 Granard Avenue, London SW15 6HJ</p>

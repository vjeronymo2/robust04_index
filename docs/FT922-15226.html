			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Industry opposition may delay Swedish shares reform THE LIFTING of restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish shares may be delayed until 1994 due to strong opposition from Swedish industry. While officially welcoming foreign investment and capital, the Confederation of Swedish Industry said more time was needed to implement the necessary changes to companies' articles of association. According to Swedish law, foreigners used to need government permission to own more than 40 per cent of a Swedish company's share capital or over 20 per cent of its voting rights. Although the law was abolished with effect from January 1 1992, more than 200,000 Swedish companies still contain these restrictions in their articles of association. According to a proposal from the Aktiebolagskommitten, a working group appointed by the government to look at the question of share ownership, companies must change their articles of association by January 1 1993 or else the changes will be imposed on them by the government. The committee's proposals are currently under discussion and suggested amendments must be submitted to the government by May 8 1992. Already, some companies have started to propose changes to their articles of association at their annual meetings, according to the Confederation of Swedish Industry.</p>

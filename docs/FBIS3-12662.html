			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tehran, [KEYHAN News Sources] -- Once again in  Tehran rumors of Rafsanjani's resignation as president of the  republic are heating up. The reason for this is a report  published in the 1 Esfand [20 February] issue of HAMSHAHRI.  According to this report, on Saturday 30 Bahman (19 February) at  a meeting of deputy ministers and chiefs of the nation's  administrative organizations Rafsanjani said among other things  that "no change" will be made in the Islamic Republic's revised  constitution, and, "I will work in another of the government's  fortifications as a soldier of the revolution."    On the other hand, some observers consider the comment about  no change in the Constitution to be due to the fact that it is  said that with the change in the Constitution Rafsanjani wants  to eliminate from this law the provision that one person can  serve only two consecutive terms as president of the republic,  in order to be able to serve a third term in that office.  However, in the Islamic Republic the procedure for revising or  changing the Constitution has not been specified in legal terms.    There is only the fact that in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March  1990] Khomeyni appointed a council of his own choosing and  arrangement to revise the Constitution, and the new Constitution  is the result of that revision. The most important changes made  in the first Constitution are separating the position of the  leader of the revolution from that of source of emulation, and  the other is eliminating the position of prime minister and  designating the president of the republic as the government's  highest executive officer.  <H5>  `We Have No Problem' </H5>   Our sources in Iran write that if the  Khamene'i-bazaar-clergy  group had not tied Rafsanjani's hands by ousting his colleagues  and close associates such as Mohsen Nurbakhsh, Mohammad Hashemi  and others, Rafsanjani would probably have begun a battle to  revise the Constitution and open the way for a third term of his  presidency. However, with the repeated defeats Rafsanjani has  suffered, the likelihood of his resignation is now much greater  than the likelihood that he will open the way for a third term  as president of the republic (see also our report under the  headline "God Willing It Is a Cat" on page 12 of this issue. See  also the column "Obvious and Between the Lines.")    Rafsanjani, who has fallen into difficulties on all sides,  spoke at those meetings of "relative resolution of problems" in  the country and added that the gains under the First Five-Year  Plan were "positive." He said: "Infrastructure problems such as  water and electricity, shipping and transportation, raw  materials, reconstruction of factories and the growth of  employment have been relatively solved. Conditions are  completely normal and we have no problem with the reconstruction  of the country. We are producing more than ever. For example,  cement production has grown 5 percent over last year. If there  is stagnation, where is this cement going?    Rafsanjani said the recent changes are "nonpolitical" and  said the main reason for these changes was that "some officials"  have remained in the same position since the beginning of the  revolution.</p>

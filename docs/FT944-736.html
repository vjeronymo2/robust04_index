			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Custody for disgraced ex-Banesto head Conde Mr Mario Conde, who became Spain's celebrity financier in the late 1980s as chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), was yesterday remanded in custody on charges of defrauding the banking group's shareholders. The decision by a high court judge in Madrid to commit Mr Conde to prison came almost exactly a year after the Bank of Spain dismissed him as chairman of Banesto, along with the bank's 19-member board, alleging mismanagement, overspending and an excessive concentration of risk. Mr Conde was transferred to the maximum security Alcala-Meco jail, near Madrid, after Judge Manuel Garca Castellon had spent 40 hours this week questioning him over his business affairs. A self-made billionaire, Mr Conde, 46, mesmerised domestic society as chairman of Banesto between 1987 and 1993 when he picked up a succession of awards as the most admired Spaniard of the year and became a role model for Spain's fledgling yuppie generation. In Alcala-Meco he will join his close business associate Mr Arturo Roman, jailed last week by Judge Garca Castellon in the same fraud indictment of former Banesto executives. The indictment served by Judge Garca Castellon on Mr Conde and Mr Roman involves a web of shell companies, some of which they owned jointly, that allegedly sold companies to the group's industrial holding company, Corporacion Banesto, at inflated prices. A friend of the royal family (he hired a sister of King Juan Carlos as an executive of a Banesto cultural foundation) and widely viewed as a future prime minister (he acknowledged his admiration for Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi in a book he published this year), Mr Conde included among his flamboyant activities the creation of a Madrid Business School, a seminar in Moscow that had Spanish politicians discussing the transition to democracy, and a gathering of intellectuals in the Vatican to debate ethics in business. He was dismissed, on December 28 last year, as Banesto chairman after a Bank of Spain inspection discovered that the bank had had overvalued its Pta7,000bn (Pounds 34bn) assets by Pta503bn. In April Banesto was acquired by Banco Santander after some Pta780bn in public and private moneys had been spent on refloating the troubled institution. In the summer before his dismissal from Banesto, the bank raised nearly Dollars 700m from the international markets in a rights issue co-ordinated by the US bank J P Morgan. Mr Conde's arrest may mark the climax of a reaction under way for some months in Spain against those who made quick fortunes in in the past 10 years, when the domestic economy grew fast on the back of its liberalisation and Spanish membership of the European Union. The former governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, and the former head of Madrid's stock exchange, Mr Manuel de la Concha, were both held in preventive detention at Alcala-Meco in May on charges of insider share dealing before being released pending trial. In October a Barcelona judge ordered the preventive detention of Mr Javier de la Rosa, the architect of multi-million-dollar investments in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office, KIO, who is accused of defrauding his shareholders in companies that he owned.

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JURY AWARDS $7.5 MILLION TO PARALYZED RAPE VICTIM  </P> <P> A San Fernando Superior Court jury awarded $7.5 million in damages to a  paralyzed woman who was raped and made pregnant in a North Hollywood nursing  home.  </P> <P> The jury found Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital grossly negligent in protecting  patient Andrea Nerpel, 38, who has lived at the nursing home since she suffered  major brain damage in an automobile accident when she was 19.  </P> <P> Nerpel, who is fed through a tube in her stomach and cannot speak or  communicate meaningfully, was raped in 1982. A pregnancy was discovered by her  grandmother about three months later, and Nerpel was given an abortion and  sterilized.  </P> <P> Before jury deliberations began Wednesday, Judge David M. Schacter instructed  jurors that they could award damages based only on the consequences of the  negligence. They could not award punitive damages against the nursing home  because there was no evidence of malice, he said.  </P> <P> At the end of the monthlong trial, defense attorney Richard B. Castle argued  that there was no evidence that Nerpel suffered from the rape, saying her  medical condition was unchanged since then.  </P> <P> But jurors said the rape might have been an emotional trauma for Nerpel,  although she was unable to express her pain. Videotape shown during the trial  indicated that Nerpel is aware of her surroundings and people who come to see  her, jurors said. In the videotape, Nerpel smiled when her grandmother entered  the room, and her eyes followed the moving camera.  </P> <P> "They were never able to prove that she has no sense of feeling or that her  mind is not working," said jury foreman Michael D. Williams of Canyon Country.  </P> <P> Jurors agreed that Laurelwood was negligent in its duty to protect Nerpel.  About six months before she was impregnated, Nerpel was moved from a room in  front of a nursing station to one farther down the hall. Jurors felt that she  should not have been moved because she was so helpless, Williams said.  </P> <P> Nine of the 12 said they believed that $7.5 million was appropriate  compensation for her suffering. Several jurors said they believed that Nerpel  was raped repeatedly because of the slim chance that one rape would result in a  pregnancy.  </P> <P> Nerpel's medical expenses are about $4,500 a month, said her attorney, Alan J.  Schultz, and the award settlement will be placed in trust to pay them. Nerpel's  grandmother is her only living relative, he said, adding that he does not know  who pays her medical bills.  </P> <P> Castle said Laurelwood's parent company, Western Medical Enterprises, will  appeal the award.  </P> <P> "It's obvious that the jury in a state of emotion decided to punish  Laurelwood," Castle said. "An emotional issue can defeat justice. The only  damages were to compensate Andrea for the harm that she suffered, but there is  no evidence of that. Nobody knows if she knows she was raped or not."  </P></p>

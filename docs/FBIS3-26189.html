			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate,  acting with unusual speed, confirmed tonight William Perry as  the new U.S. defense secretary, succeeding Les Aspin who  announced his resignation last December 18.    The vote of 97-0 this evening came slightly more than a week  after President Clinton named Perry, the No. 2 man at the  Pentagon. Shortly after the Senate vote, Perry was sworn in at  the Pentagon.    Perry was born in Vandergrift, Pa., on October 11, 1927. He  interrupted his education to serve in the Army in 1946-1947,  specializing in artillery. He graduated from Stanford with a  degree in mathematics in 1949.    He went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Pennsylvania  State University in 1957 and taught at the school during the  1950s as a professor of engineering.    Perry returned to California in 1964 to head ESL Inc., a  military electronics company, which he left in 1977 to become  the Pentagon's under secretary for research and development  under President Carter.    After Carter left office, Perry joined an investment banking  firm in San Francisco and then served as chairman of Technology  Strategies and Alliance, a consulting firm based in Menlo Park,  California.    In 1989, Perry became a director of the Center for  International Security and Arms Control at Stanford, where he  first worked with Russians seeking to convert from military to  civilian production.    He was a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence  Advisory Board and a member of a Technology Review Panel under  the Senate Committee on Intelligence.    Perry has kept a low profile on some of the social issues  that have troubled the Pentagon in the past year, but when asked  at his confirmation hearing about homosexuals in the military  and women in combat roles, Perry said that "people ought to be  allowed to do any military service they are capable of doing."    Crises are still emerging despite the end of the Cold War,  he  said.    Perry leaves Friday [4 February] for a conference in Munich  on defense issues.</p>

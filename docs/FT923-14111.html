			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Bank BCCI response attacked THE FORMER chairman of the Commons Treasury committee yesterday attacked the Bank of England for failing to respond properly to MPs' criticisms of the Bank's supervision of Bank of Credit and Commerce International before its closure. The Bank yesterday conceded - in its formal response to the committee report  -that some reform of the system of policing banks was needed in the wake of the BCCI affair, although it defended the behaviour of its officials. Mr Terence Higgins, Tory chairman of the committee in the last parliament, complained that the Bank's response did not 'cover any of the criticisms made of the Bank'. He added that the Bank was still not taking 'as tough a line for the future as the committee proposed'. Nonetheless, yesterday's response from the Bank shows a change of heart on whether an auditor should have a 'right' or a 'duty' to inform the Bank of England when it fears that there is malpractice at a bank or that depositors' funds may be at risk. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, told the committee last year that the present legal position, which gives auditors a right to report to the Bank, was adequate. But the Bank now feels auditors should be obliged to make such reports. The question is controversial because of the duty of confidentiality owed by an auditor to its client. The Bank said any amendment to the Banking Act would need to be carefully drafted, to avoid it being swamped with auditors' reports. Professional auditors responded positively to the Bank's suggestions yesterday, while saying they would need extra protection if they were to take on an enhanced whistleblowing role. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, said: 'If it was accompanied by a clarification of how auditors are protected by privilege from breach of confidentiality, it is something people would be prepared to consider.' The Bank also said it wanted new powers to shut down a bank 'on the sole ground that an applicant authorised bank cannot be effectively supervised'. The Bank wants considerable latitude in the criteria for making such a judgment. It is asking for greater powers than those necessitated by its participation earlier this week in an international agreement on co-operation between bank regulators of the G10 leading industrial countries grouped in the Basle Committee. As implied by the Basle agreement, it wants to be able to close a bank if that bank's domicile is in a country where the regulator lacks the expertise or resources to take the lead role in supervising all the bank's operations. The Bank also wants to be able to refuse authorisation to a bank if it sets up branches in countries lacking an effective supervisor. That goes far further than the Basle agreement. The Bank also wants the right to withdraw authorisation if the nature of a bank's business changes.</p>

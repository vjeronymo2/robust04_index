			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: VW to finalise Skoda finance package Volkswagen, the German motor group, is expected to finalise revised long-term financial plans for Skoda Auto, the Czech carmaker, within the next week, Reuter reports from Prague. Skoda said it would visit Volkswagen headquarters in Germany within the next few days to finalise the package. A public announcement was expected soon after the completion of the plan. VW said in September it would restructure its financial package for Skoda, after abruptly cancelling an Dollars 870m loan. Volkswagen took a 31 per cent share in Skoda when the Czech carmaker was privatised in 1991. VW said then it planned up to DM9bn (Dollars 5.33bn) in capital expansion by the turn of the century, while increasing its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent.</p>

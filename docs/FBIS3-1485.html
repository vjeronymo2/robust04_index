On Monday a march by tens of thousands of Zulu  royalists in the city centre ended in many deaths and hundreds  of injuries. Some reports put the death toll at 31.    On Tuesday morning, about 100 men with spears and assegais  poured out of a train near Newtown, scattering panicked  commuters. Minibus taxis blocked roads into the area and traffic  turned back. But the armed men soon vanished. Many Soweto  commuters were left stranded again on Tuesday as minibus  services came to a halt.    There were unconfirmed reports of another group of armed men  moving into the city from Booysens.    An SAP [South African Police] spokesman said police had gone  to Newtown. He said police had received reports of South  African Communist Party supporters gathering for a march, but  details were unclear.    A police search of a train at New Canada railway station on  Monday night yielded three AK-47 rifles and 10 pistols. Nine  people were arrested.</p>

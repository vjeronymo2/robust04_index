			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOHNSON 'UNCOMFORTABLE WITH' PSYCHIATRIST;  </P> <P> NEW YORK TUG OF WAR: WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE METS?  </P> <P> New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson pulled team psychiatrist Alan Lans into his  office before Thursday night's game amid growing concern among his players that  Lans is assuming too much power in the running of the Mets.  </P> <P> "I said there are some things I am uncomfortable with," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson would not specify. But there are signs that the psychiatrist is playing  a major role in the running of the Mets. It was Lans -- not the manager -- who  called the team meeting Tuesday at which Johnson and Darryl Strawberry nearly  came to blows. The sources said Johnson loudly reprimanded Lans once he found  out he had arranged the meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Admitted Calling Meeting  </P> <P> Lans admitted he called the meeting, saying, "I said, 'Let's have a meeting and  get it over with.' That was no particular role of mine. I mean, anybody could  have done it."  </P> <P> Thursday night, Lans apparently played a role in the decision not to have  Dwight Gooden throw in the bullpen. Johnson wanted Gooden to throw in  preparation for a start Sunday. But after a meeting with Lans in the trainer's  room, Gooden did not throw. Johnson said he did not know why. But Lans did.  </P> <P> "He had some soreness, and the decision was to slow his progress," Lans said.  Asked who made the decision, Lans said, "I don't know."  </P> <P> In Chicago this week, Johnson said his decision not to start Gooden against the  Cubs was based in part on Lans' input.  </P> <P> And several Mets players said they are wary about what they tell Lans because  they know he is a direct link to General Manager Frank Cashen, the man who  hired him.  </P> <P> "I thought Dr. Lans was here to help the people out of rehab and keep them on  the right course," said Tim Teufel, referring to Gooden, Keith Hernandez,  Mackey Sasser and Jeff Musselman, players who have had problems with cocaine or  alcohol. "I don't think we need a psychiatrist to win ball games."  </P> <P> On July 1, Lans left his role at St. Luke's Hospital and the Smithers  Alcoholism and Treatment Center, a rehabilitation center in New York, and he  has since confined his practice to working with the Mets. He travels with the  club, has unlimited access to the clubhouse and sits in on closed-door team  meetings.  </P> <P> "He plays cards with guys like he's trying to be one of their buddies," Randy  Myers said. "It's like a fan who's hanging out in the clubhouse. It's one thing  to have someone available if a player wants someone to talk to. It's another  thing to have him hanging around every day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confusion on Meetings  </P> <P> Said David Cone: "There is a little confusion as far as to when we do call a  team meeting. Is it for the team or is it for the front office, too? There is  some confusion there. You might as well invite the front office in. That needs  to be clarified."  </P> <P> Said Lans: "I'm not a front-office person. That's clear." Asked if his job was  defined by Cashen or by himself, Lans said, "By me."  </P> <P> He said he has assumed a more active role on this 10-game road trip because of  "natural frustrations" associated with the Mets' position in the standings.  </P> <P> "If we were five games ahead, I'd probably be watching these games on TV," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Private View: The millionaire alchemist Choosing a career can be tough if you are born rich, and ashamed of it. So George Ortiz was at a loss to know what to do when the family business was nationalised. Since the family business was tin-mining in Bolivia and his mother's father was Simon Patino, one of the richest men in the world, young George found himself with several millions to deal with. He decided to make a career out of a hobby. He became a collector of antiquities, transmuting tin into bronze, copper and gold. Today he is acknowledged as having reached the top of his profession: the cream of his collection, shown last year in St Petersburg and Moscow, this week went on display at the Royal Academy in London. There I found him, a slight figure, frenetic and wide-eyed, scuttling between his beautiful possessions like a nervous hostess before a dinner party. Collecting is an odd sort of job, I thought, and collectors odd sort of people. I said: you have described it as a kind of odyssey. 'Certainly,' he replied. 'And I cannot explain it. I can try to rationalise it, but it was an unconscious process, emotional, as though I'd built a work of art, as though I'd brought up a child. And suddenly it's reached maturity and I exhibit: it all comes together, it's a harmonious whole.' Is your life in this collection, or is it a hobby? 'That's a very interesting question. It may have been the answer to personal need. It may be a hobby. But I think it's much more than that. It's perhaps a frustration at not having been able to work in the family business.' You could have taken a job. 'I could have, yes, but I was told my responsibility and duty was to my grandfather. I should have had the courage, perhaps, to go out and do something else but I didn't. So the only thing I have been able to do entirely on my own has become my fortune.' Is it bad for young people to inherit a lot of money? 'If they are very well balanced, well brought up, no. But there is no doubt that adversity is the mother of progress and to be born privileged financially makes you start with a tremendous handicap.' Ortiz agreed he was paralysed by his money until he found an outlet. But is collecting a career? 'In my case, exceptionally, I think one could say it is. I think - I don't want to be pretentious - that the same way you have Mozart or Michelangelo who are gifted to create their great works, I have not that gift but a certain eye, the gift to perceive what artists have put into something.' I suggested, ungenerously, it was easy to have a good eye if you had the money to practise it. He said antiquities were not so expensive when he began and he'd had to work hard to find them. 'I loved rally-driving when I was young. My dream has always been to have a Ferrari, and I've never had one my whole life because each time it's been an antiquity instead.' About 90 per cent of his wealth is tied up in the collection. 'Nowadays my total capital, stocks, shares, bonds, apart from my home and the art is far less than some great fortunes have as income in one year - far, far less.' I asked about provenance, a controversial subject in the antiquities market these days. Have you ever had your fingers burned? 'Er, no. I'm very careful.' Anticipating the next question, he added: 'Man has always collected since time immemorial, and always will. Collections are at the basis of all our museums and all our studies of these cultures.' There's the question of authenticity . . . 'Oh, not in my case. I'm sure. Nobody has questioned any of my objects.' Was spending all that money on primitive objects a gesture, a statement about wealth? 'I don't know. You're psycho-analysing me now. Maybe. Maybe.' You were getting value for money but getting rid of the money, too? 'It's very possible. That's a very pertinent statement and I wouldn't argue it.' Did you feel oppressed by the wealth of your mother's family? 'Oh, I certainly suffered as a child. I was too sensitive and I felt the difference was too vast. This sounds ludicrous and people will think I'm absolutely mad but when when I was really young I was perfectly willing to contemplate that both my parents and myself be eliminated, physically irradiated, to make for a better world. Of course it was madness.' Ortiz explained that a youthful flirtation with Marxism had evaporated in the face of ideological freaks such as Pol Pot. But there are other kinds of madness, I reflected, to which a collector might be prone. Ortiz describes his first encounters with some objects as 'emotional, instantaneous, visceral'. That's called falling in love, I said. 'It's like falling in love. But afterwards it's completely different.' The desire faded, leaving appreciation behind. Ortiz has written as if some objects were destined to come to him. I asked: When does appreciation turn into covetousness? 'Oh, I don't think I've ever coveted in that sense. Don't you think I have enough? I've lost two or three objects I thought I really deserved to have to nouveau-riche collectors. 'But that's life. I'm going to die soon and be separated from my objects. I get just as much appreciation out of seeing a marvellous object in a museum or even in other collections.' Aren't you possessive? 'I feel possessive in the sense I feel responsible for my objects. And I look after them as though they were my life itself - even better. I feel responsible to keep them for civilisation.' Where is the line between love and mania? 'Oh, I don't think I have any mania. Sadly in a way, and marvellously in a way, this exhibition is enabling me to outgrow the collection.' How do you mean? 'It's now fulfiled its mission as far as I'm concerned. I hope it fulfils its mission for the world. I hope the visitors get nourishment out of it. I hope they all find something that satisfies them, that makes them leave enriched in some way, happier . . .' You can imagine living without it, or dying and leaving it behind? 'Oh, of course. I must not be attached to any of these works of art when my time comes to die.' Ortiz rhapsodizes about the spirit of the ancient Greeks which started him on his voyage. He is just as eloquent when castigating the materialism of the modern age: accumulation for the sake of status and power. But you have been accumulating, I said. 'I'm not accumulating for accumulation's sake. I'm accumulating because I'm building up a collection that is an answer to a need and is a message.' Your gratification is involved . . . 'It's a personal answer to a personal need, but I wouldn't call it gratification. Not like gratifying a need to drink, or eating too much, or too much sex, but gratification in accomplishing something in the best way you can.' It was the gratification felt by men like Henry Ford, or Citroen or the architect Pei. 'I think mine is creativity. It carries a message.' Ortiz becomes breathless when describing the message he says his collection  -his creation - is conveying to mankind: it is one of understanding, hope, dignity, responsibility, idealism, the common humanity of us all. Other millionaires, I said, would buy a newspaper, start a foundation or a university. Yours is an unusual way to make a political point. 'It's totally unusual. But you see those others are great businessmen or entrepreneurs who have made huge fortunes and then want to do something for their name or out of idealism, or out of guilt. Or they want to have some power or influence. 'But I haven't created an empire, I haven't built up a financial dynasty. So instead of being able to paint or sculpt, perhaps, or become a politician for reasons of being uprooted . . . I've done this. Did it start as a selfish exercise and only later become spiritual? 'Selfish is a little bit harsh and a little unfair but you could put it that way, yes. It certainly was centred on self, then I saw that the answer I had found to my anguish, my questioning, were the answer for all men. In other words, the answer to our problems is not with the system. It's responsibility, dignity, self-respect, respect for the other. If you don't come to peace with yourself and love yourself, you can't love anybody else.' You should have been a clergyman, perhaps. 'No, because I don't like preaching. I want to show people, but people must perceive by themselves.' Although brought up a Roman Catholic, George Ortiz is an agnostic who - unlike the authors of the figures he has collected - expects no after-life. 'All gods are the invention of man in front of the anguish of death,' he said. 'I accept I disappear, but the future will have me in it.' He says he will not sell his collection before he dies but leave it to his four children to dispose of if they need to. All have had the best educations. At their father's urging, the three sons, George, Oliver and Nicholas, are learning to become streetwise: they have set up a store in Vilnius, Lithuania, which employs 100. The daughter, Graziella, is at university in the US. I asked if he had made sacrifices. 'Sacrifices, no. How can one talk of sacrifice when one is as privileged and well off as I am? But in the sense of choices I've sacrificed family life, travelling, holidays, all sorts of things. You don't achieve - I don't mean to be pretentious - this degree of perfection in such an ensemble without, like Churchill said during the war, blood, sweat and tears.' What keeps you awake at night? 'Nothing.' Not people stealing from you? 'No. I don't even insure. I can't afford it. It's life. Tomorrow the plane I take can crash. I could go in a store and a terrorist bomb goes off. It's life.' Is this the attitude of a man who is not self-made - who can say 'easy come, easy go'? 'Possibly. It may relate to what you asked me about money earlier, spending it on objects. I may have . . .' He searched for words. A secret distaste for wealth? 'For wealth, but not for elitism.'</p>

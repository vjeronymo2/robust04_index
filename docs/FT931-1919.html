			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Baltica/Hafnia Baltica's announcement that it plans to bid for Hafnia looks like an attempt to find a Danish solution to this troubled insurance affair. Since the underlying insurance business of both companies is sound, a merger must be tempting - especially given a restructuring plan that should isolate the problems in Baltica's holding company. The main losers from this latest twist in the saga appear to be investors in Baltica Holding, including the French Groupe Victoire. The main gainers would be bank lenders such as Den Danske Bank whose exposure to both companies would be more secure. That begs the question, though, of who will be rash enough to recapitalise Baltica so that it can take over Hafnia. If this really is a local solution, Danish pension funds might stump up the cash. But a lot of Scandinavian institutional money has already been wasted on grandiose schemes in the financial sector.</p>

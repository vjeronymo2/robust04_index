Repeated violations by both Serb aircraft and  helicopters have been taking place since April 1993 when the UN  first enforced the ban. NATO showed little inclination and even  less resolve to punish the violators. Now that they have done  so, one has some ground to conclude that it was due to either a  sense of shame or guilt at allowing the Serbs to continue with  their massacre of the Muslims, as the world media looked on.  Whatever the reason, the NATO action, belated though it has  been needs to be commended in the hope that this will not turn  out to be just a solo exception to Europe's consistent policy of  turning a blind eye to whatever the Serbs were doing in Bosnia.  The reason why this reservation has to be articulated is that  both the UN and the NATO have by their inaction, through default  or design, helped the Serbs, steeped as their hands are in  Muslim blood. [sentence as published] The latest manifestation  of that is NATO's reluctance to bomb those heavy weapons of the  Serbs which have neither been pulled back from around Sarajevo  nor handed over to the UN peacekeepers as specifically  stipulated in the UN ultimatum. Canadian General Aikman on duty  with the UN forces, has revealed to the international press that  six Serb tanks deployed round Sarajevo were taken out by the  Serbs in clear violation of the terms of the ultimatum. And  these are now likely to be used by them on other fronts.    No reason has so far been given by the UN for allowing Serbs  to continue their bombing of other Muslim enclaves, most notably  Tuzla. Tuzla and half a dozen other Muslim enclaves are  surrounded by the Serbs with their heavy guns just as Sarajevo  was. The UN must now take next logical step and save those  cities too -- that is, if it is really interested in restoring  its credibility in the international community.</p>

Metals with differing specific gravities were the raw materials  for producing, in the weightless environment of space, a  superconducting alloy with uniform composition, and wire was  drawn from this material after it had been recovered on earth.    Hopes had been placed on this alloy of aluminum, lead and  bismuth for use in superconduction and vibration prevention.  However, since the specific gravities of aluminum and lead are  too disparate on the earth, attempts to produce a high-quality  alloy have failed because the aluminum and lead separated into  two layers. NRIM faced this challenge with the primary materials  experiments conducted on the space shuttle Endeavor by astronaut  Mori, and the alloy was produced in a weightless environment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Japan/U.S. and Japan/Russia cooperation will begin  next year on research to test and analyze the extent of  embrittlement in pressure vessels due to radiation in material  removed from closed reactors. In a five-year plan JAERI will  conduct tests with Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the U.S.  on materials used in the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor  (Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture) now under disassembly and  with the Kuruchatofu [phonetic] Laboratories on a disassembled  Russian reactor. JAERI expects this to be a valuable resource  for making decisions on measures to counter reactor aging and to  extend reactor life.    Recently JAERI and Oak Ridge agreed to a research  cooperation  agreement for testing and analyzing JPDR pressure vessel steel.  They will work together on mechanical strength tests, structural  observations by electron microscope, etc., using steel removed  from the JPDR pressure vessel.    Because the U.S. Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission is  preparing regulatory standards for the renewal of LWR permits,  it is seeking data on changes over time in actual reactors, and  it asked JAERI about cooperation using JPDR, which recorded 12  years of operation. Because Japan does not have adequate  facilities for testing radioactive materials, Japan decided that  the cooperation would be beneficial to both nations.    In cooperative research with Russia, JAERI will use Russia  NPP 27, which is a closed reactor that operated for 33 years.  Researchers will bore cylindrical samples from the pressure  vessel and bring them back to Japan for analysis. Japan plans to  bear the costs over the next five years by paying the  Kuruchatofu Laboratory about &yen;23,000,000 a year for its part  in the study.    The STA expects that this test data will form the basis for  revision of regulatory standards for the LWRs that electric  power companies are using in Japan.    As a way of increasing the number of years of operation in  nuclear power plants, the government, mainly through MITI's  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, will consider  ``streamlining'' the safety regulations that are more stringent  than necessary, but convincing data is needed to do so.    Japan's LWRs are either BWRs or PWRs. JPDR is a BWR, and  Russia NPP 27 is a PWR, so STA believes that it will be possible  to do research and testing on the characteristics of both types  of reactors.</p>

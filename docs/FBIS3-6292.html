Government guarantees "mean the government controls business  activities and this runs counter to the government's policy of  deregulation," said a top official with the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry.    The comments were made after U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey  Kantor pointed to a need for "guarantees of progress" shared  equally by Japan's auto industry and government.    Kantor, speaking before the House trade subcommittee on  Tuesday, said he is dubious whether voluntary efforts by the  auto sector will be effective without government guarantees.    Kantor cited an accord involving Motorola Inc.'s access to  Japan's cellular telephone market as a model for deeper  involvement by the Japanese Government in ensuring market  deregulation.    The government assumed responsibility under the accord for  seeing that Japan's Nippon Idou Tsushin [Japan Mobile  Communications Corporation] implements the agreement, which will  to widen [as received] Motorola's access to the lucrative  Tokyo-Nagoya cellular phone market.    In a related development, a Japanese diplomat in Washington  said the scope of the government's responsibility for  implementing the weekend deal is "limited."    The Japanese diplomat said he could not discuss the content  of terms of the cellular deal because the Japanese and U.S.  Governments have not exchanged official notes on it.    The accord is a very special case and is not related to  ongoing bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the diplomat  said.    "The framework talks are not aimed at resolving a complaint  by a company," he said.    The diplomat made the remark in reference to comments by  some  U.S. trade officials who said the cellular phone agreement could  serve as a model for issues covered under the framework talks.    The dispute over Motorola's access to Japan's cellular phone  market was seen as a flashpoint in bilateral trade relations.    Washington had threatened to impose sanctions against Japan  for allegedly not abiding by a 1989 agreement on widening U.S.  access to Japan's cellular phone market.</p>

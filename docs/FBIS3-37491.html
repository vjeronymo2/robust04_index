V.N. Kazimirov, the  Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's special envoy, and M.  Bank, general director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry,  expressed profound concern in connection with the major  escalation of hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.    There was particular concern over the widening scale of  combat actions, their ferocity, and the increasing bloodshed,  which is making the conflict increasingly inhumane.    Both sides noted that the growing internationalization of  the  conflict is a great threat to the cause of peace and regional  stability.    During the consultations it was admitted that a sound and  long-term basis for a settlement can only realistically be  established by relying on peaceful political methods and the  sides' ability to reach a reasonable compromise.    The Russian side stressed that the chief priority is the  achievement of an immediate cease-fire and the cessation of all  combat actions, and the conclusion of the relevant agreement.    The participants in the consultations noted that Russia and  Iran support the world community's efforts to settle the  conflict. Being in direct proximity to and being committed to  the settlement of the conflict, Russia and Iran have repeatedly  put forward initiatives on its peaceful resolution and,  maintaining constant contacts, will continue their efforts in  this direction.</p>

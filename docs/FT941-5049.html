			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (1): A bumpy ride to America's superhighway - The US is leading the world into the age of interactive, multi-media communications. Yet some big questions - technological, legal and commercial - need to be resolved before this revolution becomes reality The US is in the early stages of a period of profound industrial change as it leads the world into the long-heralded 'information age' - where sophisticated new methods of communication will transform the way people live and work. Behind the upheaval lies a vision: that in the not too distant future offices and homes will be equipped with multi- media terminals which will be able to receive video telephone calls, movies and hundreds of television programmes on demand. They will allow the user to bank or shop while sitting in an armchair, play chess with someone thousands of miles away, or call up information easily from international data bases. When people are away from their homes and offices, they will be able to stay in touch by carrying lightweight, wireless, pocket-sized video telephones or personal communicators, which combine the functions of telephones, computers and messaging systems. This vision is hardly new. For more than a decade communications industry analysts have boldly forecast the imminent arrival of the interactive, multi-media information age, only to find that technology could not deliver sufficiently exciting services at sufficiently low cost to attract consumers. Suddenly, however, this brave new world seems a great deal closer, thanks largely to technological innovation. Audio, visual and data information can now be transformed into the same digital form and transported in vast quantities around high-capacity fibre optic 'trunk roads'. Compression technology permits the large amounts of information to be squeezed down feeder roads into the home. The US is leading this revolution partly because it is the home of many of these technological breakthroughs, partly because of its fiercely aggressive form of capitalism, and the fact it has allowed far more competition into its communications industries than most developed countries, and partly because of its insatiable appetite for filmed entertainment, which is expected to play a crucial part in making multi-media services economic. But where the US leads, the rest of the developed world is certain to follow  -with American multinational companies playing an important role. For example, large US local telephone groups are already the most important participants in Britain's fast-growing cable television/telephony business, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US long-distance telephone service company and a leading manufacturer of network equipment, aims eventually to generate half its revenues from outside the US. However, some huge questions need to be resolved before the multi-media vision becomes reality in the US, and many fortunes will be won and lost over the next few years placing bets on the correct answers. The pitfalls were graphically underlined last month when the largest US multi-media alliance yet announced suddenly fell apart. Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative local telephone companies, had agreed last autumn to pay up to Dollars 22bn to take over the biggest US cable television company, Tele-Communications Inc, but the deal collapsed because of difficulties in pricing TCI, compounded by cultural differences between the free-wheeling cable company and staid telephone group. The break-up of the deal underlines that no one is sure what shape the new multi-media industry will take. The digitisation of information means that at least seven industries which were previously separate - some for technical reasons, others because of regulatory concerns - are converging on the same ground, jostling for position in a world where legal and other barriers to competition are falling fast. They are: long-distance telephony, local telephone services, cable television, broadcasting, personal computing, wireless communications, and publishing. The industries best placed to distribute the new multi-media services are two traditionally monopolistic sectors with existing information service wires going into houses and office blocks: the local telephone companies, notably the seven so-called Baby Bell regional operators which were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, and the cable television businesses which cover some 60 per cent of US homes. The electrical supply industry, which has a power line running into every building, is also debating how to take advantage of the revolution. The local phone and cable companies, after spending years eyeing each other as potential enemies, have now started joining forces - and invading the territory of rival local phone companies. Competition is also being created by the entry of new participants to the local telephone market: AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance carrier, is buying McCaw Cellular, the largest non-Bell cellular telephone company. MCI Communications, the second largest long-distance carrier, recently announced plans to break into the local market, in conjunction with various unnamed partners. Sprint, the third largest long-distance carrier, already owns local monopoly phone businesses and cellular operations. And the Baby Bells, for their part, want to be allowed to enter the long-distance telephone market, from which they are barred. Legislation on both this, and the opening up of the local market, is before Congress. The proposed new order would increase the powers and responsibilities of the Federal Communications Commission, the national government agency which oversees the sector, to arbitrate between these clashing interests. The Bell Atlantic-TCI deal was the most dramatic engagement between local telephony and cable and its collapse means the two industries could now move much more cautiously in forming alliances. Deals that may prove more typical are a 25 per cent investment by Baby Bell US West in the cable and entertainment business of Time Warner, or the takeover by telephone companies of relatively small cable operators. Alongside this horizontal integration between local distributors, a degree of vertical integration is also under way as telephone and cable service companies forge links with programme packagers, such as cable television networks, and with programme originators, such as Hollywood film studios. These forces have been seen most clearly in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film production and book publishing group. On one side stood the ultimate victor, Viacom, primarily an originator and packager of cable television entertainment, with financial backing from Nynex, the Baby Bell serving the north-east US, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video retail chain. On the other side was QVC Network, a cable home shopping channel, backed by BellSouth, the largest Baby Bell, as well as Comcast, a cable distributor, and publishing groups Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications. There are some sharp differences of opinion within the converging industries as to how much vertical integration is necessary. Some protag-onists argue that the distributors do not need to have a stake in high-priced programming assets. Others maintain that since no one knows how the industry will shake down, it is a sensible precaution for them to have an interest in the sector. At the very least, it gives them access to a core of entertainment to fill their channels, and possibly a better bargaining position when buying programming from outside. An even more important question is how quickly customer demand will develop for multi-media, and that depends partly on how cheaply the services are priced and partly on making them easily accessible. The many millions of people who have difficulty programming a video cassette recorder will need a great deal of help navigating the information highway. Demand for multi-media is likely to develop at different times in different markets. Mr Robert Ranalli, head of multi-media at AT&amp;T, thinks there are 'tremendous opportunities over the next three to five years' in the market for large to medium-sized businesses, where networking will allow desktop collaboration - that is, staff in different locations working together to manipulate data, while simultaneously holding video telephone conversations. Interactive multi-media in the home and small businesses may take rather longer to take off as a mass market service - some analysts suggest it may be a decade or more away - but various popular forms of entertainment, notably movies-on-demand, are expected to win converts much more quickly. 'Cost is a problem,' says Mr Ranalli. 'The home market will evolve more slowly because of that. It will take five to 10 years for the price/performance of the technology to reach the TV set.' But after many false starts, the information age is finally dawning in America.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: Television Without Walls (Tuesday 9.00-9.30pm) does a piece on The Battersea Bardot, aka Carol White, who hit the big-time - not to mention the bottle in the 1960s. After her appearances in Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow, there was strong demand for her services from directors as diverse as Ken Loach and Michael Winner. A poignant profile of a woman who was going to be a star, but ended up as a black hole. Now that politics is more about kissing babies than killing rivals, does Machiavelli have any relevance? Timewatch (Sunday 9.00-9.50pm, BBC2) asks David Mellor, Roy Hattersley, John Biffen, Clare Short and Sir Bernard Ingham whether 'The Prince' can still provide any useful pointers. The answer, surprisingly, is yes if Mrs Thatcher is used as a test case. The slogan 'retail is detail' is drummed into every Marks and Spencer employee, as High Interest (Sunday 5.10-6.00pm, C4) reveals, with board members worrying about the amount of potato in the Vichysoisse. The behind-the-scenes glimpses of M&amp;S at work are fascinating.</p>

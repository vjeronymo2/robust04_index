			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Apache buys Amoco unit IN A move which will double its reserves and production, Apache Corporation, the Denver-based oil exploration and production group, is to buy a domestic business which owns a number of US-based oil and natural gas producing properties from Amoco, the fifth largest US oil company, writes Nikki Tait. The main consideration for the transaction comprises Dollars 515m and two million shares of Apache. Yesterday, Amoco shares fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 53 3/8 , while Apache rose Dollars 2 at Dollars 15 7/8 . Apache said that the deal means that oil reserves will increase to about 40 per cent of total reserves, compared with 21 per cent at present. Apache also claimed that total proven and probable reserves of the properties were around 133m barrels on an oil equivalent basis. They are located primarily onshore and close to the Gulf Coast, in the Rocky Mountains and mid-continent regions, and in the Permian Basin. The package was said to include interests in wells which produced a daily average of 28,000 barrels of oil and 117m cubic feet of natural gas last year. For the much-larger Amoco, however, the properties represent less than 5 per cent of proven US reserves on a oil equivalent basis. The company claimed that the sale formed part of 'an ongoing portfolio management'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev, Alex Fishman, 'Oded Granot, and </F> Shefi Gabay]    [Excerpt] Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political  adviser, spent four hours in Cairo yesterday meeting with  'Arafat and brought back a pessimistic message. Political  sources in Jerusalem estimated that chances are nil for an  imminent meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat.    Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin spoke on the phone on  Sunday.  They discussed the possibility of holding a summit meeting but  decided there would be no sense in such a meeting if it is not  certain to result in an agreement.    Yesterday's meeting in Cairo was attended by Colonel 'Amos  Gil'ad, Rabin's aide-de-camp, and Israeli Ambassador to Egypt  David Sultan. The PLO leader spelled out his conditions for the  resumption of the negotiations: banning gun-toting settlers  from moving around towns in the territories, relocating the  settlers from the heart of Hebron to Qiryat Arba', and  stationing an international force in the territories.    'Arafat surprised his audience with additional demands which  totally ignore the Cairo agreement. Among other things, he is  demanding that the size of the autonomous area in Jericho be  doubled, that Palestinian policemen be stationed at the Jordan  River bridges, and other demands that gave rise to disputes in  the past.    Neriya gave 'Arafat a message from Rabin saying that Israel  is willing to significantly accelerate the negotiations and the  implementation of the agreement once it is signed.    'Arafat departed for Tunis after meeting with Neriya.  "Neriya promised everything would be all right, but he made no  promises beyond the resolutions passed by the Israeli Government  in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron," a senior  Palestinian source told MA'ARIV last night.    Palestinian sources noted that both 'Arafat and Neriya  voiced  their apprehension that the peace process might be blown to  smithereens. "What the settler did in the Cave of the  Patriarchs was to massacre the peace process," 'Arafat said. He  asked that Israel investigate the role of the Israel Defense  Forces in the event.

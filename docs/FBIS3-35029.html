			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Where Does Israeli Rulers'  Problem Lie?," AL-BA'TH says: Ironically, the Israeli rulers  continue to compete in talking about peace and in devising  words, terms, and slogans on peace without this meaning any real  thing related to working for the sake of peace. Regardless of  their various party or other affiliations, the Israeli rulers --  starting with Ben-Gurion and up to Yitzhaq Rabin -- have always  talked about peace while launching wars and embarking on  invasions, aggressions, and occupation. For many years, and  while committing some of the ugliest massacres and expelling  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, they were always talking  about peace.    AL-BA'TH adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged  threat, the Israeli rulers expanded in land and usurped all the  territory set by the UN resolution of 1947 to the Palestinian  state. Their occupation extended to cover territory from three  Arab states -- Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria.    The paper adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged  threat, the Israeli rulers also attempted to realize their  aggressive dream to set up a greater Israel that would control  the Middle East.    The paper says: Syria has exposed the true Israeli rulers'  negative attitudes toward the peace process. Syria proposed  complete peace for complete withdrawal. It followed that with  President al-Asad's initiative in Geneva on Syria's readiness to  respond favorably to all requirements of the complete peace.    The paper stresses that Syria wants the just and  comprehensive peace that carries within it the elements for its  continuity and survival. Such a peace is not based on  injustice, occupation, and violation of international  legitimacy. Any one who wants such a peace will undoubtedly  meet with Syria.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Those who do not want peace  can fabricate excuses and allegations every day to escape peace.  The Israeli rulers are doing just that. Their problem lies in  themselves. They think they can continue to escape the  requirements of the peace process and continue both with the  occupation and settlements activities.</p>

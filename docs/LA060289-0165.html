			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAD BURROWING CAUSES FURROWING OF BROWS IN CHICAGO  </P> <P> Construction crews tunneling toward each other to connect City Hall and the  State of Illinois Center with an underground walkway met in the middle to  discover the two tunnels did not line up, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The state's portion of the "pedway" is nine inches lower than the city's  segment and off by eight inches horizontally, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.  The engineering gaffe carries a $309,669 price tag, which the city says it will  pick up despite claiming that the state is to blame.  </P> <P> "It's embarrassing," said John C. Hill, the city's coordinating architect.  "Professionals aren't supposed to make mistakes like this."  </P></p>

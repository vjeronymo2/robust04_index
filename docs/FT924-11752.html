BCCI, registered in Luxembourg, begins with capital of Dollars 2.5m supplied by Bank of America and Arab stockholders, including Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi. Customers include Gulf Shipping Lines run by Gokal family. 1973: BCCI opens branches in four Gulf states and in mainly Asian-immigrant areas of UK. 1974: Further branches open in London, focusing on rich Arab clientele. 1975: Registered in Cayman Islands. 1976: BCCI moves central offices to London. Branches in UK rise to double figures, with plans for further expansion announced. But early signs of trouble: New York regulators turn down BCCI's attempt to buy Chelsea National Bank because of its uncertain status. Bank of America internal memo expresses concern over general lack of control of BCCI's activities. 1977: Abedi touts BCCI as world's fastest-growing bank. Total assets have grown to Dollars 2.2bn, and branches number 146 in 32 countries - including 45 in the UK. Abedi persists with plans to expand in the US, and enlists help of Bert Lance, Jimmy Carter's former budget director. 1978: Bank of America becomes uneasy about BCCI's loan portfolio and decides to wind down its involvement. BCCI embarks on plan to buy US banks by stealth and acquires shares in Washington-based Financial General Bancshares (FGB). Clark Clifford, former US defence secretary, becomes BCCI US adviser. Gulf Shipping accounts in difficulty. 1979: Ernst &amp; Young expresses concern about BCCI using two auditors (the other being Price Waterhouse). 1980: BCCI opens in Panama. Gulf Shipping accounts now so badly in default that BCCI starts plundering other accounts to conceal losses. BCCI's nominees finally acquire control of FGB after long battle. 1981: Manuel Noriega opens an account with the bank. 1982: Abu Nidal terrorist organisation begins to channel funds through BCCI. Bank of England official Brian Gent says the Bank is the logical supervisor of BCCI. 1983: Ricardo Bilonick of Medelln drugs cartel opens account with BCCI. 1984: Swaleh Naqvi, Abedi's deputy, visits Latin America and identifies it as market for growth. 1985: Luxembourg bank supervisor tries unsuccessfully to get Bank of England to assume full responsibility for BCCI. Bank of England receives anonymous letter detailing fraud at BCCI. BCCI's treasury department loses huge sum of money in irregular transactions and plunders other accounts to cover up. BCCI buys a bank in Colombia to tap Latin American market. 1986: Abedi takes Dollars 150m out of the staff fund to plug hole in balance sheet.

Abedi has heart attack and heart transplant. Naqvi takes over management. Bank of England receives two indications, one from City of London Fraud Squad and the other from a Middle East accountant, of fraud at BCCI, but follows up neither of them. 1989: Price Waterhouse begins to uncover loan problems, including large loans to the US nominees and other insiders. Naqvi says they will be dealt with, but no action is taken, and he becomes evasive. Noriega toppled by US invasion. BCCI agrees to forfeit Dollars 15.3m after being found guilty of money laundering. 1990: Spring: Price Waterhouse uncovers 'false or deceitful' transactions. Loan problems worsening rapidly. Naqvi goes on desperate mission to Abu Dhabi to obtain financial help. Admits there have been heavy losses. Regulators approve a Dollars 1bn bail-out by Abu Dhabi to save BCCI from what they consider to be the graver threat of collapse. Price Waterhouse signs off 1989 accounts with footnote about the bail-out. May: Control of BCCI moves to Abu Dhabi. BCCI restructured, hundreds of employees laid off and dozens of branches closed. Abu Dhabi starts its own investigation into BCCI. October: Naqvi and Abedi resign. Price Waterhouse finds evidence that Abu Dhabi representatives have been authorising more dubious loans. Need for further Dollars 1.5bn bail-out apparent. November: Florida court sentences BCCI employees to between seven and 12 years in jail for money laundering. Price Waterhouse uncovers Naqvi's private files detailing much of the fraud. December: Investigations turn up Dollars 600m of unrecorded deposits. 1991: January: Bank of England, told of latest findings, is reluctant to call a formal investigation for fear of jeopardising new Abu Dhabi bail-out plan. In US, banking and prosecution authorities prepare to take action. March: Bank of England orders report from Price Waterhouse under Section 41 of the Banking Act, but continues to press Abu Dhabi to complete rescue plan.

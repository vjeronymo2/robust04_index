			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling's paper adversary 20.0) There has been a good deal of talk this week about sterling dropping below its ERM limits. This did not happen, nor is there any immediate danger of it. It is worth recalling some details of the system to explain why. All that matters for sterling at present is its rate against the Spanish peseta, since it is comfortably within its limits against the other currencies. The rules say that the Bank of England has a perpetual obligation to buy unlimited amounts of sterling for pesetas at a floor rate of Pta 180.59, while the Bank of Spain has a corresponding obligation to sell pesetas for sterling. Since the Bank of England has never been offered sterling under these rules, the floor has by definition never been breached. The reason is simple enough. The peseta is far less heavily traded than sterling; the market therefore believes that if intervention were triggered, the peseta would take the brunt. When sterling reaches its floor - as it did several times yesterday - it simply drags the peseta with it. The floor seemed to have been breached repeatedly this week outside the ERM's hours of 8am to 4pm London time. But outside these hours the peseta is not traded, so the calculation is bogus. The real trouble for sterling comes when it hits a currency its own size. The nearest is the D-Mark, where sterling's absolute floor is DM2.778. Yesterday's rate of DM2.835 therefore gives almost 6 pfennigs of leeway. But it would not do to be complacent. Sterling has been independently weak this week, losing 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark even as the D-Mark lost 3.5 pfennigs against the dollar. The UK money markets have lost their fear of an interest rate rise, with three month money just  1/8 th of a point above base rate. The D-Mark floor wants watching just the same.</p>

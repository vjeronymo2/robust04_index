			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Court levy plan aims to boost crime fund THE CONFERENCE called for a levy on court fines to raise money for crime prevention schemes. Delegates backed a move to require local councils to set up crime and safety task forces, charged with developing crime reduction programmes in partnership with community organisations. Crime Concern Campaign chairman Mr Tim Clement-Jones, from Streatham, south London, said a 5 per cent levy on fines for criminal offences, including motoring offences, would double the Pounds 7.5m currently spent on crime prevention. A 10 per cent levy would triple that amount. But there was concern that the levy would lead to higher fines, hitting the less well off who were sometimes taken to court for minor offences.</p>

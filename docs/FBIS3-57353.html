			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 15 (505)] </F>   [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has decided to set up  a committee to deal with ethnic tensions that exist, he said, in  relations between individuals. The new body will also draft  bills for parliament to debate and advise the executive branch,  he told the KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper.    He said that migration such as that taking place in the  country was inevitable when empires collapse. In the  president's words, over 200,000 Russians and still more Germans  had left Kazakhstan last year. He described their departure as  "a significant loss." During the same period nearly 160,000  Russians, some of them from Russia, settled in the country.    Nazarbayev emphasized that he had decreed a simplification  of  the citizenship acquisition procedure for those who have close  relatives in the country.    He said that dual citizenship was an issue "imposed from  outside the country" and that such citizenship was not provided  for by the Constitution of Kazakhstan or Russia. If every other  Kazakh resident is also a citizen of another state, the Kazakh  society may be split into natives and aliens, chaos and mistrust  can be created, the Kazakh leader thinks.    Nazarbayev called for creating conditions within the  Commonwealth for free movement and communication so that when  one moves to Russia, he or she obtains its citizenship freely  and, on return to Kazakhstan, that country's citizenship. He  called for working out "an agreed document allowing one to live  where one wants (in the CIS), whatever the citizenship."    Nazarbayev said he pinned great hopes on the new parliament  to be elected on March 7. He wants to work with parliament on  amending the Fundamental Law and emphasized the need to specify  in the Constitution that the country was a presidential  republic, increase the powers of the executive branch and  introduce a bicameral parliament consisting of a senate and a  house of deputies.    In Nazarbayev's view, parliament must have the right to  discontinue the president's powers before his term expires and  the president, to dissolve parliament.    The president also said in the interview that "it was time  that we took a wider view of land rights" and called for  appointing judges for life and for removal of obstacles to  entrepreneurial activities in every sphere.</p>

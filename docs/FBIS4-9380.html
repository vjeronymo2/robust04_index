			<p>CSO     [Text] Although the law on identity cards is not  being passed, the Interior Ministry is announcing the  introduction of new identity cards in the spring; the  introduction of the new cards will be done on the basis of the  old regulations, with a change in the form for the identity  cards; a filter for uncovering individuals without Macedonian  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  citizenship.    While the adoption of the law on identity cards by the  Macedonian Assembly is waiting for "better times," the Interior  Ministry is preparing a "counterstrike"--it will start to issue  the new identity cards as early as April, and possibly the  beginning of June. Regardless of whether the new law is passed  or not, legal form will be ensured by applying the old law, but  with changes in the regulations. To put it more simply, the form  of the identity card will be changed, which the ministry has the  right to do, just as in the case of the change in passports.  <H5>  Black Number </H5>   The Interior Ministry decided on this step because the  present situation with the use and issuance of identity cards,  in which real chaos prevailed (red, blue, and plastic-coated  ones are in use), is becoming increasingly untenable.  Standardization of the main civil document has also become  necessary in order to clear up definitively the question of who  is and who is not a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia.  According to Blagoja Toskovski, a chief at the Interior  Ministry, the current process of determining the status of  Macedonian citizenship is definitive enough to give an answer as  to how many citizens Macedonia has.    The information simply shows that many residents, knowing  that they did not meet the conditions for obtaining citizenship,  did not even request it, but are continuing to reside in  Macedonia, using the old identity cards, obtained in various  ways. That is the so-called "black number," whose magnitude is  unknown, and which can only be determined by issuing new  identity cards, which, however, can only be obtained on the  basis of having received citizenship. This step is an attempt at  finally clearing up the dilemma of who is a citizen of  Macedonia, and all those who will not meet the conditions for  obtaining a new identity card will have the status of  foreigners; they will be easily identified, and they will have  to regulate their stay in Macedonia in accordance with the rules  for residence by foreigners.  <H5>  Prediction </H5>   "Indisputably it is necessary to adopt the law on identity  cards. That does not mean, however, that it should be postponed  indefinitely, because the situation `in the field' is already  intolerable. The Interior Ministry will wait for the law to be  passed, but if that does not happen we will start issuing the  new forms for identity cards this spring," Blagoja Toskovski  said.    As the situation regarding passage of the law on identity  cards stands now in the Assembly, the Interior Ministry will  probably have to start without this law. The positions of the  deputies' groups still remain unchanged: The opposition is  stubbornly insisting that identity cards be written only in the  Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, including the  citizen's name, and the coalition itself, in addition to being  divided, has not decided what it should definitely accept.    Specifically, the PDP-NDP [Party for Democratic  Prosperity-People's Democratic Party] is insisting that the  entire contents of the identity card, including the name of the  owner, be written in the language and script of national  minorities, as well as the Macedonian language and Cyrillic  script. The Liberals, as usual, still have reservations; that,  however, does not mean that they possibly might not join the  SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], which accepts  the government's proposal that the identity card should be  written in the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet,  and the name of the citizen in parentheses and in the language  and alphabet of the national minorities. There are predictions  that since we will have elections this fall the law will not  even be supported at all, because of fear of a possible loss of  support among some of the voters.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Identity Cards as Cards </H5>   The new identity cards will have the form of cards made from  a stronger material without a protective foil. The first page  will have the photograph of the bearer, together with the  owner's first name and surname, and his birth certificate and  registration number. "Republic of Macedonia" will be at the top,  but without the state seal, which is also the alternative used  in the new Macedonian passports.    The data on the date and place of birth will be entered on  the second page, and the bearer's fingerprint will be impressed  in a special place. Otherwise, it is planned that the  replacement of identity cards will be carried out within one  year, but the Interior Ministry thinks that the entire operation  can be completed in a shorter time, in view of the capabilities  of the system, which makes it possible to issue 300,000 identity  cards in a month.</p>

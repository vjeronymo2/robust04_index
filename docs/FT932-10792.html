			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Israelis take hard line, poll shows DIVISIONS in Israel over the pace and direction of the Middle East peace talks in Washington intensified yesterday, with an opinion poll revealing that 59 per cent of those questioned opposed any territorial concessions to the Arabs. The Gallup poll, published by the newspaper Ma'ariv, is a blow for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who already this week has argued publicly with Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, over the peace process and faces renewed problems with the unity of his coalition government. Some 59 per cent of those Israelis questioned said they were against territorial concessions to the Arabs, even if Israel maintained control over some land along its pre-1967 borders and east Jerusalem. Mr Peres earlier this week said he favoured an eventual federation between the West Bank, Gaza and Jordan, a suggestion promptly rejected by Mr Rabin. The prime minister has asked cabinet colleagues to stop public discussion of the peace process, but two ministers said on Wednesday they believed it was time to give a decisive push to the negotiations. Mr Arye Deri, the minister of the interior, immediately warned that such comments gave the impression Israel was conducting a clearance sale in the occupied territories.</p>

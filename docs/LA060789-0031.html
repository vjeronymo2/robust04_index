			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KAMPF WINS VENTURA COLLEGE BOARD ELECTION  </P> <P> Elementary school principal Gregory Kampf overwhelmingly defeated opponent  Dorothy Ballesteros Tuesday in a hotly contested race for a five-month term on  the Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> With all of the votes counted, Kampf, 37, defeated Ballesteros, 4,119 to 1,223,  or 76.6% to 22.8%. The remaining votes were spread among several write-in  candidates.  </P> <P> During the campaign, Kampf emphasized his experience as a Ventura elementary  school principal and as a community college district board member from 1981 to  1984. Ballesteros, a Ventura County drug-abuse counselor, cited her Latino  heritage and her attendance as a single mother at Ventura College.  </P> <P> Kampf will represent parts of Ventura, Oxnard and unincorporated areas between  the two cities.  </P> <P> The election was called after four trustees deadlocked over a replacement for a  fifth member who resigned in November.  </P> <P> Also on Tuesday, voters in the Ventura County community of Fillmore defeated a  controversial $8-million bond issue meant to help pay for a new junior high  school.  </P> <P> The measure, which required at least two-thirds of yes votes to pass, received  990 yes votes to 1,016 no votes -- 49.4% to 50.6%.  </P></p>

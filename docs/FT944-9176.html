			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (13): Dark cloud or wake-up call? - Effects of bad publicity / Patrick Harverson considers the implications The news emanating from the derivatives market this year could hardly have been much worse. Reports of multi-million dollar losses (Procter &amp; Gamble), collapsed investment funds (Askin Capital Management), companies pushed to near-bankruptcy (Metallgesellschaft) and high-profile lawsuits (Procter &amp; Gamble again) have left a nasty stain on the business. As one corporate treasurer put it recently: 'Derivatives have become a four-letter word.' Certainly, the bad publicity surrounding the business has put many derivatives practitioners - from the bankers that create and sell them, to the corporate treasurers who use them - on the defensive. It has also grabbed the attention of regulators and legislators, who have questioned whether existing supervisory and reporting structures are up to the job of handling the explosive growth in the over-the-counter derivatives market; and it has eaten into the profits the big Wall Street banks and securities houses earn from helping their clients to manage risk. Yet, amid all the gloom, there are those in the industry who believe the market has already begun to recover from its mid-summer trough, when industry analysts said activity at the high end of the market - where the more complex derivatives are sold - shrank by as much as a third. Bankers Trust, the most active bank in the business, says that derivatives activity actually picked up in the third quarter, and that its earnings from risk management during the first nine months of the year were down only 7 per cent, compared with the record year of 1993. Also, a few industry participants believe that some good may eventually come of all the bad news surrounding derivatives (although, not surprisingly, it is the bankers who are the most upbeat about the current situation). Mr Mark Brickell, head of derivatives strategies at JP Morgan, says: 'One useful aspect of all the publicity in 1994 was that it stimulated firms to take a second look at their portfolios, to reassure themselves that what they had was what they wanted. . . That's good for the system.' Another who sees a silver lining in the dark clouds hovering above derivatives is Mr Fred Cohen, managing director at Price Waterhouse's capital markets and treasury practice. He says: 'What we're observing now is that for the end-user community (the big corporations, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations and mutual funds), this is a wake-up call. It has pointed out to them some of the risks inherent in these types of product, and has given them cause to reassess the quality of their frameworks for identifying, assessing and managing risk.' Such is the desire to find grounds for optimism in the market, that some professionals have actually welcomed Procter &amp; Gamble's lawsuit against Bankers Trust over a soured interest-rate swap. Although the headlines surrounding the case are only likely to add fuel to the anti-derivatives fire currently raging through Congress (where a few lawmakers see derivatives as the biggest threat to the US financial system since Mr Michael Milken and his junk bonds), bankers hope that the case will answer some important questions. For example, how much responsibility for educating corporations about the risks involved in using derivative products should lie with the dealer? Also, how much knowledge and sophistication should the dealer assume on behalf of the client? If the courts rule that it was up to P&amp;G - a multinational company with a long and successful record of operating in the financial markets  - to ensure that it was fully aware of the risks involved in buying the disputed contract from Bankers Trust, an important ground-rule may be established. The upbeat mood among some derivatives professionals, however, cannot disguise the fact that the market has been bruised by the setbacks of this year. Although the problems stemmed primarily from the sharp rise in US interest rates and the subsequent slump in US and international bond markets - a development which could hardly be blamed on the derivatives market itself - such is the leveraged nature of some derivatives (particularly the more exotic instruments) that the negative impact of rising interest rates has been greatly exaggerated. The damage inflicted left some users and dealers nursing huge losses on their investment portfolios, or from botched hedging strategies. Consequently, the more conservatively-minded corporate users have been steering clear of the more complex derivatives in favour of simpler contracts that are easier to value and which leave the user less vulnerable to heavy collateral damage from declining markets. 'People are more sensitive to what they're buying now,' said one derivatives consultant. Other companies, however, say that they have not changed their policies toward derivatives, primarily because they claim that they do not use the complicated contracts that have been the root-cause of many of the problems. McDonald's, with its huge exposures to currency risk, is one of the biggest users of derivatives among multinational companies. The fast-food group says it has continued to use derivatives as it always has - for basic financing purposes. 'We have always been conservative about derivatives,' says Mr Chuck Eberling, a spokesman for McDonald's. One banker at a New York securities house makes a similar point, claiming that the lawsuits and losses have not unsettled corporate treasurers, because, in most large companies, the treasurers are well-versed in the risks of using complex derivative instruments. 'They're not scared off by headlines. They know from personal experience what's complicated and what isn't, and which transactions make sense for them.' For every Procter &amp; Gamble or Gibson's Greetings (another company suing Bankers Trust over derivatives losses), there are scores of McDonald's, he says. One clear consequence of the upheavals in the market this year, however, has been a general reassessment by companies of management's responsibilities in tracking the use of derivatives. According to Mr Cohen, of Price Waterhouse, the most important lesson learned this year has been that senior management and company directors need to be better informed of the risks involved in derivatives. As Mr Cohen puts it: 'There's been a general acknowledgement that corporate policies need to be better defined and documented, and that there should be a clearer statement of the goals, objectives and risk tolerances of an organisation by its senior management and board of directors.' This reassessment has been partly to blame for the slowdown in the pace of derivatives activity, says Mr Cohen. 'Today, companies are using instruments with multiple levels of risk, and there is a realisation that there's a need to have appropriate models and systems to evaluate them.' In most cases, companies are looking to outside advisers - investment banks or specialist consultants - to provide the tools for making these evaluations. One such tool is the 'RiskMetrics' risk management system developed by the US bank JP Morgan, which is now available to derivatives users. Whether access to JP Morgan's 'black box' will prevent future derivatives debacles remains to be seen, but judging by the events of this year, some companies need all the help they can get.</p>

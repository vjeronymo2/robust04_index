			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] On 17 January, several Israeli Hebrew  dailies carry additional reactions to the Geneva summit by  members of the coalition, the opposition, and the Golan settlers.    A pool report on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT cites  several members of the coalition. Construction and Housing  Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer says: "Al-Asad spoke about peace  of the brave, but did not speak of security, settlements, or  withdrawal. He bypassed all the road mines. I am very pleased,  though I am missing a few answers." Knesset Member [MK] Avraham  Poraz (Meretz) says: "We must not accept full withdrawal from  the Golan, not even for full peace with Syria. Sovereignty may  be handed over to Syria, but Israel has the right to protect its  settlements." Minister Shim'on Shetrit is cited as saying: "The  many expectations we had pinned on the Clinton-al-Asad meeting  were not met, but the process made progress."    A report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8 of Tel Aviv 'AL  HAMISHMAR says that "Minister Ya'ir Tzaban yesterday said in  response that his impression of the Geneva summit is that a real  chance has been opened for a breakthrough that could change the  entire Middle East. `It is reasonable to assume that the prime  minister's formula, according to which the depth of withdrawal  will equal the depth of peace, will soon stand the real test.  Israel has a single supreme interest: That in the future, the  Golan Heights never serve as a springboard for acts of  aggression against Israel in general and the Galilee in  particular. There is room for far reaching compromises on all  the other issues.'"    A Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ page A4 report by Gid'on Alon and Yerah  Tal carries reactions by opposition members. Likud MK David  Levi, former foreign minister, stated "Israel has maneuvered  itself into a position in which the United States now  coordinates its moves with Syria." According to him, this is a  renewed recognition of Syria without it stopping its support for  terrorists. Levi further says that "the coordination between  the United States and Syria is not healthy for Israel." He  adds: "Now, it will be almost impossible to prevent a  U.S.-Syrian understanding about Israel's withdrawal from the  Golan Heights."    MK Moshe Qatzav, Likud Knesset faction chairman, says that  President Clinton has turned al-Asad into "a key figure for  making a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. According to  him, from now on, Syria will have a right to veto peace  arrangements with other Arab countries, without a single Syrian  concession toward peace."    The HA'ARETZ report also carries a reaction by the National  Religious Party which says that "the government has created a  situation in which foreign presidents determine the future of  the state." Moledet Movement Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi is cited  as saying that "we do not need the ruler from across the ocean  to manage our peace process." He adds that all al-Asad wants is  to receive the Golan Heights back, and hopes that the government  would sober up before we encounter hardships.    A report by Shim'on Weiss and ITIM on page 2 of Tel Aviv  DAVAR says that "Golan settlers reacted with satisfaction to  what they termed `al-Asad's tough statements in Geneva.'" A  statement they issued after the summit says: "Al-Asad's  uncompromising statements shattered the illusion that an Israeli  willingness to make concessions on the Golan will cause a  moderation of the Syrian stands." The Golan settlers call on  the government to adopt a policy which represents the "broad  consensus among the Israeli public -- a policy of peace with the  Golan."</p>

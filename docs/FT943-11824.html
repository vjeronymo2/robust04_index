			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Yorkshire Water The directors of Yorkshire Water are perfectly entitled to voice their objections should patently unsuitable candidates put themselves forward for election to the board. But their heavy-handed efforts to prevent the election of Mrs Diana Scott look misplaced. While Mrs Scott is short on industrial experience, she has worked within the regulatory regime and is familiar with its consumerist concerns. That alone makes her, at least, worthy of unbiased consideration by shareholders. Even monopolies cannot afford to ignore their customers.</p>

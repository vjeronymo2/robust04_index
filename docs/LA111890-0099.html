			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANGS KEEP SHOOTING, PEOPLE KEEP DYING;  </P> <P> A SUMMIT CONFERENCE, USING BLOCK'S PHILOSOPHY, IS NEEDED  </P> <P> Despite a decade of intensive law-enforcement efforts to rein them in, youth  gangs are continuing to expand at an explosive pace. As many as 100,000 young  men, and a growing number of women, now pledge their allegiance to a gang in  Los Angeles. They are much better armed than their predecessors and more  deadly. As gang violence statistics swell, law-enforcement experts, led by L.  A. County Sheriff Sherman Block, are not just calling for reinforcements to  help break the vicious cycle, but for social programs. That's new.  </P> <P> It's also important -- and heartening. "The message to be made clear to average  citizens is that putting more dollars into law enforcement is not going to  enhance their safety," Block told Times reporter Louis Sahagun. "We also need  social programs. They are absolutely essential." Block is absolutely correct.  </P> <P> Cops and deputies are simply outmanned and, increasingly, they know it. They  need help from all quarters to prevent more youngsters from becoming  gang-bangers, and to stop the carnage that is paralyzing too many  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> To come up with more answers, the sheriff is calling a conference in January  that will include law-enforcement representatives, community leaders,  politicians, religious groups, educators, parents and a host of others who  refuse to give up in the face of escalating gang violence. That summit, though  limited to areas of the county patrolled by the Sheriff's Department, is a  strong and welcome step. It can reduce bureaucratic competition and increase  cooperation and coordination.  </P> <P> It should be duplicated. There should be a similar summit-type conference for  the city of Los Angeles, perhaps under the leadership of Los Angeles Police  Chief Daryl Gates, who says there is little difference between his views on  gangs and Block's. If so, both Gates and Block should consider co-chairing a  regional conference on gangs, perhaps later in the year, to which community and  business as well as law-enforcement leaders could exchange views and map out  strategies to share.  </P> <P> Of course, a greater emphasis on social programs will cost money at a time when  there are not enough public dollars to finance other critical needs. That  suggests the need to reassess funding priorities.  </P> <P> There is also help for the asking, however.  </P> <P> Last year the Community Youth Gang Services, Brotherhood Crusade, Nation of  Islam, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and others poured staff and  volunteers into the L. A. Police Department's South Bureau, once the city's  most violent. The committed citizens painted over graffiti, set up job programs  and initiated neighborhood street patrols.  </P> <P> That combination of law enforcement and social intervention, nurtured by South  Bureau Deputy Chief William Rathburn, paid off. Gang crime dropped by a third.  It should be duplicated wherever possible.  </P> <P> By the end of this year, the countywide gang-related death toll is expected to  top 600, an all-time high. Thousands more children and other innocent victims  will be crippled for life. Stopping the downward spiral won't be easy. But  Sheriff Block is right to call for more programs to do what cops and jails  can't do alone.  </P></p>

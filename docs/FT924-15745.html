			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Enichem falls further behind in first period ENICHEM, the Italian state-owned chemicals concern which is one of Europe's leading plastics producers, suffered a group loss of L721bn (Dollars 600m) after minority interests in the first half of this year. The result represents a marked deterioration in EniChem's performance, caused by the continuing recession and severe price competition for many plastics because of worldwide overcapacity. In the first half of 1991, EniChem, now fully controlled by the Eni energy and chemicals holding company, lost L245bn. However, that figure included L224bn in extraordinary gains from the sale to other Eni companies of its Praoil refining subsidiary. EniChem, which should shortly receive a L1,000bn cash injection from Eni, declined to give a profits forecast for the year. Officials indicated the cash injection, combined with efforts to cut costs and improve productivity, should contain this year's loss below L1,000bn. At the operating level, EniChem's results deteriorated sharply, with a L169bn first-half loss, against a L140bn profit in the first half of 1991. However, the group said a better comparison was with the L217bn lost in the second half of 1991 to show the effect of cost-saving measures. The group said the workforce had been trimmed by over 3,000 people to 34,733 in the past 12 months. Further benefits would come from the co-operation agreement and joint ventures signed with the UK's BP Chemicals earlier this year. However, the financial advantages would only be seen in next year's accounts. Sales fell to L5,708bn in the first half, against L6,463bn last time. However, this year's figure was in line with the L5,694bn turnover in the second half of 1991. EniChem's problem remains debts, which rose by 9.6 per cent to L7,677bn at end-June from L7,000bn last December.</p>

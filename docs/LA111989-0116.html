			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THERE IS HOPE' FOR THOSE WHO MUST WAIT  </P> <P> Re: "Getting a Grip on Geriatrics," by David Larsen (View, Nov. 12):  </P> <P> This is not an apology for those in the medical profession who neglect their  patients, for whatever reasons. But as one who sees medical treatment given on  a daily basis, there is hope!  </P> <P> The only time our waiting room overflows is when an emergency patient has taken  longer than expected, or treatment, such as a biopsy, must be administered  immediately. This is always explained to those waiting. Our doctors value their  patients' time; our patients realize this.  </P> <P> Maybe I have been fortunate, but the offices I have worked in have always  treated all patients with dignity and respect, regardless of age, race or  financial status.  </P> <P> JOY LOGIE  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

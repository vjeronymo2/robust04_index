			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Lyons Irish falls There was a slight fall in pre-tax profits of Lyons Irish Holdings, Dublin-based food manufacturing offshoot of an Allied Domecq' subsidiary for the 28 weeks ended September 17. From turnover, also down, at IPounds 13.8m against IPounds 13.9m, the interim surplus came out at IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.35m), compared with IPounds 4.59m previously. Operating profits were unchanged at IPounds 3m and the directors felt this was a 'good achievement' at a time of intense competition. The pre-tax figure was after lower interest income - because of less favourable rates - of IPounds 1.42m (IPounds 1.57m). Earnings per share were 12.11p, against 13.43p, while the interim dividend is increased from 3.45p to 3.65p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vyacheslav Chornovil, the leader of the Ukrainian  Popular Rukh, said the President Leonid Kravchuk's announcement  that he will not run for presidency was a tactical gimmick.    He told Interfax-Ukraine that the statement of the  president's press service made public Wednesday had not said  anything of his unwillingness to run n the elections. What  Kravchuk is doing, Chornovil thinks, is trying to foil the  presidential elections, at least in June.    Chornovil was one of Kravchuk's rivals in the December 1991  presidential elections.</p>

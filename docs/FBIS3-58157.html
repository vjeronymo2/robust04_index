			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Everybody agrees that there is a need to reexamine  the issue of the presence, and particularly the role, of the  blue helmets in Bosnia. [French] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe,  who wants NATO member countries to discuss this in Brussels on  Monday [10 January], met today in Paris with the mediators, Owen  and Stoltenberg, who have for months now been leading with  difficulty the peace negotiations on the former Yugoslavia.  They all agree that if a negotiated solution seems impossible,  conclusions should be drawn and the current peacekeeping  operation should be reexamined.</p>

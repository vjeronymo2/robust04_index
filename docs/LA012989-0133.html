			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS BATTLE BACK, LOSE WAR, 7-6;  </P> <P> OILERS BLOW 5-GOAL LEAD, PULL OUT WIN  </P> <P> Things were going badly for the Kings Saturday night until their new tough guy  got beaten up. Jay Miller took it on the chin. Again and again. And on the side  of the head. Again and again. Then he went to his knees on the ice.  </P> <P> As fellow tough guy Marty McSorley explained: "That was a big sacrifice. For a  big guy like that to stand in there and take it, to turn his cheek like that --  that was a big, big play for our hockey club. We have to be tough. We always  have to be intelligent about it."  </P> <P> Or, as Miller put it: "Obviously I'm a much better fighter than that, but when  we're down 5-nothing, I'm not about to put us in a bigger hole with a penalty.  When I went down, I thought, the fans might not like this now, but they'll  appreciate it later."  </P> <P> The sellout Forum crowd of 16,005 did appreciate it later, when the fight that  Miller threw so blatantly resulted in a 5-minute power play that brought the  Kings to life.  </P> <P> The comeback effort came up short, though. The Kings lost to Edmonton, 7-6. But  they led the Oilers a merry chase after Miller took his beating, 1:27 into the  second period.  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls scored 2 quick goals on the power play, his 49th and 50th of  the season in his 51st game, tying a club record. And by the end of the period,  which the Kings dominated, they were within a goal, 6-5.  </P> <P> Miller scored the goal that tied the game, 6-6, in the third period. Yes, Jay  Miller. The guy acquired from the Boston Bruins just a week ago for his muscle.  The enforcer. The guy with all the penalty minutes and all the bruises on his  knuckles. The guy who had 2 goals for the Bruins all season had 2 for the Kings  Saturday night and now has 3 for the Kings in 1 week.  </P> <P> With 9:05 played in the third period, the unlikely hero slid the tying goal  under the glove of Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr.  </P> <P> In a fit of honesty, Nicholls said: "To tell you the truth, when it was 6-6, I  thought we'd end up with a tie. I thought that would be the end of our  comeback. Grant Fuhr is like that. He'll give up some goals when the game is  far apart, but when it gets close, he's tough. I didn't think he'd give up  another goal."  </P> <P> Fuhr didn't, but the Kings did. Craig Simpson got the winning goal for the  Oilers at 11:53, taking a pass from former King Jimmy Carson in front of the  goal and deflecting it off the pants of King goalie Glenn Healy and into the  net.  </P> <P> The Kings are 0-5-1 in their last 6 games, their worst slump of the season. But  the comeback gave them more than a glimmer of hope.  </P> <P> "If the Kings of the past were down, 5-0, it would be all over, but not now,"  said Nicholls, a King of the past who likes the Kings of the present much  better. "There's a lot of heart here. We're not quitting. We might have played  (pretty badly) at the start of this game, but we know we're better than that.  This team is never quitting."  </P> <P> Healy agreed, saying that the Kings picked up confidence as the game wore on.  </P> <P> "The way we came back showed the pride and the character of this team," he  said. "We were making a lot of mistakes in the first period, but we had them  running around in the second and third."  </P> <P> Still, though, they came up short. So far this season, the Kings are 1-3  against Wayne Gretzky's old teammates, the defending Stanley Cup champions and  the team the Kings are most likely to meet in the first round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> "If we meet them in the playoffs, that's fine," Healy said. "We can beat them."  </P> <P> Edmonton Coach Glen Sather liked the way Esa Tikkanen held Gretzky to just 3  assists.  </P> <P> "It has always surprised me over the years why more people don't do that to  Wayne and why more people don't run into him and knock him off the puck," he  said. "He's a great player, but you can rest assured that there's gonna be a  lot of people that are gonna be banging into him from now on."  </P> <P> While Gretzky was being knocked around, the likes of Miller and McSorley were  scoring for the Kings. And not by accident.  </P> <P> McSorley said: "The reason we were scoring is because our goal scorers are  sacrificing. Forechecking, backchecking, taking the hit. They were sacrificing  to get us the puck."  </P> <P> After the Kings fell behind, 5-0, the game turned around when Oiler Mike Ware  got a 5-minute penalty for fighting early in the second period. Ware pummeled  Miller until the officials intervened. After Ware's 2-minute penalty for  elbowing and Miller's 2-minute penalty for roughing canceled each other out,  the Kings had a 5-minute power play.  </P> <P> Nicholls' goals got the Kings started. And Luc Robitaille gave the Kings their  third power play goal in a row, and their third goal in a span of 3:07, after a  holding call on Carson. Gretzky had assists on all 3 goals, which cut the  Oilers' lead to 5-3.  </P> <P> Jari Kurri gave the Oilers their only goal of the second period, skating at  Healy from the left side to make it 6-3. But former Oiler McSorley struck back  with a couple of big shots from his defensive position at the top of the right  circle. His first shot, from just inside the blue line at 13:45, made its way  through traffic and past Fuhr. His second was deflected in by Miller at 17:41.  </P> <P> In the second period, the Kings outshot the Oilers, 24-6. The Kings, who had  been outshot in 16 of their last 18 games, had not had 24 shots in a period all  season. For the game, the Kings had a season-high 47 shots to the Oilers' 32.  Nicholls took 13 shots, breaking Marcel Dionne's club record, set in 1981.  </P> <P> The Kings were outshot, outskated, outplayed, outsmarted and outfought in the  first period as the Oilers took a 3-0 lead on goals by Dave Hunter, Miroslav  Frycer and Simpson.  </P> <P> As a result of McSorley's double minor for roughing at the end of the first  period -- after McSorley hooked an arm around the neck of Kevin McClelland and  tried to dump him over the wall in front of the Oiler bench -- the Oilers had 3  minutes 55 seconds of power play at the start of the second period.  </P> <P> Carson scored 2 power play goals within 16 seconds against his old teammates,  at 1:03 and 1:19, to give the Oilers their 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> With his second goal Saturday night, Bernie Nicholls tied the club record for  the fastest 50 goals. Charlie Simmer also had 50 goals in 51 games during the  1980-81 season. . . . Ken Baumgartner, who had not played for more than three  weeks as he recovered from pneumonia, lasted a little less than one period  before being tossed for fighting. . . . New King Steve Kasper missed the game  because of illness. . . . Dave Taylor and Igor Liba are still out, Taylor with  an inflamed knee and Liba with a mildly separated shoulder. . . . There are  still tickets available for Tuesday night's game against Calgary, the leader in  the Smythe Division.  </P></p>

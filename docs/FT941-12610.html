			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Zhirinovsky map carves up Europe Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist, has carved out a vision of Europe that resembles the continent's brutal reshaping early in the second world war. Mr Zhirinovsky drew a map for a retired Swedish ambassador, Mr Rolf Gauffin, who came to see him in Moscow and subsequently passed it to Le Monde, which published the map yesterday. As the newspaper commented, Mr Zhirinovsky's doodlings cannot be entirely dismissed as 'the imaginings of a crank' because of his success in winning a quarter of the vote in Russia's elections. In Mr Zhirinovsky's vision, Russia would regain the Baltic states, except for the Estonian capital of Tallinn and the inter-war Lithuanian capital of Kaunas, which would become little city-states. Germany would repeat its 1938 and 1939 acquisitions of Austria and the Czech lands, annex bits of western Poland and regain the city of Konigsberg (today's Russian enclave of Kaliningrad), while Russia would get some of eastern Poland. Mr Zhirinovsky would take Lvov from Ukraine and return it to Poland, which lost it as a result of the 1945 Yalta conference. Mr Zhirinovsky's Russia would take Slovakia. Further south, Hungary would take Transylvania from Romania, while a greater Bulgaria would include chunks of Greece, the European part of Turkey and the ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Bosnia would be carved up between Serbs and Croats.</p>

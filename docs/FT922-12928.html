			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Observer: Succession puzzle The great unsolved mystery about the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid for Midland is who will run the enlarged group. It seems clear that for the short term Willie Purves will be in the driving seat. But he is already past retirement age and will stay in Hong Kong until late 1993. Once the merger has bedded down the intention is that the group chief executive will be London-based, and it is unlikely to be Purves. Brian Pearse, Midland's excellent new chief executive, will get a seat at the top table. But he'll probably not be in the running, if for no other reason than that, at 58, he is only a couple of years younger than Purves. The same goes for John Gray, Purves's equally good deputy. Likewise 56-year-old Bernard Asher, who runs James Capel and already sits on the Midland board, is an unlikely candidate, because he is not a banker. Nevertheless, the field is starting to narrow. John Strickland, 52, now responsible for the Hongkong Bank's information technology, will join Midland's board. John French, another Hongkong Bank veteran, has been given the task, along with Midland's Brian Goldthorpe, of looking after credit and risk management. These two, plus 51-year-old John Bond - currently nursing Marine Midland back to health - and Paul Selway-Swift, 48, are the obvious front-runners to succeed Purves. Given the Midland's high turnover of senior staff, it looks unlikely to be the source of the next top honcho. Brian Goldthorpe, the only real survivor is close to retirement. Admittedly, Richard Delbridge, Midland's 49-year-old finance director who joined from J P Morgan in 1989, gets the plum job of group finance director plus a seat on the group board. But he would have to perform extremely well over the next couple of years to beat the Hongkong competition. Indeed, it is easier to measure the losers than the winners on the Midland bench. The obvious casualty is Gene Lockhart, Midland's 42-year-old high-tech whizzbang. Of all the glamorous outsiders hired in Sir Kit McMahon's heyday, he seemed destined to be a chief executive. However, the highly-paid Lockhart has stayed out of the limelight since McMahon's departure, and - given Strickland's promotion - his days may be numbered. The other big unknown is George Loudon, 49-year-old chief executive of Midland Montagu. His name has not figured in the reshuffle, although he is in charge of the part of the business which could provide the greatest long-term growth potential.</p>

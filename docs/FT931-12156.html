			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge given over unification of VAT SIR John Cope, paymaster-general, assured the Commons last night that the government was not 'wedded' to the unification of taxation rates across the European Community, Ivor Owen writes. He was seeking to allay fears about the provisions in the Maastricht treaty dealing with the harmonisation of indirect taxes during further debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. Sir John urged critics of the treaty not to confuse harmonisation and unison. He said 'harmony involves different notes which blend with one and other to create a pleasing overall sound'. Harmonisation did not mean that every member state had to have exactly the same tax system or rates.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- At their regular meeting in Munich  on Friday [6 May], the majority of culture ministers of the 16  laender renewed the veto of their land governments against a  cultural agreement between Germany and Iran. The ratification  of the agreement, which was concluded in 1988, cannot be  approved "because of the continuing human rights violations" in  Iran and because of the fact that the death threat against  author Salman Rushdie has not been retracted. Because of  Germany's federal system, the ratification of cultural  agreements requires the approval of the laender.    At the conference, the latest arrangements between the  Foreign Ministry and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud  Va'izi during his visit at the end of February in Bonn were also  criticized. During this visit, it was agreed, among other  things, to establish an institute to promote the German language  in Tehran and to resume the work of the German Archaeological  Institute.    The laender learned about these agreements only from the  media, it was stated. "In view of the acts of cultural  barbarism in Iran, which are supported by the Iranian  Government," official cultural relations between the FRG and  Iran are, in the view of the culture ministers, "also  undesirable below the level of a cultural agreement," Bremen's  Culture Senator Helga Truepel (Greens) said.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / BAe cries foul over refinancing package for Fokker British Aerospace is challenging a Fl 1bn (Pounds 367m) refinancing for Fokker, the loss-making Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer controlled by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa). The UK company, which like Fokker is a leading manufacturer of regional turboprop and jet aircraft, is expected to ask the European Commission to block the refinancing on the ground that it constitutes an unfair subsidy. The move is likely to complicate the long drawn-out efforts of BAe and Dasa to merge their respective regional aircraft operations as part of a broad restructuring of the European sector. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said on Friday ahead of this week's Farnborough Air Show that the European regional aircraft industry needed to be consolidated around one group of manufacturers similar to the successful European Airbus consortium in the large airliner market. To that end, BAe has held extensive talks with Dasa and Aerospatiale of France. Although BAe remains in contact with Taiwan Aerospace, with which it failed last year to forge a joint venture, the UK company has made clear that it now favours a European solution to its regional aircraft problems. Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, which owns Dasa, also said last week that he hoped to reach an agreement with BAe on combining the two companies' regional jet activities. But the Fl 1bn refinancing package for Fokker, announced in July, is now seen as a significant obstacle to progress towards an eventual merger of BAe's and Fokker's regional jet activities. BAe argues that the refinancing constitutes an unfair subsidy that shores up Fokker's position in any eventual merger negotiation and further distorts competition in a market already plagued by manufacturing overcapacity and too many competing products. The refinancing of Fokker includes a Fl 600m capital injection from Dasa, which bought a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch company last year, and an additional Fl 400m of indirect support from the Dutch government, a minority shareholder. Under the package, the Dutch government has approved a sale-and-leaseback arrangement involving the sale of Fokker's aircraft building technology to Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank. The deal required government approval because the purchase and subsequent leaseback of the Fokker technology patents by Rabobank is designed to reduce the bank's tax bill, depriving the government of around Fl 400m in revenues.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS PLAY TONIGHT AT FORUM  </P> <P> The Lakers will play the Milwaukee Bucks tonight at 7:30 in the second of two  exhibitions at the Forum.  </P> <P> At 4:30, the San Antonio Spurs will play the Cleveland Cavaliers.  </P> <P> The winners will meet Sunday night, after the losers play Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> The Lakers are 2-1 in the exhibition season, having split with Portland and  beaten Maccabi Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> Friday, the Lakers cut swingmen Michael Young and Steve Bucknall, leaving 14  players on the roster. Free-agent guard Keith Smith is rated a longshot.  </P> <P> The No. 2 pick, guard Tony Smith, was slowed by his early-camp absence but is  still expected to remain with the team.  </P> <P> The competition for the 12th spot seems to be between two free-agent forwards,  veteran Tony Brown and rookie Irving Thomas.

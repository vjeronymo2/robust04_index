			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Stockholm regains securities business from foreign centres NEARLY a year after Sweden abolished turnover tax on share transactions, it is clear Stockholm has increased its trading volume and raised its share of trade in Swedish securities. What is less clear is whether it has won much business back from foreign centres where Swedish shares are traded, notably London. Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share Promotion, said: 'We are not losing any more business to London, but I am not sure that we have regained very much either.' Swedish turnover tax was abolished on December 1 1991. It had stood at 2 per cent for most of the late 1980s - allowing London to capture a significant portion of Swedish business following Big Bang - and was phased out in two steps over the course of last year. Coincidentally, the fourth quarter of 1991 was a dismal trading period on the Stockholm bourse. Volume for 18 leading stocks reached 98.1m shares in Stockholm, or 92.3 per cent of London's 106.3m shares for the same companies. In the first three quarters of this year, however, Stockholm's position has improved substantially. Volumes for the same 18 stocks have reached 132.7m, 140.4m and 125.8m shares in consecutive quarters, ahead of London's 124.9m, 118.8m and 112.4m. Ericsson, the telecommunications group which in every quarter of last year traded fewer shares in Stockholm than in London, has seen the position reversed this year. But it is an exception among Sweden's leading companies: Astra, the pharmaceuticals group and SKF, the roller bearing group, still trade more in London than in Stockholm. Mr Leif Vindevaag, head of research at the Stockholm Stock Exchange, believes there has been little erosion in London's competitive position when it comes to trading in leading international companies. But for a second tier of less actively traded groups, he believes there has been a flow back to Stockholm now the price differential between the two markets has disappeared. Quantifying how much business Stockholm has regained is difficult due to other factors such as foreign net buying of Swedish shares and increased activity by domestic players following this year's reduction in capital gains tax. Stockholm can expect to enhance its position vis-a-vis London in stocks where it clearly has greater liquidity. But a strong reversal of the relative positions may require more than that.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo Stock sales by corporate investors realising profits to boost earnings ahead of the September book closing are expected to peak this week, writes Emiko Tarazono. While public pension and insurance funds are likely to support prices around 20,000, large capital stocks and banks will face selling pressure. Investors are expected to focus on releases by think-tanks on corporate earnings for the current business year to next March but Friday's futures and options settlements will introduce a note of caution.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rise of 74% suits Moss Bros COLOURFUL jackets from Versace, retailing at about Pounds 300 each, helped Moss Bros, the men's wear company, lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m for the 53 weeks to January 30. That was an improvement of 74 per cent on the Pounds 1.32m returned for the previous 52 weeks. More than a third of profits came from net interest receivable of Pounds 933,000 (Pounds 720,000). The company ended the year with a Pounds 14m cash balance and said it was considering both organic growth and expansion by acquisition. After a tax credit of Pounds 1.05m in the previous year, Moss Bros paid Pounds 877,000 tax. Earnings per share were 8.52p (5.19p before the tax credit). Directors propose a final dividend of 4p, giving a total for the year of 5.5p (5p). The company, which sells more than one in every 20 suits bought, increased turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 55.8m mainly due to an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.5 per cent. This figure masked a 14 per cent increase in the contribution from Cecil Gee, the high street outlet for fashion products, including the jackets, although the company said a range of racy briefs, also from Versace, had sold less well. Suit Co, the mainstream retailer, recorded a 3.5 per cent increase in sales while classic outfitter Savoy Taylors Guild improved sales 3.5 per cent. Turnover was also lifted by the inclusion for the first time of the Dormie business acquired at the end of 1991 and the additional week covered by the 1992 accounting period. Mr Rowland Gee, group managing director, said: 'Business failures in clothing retail companies went up by 67 per cent last year which means Britain is no longer over-shopped. 'We think we will be one of the sectors to come out of the recession quickest.'</p>

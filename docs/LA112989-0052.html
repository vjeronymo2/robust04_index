			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE GATHERS OFFENSE TOGETHER IN TIME TO BEAT CLU  </P> <P> Having suffered a heartbreaking quadruple-overtime loss to the College of St.  Thomas in its opener Saturday night, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball  team was eager to make amends against Cal Lutheran on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Perhaps too eager.  </P> <P> An impatient Matador offense made only 32% (11 of 34) of its shots in the first  half. But in the second half, Northridge settled down, hitting 18 of 34 shots  en route to a 79-63 victory in a nonconference game at Northridge.  </P> <P> "We're like a bunch of thoroughbreds," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said.  "We're young and we have a tendency to just want to get out and run. . . . We  get overanxious, and it affects the way we play."  </P> <P> Derrick Gathers was a prime example of what Cassidy was talking about. The  Matadors' leading scorer last year, Gathers scored only two points in the first  half on one-of-11 shooting, but he finished with a team-high 18 points after  hitting six of 11 shots in the second half.  </P> <P> 'I'm a shooter," said Gathers, who scored a team-high 26 points against St.  Thomas. "So I wasn't really worried about the first half. I knew I would heat  up sooner or later. Coach told me at half to just relax and things would start  to fall and they did."  </P> <P> Leading, 38-32, early in the second half, Northridge -- led by Gathers -- put  the game away with a 23-9 run.  </P> <P> Gathers, who had missed his last 10 shots of the first half, made three of four  -- including two three-point baskets -- during the surge.  </P> <P> With a 20-point lead, Cassidy sat four of his five starters, but Cal Lutheran,  led by Jeff deLaveaga, countered with an 7-0 run to narrow the Matadors' lead  to 61-48 with 9:12 remaining.  </P> <P> DeLaveaga, who scored a game-high 27 points, had five points during the  Kingsmen rally, prompting Cassidy to reinsert Gathers and Co. into the lineup.  </P> <P> Northridge (1-1) quickly hit four consecutive baskets to take a 71-48 lead with  7:35 left, and Cal Lutheran (0-4) got no closer than 14 points after that.  </P> <P> Gathers made three-point baskets to start the run and finish it, and baskets by  Kris Brodowski and Kendell McDaniels were sandwiched in between.  </P> <P> Brodowski scored 12 points in the game, along with teammates Jemarl Baker and  Eugene Humphrey; McDaniels had 11 points and a game-high 17 rebounds.  </P> <P> Sandy Brown added nine points off the bench -- all in the second half -- for  the Matadors.  </P> <P> Northridge led, 36-30, at halftime, despite Gathers' troubles.  </P> <P> Humphrey picked up the scoring slack, scoring 10 points on four-of-five  shooting, including two three-point baskets.  </P> <P> "Gene is one of our most patient players," Cassidy said. "He's a very  intelligent player on the court. He doesn't get overly excited."  </P> <P> DeLaveaga, the younger brother of former Cal Lutheran standout Steve, led the  Kingsmen with 12 points in the first half, hitting four of eight shots.  </P> <P> Northridge appeared to be on the verge of blowing Cal Lutheran out in the first  half -- leading, 29-17, with 5:37 left -- but the Kingsmen went on an 11-4 tear  over the next 3:59 to narrow the deficit to 33-28 with 1:38 left in the half.  </P> <P> The Matadors will travel to Utah later this week for games against Weber State  on Friday and Utah State on Saturday.  </P></p>

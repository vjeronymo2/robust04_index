			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE EARTH IS ENOUGH GROWING UP IN A WORLD OF TROUT AND OLD  MEN BY HARRY MIDDLETON (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 269 PP.)  </P> <P> Harry Middleton's vivid and moving memoir is part autobiography and part homage  to the two old men who taught him to love the outdoors. In a few brief but sure  strokes, Middleton sketches his family circumstances, with a stunning  description of a tough military father. Near the military base where  Middleton's father is stationed on Okinawa, one of the author's schoolmates is  killed by an old hand grenade the boys find in a creek bed. The young Middleton  is immediately packed off to live with his grandfather and granduncle on the  family farm in the foothills of the Ozarks. On the bus trip across the States,  the boy fears he is being "handed over to tobacco-chewing, brain-damaged  hillbillies."  </P> <P> Instead he finds two old eccentrics with whom he feels instantly at home.  Grandfather Emerson and Uncle Albert own a tract of miserly "hardscrabble"  land, but they revel in their wilderness of ancient, tenacious trees and wild  game. Their lifeblood is liberty and solitude, the possibility of hunting and,  most of all, of trout fishing in Starlight Creek. The old men raise vegetables  but no animals because, whereas tomatoes are never in a hurry, animals have a  habit of requiring attention just when the "trout were rising or something more  interesting or illuminating was happening up in the mountains or deep in the  woods."  </P> <P> The farm is in fact so unproductive that a state agricultural agent calls it  "an agricultural disgrace." The scene with the agent, in which the old men can  barely conceal their pride at having kept the land so wild and pristine,  contains their whole philosophy. In answer to the agent's advice to cut down  the useless trees and plant valuable pines, Emerson protests: "Certainly the  world isn't experiencing a shortage of telephone poles." Instead he asks for  advice on how to preserve the trout's environment. Trout are "finicky,  civilization upsets them. They'd rather die than have any part of it." Albert  then invites the fellow to go fishing in a perfect place where there's a sly  old trout, adding: "Of course, if you hook him we expect you to do the decent  thing and let him go. If a man is careful and lucky, some of life's thrills can  be experienced more than once." As the agent withdraws in fury, he rebukes  them: "Goddamn old hippie communists. Men your age, too. You ought to be  ashamed."  </P> <P> In the old farm house that "tended to embrace the practical rather than the  needless, the theoretical, dispensable or the visionary," there are no modern  conveniences except a radio, so that Albert can play his Hohner harmonica along  with a weekly blues program from Memphis. Another indispensable item in their  life is books: hundreds of them. In the evenings and in foul weather, the old  men attend Roman orators, converse with Mark Twain, are aggravated by Evelyn  Waugh. When it appears that the young Middleton is bitten as hard by the bug of  writing as of fishing, they build him a desk, and eventually, a chair,  straight-backed and plain like everything else in the house. "No writer writes,  I hear tell," says Emerson, "unless he's uncomfortable with something, even if  it's just a chair."  </P></p>

As concerns the legal aspect, the things are  clear: The two chairmen of county councils were not empowered to  sign a possible adhesion. As for the political aspect  concerning the future of Europe, the enhancement of integration  and stability on the continent and in our region, this kind of  cooperation at the level of localities or territorial  administrative units is a viable formula. The problem consists  only of the manner of delimitation of the area in which this  organization is functioning. We want to be sure that such steps  do not conceal also things contrary to the European  organizations' generous and noble purpose of securing the  states' cooperation and prosperity. Ukraine's efforts to  include in the Euro-Carpathian Region two counties of Romania --  Botosani and Suceava --, where the numbers of the Ukrainian  minority are rather inconsequential, means a stand taken by the  Ukrainian Government precisely on this preoccupation of ours.  The possibility of Romania's participation in the  Euro-Carpathian Region or in other forms of similar cooperation  has been under the foreign ministry's consideration," spokesman  Mircea Geoana said.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate nerves return to jolt share prices - Market Report Interest rate confidence was jolted in the London stock market yesterday as City analysts took a closer look at the survey of industrial trends by the Confederation of British Industry and then at the sharp rise in US durable goods orders reported for last month. The FT-SE 3,100 mark was abandoned in late afternoon, in both the stock market and derivatives sector. Slight disappointment over demand at the Pounds 2bn government bond auction checked attempts by shares to edge forward in early trading. The market turned off heavily when the dollar, Wall Street and the US bond market fell sharply towards the London close. The FT-SE Index closed at the low of the day, with a loss of 34.9 points bringing it to 3,082.3. Volume, helped by trading statements from a number of leading UK companies, rallied from the subdued levels seen this week but was still modest by comparison with trading sessions of the past few months. At yesterday morning's meetings at the leading securities houses, strategists focused on disclosure in the CBI report that business optimism had fallen in July, while capacity utilisation rates - already above long-term averages - had risen further. 'Inflation pressures in the manufacturing sector have picked up over the quarter,' commented UBS. Nervousness that interest rate pressures could be increasing led to concern that the feared rise in domestic base rates might come sooner than markets have bargained for. The pessimists pointed out that the Governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the exchequer will meet today for policy discussions. However, shares held up steadily for a while as satisfactory trading results from BAT Industries and BT bore out views that further rises in corporate earnings and dividends will protect the stock market from interest rate concerns, for some time at least. Confidence was challenged, however, by early weakness in sterling against the D-Mark, in the sterling trade-weighted index which fell to its lowest level for 18 months, and later by weakness in the gilt-edged market and the short sterling rate. But the Footsie 3,100 mark was held until developments in the US sent British government bonds down sharply and upset investors across the range of UK securities. Selling hit the stock index sector, where the September contract on the FT-SE Index saw its premium against cash wiped out. A rally from the initial fall in the Dow Average, which cut its loss to 18 points in UK trading hours, was no help to the London market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to futures trading, lost only 8.2 to 3,632.9, but appeared to be vulnerable should further selling develop in the market today. Seaq volume of 599m shares compared with 551.7m on Tuesday, when retail business was worth only Pounds 979.7m, one of the few times this year that daily retail, or genuine customer, business has fallen below the Pounds 1bn mark. The London market was caught between two fires. Retail and consumer stocks, closely tied to prospects for domestic interest rates, fell back, with Marks and Spencer, Great Universal Stores and Sears all weaker; similar factors upset bank stocks. But at the same time, US and dollar concerns hit the blue chip internationals, bringing setbacks for Glaxo, Shell, RTZ and many others. Some investors fell back on the utility sectors as defensive areas in a nervous stock market. While the bearish school of analysts, headed by Mr Nick Knight of Nomura, returned to the market limelight, some others suggested that the weakness in equities might have been overdone in view of the generally favourable outlook for company profits.</p>

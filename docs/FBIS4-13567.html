			<p>BFN     [Text] Nearly 500 foreign investors and Indian  entrepreneurs have come together in the capital under a focus  program to promote direct foreign investments in the small and  medium industries. A report.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] The program -- India  Invesmart -- organized jointly by Industry Ministry and the  United Nations Industrial Development Organization -- UNIDO --  is providing a forum for individual business negotiations  between foreign investors and Indian project sponsors. The five  priority sectors in this meet are food processing, leather and  leather products, textiles and ready-made garments, chemicals,  and metallurgy. Inaugurating the five-day Invesmart, the prime  minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, called for an interdisciplinary  approach to industrialization keeping in mind the variety of  contemporary concerns like environment, employment, and  resources.    [Rao] The fact that most of the identified projects are in  the small and medium enterprise sector, it is equally important.  This sector has led the process of economic growth in a number  of developing countries and moreover in India it is particularly  important for its relatively greater employment potential. Thus  it has been the effort of my government to strengthen industries  in this sector through promotion of competition, efficiency,  technology upgradation, and enhancement of the export  capability.    [Correspondent] The Secretary General of UNIDO, Mr. Mauricio  de Mar'iay Campos, took note of India's industrial growth  potential; some of the contributory factors being India's large  market and skilled and diversified manpower and its wide  industrial base. India's investment potential has attracted the  foreign investors attending this meet, nearly half of them  coming from major developed countries like France, Germany,  Italy, UK, and USA. The proposals to be discussed amounted  total investment of nearly $1,500 million mostly in the small  and medium scale sector. An open house question hour session  was held in the afternoon between investors and entrepreneurs on  the one side and top (?prime) representatives of the government  and apex industry organizations on the other. Headed by the  chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N.  Verma, the (?panelists) fielded questions ranging from pollution  control laws to Land Ceiling Act, shareholding rules, and the  RBI [Reserve Bank of India] regulations. It was clear at the  end of the day that the government in collaboration with UNIDO  intended to act as a promoting rather than a regulatory body.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR HAUNTS CHURCH WHERE INTRUDING GUNMAN KILLED 2  </P> <P> Monique Woods, 13, and her brother, James, 11, so dreaded their return to  church Sunday that they spent the entire night curled up in their grandmother's  bed.  </P> <P> They shuddered at the memory of the masked gunman who burst into Mt. Olive  Church of God in Christ on Friday, just minutes after they had received their  diplomas for attending a weeklong Bible class.  </P> <P> They had nightmares after witnessing the deafening shots from a sawed-off  shotgun, the bloodstains on the floor from the two people who lay dead, and the  cries from the other children, "Mommy, mommy," as they huddled under the pews  of the Southeast Los Angeles church.  </P> <P> But their grandmother, Hannah Woods, wasn't about to let them stay home.  </P> <P> "Being a church, you can't back off it," she said. "You just can't let the  church die. If you give up, it means you've been defeated by the devil."  </P> <P> So Monique put on a frilly white dress with matching bow, her brother dressed  up in a crisp pink shirt with a white tie and they took their places with 75  other people in the half-empty red velour pews of Mt. Olive.  </P> <P> A gospel choir clad in white robes sang praises, a small combo laid down a  rollicking boogie-woogie beat that made even some of the usually stoic  white-gloved ushers tap their toes and the congregants cooled themselves with  cardboard fans, supplied by a funeral home, that had printed on them: "In time  of need, we are there."  </P> <P> They prayed for Mae Lee, 76, a mother of six who had been shot in the back and  killed as she ran in right toward the bathroom.  </P> <P> They prayed for Patronella Luke, a 35-year-old soprano who had been invited to  sing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, killed by a shotgun blast to her temple.  </P> <P> And they prayed for Luke's husband, Peter, 33, a computer technician who was  wounded in the leg.  </P> <P> "They said it would make us feel better, but I don't know," Monique said. "It's  so scary. You don't know if that man might come back in."  </P> <P> Los Angeles police, who have kept guard in front of the church since the  shooting, said Sunday that they still know of no motives and have made no  arrests in connection with the attack.  </P> <P> Detectives are pursuing various theories, Sgt. Bob Riebold said, from the  possibility of a gang-related attack to the chance that the Lukes -- who were  sitting at opposite ends of the chapel -- may have been targeted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Man Sought  </P> <P> In addition to the gunman, police are seeking a second armed man who waited  outside the church.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) told the congregation that she is  donating $5,000 in conjunction with the Black Women's Forum to be used as a  reward for information leading to the capture of the assailant.  </P> <P> "I feel, along with the rest of the community, violated," Waters said. "The  church is a sanctuary that must never be violated."  </P> <P> The Rev. J.C. Brewster, pastor of Mt. Olive for 20 years, speculated that fear  had probably kept away at least half of the 200 congregants who regularly  attend Sunday services. He urged those who were there not to despair, but to  continue as "pilgrims" on a righteous path.  </P> <P> "We have to keep on keeping on," he said. "You can't stop now. You can't quit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Prophecy  </P> <P> Brewster discounted the notion that he had somehow prophesied the attack on the  Lukes Friday night when he told the couple that God was going to call on one of  them. He said he was merely trying to inspire Peter Luke, a Sunday school  teacher at the church, to continue living a devout life.  </P> <P> "He's a fine young man, very helpful," Brewster said, adding that he often  singles out individuals in the congregation. "He was just young and needed  encouragement . . . to be faithful."  </P> <P> Peter Luke, who was in stable condition Sunday recovering from the leg wound at  California Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the gunman's actions as  "cold, calculating," but said he does not think he or his wife were  specifically targeted.  </P> <P> "I saw him walk through the center aisle," Luke said. "He passed me . . . then  shot in front . . . then I saw him point the gun at me and shoot. I hit the  floor. After that, there was just screaming."  </P></p>

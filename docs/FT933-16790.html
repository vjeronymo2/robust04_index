			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Taskforce calls for system to speed share settlement A TASKFORCE backed by the Bank of England yesterday urged the adoption of a slimmed-down electronic system to speed up the settlement of equity share trading in the London stock market. At the heart of the plan is a move within the next year using existing stock exchange technology to allow share transactions to be settled 10 days after they are struck. Under the present system it takes two to three weeks to complete a transaction. By early 1995 the gap between bargains and settlement will narrow to five days, leading, eventually, to same-day payments. The system is intended to replace the London Stock Exchange's failed Taurus project which was abandoned in March after costing the exchange and the City of London up to Pounds 400m. The failure of Taurus led to the resignation of Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the stock exchange. Under the plan, announced by the Bank yesterday, proposed improvements to the present Talisman system will be replaced by the new system, to be known as Crest, in 1996. Under the plan, the exchange would no longer be the main provider of settlement services in London. At the moment it is responsible for all share dealings, which involves the physical movement of share certificates. The Bank will form a new taskforce to set firm specifications for the Crest system which will report in six to nine months. The system will differ from Taurus in several respects: Participation will be voluntary. It will not require the complete abolition of paper share certificates, an option likely to be used mostly by private investors. It will have no central depository for record keeping. Investors who want a longer settlement period will be able to negotiate that with their broker. Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England and taskforce chairman, said the proposals would not be the first choice of all market participants but they would satisfy most of them and avoid the conflicts of interest which led to the end of Taurus. The plans were cautiously welcomed by fund managers, brokers and custodians. Mr Richard Weir, director general of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, said: 'They seem to have met our greatest concerns: speed of settlement and sponsorship by the Bank of England.' Mr Kent said it had not been decided who would run the system. He did not rule out a Bank of England-run system, but said: 'If we ran it, we would do so on a commercial basis.' Under the broad outlines of the plan, investors, brokers, custodians, registrars and banks would have to become members of Crest if they wished to use its services.

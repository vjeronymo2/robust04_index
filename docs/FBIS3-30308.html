On the  contrary, they have hit the civilian population, especially in  Vojvodina, extremely hard, deprived the warring parties of equal  opportunities and caused Hungary's economy a loss of $1.3  billion. For this reason, the embargo policy needs to be  reconsidered and, if need be, a new sanctions system has to be  introduced, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Deputy  Chairman Gyorgy Csoti of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum  (HDF) told reporters in Budapest on Monday [31 January].    Csoti stressed that, despite the ensuing losses, Hungary  will  continue to observe the sanctions imposed by the international  community. He denied that Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade  has anything to do with calls for reconsidering the embargo.    "Hungary has nothing to talk about with Serbia concerning  the  embargo, nor should the lifting of sanctions be initiated by  Budapest alone," csoti added. "It is mainly a question of  effectiveness. The embargo has proven futile so far," he said.  He admitted that he has no idea what kind of a new system  should replace the present sanctions.    Csoti recalled that Hungary's association agreement with the  European Union will come into effect tomorrow, opening new  prospects for the country's development. He proposed that  Budapest immediately start preparations for becoming a  full-fledged EU member, and file its application as soon as  possible so that genuine talks can start in 1996. Csoti  considers it important for Hungary to get involved in the work  of the EU's political institutions. In addition, Hungary should  press for the Western European Union to grant a status  corresponding to associate membership for Hungary and Poland in  its June general assembly, he said.    Evaluating Hungary's relationship with neighbouring  countries, Csoti said that bilateral ties with four of Hungary's  seven neighbours are free of problems, and there are no  obstacles to the development of friendly contacts.    Unfortunately, this is not true for ties with Slovakia,  Romania and Serbia. Hungary's foreign policy towards these  states should seek historical reconciliation, he said. However,  good relations are only conceivable if ethnic minorities are  allowed to exercise their right of self-determination and their  collective rights, Csoti said. He mentioned South Tyrol and the  Swedish minority in Finland as proper examples.    Csoti pointed out that the Hungarian minorities living in  neighbouring countries have declared their efforts for autonomy  in a responsible and civilized way which is recognized by the  world public.    In Csoti's view, Hungary should always stand prepared to  hold  talks and forge agreements with its neighbours, but this policy  should not go to the minorities' detriment. "This does not mean  that Hungary gives an ultimatum to its neighbours. We only  expect Slovakia and Romania to observe the rather lenient  recommendations of the Council of Europe," Csoti said.</p>

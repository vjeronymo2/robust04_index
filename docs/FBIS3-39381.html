			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Following an interview with the London  FINANCIAL TIMES and another with the Madrid daily ABC, as well  as a speech at the meeting of the Social Democratic Party's  (PSD) national council, it seems certain that Prime Minister  Cavaco Silva will try for the third time to achieve an absolute  parliamentary majority in 1995 and remain as prime minister,  writes political analyst Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in the 31  January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. Rebelo de Sousa  attributes the prime minister's reported decision to the results  of the municipal elections--which were better than expected--to  polls indicating that an absolute majority is not impossible,  and to the signs pointing to economic recovery in Europe.  Finally, Cavaco's decision may also stem from the availability  of EU structural funds in time to stimulate the Portuguese  economy toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995.    While a third prime ministership for Cavaco Silva will  please  some, it will upset others, Rebelo de Sousa comments. First  among the latter is Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio  Guterres, whose basic strategy is predicated on the fact that  the prime minister has set his sights on the presidency, in  which case Guterres would face an opponent less formidable than  Cavaco Silva. Guterres must thus "rethink his discourse and  image" and focus on a few important issues that can withstand  the test of time until 1995. Minister of Defense Fernando  Nogueira, the government's No. 2 man, ought to be no less  concerned than Guterres, Rebelo de Sousa continues. Nogueira has  worked hard and well and gets most of the credit for the partial  victory in the municipal elections. In the debate over the  post-Cavaco Silva era that opened as early as 1992, Nogueira  emerged as the prime minister's most likely successor, a  position Rebelo de Sousa thinks would be difficult to maintain  for another six years. This would lead to the "bitter"  conclusion that Nogueira's long labors in "creating  solidarities, fostering fidelity, and patiently managing  conflicts, careers, and ambitions" will be unrewarded.    A third Cavaco term would also make some people happy,  Rebelo  de Sousa continues. On the Right, former Prime Minister and  media magnate Francisco Pinto Balsemao might decide to run for  the presidency. He would then have to decide whether to run as  an independent or under the PSD banner. Other candidates might  be Azores regional President Mota Amaral or Madeira regional  President Alberto Joao Jardim, intent on escaping "insular  claustrophobia," or even "virtual" candidate and PSD luminary  Eurico de Melo. On the Left, "there is the perennial candidate  to candidate," former President Ramalho Eanes, "if the  temptation to recoup lost time wins over a serene assessment of  the situation." Also, Lisbon Mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio  and universitarian Rui Alarcao, whose candidacy would mean a  loss for the legal field in Portugal, Rebelo de Sousa concludes.    Were Cavaco Silva to run for the presidency, abandoning the  government before the next legislative elections, President  Mario Soares would then dissolve the National Assembly, contends  the 29 January Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, citing a Soares  "confidante" as the source of the information. The paper quotes  this source as saying that Soares "will not allow Cavaco Silva  to do what Margaret Thatcher did in England, letting herself be  replaced by a John Major whose name, in this case, is Fernando  Nogueira." The president's scenario, according to EXPRESSO, is  that the present difficult situation would render unlikely an  absolute PSD majority, with the prime minister "forced" to  announce his presidential candidacy at the party's November  congress.</p>

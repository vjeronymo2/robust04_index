			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Pellerin Cezannes sell well: Saleroom SEVEN Cezannes from the collection formed by Auguste Pellerin went under the hammer at Christie's in London on Monday evening. All of them sold - one immediately after the sale - almost all at the lower end of their published estimates. Only 'L'Homme a la Pipe', the most impressive of this important but uneven group, exceeded expectations by selling for Pounds 3.52m. It is the only surviving study for the figure of the pipe-smoking spectator who features in the monumental Cardplayers series. A fiercely expressive self-portrait, which once belonged to the artist's friend, the novelist Emile Zola, tipped Pounds 1m. What was hailed as the star turn, a painting of five male bathers, fetched Pounds 3.025m. Pellerin was one of the earliest and most passionate collectors of Cezanne. Between 1895 and 1925 he amassed more than 100 works by the master - many now hang in leading museums. The sale demonstrates that there is still demand for exceptional works of art - particularly those with a distinguished provenance. It also witnesses a new discrimination among buyers. A watercolour drawing of another of Cezanne's favourite motifs, the Mont Sainte-Victoire, also sold well, realising Pounds 1.43m. A large oil and distemper 'intimiste' interior by Vuillard made Pounds 1.54m.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRET REVIEW OF NORTHROP MAY STIR FUROR;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE COMPANY SAYS AN AIR FORCE REPORT IS FAVORABLE; OTHERS TERM IT  DAMAGING. CONGRESS MAY FOCUS ON IT AT HEARINGS NEXT MONTH.  </P> <P> An intensive and still confidential Air Force review of Northrop Corp.'s  management problems, ordered by Assistant Secretary John J. Welch Jr., is  becoming the centerpiece of what is likely to be an adversarial congressional  hearing about the Los Angeles aerospace firm.  </P> <P> Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said Wednesday that the Welch review, which was  completed in July, resulted in a "very favorable" report about the company and  that he has "no quarrels" with the findings.  </P> <P> "They found some things that we could improve, but there were many things that  were very favorable," Kresa said Thursday during his first meeting with  reporters since becoming the company's chairman earlier this month.  </P> <P> But congressional investigators for Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), who plans  to call a hearing next month and subpoena Kresa, on Thursday took a  substantially different view of the Welch report.  </P> <P> "The report is one of the most damaging things I have ever seen," said a  Dingell staff member who has read it. "I don't understand how he could say it  is favorable."  </P> <P> Neither Kresa nor his congressional critics would discuss the specific findings  of the report. But a letter last June from Welch to Kresa, a copy of which was  obtained by The Times, made it clear that the review was a severe measure.  </P> <P> "The nature of the performance problems is most serious," Welch wrote to Kresa.  "I encourage your direct personal involvement in promptly correcting them."  </P> <P> In the letter, Welch told Kresa that he was "concerned about recurring program  problems the Air Force is having with Northrop. While some programs have shown  improvement in the past year, others, including Tacit Rainbow (a missile  program) and key classified programs, continue to reflect poor performance."  </P> <P> The tough language is nothing new for Northrop. In addition to criticism from  Pentagon leaders, the company has been excoriated by three congressional  committees in seven hearings since 1987. Additional hearings are pending.  </P> <P> Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee and two other House committees are  expected to hold Northrop hearings next month. If Kresa testifies, the hearing  is likely to be unusually adversarial. In earlier hearings, members of Congress  have expressed outrage at the unwillingness of Northrop executives to appear.  </P> <P> "We have to get the confidence of Congress," Kresa said Thursday. "They  (members of Congress) have been shaken by a lot of the allegations. We have to  get beyond that."  </P> <P> The congressional furor is taking a toll on Northrop and creating a major  challenge for Kresa in his new job just as he is attempting to emphasize  corporate ethics.  </P> <P> Kresa acknowledged that the company has made mistakes in the past and at one  point referred to some of those errors as "not a glorious chapter." Though he  did not explicitly criticize former Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones, the  mistakes occurred during Jones' tenure.  </P> <P> In other matters, Kresa said flight testing of the firm's advanced tactical  fighter is going well and will be completed in another month. He also said the  second B-2 Stealth bomber, which has yet to fly, is about a month behind  schedule.  </P></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Boost for opponents of BAe's Taiwan venture TAIWANESE opponents of a joint venture deal with British Aerospace to build regional jet aircraft in Taiwan scored a success yesterday when the minister sponsoring the deal said he might quit as a director of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, BAe's joint venture partner. Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said: 'It would not be bad to have a more detached position.' His statement comes a week after the resignation of Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president and the man who signed the original joint venture agreement with BAe in January 1993. Opposition politicians, who had called for Mr Yang's resignation from TAC's board, yesterday renewed their attacks on the proposed joint venture, Avro. They accused BAe of not guaranteeing technology transfer for the development of a new model, the RJX. The deal is part of BAe's strategy to improve profitability - the RJ series of aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, loses money for the company. The latest attack and Mr Yang's statement will be the backdrop to a new round of talks between BAe and Taiwan later this month. These are aimed at finalising the arrangements for the transfer to Taiwan of technology and development expertise, and outstanding legal issues. But opposition politicians and bank lenders have attacked the joint venture as politically, rather than commercially, inspired.</p>

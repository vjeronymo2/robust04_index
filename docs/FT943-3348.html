			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sued over US derivatives contracts Bankers Trust is being sued in the US over contracts that allegedly led to losses of Dollars 20m. The action is believed to be the first lawsuit brought against a derivatives dealer by one of its corporate customers. Gibson Greetings, a Cincinnati-based company, has filed a suit in the federal court alleging the US bank misled it about the risks of complicated interest rate swaps that it bought from 1992 onwards. Bankers Trust continued to maintain that the contracts were 'legal, proper and appropriate'. The bank is expected to defend itself by claiming that it had advised senior Gibson executives, including the finance director, about the risks of the transactions, both in meetings and in written communications. Gibson's contention that it had been misled by Bankers Trust first emerged in April, when it announced losses in the wake of rising US interest rates. It came after Procter &amp; Gamble had also publicly attacked the bank, though P&amp;G has yet to take any formal legal action over its allegations. In its suit, Gibson said that Bankers Trust 'did not reveal the material risks and misrepresented the nature of the transactions and thereby deceived and defrauded' the company.</p>

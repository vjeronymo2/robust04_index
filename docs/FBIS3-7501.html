Security Council [UNSC] in talks Tuesday [29 March]  with Japanese counterpart Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Ministry  officials said. The officials said Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo  on Monday for a five-day visit, told Hosokawa that Bangladesh  "strongly supports" a permanent seat for Japan on the Security  Council.    She said Bangladesh is prepared to encourage other countries  with which it has close ties to similarly support Japan to that  end. The officials said she was apparently referring to other  Islamic countries, members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),  and so-called least developed countries (LDC's).    Ziaur called for continued Japanese economic assistance and  expressed gratitude for Japan's agreement earlier in the day to  extend a 22.9 billion yen loan, including some 21.5 billion yen  for construction of a five-kilometer road-cum-rail bridge over  the Jamuna River.    The bridge, expected to serve as a vital link between the  eastern and western parts of the country, is being cofinanced by  the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, each contributing  200 million dollars.    The officials said Hosokawa urged that the Bangladeshi  Government ensure the residents of the area where the bridge is  to be constructed are treated satisfactorily. They said it is  estimated by the World Bank that 40,000 people will have to be  relocated.    A second Japanese loan, worth some 1.4 billion yen, will go  to fund a project to supply natural gas to the principal port  city of Chittagong and its surrounding area.    The pledge of the two official loans, covering fiscal 1993,  ending March 31, was formalized in an exchange of diplomatic  notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bangladesh  Finance Minister Saifur Rahman.    Japan is Bangladesh's top aid donor, providing 300 to 400  million dollars a year in financial aid and other assistance.  Foreign Ministry officials said Ziaur expressed a hope for more  Japanese investment in her country, saying the investment  environment is good and has received favorable reviews  internationally.    In response, Hosokawa announced Japan's readiness to begin  negotiations to conclude an agreement with Bangladesh on the  promotion and protection of investment.    The officials said the expressed intention of the Japanese  Government should be an important "signal" for the Japanese  private sector to go ahead and boost investment in Bangladesh.  Japan presently has concluded such agreements with only four  countries -- China, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Turkey.    In addition to the talks with Hosokawa, Ziaur is scheduled  to  meet various Japanese business leaders and deliver a speech at  an investment seminar Wednesday, they said.    In a speech at a dinner hosted by the Japanese premier,  Ziaur  urged Japan offer Bangladesh "special and differential  opportunities for market access in Japan and in securing  Japanese investments in our country." She said Bangladesh is  planning to set up a special export processing zone "for  Japanese investments alone."    Referring to the Security Council issue, Ziaur said, "The  economic miracles achieved by Japan deserve to be translated  into... (an) enhanced international political role."    "Bangladesh will continue to support the legitimate  aspirations of Japan in the United Nations," she said. "To be  more explicit, we are totally behind you in your effort to be a  permanent member of the Security Council."</p>

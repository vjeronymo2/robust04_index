			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Poles read Russian anti-Nato signals: How Warsaw sees the postponement of Chernomyrdin's visit The last-minute postponement of a long delayed visit to Warsaw by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, has been interpreted in Warsaw as confirmation that a Russian effort has begun to block new US initiatives on Nato membership for Poland. Tuesday's decision, ostensibly caused by the Polish government's failure to make amends for a recent incident when police at a Warsaw railway station beat several Russian travellers, was sudden and unexpected. Teams of experts had been in Warsaw all week preparing for the two-day visit. Mr Yuri Kashlev, the Russian ambassador, stressed in a newspaper interview yesterday the depth of Russian opposition to any expansion of Nato to the east. 'In our view, having the central European countries join Nato is not a rational option,' he said. 'We think such a development would reduce our own security.' Mr Chernomyrdin was to have signed agreements on a new gas pipeline across Poland as well as a mutual write-down of Comecon-era debts. The latter covered the Dollars 2bn and 4bn transferable roubles owed by Poland and the Dollars 330m and TRbs75bn Russian debt to Poland. The debt deal is seen as a way of wiping the slate clean of past problems and paving the way for future trade growth. Polish sales to Russia rose by 68 per cent to Dollars 623m over the first eight months of this year but remain a mere 6 per cent of its total exports. In the communist era the Soviet Union took more than a third of Polish exports. Similarly, Polish imports, at Dollars 850m, rose by 40 per cent above last year's levels but still account for only 6.5 per cent of total imports. After this year's trade growth, Russia's share in Polish trade turnover has returned to 1992 levels, but that was when the slump in mutual trade was already well established. In spite of the postponement, Mr Chernomyrdin is believed to have been keen for the visit to go ahead. He recently made the highly symbolic gesture of travelling to Katyn near Smolensk, burial site of thousands of Polish officers murdered by the NKVD, forerunner of the KGB, on Stalin's orders in 1940. He intervened to end opposition by local officials to Polish efforts to construct a cemetery for the murdered officers. The gesture showed that Mr Chernomyrdin, like President Boris Yeltsin, is keen for the two countries to put their troubled past behind them. Russia needs a friendly Poland for strategic reasons. Routing the planned gas pipeline across Belarus and Poland to Germany, for example, would avoid Ukraine, which has in the past threatened to block Russian gas sales to the west. The pipeline, whose Polish section will cost Dollars 2.5bn, will raise annual sales of Russian gas in Poland to 14bn cubic metres. Mr Chernomyrdin's visit was needed to sign a protocol confirming the commitment as well as to clarify financing arrangements. The Russian ambassador also confirmed in his interview that Russia wants Warsaw to open a new crossing point on the Polish-Belarus border which would enable Russians to travel to and from their Kaliningrad enclave without going through the Baltic states. Yesterday, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, said there could be no question of apologising for the incident at the railway station until the case had been thoroughly investigated. But the government is expected to come under pressure to conciliate Russia from local businessmen keen to see an expansion in bilateral trade.</p>

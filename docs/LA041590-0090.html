			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE  </P> <P> Can one be proud of a newspaper? Shall I tell you how delighted I am to read  the analysis of the Van de Kamp negative ad on which you reported on March 23  ("Van de Kamp to Fire on Feinstein With First Negative Ad in Race," Part A)?  </P> <P> I cannot remember reading such an outstanding analysis before -- and one which  Feinstein's staff did not have to prepare.  </P> <P> Surely, the eyes of your political writers are open wide and they are alert to  what may be the beginning of an ugly campaign.  </P> <P> Truth is an elusive element in many political campaigns -- let us hope that by  reading The Times we may find it in the coming months.  </P> <P> GLORIA SAULNEY CURTIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

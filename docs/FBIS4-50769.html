			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- China and Russia are to  hold the second meeting of the Sino-Russian Committee on  Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technological Cooperation here  from Tuesday [24 May] to Thursday.    The two sides will exchange opinions on furthering bilateral  cooperation in the four areas.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will co-chair the meeting.    China and Russia are neighbors highly complementary to each  other in terms of economy and enjoy economic and trade  cooperation in many fields, according to Geng Xuncai, deputy  director of the European Affairs Department of China's Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).    He said that bilateral economic and trade ties are  developing  rapidly, with last year's trade volume reaching 7.7 billion U.S.  dollars, an increase of 31 percent over 1992.    In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade are  diversifying with the development of barter trade, cash trade,  compensation trade, entrepot trade, leasing, project engineering  and labor services.    He said that the Chinese Government maintains an active  attitude towards the development of Sino-Russian trade and such  cooperation has a bright prospect.    In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such  as large trade corporations, the Chinese side will seize the  opportunity to press for a gradual shift from the dominant  barter trade to cash trade with involvement of all foreign trade  means.    He said that the Chinese side will continue to stress the  role of border and regional economic and trade cooperation,  further strengthening administration over such cooperation and  the standardization of commodities inspection, in a bid to  better facilitate the development of such cooperation and  two-way investment.    In scientific and technological cooperation, he said that  China hopes for extending cooperation to such high-tech fields  as aviation, space technology, medical sciences, chemical  industry and machine-building.    He added that the problem of communications constitutes an  obstacle in bilateral trade, hoping that the two countries will  make full use of land transportation, along with the proper  development of sea transportation.    He said that he believes the coming meeting will accelerate  the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.</p>

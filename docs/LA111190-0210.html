			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: SOVIETS UNLIKELY TO AVERT  STAGNATION AND INFLATION  </P> <P> Will the Soviet Union make a successful transition to a market economy?  Opinions differ and, like much else about economic changes in the Soviet Union,  a lot depends on the meaning of the words used by different people.  </P> <P> Phrases such as private property, price stability and market economy often do  not have the same meaning for Soviet officials and economists as for  Westerners. And even within the Soviet Union there are major differences.  </P> <P> It was my good fortune to be in Moscow in mid-September with the Global  Economic Action Conference while the great debate about the 500 days' reform  took place in the Soviet parliament. The issues appeared to be not only whether  radical reforms would be made or, once again, postponed, but whether the  radical reformers would come to power.  </P> <P> But this is somewhat misleading. Even the radical reformers offer a program  that is much too modest to solve the major problems of the Soviet economy. For  example, a major issue is whether there is to be private property. The  so-called radicals want to permit private ownership of land and apartments. On  closer reading, it turns out that often the meaning of private ownership is  highly restricted. Apartments and land would be sold, but only on condition  that they would not be resold -- except to the state. Because housing is  heavily subsidized, many Soviet renters see this as an attempt to reduce  subsidies, not as a way of encouraging investment and production to reduce the  chronic housing shortage.  </P> <P> The more basic problem is that major problems are not addressed adequately  either in public discussion or in the "radical" proposals.  </P> <P> One is the problem of repressed inflation, which appears to be getting worse.  This is the problem of stabilizing a properly constructed general or average  price level.  </P> <P> Second is the problem of achieving commodity prices that are related to costs  of production and consumer or producer demands. Here the problem is to get not  stability but flexibility of individual prices, many of which have been  unchanged for decades.  </P> <P> Third is encouragement of competition. There are many ways in which competition  could be increased. One of the most effective steps would be to permit imports  and allow convertibility of the ruble.  </P> <P> There is much talk about developing a market economy, but at the highest levels  there seems to be little awareness of what is involved. Internal discussion  does not recognize that there are successful and unsuccessful market economies,  or why some succeed. In contrast with such relatively successful economies as  the United States, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there is Argentina or  Brazil, where competition is limited and where inflation and hyper-inflation  distort decisions and impede progress toward efficiency and higher living  standards.  </P> <P> My impression is that even if the radical reform proposals are adopted, the  Soviet economy is more likely to reach an "Argentine solution" than to achieve  stable prices and growth. There are several ominous signs.  </P> <P> The budget deficit is estimated at 15% to 20% of gross national product. No one  can be very precise, since neither GNP nor the budget is calculated reliably.  But many estimates lie in this range. Aside from defense, much of the spending  goes for subsidies to producers and consumers. The only program for removing  some of these subsidies calls for higher prices that would reduce living  standards. But closing, or substantially reducing, the budget deficit would  require substantial cuts in living standards and unemployment. The reformers  are cautious about reducing subsidies.  </P> <P> Since there is no capital market and very little saving to finance the deficit,  most is financed by printing rubles. Unofficial estimates put inflation at 20%  this year and money growth at 25% to 30% and rising. With output falling, it  will be hard to hold inflation at current levels without major reductions in  spending and subsidies.  </P> <P> There are signs that a flight from money has started. The government has  devalued the tourist ruble to about 17 cents, 10% of its official value. On the  black market that thrives in the large cities, the ruble sells for about  one-third of the tourist rate (or less), about 3% of the official rate.  </P> <P> Most taxi drivers refuse to accept the ruble; their business is done in  cigarettes, dollars and other convertible currency. Street vendors sell  watches, army binoculars and other goods only for hard currency. This illegal  activity is widespread in Moscow, and I found it in areas as remote as  Uzbekistan in Soviet Central Asia.  </P> <P> The current inflation is more damaging because it is repressed, not open. Since  prices remain controlled, goods disappear from the established markets to  reappear in the black markets. This longtime feature of the Soviet economy has  become more widespread. Goods must be hunted down, and many can be purchased  only on the black market.  </P> <P> With wages controlled, living standards fall, adding to the widespread  discontent. Freeing prices without introducing competition, which at first must  come mainly from abroad, will not move the economy toward a rational system.  There is no relation between prices, costs of production and demand. The  proposals for reform do not deal with this central problem of establishing not  just markets but competitive markets.  </P> <P> The command economy no longer functions as it once did. The crops were good  this year, possibly a record. But the harvest is poor. In the past, people  would be ordered into the fields to collect the harvest. That method is no  longer as widely used, and it has not been replaced by a functioning price  system. So, much of the crop will rot in the field, and food will be scarce  this winter.  </P> <P> When money does not buy goods, it loses its value and its ability to motivate  people to work and produce. The Soviet Union has not reached that condition,  but it seems headed in that direction. None of the debates taking place in  Moscow seemed designed to reverse course.  </P> <P> As we left Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked of taking control and  ruling by decree, and soon after he did so. Given his record of vacillation and  error in economic policy, that is not a promising development. The "Argentine  solution" may be postponed by this decision, but the Soviet Union is unlikely  to prevent the drift toward stagnation and rapid inflation that appears to be  gaining momentum.  </P></p>

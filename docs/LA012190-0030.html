			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 GIPSY KINGS "MOSAIQUE" ELEKTRA  </P> <P> The Gipsy Kings' surprise U.S. success last year held a delicate balance  between novelty and legitimate inter-cultural phenomenon: real French/Spanish  Gypsies doing a modernized version of real Gypsy music in Andalusian Spanish.  On its second U.S. release, the group wisely avoids playing up the novelty  aspect.  </P> <P> Save for a rather horrid version of "Volare" (apparently a sequel to last  year's much better Gipsification of "My Way"), this is a pretty straight  rendering of the sexy style the band has developed, with no obvious compromises  or panderings to its new American audience. But as such, it's too much of a  repeat of the U.S. debut. The arrangements are a little fuller, but don't  really move in any new direction (and don't catch fire as the band can in  concert). Only the Andalusian-rooted "Viento Del Arena" stands out as a new  twist. For the rest of it, unfortunately, once may be enough. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift ahead of long weekend LONDON SHARES drifted lower in quiet trading as investors and marketmakers avoided risks ahead of the holiday weekend. The mood was subdued as the market acknowledged that the local elections results were discomforting for the Conservative Party. A modest overnight rise in New York inspired no one. On the opening of the new session, Wall Street lost ground as US employment figures indicated there was little pressure for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further in the short term. UK equity strategists varied from the cautious to the pessimistic. Mr John Reynolds County NatWest argued that since the swing away from the Conservatives was only partly towards the opposition Labour Party, the disappointment of the results was cushioned. He pointed to a limited fall in the share prices and sterling's resilience as evidence: 'there is scope for one per cent off interest rates over the next few months,' he said. A half percentage point is already discounted in the money markets. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull had a different interpretation of the polls. He said that the results had been 'the worst possible' for the market. Support for the centrist Liberal Democrats raised the prospect of a hung parliament and associated uncertainties. He also thought that the Conservative government would have to wait until 1992 before calling an election - unemployment would be rising too quickly in the autumn. There were dangers, too, of political interest rates cuts that would reap only small electoral benefits. Mr Harnett added that the danger period for shares was the next few days of trading. If the market survived next week at current levels it could then rise quickly. Chartists elsewhere agreed, saying that although the fundamentals were negative, the market was 'behaving as if it had upside potential'. Faced with such diversity, investors did little. The Footsie index spent the entire day just inside negative territory. There was little trade to persuade marketmakers to change their prices and the index moved in a narrow range before ending 1.9 above the day's low at 2522.7. The net fall was 8 and turnover an unspectacular 452.7m shares. The dollar's late recovery, gaining more than two cents against sterling, helped international stocks. Wellcome again the among the best performers as upbeat press and analysts' comment followed the Thursda's results. Gilts opened a little easier on worries that sterling could weaken after the polls. They soon rallied only to lose ground when US bonds fell on the US employment figures. Gilts ended up to  1/4 point off. Caution ahead of local polls meant low volume. Bid talk helped levels on Thursday, but funds were disinclined to commit much cash ahead of next set of inflation data.</p>

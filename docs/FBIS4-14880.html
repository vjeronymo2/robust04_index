			<p>BFN     [Text] The Czech Republic's Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has  said that the former economic cooperation between his country  and Russia has become a thing of the past.    Addressing students of the Russian Government's Finance  Academy in Moscow on Monday, he voiced doubt that his country  would act toward any East European economic integration. "We  favor a free market with our partners in Poland and Hungary, and  in this sense are open to East and West alike."    He reported that at a meeting with Russia's Premier  Chernomyrdin on Tuesday he would sign a treaty on mutual  investment guarantees and one of the topics for discussion with  Chernomyrdin will be Russia's debt to Czech enterprises.    In his speech before academy students, Klaus focused on the  consistence with which his cabinet had proceeded from the  administrative command economy to a market-oriented economy. As  a result, the Czech kron has for 40 months now been a model of  stability not only for the post-communist states but also for  some western democracies. He pointed out that the Czech  Republic, unlike neighboring East European countries, is trying  hard to halt relentless western investment.    He claimed that the transition to a market economy should  start primarily with macroeconomic transformations and a  deficit-free budget. "There must be a man who can say "no"  without fear of attack from the opposition and newspaper  lampooning but who should be in close touch with society through  the press," Klaus said. He described as a delusion the desire  to attract western capital by all kinds of privileges. There is  nothing more important for a government in a transitional  period, according to Klaus, than to pave the way for economic  recovery by curbing inflation, liberalizing prices and foreign  trade, and privatizing property as soon as possible.    Klaus is paying an official visit to Russia.</p>

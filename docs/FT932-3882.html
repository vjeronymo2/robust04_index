			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shares in 3M tumble as profit forecast is cut 3M, the Minnesota-based adhesives manufacturer said that a slowdown in US sales would result in lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The revised second-quarter outlook hit 3M stock hard with the shares down Dollars 10 to close on Wall Street at Dollars 105 3/4 . 3M is one of the 30 Dow stocks. The company's news was seen by some analysts as a sign of renewed weakness in the US economy. '3M's products are sold to a very broad base of industry,' said Mr. Alex Henderson, a securities analyst for Prudential Securities. In the prepared announcement, Mr L. D. DeSimone, 3M chairman, said: 'Reflecting what appears to be a slowing of the US economy, a majority of our businesses have experienced slower US growth so far this quarter.' He said 3M still expects to have second-quarter earnings above the Dollars 317m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, seen a year ago, but the gain will be less than the company had expected. Before the announcement, securities analysts had forecast second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.55 to Dollars 1.65 per share. That range has now been revised downward to Dollars 1.40 to Dollars 1.50. 3M is due to release its results for the second quarter on July 30.</p>

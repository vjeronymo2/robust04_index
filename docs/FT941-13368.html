			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Milk board pressed on farm deals The government is pressing the Milk Marketing Board to allow dairy farmers to revoke contracts they have signed with its planned successor body, Milk Marque, in the light of changes the board has made to its reorganisation plans. The board said yesterday it would consider the matter once the government had approved the revised proposals, although it argued that it was under 'no legal compunction' to do so. The board has dropped proposals to transfer the bulk of its assets to the new farmers' co-operative and offered concessions to the dairy trade on its milk-selling system in response to government concern that Milk Marque might be anti-competitive. Negotiations with agriculture ministry officials over the changes have forced it to delay liberalisation of the Pounds 3.3bn milk market from April to November. The board now plans to float up to 49 per cent of its processing subsidiary Dairy Crest, more than originally planned, to create a viable asset base for Milk Marque in the absence of Genus, the cattle breeding service, and National Milk Records, which are to be hived off. Mr Peter Morgan, the board's head of corporate affairs, said the changes had not compromised 'the core essentials in what we're proposing for Milk Marque'. He added: 'Our legal advice is that the contracts are perfectly valid. Those that signed with Milk Marque did so voluntarily.' He acknowledged, however, that the ministry wanted to ensure farmers were content with the contracts they had signed. 'We don't have a problem with that. We wouldn't want to keep people in against their will,' he said. 'It's an issue we have discussed with the ministry. We'll take a view after the scheme has been approved.' The government is understood to be concerned that producers came under pressure to sign contracts with Milk Marque late last year before knowing the final shape of the reorganisation scheme. Nearly half the 28,500 dairy farmers in England and Wales have already signed up. The board has agreed to ease penalties against farmers who give less than 12 months' notice to terminate their contracts. Farmers who give three to six months' notice will still forfeit 2 per cent of their previous year's milk production. But the penalty will be reduced if they agree to give more notice. Mr Morgan said the board had not decided exactly how much more of Dairy Crest to float in July, but majority ownership would remain in farmers' hands. The original plan was to sell off 25 per cent to 35 per cent. The board aims to increase Milk Marque's working capital to Pounds 34.2m from Pounds 26.7m under the earlier plan.</p>

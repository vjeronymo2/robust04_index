Today they are still there, with Alan working as a courier and Tish bringing in more money from her job in a City optician's.

Yes really. But don't worry, The Negotiator is no ordinary policeman, gosh no. How about this for novelty: Charlie King uses unorthodox methods but his superiors overlook it because he gets results.

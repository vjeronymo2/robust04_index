Armitage for the Army, Undersecretary  H. Lawrence Garrett III for the Navy and Donald B. Rice of the Rand Corp. for  the Air Force -- defense officials said. Armitage and Garrett are veteran  government bureaucrats while Rice is a former government official who has  stayed in contact with the bureaucracy as a defense specialist at RAND, the  Washington Post reported. The three must still be formally nominated, then  confirmed by the Senate, before assuming their duties.  </P></p>

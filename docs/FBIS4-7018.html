			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Kim Hyon-chun,  chairman of the South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon), at a recent press conference expressed  the resolve of his federation to win in its confrontation with  the pro-U.S. traitorous "government," a South Korean newspaper  reported.    Noting that "Hanchongnyon at its congress of second-term  representatives early this month branded the Kim Yong-sam regime  as a pro-U.S. traitorous regime," Kim Hyon-chun said: "We will  unite all people including the one million students under the  slogan of independence, democracy and reunification and lay a  foothold for victory in our confrontation with the Kim Yong-sam  regime."</p>

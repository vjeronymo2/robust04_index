			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] candidate for  the presidency of the Republic, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, was  once again defeated last night -- this time by omission -- by  the party's Executive Board. The national congressional bloc did  not obtain authorization to participate in the constitutional  revision process. In the meeting, Lula defended the idea of an  autonomous position that would have given the party bloc the  power to define a framework for participation with the contras  [groups opposed to the revision] and decide on which points  legislators could vote. But Lula did not even vote. He left  before the meeting ended. Had he stayed and voted, the picture  would have changed because the final vote ended up in a tie of  eight votes for, eight against, and one abstention.    The tie left in effect a previous national Executive Board  decision limiting the party bloc's participation to voting on  the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) and attending negotiations on a  maximum agenda to make sure that the revision ends by 15 May.    "The tense climate between the Executive Board and the party  congressional bloc remains intact," PT Secretary General  Gilberto Carvalho said, admitting to being surprised by the new  impasse.    Deputy Jose Genoino (SP [Sao Paulo]) said the result is a  disaster for the negotiations between party bloc members and the  contras.    "They (contras) need to know whether they can count on our  votes or not. Without a decision on this point the negotiation  cannot progress," Genoino complained, adding that the decision  will continue "tearing" the party bloc.    Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), congressional party bloc vice  president, recognized that the difficulties for negotiations  with the contras have increased, but said yesterday's tie shows  that Lula's intervention has already helped change the internal  crisis.    "We started losing by 15 to nil on this question. Then we  lost by 15 to four, and now we got a tie," Eduardo Jorge said.    Lula also was defeated on the discussion of controversial  items in the PT government platform. In order to please radicals  and moderates, the moratorium stopped being explicitly mentioned  as the path to negotiate the foreign debt, but it stayed  camouflaged under a new definition defending the right of the  future government to resort to a suspension of payments if  creditors are inflexible.    Lula did not vote on this issue either. He left a message  saying: "My position is to the left of the proposed draft."  Federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), his economic adviser,  not only voted in favor of the proposal but also spoke for it.  State Deputy Ruy Falcao, who leads the radicals, said he finds  no difference between a suspension of payments and a moratorium.    Lula also lost in the vote on Senator Eduardo Suplicy's (SP)  minimum income proposal. The proposal, which would have been the  basic item in the PT income redistribution program, was defeated  by eight votes to seven, with four abstentions, obtained by the  party economists' proposal.    The board also discussed the issue of the Armed Forces and  approved a new draft where support for the Armed Forces'  modernization prevails, but without making reference to military  projects.  <H5>  Criticism </H5>   Lula criticized President Itamar Franco for his remarks  supporting the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso.    "As a citizen, Franco has the right to support any ticket of  his liking, but as a president he has other responsibilities and  needs to govern the country."    Lula then minimized the effect of Franco's remarks.    "The president is not wholly behind that ball; he was burned  a little already."</p>

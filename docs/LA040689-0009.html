			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA PETITIONS NLRB FOR REMOVAL OF PICKETS  </P> <P> Facing the possible loss of "hundreds of thousands of dollars," the San Diego  Opera on Wednesday sought to remove a picket line from the Civic Theatre by  filing a charge of unlawful labor practices against the pickets' union with the  National Labor Relations Board.  </P> <P> The opera stated in a news release that the union -- Makeup Artists and Hair  Stylists Local 706, International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees --  unlawfully established a picket line Monday because it "never represented a  majority of the opera's employees.  </P> <P> "The opera would commit an unfair labor practice if it recognized Local 706  prior to the union being chosen by a majority of the makeup artists and hair  stylists to be their representative."  </P> <P> Union stagehands, electricians and wardrobe workers have refused to cross the  picket line, preventing the unloading of "Madama Butterfly" scenery and  scheduled costume fittings for the opera's cast. Also, Local 325, the American  Federation of Musicians, announced Tuesday that the picket line was sanctioned  and notified musicians in the opera orchestra that they may legally refuse to  cross the line for opera rehearsals and performances.  </P> <P> A Saturday recital by mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne at the Civic Theatre is  endangered by the pickets as well as four virtually sold-out performances of  "Madama Butterfly." A series of four subscription concerts and one other  performance of the opera are to begin April 15 at Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> Local 706 filed a petition with the NLRB Jan. 5, alleging unfair labor  practices by the opera. That petition alleges that the opera unlawfully ordered  the members of its wig and makeup department on Dec. 15 to return season  contracts before they could accept or reject the contracts.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the NLRB filed a request for a temporary injunction against the  opera to force the opera to again offer the contracts to the musicians.  </P> <P> Wednesday's action by the opera was designed "to force some action," opera  spokeswoman Brenda Hughes said.  </P></p>

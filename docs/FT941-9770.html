			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK markets The virtuous circle of a rising equity market linked to higher gilts and sterling was well and truly broken this week. Thanks to the Federal Reserve tightening and the UK authorities' fumbled presentation of Tuesday's rate cut the sparkle has gone out of all three markets at once. Yet if the circle cannot be mended, the markets need not continue to feed off each other's fall. Equities should reap some benefit from the weaker currency, which will be useful in the light of yesterday's trade figures showing lower export volumes. Much depends on whether earnings and dividend growth is sufficient to support share prices. It is too early in the results season to draw any firm conclusions, though dividend increases from Reuters and Lloyds Bank of 23 and 20 per cent respectively offer some encouragement. Gilts may have a harder time, especially if US bonds refuse to settle down. Indeed the Bank of England seems defiant in planning an auction with a maturity of up to 10 years. Perhaps it believes foreign buyers will return, but its announcement left open the option of a six-year issue if they do not.</p>

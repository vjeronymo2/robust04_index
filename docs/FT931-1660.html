			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo is disappointing GERMAN futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank disappointed dealers by announcing a variable rate repurchase agreement in its weekly money market operations, writes James Blitz. For several months, the Bundesbank has been trying to wean the market away from thinking that policy is being eased mainly through alterations in its officially posted rates. There has been a strong focus on the repo rate, which the Bundesbank uses to provide short dated funds to commercial banks. There had been a strong expectation that the repo rate would be cut below 8.25 per cent this week. Instead, the Bundesbank yesterday announced a variable rate tender, which means banks must offer competitive rates for wholesale funds today. Dealers believed last night that the lowest accepted bid today could be well above 8.25 per cent because of strong competition for funds. According to Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London, banks are particularly anxious to comply with the new minimum reserve requirements at the end of this month, which is why cash rates are currently tight in Germany. Call money rose as high as 8.75 per cent yesterday, close to the Lombard rate ceiling of 9.00 per cent, before falling back to 8.58 per cent. The Bundesbank might counter a rise in the repo rate by adding funds. Yesterday, it pumped a large amount of liquidity into the market via currency swaps and section 17 funds. But the tight conditions dampened sentiment, with the June Euromark contract falling back 19 basis points from its opening level, to close at 92.87. At this level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 7.13 per cent, some 71 basis points below yesterday's cash level. The contract was some 37 basis points down from last Tuesday's price, showing how much expectations have been revised. Short sterling futures yesterday retraced Monday's losses, in spite of a sell-off of sterling on the currency markets. The June contract was up 5 basis points at one stage, at 94.17, but later closed unchanged at 94.12. Three-month money closed  1/16 per cent higher at 6 1/8 per cent. The view prevails that base rates will stay at 6 per cent in the medium term.</p>

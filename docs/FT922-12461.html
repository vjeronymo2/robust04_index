			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: ING may take 15% stake in BBL INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, is holding talks on acquiring all or part of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert's (GBL) stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second-biggest bank, as part of a strategy of creating a second 'home' market south of the Dutch border. If it succeeds in buying GBL's direct stake of nearly 15 per cent, ING - which already owns roughly 9 per cent of the Belgian bank - will become BBL's single largest shareholder. Besides its direct stake in BBL, GBL also has close relations with two other main shareholders, Royale Belge and its French parent Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), which together hold more than 10 per cent of the Belgian bank's shares. Mr Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, ING's vice-chairman, said he expected the negotiations with GBL to take some time. He added that ING had no plans to launch a public bid for the rest of BBL's shares, citing 'psychological' obstacles in Belgium to an outright Dutch takeover. ING, which was formed last year through the merger of Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank, said it would seek to form an exclusive banking partnership with BBL. After an extensive courtship by several of its biggest insurance industry shareholders, BBL told ING, Royale Belge and Winterthur of Switzerland last month that they would all be entitled to work with it in expanding in the field of insurance. Earlier, BBL had been presented with two rival insurance proposals, one from ING and the other from Royal Belge and Winterthur. ING is having to tread carefully in its attempt to become BBL's most powerful shareholder, partly because of the delicate relations between the Flemish and French-speaking parts of Belgium's financial community. BBL's institutional shareholders, which together own more than 50 per cent of the bank's capital, have a long-standing pledge to notify each other if they plan to buy or sell additional shares. On Thursday, ING reported a 4.2 per cent increase in 1991 net profit to Fl 1.57bn (Dollars 840m). The modest profit rise was due partly to reduced losses at ING's Orion subsidiary in London, and to growth in foreign lending, leasing and trading in Third World debt. For 1992, ING is forecasting that net profit will at least match 1991 results.</p>

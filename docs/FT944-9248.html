			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais offshoot withdraws from UK banking The retrenchment of Credit Lyonnais, the lossmaking French bank, has led to one of its subsidiaries withdrawing from the UK. Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, a Rotterdam-based unit, has agreed to sell its two branches in London and Manchester and about Pounds 100m of assets, more than half of the UK loan book. The purchaser is Singer &amp; Friedlander, the UK merchant bank, which is seeking to develop its operations in Manchester and in trade finance. 'It is a nice extension to what we are doing and should produce a modest improvement in our profitability,' Singer &amp; Friedlander said. Offices in the UK were only peripherally involved in CLBN's most spectacular loss, on a Dollars 888m (Pounds 541m) loan to Mr Giancarlo Parretti to buy the MGM film studio. CLBN said most of its loans were performing and its performance bettered that of the UK clearing banks. Singer has nevertheless refused to take on a significant portion of CLBN's UK portfolio. Credit Lyonnais itself recently experienced a setback in the UK when Health Care International, operator of a luxury hospital in Glasgow, went into receivership after borrowing Pounds 30m from it. CLBN's contraction mirrors that of its parent, which recently announced the withdrawal from UK retail banking and the closure of half of its corporate banking branches. Credit Lyonnais has one of the largest pan-European branch networks and the new management has indicated no wholesale withdrawal. However, reviews have been ordered into operations in Belgium, Spain and Italy.</p>

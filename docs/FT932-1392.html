			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Australians angry over US dumping levies DIRECTORS of BHP, the Australian steel and resources group, said yesterday the company would continue vigorously to defend its markets following the imposition of dumping duties on its steel products in the US, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The action, announced by the US Department of Commerce on Tuesday, has imposed a tariff of almost 25 per cent on certain BHP steel products. 'BHP supplies unique corrosion-resistant steel products to US markets which it has developed and to markets which have not traditionally been attractive to US steel makers. The tonnages involved cannot have caused injury to the US domestic market.' The BHP statement said the dumping margin announced affected only corrosion-resistant products which accounted for annual exports of about 135,000 tonnes. This amount would not significantly affect BHP's total annual steel exports, around 2.4m tonnes. The Australian minister for trade, Mr Peter Cook, said the company had not acted improperly and had a strong case to overturn the imposition of a dumping margin.</p>

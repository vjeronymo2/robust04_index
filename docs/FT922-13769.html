			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Hughes to head GM in Europe GENERAL Motors of the US has moved quickly to fill the management vacuum at its European operations with the appointment of Mr Louis Hughes as president of General Motors Europe. The promotion of Mr Hughes from his post as chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, follows the surprise appointment last month of Mr Robert Eaton as chairman-elect of Chrysler, the third largest of the big three US vehicle makers. Mr Eaton will succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman and chief executive of Chrysler at the end of the year. Although educated as a mechanical engineer Mr Hughes, 43, has enjoyed a rapid rise through the finance hierarchy of the world's biggest car maker. Before becoming chairman and managing director of Opel in April 1989, he held successive posts as finance vice-president of GM of Canada and then GM Europe. He was previously assistant treasurer in the US with general responsibility for international activities involving financing and new business ventures and played a key role in GM's negotiations with Toyota to set up a manufacturing joint venture in Fremont, California, in the early 1980s. As president of GM Europe Mr Hughes is taking over the leadership of probably the most profitable volume car maker in Europe and the most successful part of GM's troubled automotive operations. While GM worldwide made a net loss of Dollars 4.5bn last year, GM Europe, with a workforce of 128,000, achieved a net profit of Dollars 1.76bn last year on a turnover of Dollars 25.4bn. GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall operations produced a record net profit of Dollars 1.96bn. GM, whose US management hierarchy has been thrown into turmoil this week by board changes which have effectively limited the power of Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, and have demoted his chief lieutenant Mr Lloyd Reuss, is vitally dependent on its European operations as it seeks to staunch massive losses in North America. As chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, Mr Hughes, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio, has taken pains to assimilate himself into the higher echelons of the European motor industry. He has learned German well enough to use it as his everyday business language at Opel's headquarters at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. His presence in the inner circles of German business has been helped by the high profile role GM is playing in investment in eastern Germany with the building of a 150,000 cars-a-year assembly plant at Eisenach, close to the site of the old East German Wartburg factory. At GM Europe he will have overall responsibility for continuing the group's effort to increase its production capacity by 25 per cent by the mid-1990s in the face of mounting Japanese competition. Mr Hughes will lead the company's vital new product programme - a key to its recent success - with the launch next year of the new generation Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova small car range. GM Europe is also committed to an ambitious expansion in eastern Europe, not only with the Eisenach plant but also with important projects in Poland and Hungary. At Opel Mr Hughes has been closely identified with GM Europe's efforts to introduce so-called 'lean production' techniques, and with the Eisenach plant GM is seeking to reach levels of productivity and efficiency to match some of the best Japanese car makers.</p>

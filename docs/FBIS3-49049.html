			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with unnamed expert close to the secret service </F> by Attila Schmidt; place and date not given: "Who Is a Spy And  Who Is Not -- Even the CIA Was Unable To Look Into the Files of  Our Agents"]    [Text] Spying is one of the most ancient occupations. It  was originally called reconnaissance, and this name is still  used because the military secret services like to call  themselves reconnaissance units. The difference between  intelligence [hirszerzes] and reconnaissance [felderites] in the  classical sense is that reconnaissance is mainly the visual  acquisition of information while intelligence is infiltrating  enemy organizations through agents and technical means, said an  expert who claims to be close to the secret service but who did  not wish to name himself, when we interviewed him on this  special activity.    [Schmidt] What is the correct term, intelligence or spying?    [Expert] This depends on the angle of the view. Throughout  the world, every secret service calls its offensive body an  intelligence service while the enemy's is a spy organization.  When we are doing it, we are gathering information, and when  the enemy does it, it is spying.    [Schmidt] Do all countries maintain an intelligence service?    [Expert] All states that consider themselves worth anything  use intelligence agents, because it is a vital interest of all  powers to learn about the political, economic, and military  secrets of their enemies. However, the medium and small  countries only maintain military reconnaissance or intelligence,  but the activities of these also extend to civil areas.  Naturally, the situation is different in the case of a  superpower like the United States. Here, in addition to the  CIA, all branches of the military practice active intelligence  work.    [Schmidt] Does the Hungarian secret service operate in both  directions?    [Expert] Yes, the two organizations are called the military  and the civil information offices.    [Schmidt] Can it be expected that, after the new elections,  the personnel of the secret service or the direction of  reconnaissance will change?    [Expert] Fundamental changes will probably not take place  after the change of the government, although it cannot be  excluded that some of the leaders will be replaced, which is  certainly not a sensible thing to do. Intelligence should be  treated as a professional, rather than a political, organization.    [Schmidt] Was the intelligence service also "decimated"  after the change of the regime?    [Expert] Some experienced intelligence agents were removed  from their positions, but the clear-out was not as big as at the  National Security Office.    [Schmidt] Have the directions of intelligence work changed?    [Expert] Essentially, they have. The former enemy turned  into a friend and the former friend has turned into a suspicious  country that is to be observed. Therefore, everything has to be  done the same way as before, only in different directions.    [Schmidt] Do the friends spy on each other?    [Expert] Friendship and the hunger for information are two  different things. Although we and many other countries have  rather good relations with the United States, the CIA, as a  global intelligence service, is active in all parts of the  world, including Hungary.    [Schmidt] Are all military attaches intelligence agents at  the same time?    [Expert] At any rate, it is the task of all military  attaches to learn as much as possible about the army and the  military secrets of the receiving country. For this reason, out  of politeness, the receiving countries invite them to military  exercises where they can learn about the armament, equipment,  and certain secrets of the army. This is done on a reciprocal  basis. The goal of this can be disinformation.    [Schmidt] What does "dark" information gathering mean?    [Expert] When for example an intelligence agent "disguised"  as a diplomat gets to know some important person in the  receiving country and acquires information from him in the  course of a conversation, without the person knowing that he is  giving information to a spy.    [Schmidt] Does the intelligence service recruit its agents  through pressure?    [Expert] Yes and no. It is best if, for some reason, the  chosen candidate voluntarily accepts to cooperate.    [Schmidt] How much money is normally given to an agent?    [Expert] This depends on the agent. It mainly depends on  the financial and work position of the person. If someone earns  $100,000 then he cannot be given $5,000. The amount has to be  proportionate to the value of the information and the level of  risk.    [Schmidt] After the change of the regime, did the CIA  receive the list of our agents working abroad?    [Expert] Naturally, it did not. A single ill-considered  step like this could mean the end of the intelligence service.  The United States understood this and only asked for the  material that we had given to the KGB. We did not fulfill this  request, either, because they could have derived the names of  the agents on the basis of this.    [Schmidt] Did the KGB conduct intelligence work against us?    [Expert] I am certain that it did not, because we did not  have any secrets from them, all data was officially open to  them. To prove that they did not have any agents here, when the  Soviet troop withdrawals began from Hungary, we received many  indications that they were hastily trying to meet this need.  They were trying to enlist people. Probably without much  success.    [Schmidt] Have you ever been approached?    [Expert] I have, a number of times. It was an interesting  case when I was trying to enlist a South American diplomat and,  during the conversation, it became clear that he had also met me  in the very elegant restaurant with the intent of enlisting  me....</p>

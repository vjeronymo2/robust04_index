			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, the government passed the proposal of the  law on the 1994 budget and its realization, which the State  Chamber is supposed to pass by the end of March at the latest.  Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari presented it at a news  conference. Suzana Kos reports:    [Begin Kos recording] At today's session, the government  finally passed the 1994 budget. The treasury will amount to 402  billion tolars, while the deficit is supposed to be 8.9 billion  tolars.    The greatest portion of the funds in the treasury -- 373  billion tolars -- will, of course, come from taxes, while 20  billion will come from non-tax sources.    The obligations from this year's budget will be 348 billion  tolars, while 52 billion will be intended for various  investments. Officially, the budget document will reach  parliament tomorrow. Next week, the government is also supposed  to send a document on the public deficit of the Republic of  Slovenia and a report on the financial rehabilitation of  commercial banks.    Let me quote some other budget figures. The Finance  Ministry has the greatest share in budgetary expenditure,  amounting to 92 billion tolars. This figure comprises the  obligations of the state toward the Pensions' and Disability  Fund, the Agency for Construction of Highways, and toward  foreign counties. The second greatest share of 86 billion  tolars will go to the Labor Ministry, followed by the Defense  Ministry, the Ministry of Justice, and other departments.    The government was supposed to discuss the problems  surrounding our debt to commercial banks again today. However,  because Defense Minister Jansa put forward a sort of document at  the session, that is to say, proposed new conclusions to resolve  this issue, the government will discuss this topic again next  week, when it will also study Minister Jansa's new proposals.    It is interesting to note that the finance minister did not  wish to answer when he was asked whether a repeated debate and  confirmation of already agreed conclusions regarding debts  toward the commercial banks is really necessary.

Taiwan  University political science professor Chao Yung-mao has spent  close to 10 years studying the phenomenon of criminal-influenced  politics and its relationship to local and regional political  factions. In a special interview granted this newspaper, he  analyzed the situation by pointing out that the Yun-lin case is  a symptom of Taiwan's regional politics "festering" at the core  and that it is entering a criminal democracy period in which  "local government is dominated by criminal politics" with all  the trappings of an "Asian Sicily"; we should therefore consider  this a wake-up call and treat the situation seriously. The  following is the gist of Professor Chao Yung-mao's interview.    Judging from the data available to me, Taiwan today carries  on a close relationship with criminal politics, most directly  through members of a legislative assembly who came out of  criminal politics and make up as much as 50 percent of its  membership. This type of environment is very frightening because  the linkage between criminal forces and local politics is  extremely close which enables them to "divide the spoils on the  spot" whether over the budget, administration or letting of  municipal contracts, and this will impact on the quality and  allocation of public services in local government.    As for the Yun-lin County incident, one can analyze it from  three different perspectives to gain some understanding of the  background and origin of criminal political influences: First,  criminal politics thrive on receiving and granting of favors and  settling disputes among enterprises and over spheres of  influence controlled by the criminal forces themselves. Second,  criminal politics have grown and evolved over time from the  "societal model" in the 1950-60s, when they depended on  blackmail, extortion, taking a cut on gambling winnings and  operating prostitution and gambling activities to maintain their  existence, to gradually changing to the "economic model" in the  1970s when Taiwan became developed economically and democratized  politically and the new environment required the protection of  politicians in power, and in this period the criminal  enterprises began to restructure and became regional or publicly  owned enterprises. Under these circumstances, the relationship  between criminal forces and local political factions grew even  closer and produced the situation in which the former would  throw their support to certain factions or choose sides. At the  same time, favors and grievances which one political faction may  have vis-a-vis another would affect the interests of the  criminal forces, so when such conflicts occurred, the criminal  forces behind the various factions would come out to settle the  disputes in behalf of their sponsors, and the atmosphere would  become especially charged when elections are involved, and this  threatens the fairness and safety of the electoral process  itself. Third, the actual battleground of criminal forces is the  elections not of the county magistrates, but the next generation  of county assemblymen; therefore, the situation we see today is  only the first shot leading to the next battle, for the criminal  forces are now only getting the candidates of their factions  ready for the next election. Analyzed from the above-mentioned  second and third factors, local politics and criminal politics  are already intimately intertwined. If local political power  comes from the county assemblymen, village chiefs and township  mayors who all owed their political start to criminal forces, it  would be difficult to say that criminal politics would not  continue to develop and extend its reach to the provincial  assemblymen and people's representatives in the national  legislature, and this will certainly interfere with the goal of  achieving honest government in national political development.  If criminal forces and politics were too closely tied together,  it would lead to even more severe "political struggle,"  particularly after criminal politics has monopolized local  political power for a long period of time; this would compound  the difficulties for any party in power to undertake any local  political reforms.

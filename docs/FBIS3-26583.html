			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Zhide (2612 3112 1795): "Prospects for </F> Cross-Strait Cooperation in Science and Technology Are Bright --  Interview With the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,  CAS, Zhou Guangzhao"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the CAS and a famous scientist who just returned  from an exchange visit to Taiwan, said in a recent interview  with this reporter: The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have  their own strong points in scientific research and industrial  technology development. Enhancing and quickening cross-strait  exchanges and cooperation in science and technology will be  conducive to the economies and scientific and technological  development of both sides. This tendency is irresistible and  its prospects are bright.    Leading a delegation to attend the "1994 Cross-Strait  Conference on Technologies of the Steel and Material  Industries," Zhou Guangzhao arrived in Taibei [Taipei] on 17  January. Others who attended this conference included several  well-known scientists from the CAS as well as experts from the  Shougang Corporation, the Anshan Steel Corporation, the Wuhan  Steel Corporation, the Panzhihua Steel Corporation, and the  China Metals Import and Export Corporation. When asked about  what he thought of his exchange visit to Taiwan, Zhou Guangzhao  said: I certainly felt very happy that I was able to visit our  country's prized island, conduct exchanges there, and do  something for the development of cross-strait exchanges. In  this exchange visit to Taiwan, Mainland scientists, technicians,  and enterprise representatives were well received in Taiwan.  This shows the willingness of people on Taiwan to enhance  exchanges.    Zhou Guangzhao held: This conference further specified both  sides' individual strong points in resources and technologies.  If we can enhance our cooperation, it will be conducive to  development on both sides. He explained: The Mainland is  blessed with rich resources, affluent supplies of raw and  semifinished materials, and abundant scientists and technicians,  whereas Taiwan has a solid basis of technology and is very good  at developing and commercializing research results. Take  material technology for example; rare earth is very useful in  many fields of high technology industries such as motor  manufacturing, special semiconductors, new magnetic materials,  and superconductors. According to statistics on proven  reserves, more than a half of the world's rare earth resources  are in the Mainland. However, the Mainland still has a lot of  catching up to do in developing technologies for exploiting and  applying rare earth elements, while Taiwan has strong production  and applied mechanical and electrical technologies. He said:  Taiwan has many electrical manufacturers. If they use rare  earth to produce electrical products, the performance of their  products will be even better. Suffering from the lack of raw  and semifinished materials on Taiwan, these manufacturers are  not able to give full play to their strong points. As for steel  materials, Taiwan's steel output has increased by a large margin  in recent years. The annual output of the "China Steel  Corporation" on Taiwan currently exceeds 6 million tonnes, and  it is marching toward the goal of 9 million tonnes.  Nevertheless, the market on the island is quite small after all  and its development potential is limited. On the other hand,  the Mainland's broad market and abundant raw and semifinished  materials represent an advantage for development. Therefore,  the two sides need to further cooperate with each other.    Speaking on the present situation and prospects for  cross-strait cooperation, Zhou Guangzhao pointed out: At  present, some Taiwan industries depend heavily on foreign  countries. A number of persons with insight on Taiwan hope to  find cooperation partners on the Mainland to reduce dependence  on foreign countries. He said: The two sides should work hand  in hand to develope some technological industries. Again, he  took rare earth as an example and said: The two sides are  intensifying efforts to develop industries in this field. It  will absolutely help accelerate development if they can make  good use of their strong points, strengthen cooperation, and  complement each other with their own advantages.    Zhou Guangzhao said: Some progress has now been made in  scientific and technological exchanges between the two sides.  Quite a few Taiwan researchers have visited the Mainland and  conduct exchanges. This time Mainland scientists were invited  to visit Taiwan. These visits and exchanges promote  understanding. Moreover, many cross-strait science and  technology [S&amp;T] cooperation projects are underway in  communications, radiation synchrotrons, and marine science. The  range for cooperation is very broad, including basic theory,  applications of technology, industrial development, and even  nuclear science and technology. In conclusion, he said: Under  the premise of mutual benefit and reciprocity, we will make  efforts to promote further cooperation between S&amp;T circles  from  both sides.</p>

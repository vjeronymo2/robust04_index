			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by staff reporter Lin Yu-tung (2651 5940 </F> 2767): "Shenzhen To Reform Port Management System, To Practice  72-Hour Visa Exemption System"]    [Text] Shenzhen, 22 Mar--The Sixth Session of the First  Shenzhen City People's Congress solemnly opened here this  afternoon. At the meeting, Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen  City CPC Committee and city mayor, delivered a government  report. When reviewing the achievements in various fields of  endeavor in 1993 and talking about the work goals and duties in  1994, he said Shenzhen should open wider to both the interior  region and the outside world and develop a new pattern.    Li said: To open wider to the outside world, Shenzhen should  first tighten and improve management at the first and second  lines and apply the special policy toward the bonded area fully,  satisfactorily, and flexibly. He said: Further efforts should  be made to revise and improve the plan for managing the first  and second lines to make it more in keeping with reality. It is  necessary to step up hardware and software construction in the  second line and manage the second line satisfactorily and  strictly so as to create conditions and lay a good foundation  for implementing the policy toward the bonded area. Li said:  The work of designing a bonded area in Yantian Port and  submitting it for approval should be accelerated in a bid to  start operation this year.    Second, it is necessary to reform the port management  structure. Li said: With support from the relevant central  departments and provincial authorities, Shenzhen will further  reform the port management structure, simplify examination  procedures, and improve examination equipment to make the port  "convenient, highly efficient, safe, and free-flowing." We  should gradually establish a port management structure operating  according to international practice and in better coordination  with the Hong Kong and international markets. We shall strive  to practice a 72-hour visa exemption system for foreign tourists  coming to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.    Third, it is necessary to expand the scope and sphere of  foreign capital introduction and raise the grade and level of  its use. Li Youwei said: Shenzhen should actively create  conditions for introducing funds and technology from large  multinational corporations and financial groups in Europe, the  United States, and other countries, and expand capital  introduction to many spheres, such as infrastructure  construction, trade, finance, insurance, tourism, and real  estate. We shall set up a China Merchants Steam Navigation  Company to strengthen leadership over investment invitation.</p>

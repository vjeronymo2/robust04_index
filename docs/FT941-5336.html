			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Generali premium income rises 13.5% Aggregate premium income at Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company, rose 13.5 per cent to L19,200bn (Dollars 11.3bn) in 1993 after a further strong performance from its joint venture in Spain with Banco Central Hispanoamericano, according to preliminary results, writes John Simkins in Milan. Generali said the parent company's net profits, which will be revealed after a board meeting in early May, were expected to show an improvement on the L389.8bn in 1992 in spite of a heavier tax burden. The parent company's premium income was L9,550bn, an increase of 8.4 per cent. Adjusted for currency factors, the rise was 4.3 per cent.</p>

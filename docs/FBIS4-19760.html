			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek Cypriots have started operations to forcibly  evict the Turkish Cypriots living in south Cyprus. Nineteen  Turkish Cypriots who had illegally passed from the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus to south Cyprus received inhuman  treatment and were evicted. Some of the evicted have been  living in south Cyprus for a long time.    Greek Cypriots evicting a group of Turkish Cypriots by  beating them, at a time when the Greek Cypriot authorities are  talking about peace and friendship, proves once more that the  two people cannot coexist. The fact that the Greek Cypriot  authorities, who have shown their true face to world, increased  their pressure on the Turkish Cypriot minority living in the  south Cyprus at a time when the confidence-building measures are  being negotiated, exacerbates feelings of distrust between the  two populations. Even Yilmaz Mavideniz, among the evicted  Turkish Cypriots, who was in close cooperation with the Greek  Cypriot police was not spared eviction.</p>

The joint project involves 68.1 miles of SKOL's line and involves: (1) SKOL's granting trackage rights to MP and SEKR over SKOL's line (a) between milepost 155.8 at Cherryvale, KS, to milepost 165.7 at Independence, KS, and between milepost 0.0 at Independence, KS, to milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction (Dewey), OK, a total distance of 47.5 miles (the Tulsa Subdivision); and (b) between milepost 16.9 at Coffeyville, KS, and milepost 0.0 at Cherryvale, KS, in Montgomery County, KS, a total distance of 16.9 miles (the Coffeyville Subdivision); (2) SKOL's granting MP trackage rights over SKOL's line between milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction, OK, to milepost 41.3 at Bartlesville, OK, a distance of 3.7 miles (SEKR holds rights over this trackage based on an assignment from MP at the time SEKR leased the Bartlesville Subdivision); and (3) MP's incidental abandonment and discontinuance of operations and SEKR's incidental discontinuance of lease operations over the line beginning at milepost 171.0 near South Coffeyville, OK, and ending at milepost 191.15 near Dewey, a distance of approximately 20.15 miles in Nowata and Washington Counties, OK. The transaction was to have been consummated on, or soon as possible after, October 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MP is a class I rail carrier. SEKR and SKOL are class III carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEKR operates a line of railroad known as the Bartlesville Subdivision from milepost 171.0 at South Coffeyville, OK, to milepost 200.0 near Bartlesville, OK. SEKR has not conducted train service over the segment of line between mileposts 171.0 and 191.15 (near Dewey, OK) for more than two years. SEKR uses haulage via SKOL to move its cars from Coffeyville to Dewey or Bartlesville and the cars are then interchanged to an SEKR crew for placement to SEKR customers in Dewey or Bartlesville. SKOL will grant trackage rights to SEKR and MP between Coffeyville, KS, and Dewey so that SEKR and MP can provide service to Dewey. SKOL's grant of these trackage rights will permit SEKR to discontinue its lease operation and MP to abandon and discontinue its operation on the out of service trackage from mileposts 171.0 to 191.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The joint relocation project involving MP's and SEKR'S rail operations will result in an alternate and satisfactory continuation of rail service to customers. There will be no new traffic generated by the proposed transaction, there will be no extension of rail service into new territory, and there will be no adverse effect on shippers. In addition, there will be no change in the competitive situation of the rail carriers in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment and/or discontinuance component of a relocation project only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, generally, Denver &amp; R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). Under these standards, the abandonment and discontinuance under consideration here is not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission has determined that line relocations embrace trackage rights transactions such as the ones proposed here.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See D.T. &amp; I.R._Trackage Rights, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  363 I.C.C. 878 (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norfolk and Western Ry.

The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Jeanna L. Regier, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179, and Karl Morell, Ball, Janik &amp; Novack, 1101 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20004. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: October 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, David M.

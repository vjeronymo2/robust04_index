An editorial, carried by the official newspaper NODONG  SINMUN, said that the DPRK is willing to accept IAEA's  inspections of its nuclear sites aimed at sefeguarding the  consistency of the nuclear security.    However, only when the DPRK and the U.S. reaches an  agreement  on simultaneous action on the basis of the commitments made  earlier can early inspections take place, the paper added.    According to the principles of simultaneous action, if the  DPRK accepts the IAEA's inspections, the U.S. should cancel its  annual military exercise with South Korea and issue a joint  decision with the DPRK on the timing of the third round of  meetings, said the newspaper.    The editorial concluded that only after these actions have  been implemented can the nuclear issue be fairly solved.    It also criticized some U.S. news media for blaming the  failure of the implementation of the IAEA's inspections on the  DPRK's refusal to give entry visas to inspectors. The failure  was not the DPRK's fault, the paper said.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT'S ART MUSEUM FORMS MERGER PANEL  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum has formed a four-member committee to explore a  closer alliance, perhaps a merger, with the Laguna Art Museum.  </P> <P> The action was taken in response to the creation of a similar committee by the  Laguna Art Museum. Laguna committee chairwoman Claudette Y. Shaw had requested  a discussion with the Newport museum about whether "any type of merger would  appear to be advantageous" to the county's two best-known museums, according to  Thomas H. Nielsen, president of the Newport museum's board.  </P> <P> Nielsen named Trustee Jay M. Young to chair the Newport museum's committee,  which also includes trustees James B. Pick, Tom Peckenpaugh and Trustee  Emeritus Jane Lawson. Peckenpaugh is chairman of Santa Ana's Discovery Museum,  formed from the merger of two children's institutions in the county, the  Experience Center and the Exploratory Learning Center.  </P> <P> "The committee's aim is to explore what the possible affiliations may be and to  see if we can work out some arrangement advantageous to both institutions,"  Young said. "I have no preconceived ideas" about what might transpire at the  first meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, he said.  </P> <P> Chairing the Laguna museum's committee is Trustee Kenneth Heintz. The other  members are trustees Mary Hendrickson and Thomas Magill. No date has been set  for its first meeting, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Though Shaw has stressed repeatedly that any discussion of a merger would be  exploratory, she has said "it does seem that some sort of alliance would serve  (both museums) well." The Laguna museum, which has an annual operating budget  of $1.2 million, has been plagued by a persistent deficit that totalled $72,000  during the last fiscal year. The Newport museum is in the midst of a  $50-million drive to build a new facility in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Shaw also has said that any merger most likely would combine adminsitrative  services and fund-raising efforts, rather than mix the museums' collections  into a single facility. Though many of the changes therefore would be behind  the scenes, she said, consolidation could result in jointly organized, bigger  or more comprehensive exhibits.  </P> <P> "The proponents of the (merger) see some way of combining our administrations,"  she said. "That way, both of us could keep our expenses to a minimum and keep  (fund-raising efforts) under one administration so that we would not compete  with each other."  </P></p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE BAA, the privatised UK airport operator, is expected to report higher first-half pre-tax profits on Monday of Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m. However, last year's Pounds 151m followed hefty provisions of Pounds 55m for property write-offs and staff cuts. Although traffic at BAA airports has recovered from the effects of the Gulf war on air travel, the economic slowdown in the UK and other industrialised countries has slowed the upturn. For the full year, City analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits in a range of between Pounds 270m and Pounds 300m. Composite insurers General Accident and Royal Insurancer, which report nine-month results on Tuesday and Thursday respectively, are expected to show improvements, but still be in the red. GA is tipped to reduce losses to Pounds 20m (Pounds 133m), thanks to higher premiums and the abating of rising claims costs. Depending on claims over Hurricane Andrew, the third quarter could even be profitable. Royal should cut its losses from Pounds 214m to about Pounds 106m, although it is still being hit by mortgage indemnity losses. Water company results are skewed towards the first half. Northumbrian, the smallest of the 10 privatised bodies by market capitalisation, is expected to show a 25 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 39m in the six months to September 30 when it reports on Tuesday. The interim dividend is forecast to go up by 9 per cent to 7.4p (6.8p). At Anglian, where Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez sold its near-9 per cent stake in October, sending tremors through sector share prices, the forecast profit rise is from Pounds 91.2m to Pounds 101m, with dividend growth of about 8 per cent to 6.8p. Dunhill, the luxury goods group which reports on Wednesday, is marked down for flat to slightly lower interim pre-tax profits, compared with last year's Pounds 31m. A cushioning effect will be higher interest receivable on healthy cash balances of about Pounds 180m. Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group which has weathered the recession better than most, is likely to report resilient interim profits on Thursday. Analysts believe pre-tax profits may edge ahead to around Pounds 180m as the strength of the Boots the Chemists chain and the pharmaceuticals division again shine through. However, the businesses acquired through Ward White will probably continue to look pretty sickly. BT is expected to show a 40 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 990m for the half year to September 30 when it announces its results on Thursday. The main reason for the fall is exceptional charges for the sale of its interest in Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment maker, and for the voluntary retirement of 29,000 people. Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, reports its third-quarter figures on Thursday. Most analysts are forecasting a Pounds 550m to Pounds 750m profit on a replacement cost basis, compared with Pounds 523m in the same quarter last year, and Pounds 481m in the last quarter. The results are expected to be boosted by foreign currency gains and an accounting adjustment at a subsidiary, forecast to net Pounds 50m.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Timing of Payment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 48. As noted, the date for payment of standard fees will be announced by public notice and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For licensees, permittees and holders of other authorizations in the Common Carrier, Mass Media and Cable Services whose fees are not based on a subscriber, line or circuit count, fees should be submitted for any authorization held as of October 1, 1993. We have selected October 1 as the date for calculating these fees since October 1 is the first day of the fiscal year and, therefore, current licensees subject to the fees would have benefited from out regulatory activities since the beginning of the period covered by their payment. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In light of this decision, the comments by Orbital Communications Corporation, GE American Communications, Inc. and Starsys Global Positioning, Inc. concerning appropriate payments for satellites that became operational after commencement of the fiscal year are moot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 49. In the case of regulatees whose fee payments are based upon a subscriber, line or circuit count, we have decided that the number of a regulatee's subscribers, lines or circuits on December 31, 1993 will be used to calculate the fee. We have selected the last date of the calendar year because many of these entities file reports with us as of that date. Others calculate their subscriber numbers as of the last day of the calendar year for internal purposes. Therefore, calculation of the subscriber fee as of that date will facilitate both an entity's computation of its fee payment and our verification that the correct fee payment has been submitted. Cable systems should calculate their FY 1994 regulatory fees using the subscriber data that was provided to the Commission for the 1993 Annual Report of Cable Television Systems (FCC Form 325A) submission. Accordingly, the number of subscribers will not necessarily be based on December 31, 1993, but rather on ``a typical day in the last full week of December 1993.'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCC Form 325 Instructions at page 1). Finally, since entities in the Private Radio services pay their fees when applying for an new, renewal or reinstatement license, we will require Private Radio applicants to submit a regulatory fee with new, renewal and reinstatement applications filed following the effective date of these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Method and Location of Payment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 50. We proposed to adopt generally the same methods of payment for regulatory fees as we established for application fees. See 47 CFR 1.1108(a). In addition, we proposed to establish a process to permit the electronic filing of fee payments, initially on an experimental basis. Further, we proposed to permit payment of fees by credit card (VISA and Mastercard) in some circumstances subject to the requirement that, when a credit card payment is made, the entire fee payment must be made in a single credit card transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 51. Several parties have requested clarification of our requirements for multiple fee payments by Private Radio licensees. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Other parties support our proposals concerning payment methods, particularly our decision to accept credit cards and electronic payments. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See comments filed by FIT, Naber and UTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See comments filed by SWB and Bell Atlantic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 52. We have designed FCC Forms 159 (Remittance Advice) and 159&hyph;C (Continuation sheet) to replace Form 155. We are satisfied that the forms, and our rules, provide sufficient clarification of our requirements concerning multiple fee payments. These forms are to be submitted with any regulatory fee payment in the mass media, common carrier and cable services. Payors, in the Private Radio services making a single regulatory fee payment, other than by electronic means or credit card, are not required to file a Form 159 as long as their accompanying application form provides the information necessary to accomplish the payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Multiple Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 53. Generally, we will permit any entity, including licensees in the private radio services, to make multiple section 9 regulatory (and section 8 application) fee payments within the same lockbox, including, where applicable, installment payments. Under this procedure, a single payment form and a single instrument of payment may be used to cover multiple regulatory fee payments. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  A multiple regulatory fee payment also may cover payments by more than a single regulatee. Regulatees making combined payments of regulatory fees and application fees within the same lockbox for the Private Radio services may make payment with a single payment instrument and are to submit with the multiple payment a Form 159 and, if needed, a Form 159&hyph;C. Also, any regulatee making payment by credit card, including licensees in the private radio services, must submit a Form 159. See the specific instructions concerning the use of Forms 159 and 159&hyph;C. A copy of the forms and instructions may be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission, Forms Distribution Center, 2803 52d Avenue, Hyattsville, MD 20781. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Payors of regulatory fees for vanity call signs must submit a Form 159 with their applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54. Each regulatee will remain solely responsible for assuring that its applications and authorizations are properly accounted for and listed, and for submitting the full, cumulative payment covering each of its licenses and authorizations. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  As described below, payment deficiencies could lead to penalty charges, dismissal of applications and revocation of authorizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Payment of a regulatory fee may be made by a third party, as NABER and NECA request. However, the entity subject to the requirement to pay the fee will remain responsible for ensuring correct and timely payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 55. As proposed in our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we are establishing a single lockbox at our lockbox bank for the receipt of mass media, common carrier and cable regulatory fees. The single lockbox will accept Mass Media, Common Carrier and Cable Services regulatory fee payments, and will enable regulatees to submit fee payments for these services to the same lockbox and to combine their fee payments for these service categories. However, Private Radio fees will not be accepted at this lockbox and, instead, should be submitted to the lockbox designated for application fees covering the category of license or authorization for which the payment is made. See sections 1.1152 through 1.1155 for the address, including lockbox number regarding payment of regulatory fees for the specific categories of service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

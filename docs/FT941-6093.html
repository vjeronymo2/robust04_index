			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Nigel Rudd takes on another chair Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, is to take up the chairmanship of East Midlands Electricity from May 1 on a non-executive basis. He takes over from John Harris, 55, who has been in the industry for 38 years and will be taking early retirement from April 30. In his 12 years as executive chairman, Harris has been one of the regional electricity sector's most powerful chairmen but his high profile and decisions on diversification have sometimes upset investors. Rudd's appointment is the latest in a series of appointments to key electricity posts of people whose experience is large outside the industry, although he has been an East Midlands' non-executive director for four years. When Harris goes, the chairmen of half the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales will have moved on since privatisation in 1990, several of them replaced by industry newcomers. Although Rudd has made his name as the head for 12 years of a highly acquisitive group, he made clear yesterday that his role at East Midlands will be markedly different from that at Williams. He wants East Midlands to focus on the 'core electricity businesses' - which the City interprets as meaning he would be unlikely to want East Midlands to make further acquisitions. In the past, East Midlands' shares have been among the lowest rated, partly because of its acquisition of electrical contracting companies which have performed below expectations. There has also been disquiet about East MIdlands' association with a prospective bid by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers for British Coal mines, although the company said recently it would not be part of the bidding consortium. Rudd says he will not be getting involved in the day-to-day running of East Midlands: 'The company has an excellent team to do that already.'</p>

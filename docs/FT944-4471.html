			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ripples on the Danube - Advertisers in Hungary are putting their own campaign together These days neon lights pierce the Budapest skyline and slick posters on trams and at bus stops brighten up the city's once grey boulevards. Local pop stars advertise state-of-the-art western televisions, luxury cars and mobile telephones from billboards. The campaign preoccupying Hungarian advertisers at the moment, however, is one aimed at promoting themselves. 'This is a relatively new and growing industry in Hungary, but one which is not well understood,' says Ildiko Takacs, a former head of Young and Rubicam's local operation and president of the Hungarian chapter of the International Advertising Association (IAA). Her hope is that the IAA's lobbying will persuade the government and a sometimes sceptical public that the industry's old-fashioned regulatory framework needs to be liberalised. Advertising is a flourishing sector in an economy which has shrunk by 20 per cent in the last five years. 'Growth in the industry has been spectacular,' says Peter Nagy, secretary general of the Hungarian Advertising Association. 'Five years ago there were no billboards. Now we have 14,000. In newspapers and magazines you never used to see a full-page ad.' Nagy says spending on advertising jumped from Ft7bn (Pounds 40m) in 1989 to Ft33bn in 1993 and is likely to reach up to Ft42bn this year - even given average annual inflation of around 25 per cent. It is also a sector in which western influence and dominance has been greatest. The severe recession has caused the country's traditional advertisers, big state enterprises and retail chains, to cut back. Western consumer goods and service companies, fighting for a share in newly opened eastern European markets, have filled the gap. Western companies or foreign-owned joint ventures account for 75-85 per cent of advertising spending, according to HAA estimates. New local advertisers, notably banks and financial service companies eager to woo Hungary's growing middle classes, have quickly caught on to slick, western advertising techniques. Western agencies have followed their international clients. 'A decade ago the market was shared by a handful of companies. Now we have several hundred mainly small private companies and 18 multi-nationals with local offices or joint ventures,' says Nagy. Local agencies have lost business to the multinationals, which control more than two-thirds of the market, but are beginning to fight back. 'The multinationals have greatly raised the quality of advertising. This has had a spill-over effect on local companies which have been forced to improve to survive,' says Nagy. As the economy recovers, local companies will be well-positioned to attract business from the emerging private sector, he says. But Hungarian advertisers complain that regulation has lagged behind the changes in the sector. The main aim behind their campaign is to press the country's new government to provide the industry with legislation in line with western European norms. The few regulations which exist date mainly from the 1970s. 'The main difficulty is that we're working in a 'grey area'. At the moment there are no definitions of advertising and therefore no framework for regulation,' says Michael Parsons, spokesman for Philip Morris's central and eastern European division. The previous conservative government produced several draft advertising bills but could never agree on a final version. Hungarians are divided over advertising, with many ambivalent towards the industry, says Nagy. 'Many feel we have too much advertising. They are overwhelmed.' Another problem is western advertisements with little sensitivity to the local market. Judit Fekete, editor-in-chief of Propaganda Reklam, a leading local trade magazine, says: 'Most of the big campaigns are global and are aired here with few changes. But many western advertisements don't fit into our way of living - for example, soap powder or detergent commercials filmed in huge, luxurious kitchens. Hungarians are shocked at the opulence. Few people in this country have kitchens like that.' She says campaigns made by western agencies for eastern markets are often not much better: 'One car company showed Mr Kovacs - Mr Smith - choosing his first new car in 26 years. This type of ad is extremely patronising.' But the most contentious issue is a 1978 ban on advertising alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical products. 'One of the worst aspects of this ban is that it is ambiguously worded,' says Nagy. 'The law forbids advertising which 'encourages the consumption' of alcohol and tobacco. We are constantly being asked whether this means a total ban or not.' Companies have found many ways to get around the ban. One is to simply ignore it, says Fekete. 'The press is full of ads for banned products. The cost of fines is simply built in to the cost of the ad.' Sponsorship is the most popular legal way for alcohol and tobacco companies to promote their brands. Companies give their name to a sporting event or a music festival, which they advertise heavily. Other ploys include distributing ashtrays, table-cloths, pens, coasters and other gimmicks emblazoned with brand logos. Cigarette companies have launched clothing and footwear lines and advertised these to spread their brand names. Tobacco and alcohol companies argue that advertising merely influences consumers' choice of brand. But industry analysts say financial arguments are the most likely to convince the public and the government to accept more advertising and a limited lifting of the bans. Some estimate that adopting UK or German-style regulations - which allow tobacco and alcohol advertising in the press, posters at the point of sale - would inject as much as Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) into the economy. Takacs says: 'One of the messages we need to get across in the campaign is that without advertising, the press is more expensive and less profitable. That isn't good for the public or for the government's tax revenues.'</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: 'Son of BES' aims at unquoted companies - Enterprise investment THE MEASURE: The introduction of Enterprise Investment Schemes to encourage direct equity investment in unquoted trading companies. Also, the creation of venture capital trusts, a new kind of investment trust which would invest in unquoted trading companies. IN DETAIL: The Enterprise Investment Scheme will come into force on January 1. Investors will be able to put up to Pounds 100,000 a year in companies qualifying for the EIS, which will be able to raise up to Pounds 1m a year through the scheme. For the tax year 1993-94, there will be a combined limit of Pounds 40,000 for investments under the EIS and BES; the new Pounds 100,000 limit will apply from 1994-95. Income tax relief will be limited to 20 per cent, but losses on the disposal of shares will be eligible for income tax or capital gains tax relief, which may encourage investors to be less averse to risk. Any capital gains within the scheme will be free of tax. Shares must be held for at least five years. Companies investing in private rented housing will not be eligible. Investors previously unconnected with EIS companies will be allowed to become paid directors while still qualifying for tax relief - this means that 'business angels' will be able to take an active part in the management of the company without losing entitlement to relief. Venture capital trusts will also be free of tax on dividends and capital gains. These trusts would not become available for a considerable time: the chancellor plans to issue a consultation paper on the subject in the New Year, with legislation in the 1995 Finance Act. THE BACKGROUND: The EIS was welcomed by the investment industry yesterday as the 'son of BES' it had been demanding. It is a direct replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme, which ends on December 31. The BES was launched in 1983. Intended to encourage private individuals to invest in small, high-risk growing companies, it ended up being used largely as a tax-efficient method for investing in rented property. The previous chancellor announced the abolition of the BES in 1992.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Gilts market operators welcome launch of Treasury review Investors and marketmakers are hoping for substantial changes in the way the gilts market operates, in the wake of a review announced by the Treasury. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, said his officials would 'examine the present arrangements within government for the issuance of government debt to ensure that we keep up with best practice in Europe and elsewhere'. The review, led by Treasury economist Mr Jonathan Portes, will look at existing debt management arrangements, the selling of government debt and the management of outstanding debt. A report is expected by next summer. The Treasury announced in March that it was giving the Bank greater freedom to operate in the gilts market, allowing it to choose the timing and nature of issues within the terms of the annual remit established by the Treasury. One option to be considered by the review is a more structured system of auctions, along US lines. Mr Andrew Burtenshaw, investment manager at Norwich Union, said he would like a better auction timetable. 'The one we have at the moment is a bit hit and miss.' Mr Burtenshaw also thought it would improve the efficiency of the market if the maturity of the stock was known further in advance. 'Half the auctions tend to be of the five, 10 or 15-year benchmark stocks so they might as well go the whole hog.' Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said a change in the handling of gilt auctions was especially desirable for foreign investors who 'find the uncertainty to be a real deterrent'. Mr Shepperd also recommended making all gilts free of tax for residents abroad. At the moment some gilt issues are tax-free for non-UK investors and others are not. One issue the Treasury review will not cover is extension of the repurchase, or repo, system in the gilts market. The Bank of England instituted a short-term gilt repo facility following sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, as a means of easing very large shortages in the money market. Under the repo system, the Bank is a party to all agreements. It has been consulting for some months over the creation of an 'open repo market' to allow gilts investors to have repurchase agreements with each other with the aim of adding liquidity to the market. The Bank will shortly issue a consultation paper on the subject, and there has been much speculation that an open repo market will be announced in the Budget.</p>

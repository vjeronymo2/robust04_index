			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate approved on final reading a bill that  will allow the liberalized entry of foreign banks in the  Philippines before the chamber adjourned for the Lenten Season  recess. The measure was certified urgent by Malacanang  [presidential office].    Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the Senate Committee on  Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies, stressed that  liberalization would allow the Philippines to join the global  economy and give the country access to foreign funds development  and opportunities opened by present international market  conditions.    "When the whole world is making the globe smaller; when  NAFTA  is being organized; when the European common market have become  one; when ASEAN is trying to assert its proper leadership in the  economic development of the Pacific Area, are we in the  Philippines going to be alone and be left behind by all these  developments?" Roco said.    The approved bill (Senate Bill 1606), entitled "An Act  Liberalizing the Entry and Scope of Operations of Foreign Banks  in the Philippines," allows a total of six foreign banks to  enter the Philippine banking system within a period of five  years to foster greater competition in the industry. The  president may recommend two more banks.    In the bill, foreign banks will be allowed to enter through  any one of the three modes namely:    -- By acquiring, purchasing, or owning up to 60 percent of  the voting stock of an existing bank;    -- By investing up to 60 percent of the voting stock of a  new  banking subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the  Philippines; or,    -- By establishing branches with full banking authority.    Foreign banks will be allowed to bring in not more than  three  branches with a capital requirement of P [Philippine pesos] 300  million. For every branch in addition to the three  (sub-branch), P50 million shall be added to the permanently  assigned capital. Assigned capitals shall be inwardly remitted  and converted into Philippine currency.    Roco stressed that foreign banks that would establish  branches in the Philippines would give the country access to  global resources of the mother company. "That is principle of  the liberalization."    Apart from increasing competition, Roco added that  liberalization would equalize ownership in Filipino banks. At  present, Filipino groups can only own 20 to 30 percent, while  foreigners can own up to 40 percent. The bill contains a  provision that allows a foreign bank or a Philippine corporation  to own up to 60 percent of the voting stock of only one domestic  bank or a new banking subsidiary.    One of the guidelines for approving a foreign bank  application is ensuring that reciprocity rights are enjoyed by  Philippine banks in the applying foreign banks' country. The  Monetary Board, which is the approving body, is given other  guidelines such as:    -- Ensuring geographic representation;    -- Considering strategic, trade and investment relationships  between the Philippines and the country of incorporation of the  foreign bank; and,    -- Study the demontation for financial innovations and  stability in a competitive environment of the applicant.  [sentence as published]    Only those among the top 100 banks in the world or the top  three banks in the country of origin shall be allowed to enter.    He said it was time for the Philippine banking industry to  share the profits with the Filipino people. At present the  banking industry, despite being the most profitable in the past  15 years, gave only 3 or 4 percent interest in deposits while  charging 20 to 23 percent interest in borrowing.    "The liberalization will foster greater competition in the  banking industry in attracting depositors," said Roco.</p>

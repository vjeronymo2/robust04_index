Meanwhile, public servants have gathered for an  antigovernment rally at Lichtenburg on the South African side of  the border. Traffic ground to a halt in Mafikeng after a  meeting in (?Rooigrond). Teachers and health workers have also  embarked on a strike and public servants have begun a consumer  boycott against businesses owned by the government.    In a separate development, ANC [African National Congress]  leader Nelson Mandela has asked the South African government to  recall officials seconded to Bophuthatswana and to maintain a  defense force presence on the border to monitor the situation.  However, the defense force had denied that it has been deployed  to prevent the unrest in Bophuthatswana from spilling over into  South Africa.</p>

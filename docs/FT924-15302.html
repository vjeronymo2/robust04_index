			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: German insurance competition hots up - The battle for market share ahead of deregulation in 1994 When in March this year Germany's federal cartel authorities ruled that that Allianz should scale down its 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner Bank, the move was seen as an attack at the very heart of the German financial and industrial establishment. Last week, the Bundeskartellamt backed down, saying there was no need for Allianz - Europe's largest insurance group - to sell a single share in Dresdner, the second biggest bank in Germany. It was a dramatic U-turn, and it leaves the Allianz/Dresdner axis intact as a powerful new force in German banking and insurance, its influence consolidated through a network of shareholdings in large industrial companies. As the Berlin-based cartel authorities explicitly recognised in reversing their earlier judgment, competition in the German insurance market - the largest in Europe with premium-income of DM168bn (Pounds 67.2bn) last year - is intensifying ahead of deregulation. A series of European Community Directives, aimed at freeing up insurance markets, must be adopted by member states by 1994. Two large, financially strong companies have moved aggressively into the German market in the last six months. One is Assurances Generales de France (AGF), which has recently fought and won a complex battle to have full voting rights accorded to its 25 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligung, Germany's second largest insurance group. The other is the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and rival to Allianz as Germany's most powerful industrial/financial complex. In July it bought a 30 per cent stake in Gerling-Konzern Versicherungs-Beteiligungs, the biggest privately-owned insurance company in Germany, with premium income of DM10bn. It followed this last month with the purchase of a majority holding in Deutscher Herold Versicherungs, another privately owned group. The bank has said it will respect the wishes of the vendors and not disclose any financial details. Speculation suggests that the bank paid between DM1bn and DM1.5bn for the Gerling stake, and around DM500m for control of Herold. Mr Georg Krupp, the Deutsche main board director responsible for the bank's insurance activities, said that most of the press reports about the prices paid had been wide of the mark - but declined to give any clue as to the actual figure. AGF's motivation for closer co-operation with Aachener is clear - it wants to establish a bridgehead into the German market. From the point of view of the German bank, Mr Kilmar Kopper, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, explained last month that the Herold deal was a means of diversifying its private client business. The 30 per cent stake in Gerling - predominantly an industrial insurer - was a 'financial participation', not an excursion into mainstream insurance. Despite these innocuous explanations, the German press has been alive with stories about an impending battle of the giants between Deutsche on the one hand and Allianz/Dresdner on the other, a battle complicated by the fact that Deutsche and Allianz both own 10 per cent stakes of each other. From his eyrie towards the top of one of the Deutsche Bank twin towers in the heart of Frankfurt's financial district, Mr Krupp dismisses talk of a 'battle of the giants'. 'It has never been our aim to build up an insurance group,' he says, 'and it will not be in the future either. Our goal is not to set ourselves up as a competitor to Allianz, but to serve our retail customers better.' Mr Krupp says that Deutsche Bank has long realised that in order to keep its 6.5m retail banking customers happy, it must offer more than straightforward banking products. And in order to market its expanded product palette more effectively, it must do more than operate its network of 1,500 bank branches: it must open up new channels of distribution. The first step in this strategy was to open up a housing finance subsidiary, followed by the founding of a life insurance business in 1989. Mr Krupp says that the recent acquisitions - especially the Herold purchase - have enabled the strategy to be developed more quickly and cost-effectively than if the bank had relied on organic growth alone. Herold brings the bank a tranche of new life and other personal business, as well as access to new distribution channels via a network of itinerant salesman. By contrast, the purchase of the Gerling stake is less easy to explain. As a pure financial investment, it makes little sense, analysts say - especially at a time when Deutsche takes pains to stress that the assets locked up in its other industrial holdings could better be deployed in the mainstream banking business. From an operational point of view, the synergies are small in relation to the outlay. It is involved in life insurance and other personal sectors, but the bulk of its business is with companies, not private individuals. Some analysts worry that the acquisition of the 30 per cent stake could be a stepping stone to a full purchase - 'worry', because Deutsche bankers do not necessarily have the expertise to manage the business, and because the company is said to need large injections of capital to make it fully competitive over the longer term. There is no clarification on this from Deutsche: asked whether the bank has plans to buy the entire company Mr Krupp replies cryptically: 'Fantasy knows no bounds.' Closer co-operation cannot be ruled out, he says. One fantasy which may yet become a reality is that of Allianz/Dresdner and Deutsche Bank battling it out in the liberalised insurance markets of the mid-to-late 1990s.</p>

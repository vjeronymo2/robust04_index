			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (AFP) -- Today, the Cuban  Government reaffirmed its willingness to engage the United  States in an unconditional dialogue, but in fact the only  condition must precisely be an absence of prerequisites. At the  conclusion of a three-day visit to Uruguay, the foreign minister  from Havana, Roberto Robaina, pointed out that there is  currently "no sign" that would lead us to expect a possible  lifting of the economic and commercial blockade that has  burdened the island for over three decades.    "We are not now holding talks with the United States, (but)  are willing to engage in a dialogue on any issue. We do not  even have to start with the blockade," the Cuban minister said.  "What we have said is that we would hold talks under one  condition: that there be no conditions," added Robaina, who is  the obvious leader of a diplomatic offensive launched by the  island to attract private investors.    The foreign minister, 37, said at a news conference that "if  the idea is to hold talks based on prerequisites, there would be  no chance of us participating in any talks." Robaina pointed  out that "my country has nothing to give in exchange for an  unjustly imposed blockade." He added that both OAS votes and a  genuine willingness to invest in Cuba are needed to end it.    As for his government's policy of promoting investments,  Robaina assured that even Cubans in exile will have an  opportunity to participate in the opening up process. "Cuba  cannot say that it is opening itself up legally to capital  investment from all quarters without opening itself up to Cubans  who left the country," the foreign minister said. He added that  "when we say that investment possibilities are available to  everyone we mean everyone." Robaina pointed out that this calls  for a gradual process as well as the establishment of a climate  of trust in the foreign investor within a framework of broad and  flexible regulations that excludes no one.    The minister also commented on the economic problems facing  the island in the wake of the "surprising" demise of the  socialist bloc. He said that "although there is no variety on  our tables," the basic nourishment of our population is ensured.  He pointed out that in view of the dilemma caused by this  situation, Cuba has only two options: "Renounce its achievements  or decide to ignore their essence and adapt in order to survive  under current conditions and with principles that are essential  to us."    The foreign minister said that the collapse of socialism was  not the only thing that affected the expectations of the regime  that has ruled the island since 1 January 1959. He admitted  that mistakes that led to the current situation included  excessive reliance on foreign aid and the neglect of important  production sectors like agriculture. In this regard, he pointed  out that the preferential relations that Cuba enjoyed with the  Soviet bloc had ended and voiced Cuba's willingness to  participate in a restructuring process leading to the  establishment of new ties.    Robaina also talked about exiles and noted that a meeting  will be held on the Isle of Youth from 22 to 24 April with  representatives of the diaspora from about 60 countries. He  pointed out that the government plans to establish a "normal  path" to ensure that exiles "cease to be the instrument for  hostile policies against the island." The foreign minister said,  "I think that certain things involve healthy interests (because)  many Cubans of goodwill, who are all over the world, want to  maintain normal relations with their homeland." He added that  the important thing will not be the meeting itself but its  results.</p>

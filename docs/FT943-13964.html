			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: If you don't understand, then ask Tax assessments are sent out with accompanying notes from the Inland Revenue. Some, particularly on the Schedule E (Paye) assessments, are extremely helpful. Others may confuse the lay reader. Many people employ accountants, but it makes sense to study your own tax assessment. And remember: If you do not understand anything in your assessment, ask your inspector of taxes to explain it. They are usually helpful. If you still do not understand, take professional advice. You only have 30 days to appeal against an assessment, so do not waste time.</p>

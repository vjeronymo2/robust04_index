			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. State Authorization_Subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test (56 FR 30201). In that proposal, the Agency considered the effect of those proposed revisions on State Authorization based on the entire test, rather than on the individual components of the entire financial test ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 30214 and 30215). This proposal would modify one provision of that July 1, 1991 proposed rule. Specifically, this proposal would modify the domestic assets requirement of the financial test contained in &sect;&sect;264.143(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D) and the corresponding revisions to the financial test instruments at &sect;264.151 (f) and (g). This proposed change of the domestic asset requirement would not change the effect of State Authorization detailed in the July 1, 1991 proposed rule. As a result, if the Agency does promulgate a revised financial test under subtitle C, the effect on State Authorization would be based on the July 1, 1991 proposal, though a full discussion of the effect on State Authorization of the entire revised subtitle C corporate financial test will be contained in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XI. Economic and Regulatory Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 4, 1993 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 51735), the Agency must determine whether a regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record for this rulemaking ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F&hyph;94&hyph;FTMP&hyph;FFFFF).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency conducted an analysis to estimate the costs that would be avoided by corporations if this corporate financial test were available to them. Since corporations would be able to use the financial test for all or part of their subtitle D obligations, corporations would save the cost of obtaining a third-party instrument for those portions of their obligations. The Agency estimates that the corporate financial test and guarantee mechanisms would save corporations $45 million annually. In performing this analysis, the Agency assumed that the 1991 data used to estimate the number of MSWLFs, the costs of closure and post-closure care for each of the categories of MSWLFs, and the number of corporations are held constant. The financial data of the corporations are also assumed not to have changed since 1991. The Agency also assumed that corporations had, as their only environmental obligations, the costs of closure, post-closure care of their MSWLFs. The Agency further assumed that the cost of obtaining a third-party financial instrument, such as a letter of credit or surety bond, would be 1.5 percent of the cost estimate of closure and post-closure care of the MSWLF. Finally, the Agency assumed that corporate parents would be willing to provide guarantees to their subsidiaries to the extent that they are able to provide those guarantees through the financial test. A full discussion of this analysis can be found in the docket for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Mixture of influences leaves shares lower Wall Street US SHARE prices fell for the second consecutive day as investors reacted to higher bond yields, a mixed batch of corporate earnings reports, and news of weaker housing activity, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 23.50 down at 3,443.49, some way off its low for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.36 to 445.10 and the Nasdaq composite 1.06 to 661.97. NYSE volume was a heavy 319m shares. The economic news set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 4.6 per cent last month, a larger than expected setback even after taking into account the effect on house building of the severe winter storms that struck large parts of the country in March. Stock prices were also depressed by a rise in bond yields. Although the rise was sparked by mostly technical factors, equity investors remain nervous that the 1993 bond market rally, which has sustained share prices through these early months of this year, is almost over. A large number of corporate earnings were filed yesterday as the first-quarter reporting season came into its stride. There was no discernible pattern among the releases, which partly explains why the stock markets have struggled to find a direction in recent days. IBM shed Dollars 1 at first, but then rebounded to end Dollars 1 1/8 ahead on balance at Dollars 50 1/2 on volume of 2.4m shares after the computer manufacturer announced a first-quarter loss of 50 cents a share, compared with a profit of Dollars 1.21 a share a year ago. The figures were broadly in line with analysts' expectations. Bank shares fell in spite of some good earnings news. The declines were attributed to profit-taking by investors who had bought bank shares in anticipation of better profits. Citicorp was the second most heavily traded stock, easing Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 3/4 in volume of 5.9m shares after the group revealed net income of Dollars 374m but also announced a rise in non-performing assets. Chemical, which reported profits of Dollars 374m, up 44 per cent from a year ago, dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 , and Wells Fargo dropped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 113 7/8 following news of Dollars 1.72 a share first-quarter net income. Chemical Waste Management fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 after disappointing the market with its first-quarter earnings. On the Nasdaq market, technology issues rallied after Tuesday's plunge in Intel shares. Intel recouped Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 101 and Seagate Technology, aided by a ratings upgrade from Bear Stearns, firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 15 7/8 . Canada TORONTO ended on a mixed note after yet another day of extremely heavy trading as gains in gold and forestry issues restrained the market from shadowing losses on Wall Street. Dealers said junior diamond, oil and gas shares continue to attract large volumes and keep overall activity busy. . The TSE 300 index was up 0.1 at 3,663.3, with rises edging ahead of declines by 363 to 350 after volume of 77.2m shares.</p>

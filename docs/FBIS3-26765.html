With the approval of the Xinjiang Autonomous Regional  Higher People's Court, nine of them, including Huang Jianchao,  Feng Xiaojiang, Wang Wei, and Bai Liang, were sentenced to death  and executed immediately.    The criminals harshly punished by the law on 28 January  committed numerous crimes which incurred the extreme and intense  indignation of the people. Some committed cases of  manslaughter, one after another, in revenge and then conducted  counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation when they  absconded to avoid punishment; some killed innocent people after  robbing them of money; some formed a gang and, more than once,  used coercion to rob taxi drivers of their takings in spite of  the law; some raped women in broad daylight.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Administrator completes sale of Airbreak arm MR DAVID BUCHLER of Buchler Phillips, the administrator for the Airbreak Leisure Group, yesterday completed the sale of Sunsail International, one of the failed tour operator's subsidiaries, for an undisclosed sum. However it is thought the amount will be in the region of Pounds 2m, the figure touted when Airbreak's management was trying to sell Sunsail in the weeks leading to the USM-quoted group's collapse. The Civil Aviation Authority has agreed to allow Sunsail to retain its licence. Ironically, it was Sunsail - which provides sailing and club holidays in the Mediterranean and was acquired by Airbreak in January for up to Pounds 8m in shares and loan stock - which precipitated the fall. When announcing the group's losses of Pounds 2.92m on September 15, Mr David Lewis, Airbreak chairman, blamed heavy discounting in the charter tour market, 'unexpected problems' in two of Sunsail's associated companies and 'wholly unanticipated demands for repayments of existing and long-term overdraft facilities from Sunsail's two principal bankers'. Sunsail is being sold to Mr Chris Gordon and his wife Sally. They were managing director and marketing director respectively before and during the Airbreak ownership and will continue in those roles. There will be no job losses. The buy-out is backed by a 'major City institution'. Two other Airbreak subsidiaries - Suntan Tours IATA and Airbreak Travel - are still IATA-bonded as sellers of flights, rather than as travel or tour operators. They are trading under administration, and Mr Buchler is looking for buyers. All the group's other subsidiaries have ceased trading with liquidation or receivership awaiting.</p>

The high-ranking officer said the GN, the Navy,  and the Army have beefed up security in Casdualito, the  Venezuelan town bordering Colombia, in anticipation of a new  guerrilla attack. "We are absolutely sure they will carry out  future attacks against our installations and we are ready for  that," he asserted.    Artuza Delgado said the civilian population of the southwest  region of Venezuela can rest assured the Armed Forces will  safeguard their physical safety and will protect their  properties. Meanwhile, the GN commander reported that this  Venezuelan force had not arrested the Brazilian gold prospectors  and also denied entering the Brazilian territorial space.    The general remarked the Venezuelan Armed Forces respect the  borders and are perfectly aware of their location. He added that  in the last operation conducted in the area bordering Brazil,  Venezuelan military authorities destroyed 88 "gold prospecting"  camps and 11 rafts used by the illegal miners. The officer  concluded that "the illegal Brazilian miners, who profit from  the illegal exploitation of our land, want to create friction at  the international level so as to weaken the work being done at  the border."</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] A DPR [Parliament] member has asked why Bank  Indonesia, which under Law No. 7/1992 on banking is the only  institution that supervises and oversees banking, is silent and  has not given any explanation to the people about the crisis at  BAPINDO.    B.P. Messakh, member of the DPR FKP [Functional Group  Faction], feels that Bank Indonesia, as the only institution  that supervises and oversees banking, should give an explanation  to the public about the problem loans at BAPINDO.    "Why has Bank Indonesia never given any information about  the  BAPINDO case, despite the fact that under Law No. 7/1992, Bank  Indonesia is the only institution that supervises and oversees  banking? The minister of finance himself has not directly given  any information, either," Messakh said yesterday at the DPR  Building. Messakh also asked why Bank Indonesia has not  announced the results of its supervision and oversight of  BAPINDO, although the BUMN bank has been in the news for months.    "Should not Bank Indonesia have announced whatever its  action  has been against BAPINDO? If there is a bank that is not  healthy, Bank Indonesia should know more about it than anyone  else," the legislator said.    A similar thought was expressed by Sri-Bintang Pamungkas,  member of the DPR's APBN [National Budget] Commission from the  FPP [Development Unity Faction], who said that because Bank  Indonesia is the institution that oversees the activities of  BUMN banks, it naturally knew of the BAPINDO loan case before  anyone else.    "Bank Indonesia should be the one to give explanation to the  public. It is simply silent, however, although it certainly knew  of the case first," Bintang asserted. The vocal DPR member  feels that Bank Indonesia must be examined in connection with  the BAPINDO case. "Bank Indonesia must be examined," he declared.    Bintang's basis for his statement was that because Bank  Indonesia routinely oversees banking activity, including that of  BUMN banks, it must give account of its oversight of BAPINDO.  Bintang feels that Bank Indonesia people can be bribed,  however. Thus, unsatisfactory conditions at a bank are made  satisfactory.    Messakh also said that Bank Indonesia is the one that should  know whether a bank is healthy and should also know what action  is to be taken against such a bank, including BAPINDO.    Bintang thinks the DPR APBN Commission's request for  cancellation of its meeting with the Bank Indonesia governor was  "engineered," thus closing off any information from Bank  Indonesia. The basis for the cancellation was that the questions  the APBN Commission would have asked the governor would be the  same as those asked by Commission VII.    "Oral questions from APBN Commission members would certainly  differ from those of Commission VII, because their areas are  different," Bintang asserted. Messakh said Bank Indonesia  appears to have no role in the current BAPINDO case. "It is as  though Bank Indonesia has no part whatever in the BAPINDO case,"  he said.    The former member of Commission VII, which handles finance  and banking, also asked whether the Attorney General's Office is  pursuing the person who leaked confidential information about  Eddy Tansil's loan at BAPINDO. He asked why the person who  leaked confidential loan information about Eddy Tansil is not  being pursued, because from the criminal aspect that person  violated the Banking Law, particularly with regard to bank  secrecy.    "I agree that Eddy Tansil should be pursued, but there is  clearly a criminal element in the leaking of bank secrets. Why  has it been hushed up?"    The DPR member asked whether the Attorney General's Office  has tried to trace the one who leaked the confidential  information about Eddy Tansil's loan. A similar question was  raised by Aberson M. Sihaloho, deputy chairman of the DPR APBN  Commission. "The person who leaked the bank secrets should be  tracked down," he said.  <H5>  Foreign Bankers </H5>   Meanwhile, people in the DPR also expressed the opinion that  the use of foreign bankers to resolve the BAPINDO crisis is  justified only to the extent that such use does not violate Law  No. 7/1992 on banking, the provisions of which have yet to be  spelled out in government regulations.    Abdullah Zainie, deputy chairman of the FKP, said that Law  No. 7/1992 provides for the possible use of foreign personnel by  domestic banks.    "As long as such foreign personnel are used only as  consultants or advisers, it is all right to assign them to help  BAPINDO managers or directors, but they cannot be used for  executive jobs at the bank," Zainie said.    "I agree with the government's contracting with foreign  bankers to improve BAPINDO management, as long as such contracts  do not violate the Banking Law," Commission V member Bomer  Pasaribu said yesterday at the DPR Building.    Bintang expressed the opinion that there will be no problem  if the government wishes to establish BAPINDO management  cooperation with a foreign bank as long as management is not  delegated. "It would not be right to delegate BAPINDO management  to a foreign bank!" Bintang declared.    Meanwhile, Messakh, a member of DPR Commission V, said that  if the improvement of BAPINDO management is to involve foreign  personnel or bankers, it must be learned which areas are  permitted by Law No. 7/1992 on banking.    "In the clarification section of Law No. 7/1992, there are  limitations and conditions on the employment of foreign  personnel," said the former member of the special committee on  the banking bill.    The conditions are to be spelled out in government  regulations, Messakh said. "The conditions that are to be  spelled out are specified in Law No. 7/1992," he added. Messakh  invited the government to cooperate with foreign personnel to  improve BAPINDO management, as long as such cooperation does not  violate the Banking Law and is not contradictory to it.    A similar view was presented by Novyan Kaman, secretary of  the FKP, who said that regulations should be drawn up before  recruiting foreign personnel to improve BAPINDO management.    "If the government wants to improve BAPINDO management by  contracting with foreign personnel, it will not be done in the  near future, because the government will naturally wait for the  regulations to be drawn up first."    They said these things as reaction to the plans of the  minister of finance to recruit foreign bankers to improve  BAPINDO management. Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad is  expected to explain the plan in a working meeting with the APBN  Commission today at the DPR Building.    Bintang said that besides asking about the finance  minister's  plan for BAPINDO management cooperation with foreign bankers, he  will also ask about other problem loan cases, which involve  about 50 big customers.    "If the resolution of just one problem loan case takes at  least two months, then about 100 months, or eight years, will be  needed to resolve 50 cases," he said. He feels that not all the  capital of a BUMN bank needs to be owned by the government. As  long as more than half the capital is owned by the government,  it can be called a BUMN bank.</p>

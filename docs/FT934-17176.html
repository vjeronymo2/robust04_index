			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Dollars 2bn pledged for Palestinians MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday hailed as 'a striking success' a donor conference of 47 governments and organisations in Washington. It attracted pledges of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) over the five-year interim period of limited Palestinian self-rule, and evoked promises of more to come. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, predicted that donations would eventually exceed the Dollars 2.4bn which the World Bank has estimated will be required in external aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said yesterday that the Dollars 2bn was not enough and the Palestinians needed at least Dollars 5bn. The US committed Dollars 500m, although Dollars 100m will have strings in that it comes from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation as loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance to support US private investment. Continuing the stress on economics, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, met at the White House and agreed to work on economic and environmental matters, even before any agreement on the more divisive security and border issues. The two sides agreed to establish a joint economic committee, which could also become a receptor for donor funds. 'We are moving this process very quickly,' said President Bill Clinton, who met the prince and the minister. He claimed to be undeterred by the Arab rejection of his call for an end to the economic boycott of Israel. Israel itself pledged Dollars 75m to the donors' fund, Saudi Arabia, Dollars 100m and Japan Dollars 200m. The EC - the largest donor - will give Dollars 600m. The World Bank and a Palestinian committee will take part in managing the fund, while the UN takes charge of immediate relief needs. At the state department, officials from the donor countries talked of the urgent need to get aid quickly into action on the ground, so as to spread hope in Gaza and the West Bank. Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, said on Thursday that the bank was planning to provide some Dollars 450m of its own money over the next two years, including a Dollars 50m loan likely to be approved by its board in the next two weeks. At first, the aid will pay for road maintenance, irrigation and housing. Later, projects will include provision of a clean water supply, improved transportation infrastructure, a reliable source of energy, and environmental preservation. Reuter adds: Syrian President Hafez al-Assad yesterday poured cold water on Mideast peace advances saying an Israeli-Syrian agreement was less likely than before the Israeli deal with the PLO.</p>

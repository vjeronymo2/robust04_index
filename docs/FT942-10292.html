			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Redrow's small public response The Pounds 117m flotation by Redrow, the third housebuilder to come to the market this year, has fallen foul of the recent fatigue in the London stock market for new issues. The company announced yesterday that while all of the 87m shares on offer had been taken up, the public had subscribed for only 17.12m or 78.7 per cent of the minimum 21.75m shares they had been offered. The shortfall has been placed with institutions which have acquired 4.6m more shares than they had expected. The issue at 135p was fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd with Cazenove acting as broker. The issue price valued the company at Pounds 298m. The company scaled down the offer price following a fall in building share prices this spring. It had originally considered an issue price of 145p, valuing the company at Pounds 350m. Under the terms of the issue Redrow gained Pounds 55.4m from the sale of 41m shares while Mr Steve Morgan, the founder and chief executive, raised Pounds 62m from the sale of 46m shares, reducing his stake to 60 per cent. Mr Morgan originally had planned to raise Pounds 100m and reduce his stake to 50 per cent. Dealings are due to start in the shares on May 17.</p>

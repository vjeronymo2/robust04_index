			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO;  </P> <P> LEADERS CALL FIRST MEETING ON GANG DIVERSION PROGRAM  </P> <P> Business and community leaders, as well as school, church, city and law  enforcement officials, will meet at 7 tonight in the community room at Rio  Hondo Regional Library in the first of a series of brainstorming sessions to  develop a gang diversion program.  </P> <P> Councilman William Molinari, who is organizing the meeting, said that although  Montebello has a successful Drug Awareness Resistance Education (DARE) program  at all the schools in the Montebello Unified school district, more is needed to  ensure that children stay out of gangs.  </P> <P> "It seems every day we read about another shooting in the area," he said.  "Though we don't have serious gang crime problems here, we can't sit back and  expect that it will last forever. Sheriff's officials tell me that once a child  has joined a gang it's almost impossible to get them out. We need to make sure  they never get in."  </P> <P> Molinari said that by bringing a cross section of the community together, he  hopes the city can come up with a sound, well-rounded gang diversion plan.  </P></p>

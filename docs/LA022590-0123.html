			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'I LIKE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THEIR DECISION TO CHANGE AND CREATE  HEALTH FOR THEMSELVES'  </P> <P> When Loretta Covert had surgery a few years ago and wasn't recovering quickly,  a friend suggested that she see a faith healer. She thought, why not? That  visit changed her life. Abandoning her studies in horticulture, Covert began  exploring metaphysics, spirituality and traditional Chinese medicine. She  attended the Kairos Institute in Encinitas and is a graduate of the California  Acupuncture College. Now, the 36-year-old North Park resident offers an  acupuncture/massage service at the Park Blvd. Health Center. Using  strategically placed needles, massage and meditation, Covert treats people  afflicted with everything from insomnia to infertility. Times staff writer  Caroline Lemke interviewed Covert, and Theresa Tamura photographed her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I was working for a company taking care of indoor plants when I became ill. I  had had some surgery, and I wasn't healing, I wasn't gaining my strength back.  One of my fellow workers took me to see a faith healer who had helped him a lot  with his back pain.  </P> <P> It was a totally unexpected experience. The faith healer was this Filipino man.  I went in, laid down on the table, and he put his hand over my scar and said,  "What happened here?" I had not told him anything, and I felt this incredible  rush of energy move through me. I knew that this man knew God.  </P> <P> That's basically what began my whole search into where I am now, into healing  as a science and an art. I became interested in what faith healing was, and I  started studying not so much religion, but spirituality.  </P> <P> It was while I was at the Kairos Institute that I realized horticulture wasn't  really my life work.  </P> <P> The reason I did the massage was to find out if I really wanted to work with  people. I found I liked massage, and I was good at it, and from there I  immediately went into acupuncture school, which is almost a four-year process.  </P> <P> Most people think that you just go take a class in acupuncture and you learn  how to put a needle in. But acupuncture is just a small portion of what  traditional Chinese medicine is. It's much more than putting needles in. You  really need to be able to diagnose a person.  </P> <P> Acupuncture is looking at the body as an energetic system and that each part of  the body, each organ, has a specific energetic function. The traditional  Chinese medicine doctor makes an evaluation or diagnosis much like a Western  medical doctor does. It's done through observation, listening not only to what  the patient tells, but what they aren't telling you. When someone comes in with  a complaint, you utilize all the skills you have.  </P> <P> I find very often that people have no idea about their bodies. We spend a lot  of time out of our bodies, so to speak. We're such a mental society that we  don't really know what it is to stop and sit and be with ourselves. We spend a  lot of time trying to get out of it.  </P> <P> All modalities of healing are relevant. Some people may need to go see an  acupuncturist and that takes care of it. And some people need to go see a  medical doctor and some may need to see a chiropractor. If I see that a patient  of mine needs something different, I will refer them to a medical doctor, or a  chiropractor or an osteopath.  </P> <P> We need the medical Establishment. If I get my bones broken, take me to a  hospital. I will go see an acupuncturist afterward to facilitate the healing  process.  </P> <P> I feel that my role as an acupuncturist or a healer is to support people in  understanding their own ability to heal themselves and take responsibility for  that. I like to support people in their decision to change and create health  for themselves. It's difficult because you have to be willing to make some  changes in life style, and sometimes in beliefs.  </P> <P> Every day, every patient who comes to me, I learn a great deal about  acupuncture, about healing and what my role is, about myself, about people in  general. We're all here to basically learn from one another and assist one  another, whatever our process.  </P></p>

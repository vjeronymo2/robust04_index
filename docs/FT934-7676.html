			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (10): Narrow focus a winner - Profile: BZ FOR most of its astonishingly successful eight-year life, the BZ investment banking group in Zurich has kept a low profile. Mr Martin Ebner, the driving force behind the group, has preferred to concentrate on leading his tiny band of traders and analysts to pile up profits for clients and, of course, for the bank itself. So far it has been a winning formula, with the bank showing a net income of SFr59.5m (Dollars 41.90m) last year and Mr Ebner, a former equities analyst at Bank J Vontobel, appearing regularly in the lists of the wealthiest Swiss. The group's strategy has been to focus its attention narrowly. It has only a dozen main institutional clients, it follows closely only about 30 Swiss shares, and it issues and trades warrants in even fewer of them. It scored an early success in 1987, issuing covered warrants on registered shares of Swiss companies. At the time, foreign investors were not allowed to buy these but most reckoned prohibition would soon end. This happened, but the warrants are still popular among some investors for their tax efficiency. As it has grown, BZ has diversified into fund management, but again has focused narrowly. In 1991, it took over Pharma Vision 2000, a sleepy investment trust with holdings in pharmaceutical and chemical shares. It pared Pharma Vision's holdings down so that its SFr2.4bn portfolio is now made up of securities of only three Swiss companies: Roche, Ciba and EMS-Chemie. In the same year, it formed a similar trust, BK Vision, for banking shares, and roughly two-thirds of its SFr2bn portfolio is in Union Bank of Switzerland shares and options. BK is by far the largest single shareholder of UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, with a 15 per cent stake. In both cases, the trusts were able to achieve large scale status quickly because BZ institutional clients were willing to put their holdings into them in return for Vision shares. By late last year, the BZ group had reached a size at which it was increasingly difficult to keep a low profile, especially as three of its vehicles, the two Visions and its derivatives subsidiary, OZ in Zurich Options and Futures, were quoted. Moreover, Mr Ebner began to fulfil his commitment that the Visions would be active shareholders, trying to influence the management of companies in which they had holdings. In December, BK Vision indicated publicly that it was unhappy with a UBS board decision not to renominate Mr Christoph Blocher, a controversial industrialist-politician, to its ranks. This was a delicate case as Mr Blocher, the chairman of EMS-Chemie and of Pharma Vision, was clearly a BZ ally. Yet the UBS move looked like spite against Mr Blocher's isolationist politics. In the end, BZ pulled its punch, but UBS lost face. In June, BK Vision returned to the attack, filing a legal suit against the creation by UBS of shares that could be used to make acquisitions without prior approval by shareholders. This time, it struck a responsive chord in Swiss financial circles, where it was widely felt that UBS had stretched the meaning of recent company law reforms beyond a reasonable limit. UBS responded constructively, saying it welcomed the opportunity to clarify the law. For its part, Pharma Vision has begun to grumble about the lacklustre performance at Ciba. But BZ's main claim to fame is still its ability to raise and make huge amounts of money. So far this year, BK Vision has raised SFr220m and Pharma Vision SFr310m in rights issues. A third investment trust, Gas Vision, to specialise in shares of industrial gas companies, was launched in August raising SFr500m. Meanwhile, BZ Trust, a group offshoot which manages the Visions, has made astronomical commissions from them. BZ uses a formula that provides for no commission unless the Vision shares grow more than 6 per cent, but then for sharply rising fees. In the first half of this year, it earned SFr140.4m from Pharma Vision and SFr132.7m from BK Vision. Mr Ebner's latest enthusiasm is for company share buy-backs. He says it is better to distribute excess capital venture into risky diversifications. He started working on the techniques two years ago when looking for tax efficient ways for EMS-Chemie to pay dividends. One was to pay back a portion of the nominal share capital, which Ems did last year in lieu of paying a dividend. This year, EMS took a bigger step, buying back and cancelling 36 per cent of its bearer shares, distributing SFr550m back to shareholders. Societe Generale de Surveillance, the cash-rich Geneva based inspection group, followed with a similar programme to distribute SFr216m, but said it had not been advised by BZ. BZ recently announced that its OZ subsidiary would launch a buy-back programme via partial redemption of its nominal capital worth at least SFr18m. BZ officials have begun floating the idea that mighty UBS should join the trend, although they recognise that in the case of a bank, a delicate balance must be struck between maintaining sufficient capital and producing good returns on it. The time has long since passed when sceptics could say that the BZ group was a meteor that would quickly burn itself out. But equally, it remains to be seen if it can continue to spin gigantic profits for itself and its clients out of financial engineering on a small number of securities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The declining media trumpets of the gang of  rebellion and secession, and some suspect foreign media hostile  to the Yemeni unity, have continued to propagate exposed lies  and fabrications to the effect that Iraqis are fighting  alongside the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy.    On 4 June, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, MBC,  cited its correspondent in Aden on the arrest of some Iraqis  claiming they were fighters recruited within the ranks of the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, when in fact they  are Iraqi teachers who had been teaching in the Hadhramaut  Governorate. The forces of the gang of rebellion and secession  arrested them and showed them on television claiming they were  Iraqi fighters, thus committing a new moral scandal that is  added to the series of moral scandals committed frequently by  the gang of rebellion and secession. This gang is experiencing  its death-throes and is trying, in vain, through these  fabrications and cheap blackmail, to win foreign sympathy and  intervention to save it from inevitable doom.    The First Channel Television yesterday evening screened  documentary evidence that refutes the successive fabrications of  the gang of rebellion, secession, and treason and those of  suspect and hostile media organs.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: No mention of public transport Sir, Your editorial, 'Cars, congestion and pollution' (November 20), fails to mention a policy option that would attack both problems at the same time, that is, greater investment in public transport. The omission is all the more striking given that, on the same page, you carry an article on the current state of the London Underground which has just had its investment budget cut by more than Pounds 200m.

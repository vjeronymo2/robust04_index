			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen republic has assessed the attempt by  Russian helicopters to continue chasing terrorists above the  territory of the republic as "an illegal violation of the air  space of a sovereign state." The Chechen Foreign Ministry told  Interfax that "only the Chechen republic's obligations to  confront terrorism as an international phenomenon prevented it  from taking tougher measures against the violators of the air  space."    The Chechen State Security Department told Interfax that the  Chechen anti-aircraft forces had forced the Russian helicopter  following the helicopter with the terrorists on board land at  Groznyy airport after they crossed the Chechen border.    "The detention and neutralization of the terrorists was  carried out by Chechen special purpose units," a spokesman for  the department said.    The terrorists had captured a bus with civilians near  Mineralniye Vody and flew for Chechnya having been given a  ransom of several million dollars.    At the moment, the terrorists, including two Chechen  nationals and one Kumyk (one of the peoples populating Dagestan  -- IF note) are in a custody in Groznyy under investigation.  Negotiations are held to extradite the terrorists to Russia.    At the same time, a high-ranking official of the Chechen  presidential staff told Interfax that Groznyy would insist on  Russia's notifying it of emergencies. He described the fact  that the Russian side had failed to take part in the detention  of the terrorists near the Chechen town of Gudermes as a blunder  by the Russian special services.</p>

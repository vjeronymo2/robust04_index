			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Basov: "Russia Needs a Navy -- But What </F> Kind?"]    [Text] Having devoted more than forty years to  naval service, I had mixed feelings when I read the article "We  Must Save the Navy" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. On its pages the  paper raised a most urgent question which touches on the  long-term vital interests of Russia. Once again I was convinced  of the terrible situation (let us call a spade a spade) in which  our navy has existed for the last two or three years, that same  avy which for the first time in history had ranked second in the  world in terms of power. The peoples of friendly countries on  all continents welcomed ships flying the white and blue flag,  and enemies treated it with respect on all the waters of the  World Ocean.    The Deputy Chairman of Goskomoboronprom [State  Committee of the Defense Industry] of the Russian Federation G.  Voronin, straightforwardly and with facts in hand, sketched the  rapid fading of our fleet and its dismal prospects. In five  years the complement of the navy has been cut by 40 percent. For  the second year not a single new ship has been started. The  basing system has been destroyed, alert-duty service has been  cut, the squadrons of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean  have returned to their own coastal waters, some ship-building  centers have broken away, and the financing of fundamental and  exploratory research has stopped. Deprived of its navy, the  country will inevitably lose its great-power status.    This prospect is dismal and ruinous for the state. Still,  some estimates demand clarification, some predictions require  discussion.    First of all I want to note that one can speak of the navy  only with allowance for the geopolitical factor. In contrast to  island states, England, Japan and (in a sense) the U.S., which  does not have the million-strong armies of neighboring states  nearby, Russia must first protect itself from the possible  invasion of ground troops. Nor is invasion from naval axes ruled  out.    As many now assume, world nuclear war is not very likely.  But  nuclear weapons will remain weapons of deterrence and prevention  of aggression for many years yet. It is no secret that before  the start of perestroyka, when no expense was spared  on defense, the USSR put the emphasis in the nuclear triad on  heavy ground-based missiles (ICBMs), which the U.S. most feared  and which most met the geopolitical interests of our state. At  that time it was easier and cheaper to form the Strategic  Missile Troops than the Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces.    A change in the structure of strategic offensive arms to  increase the naval component up to 50 to 70 percent, as G.  Voronin proposes, will lead to another naval arms race. Voronin  acknowledges that it would be unrealistic and inexpedient to try  to achieve quantitative parity at sea given the great economic  superiority of the U.S. Our country would not be able to breath  freely under the burden of excessive military expenditures. He  suggests concentrating strategic missile submarines and their  supporting forces in the North and East as part of the Northern  and Pacific Fleets. Allowing for the great economic importance  of the Northern and Far-Eastern Seas, the author believes that  "our navy must provide full superiority in these zones."  Accomplishment of this task would require too many forces.  However, temporary control over certain waters with the goal of  blocking amphibious assaults, for example, is a realistic task.  The new grouping of Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces also demands  balance by conventional forces, to prevent skewing in the  direction of any single weapons system. Forces to combat  submarines, aircraft carriers, and other strike vessels are  needed. All this requires an "air-defense umbrella."    Everyone remembers the Caribbean crisis of October 1962,  when  our forces in Cuba found themselves beyond the reach of Soviet  conventional weapons and we were compelled to withdraw our  missiles from Cuba literally under the muzzles of American guns.  Thus in every theater, a complete structure of the present-day  navy must be established.    So we must save the navy. To do this, the main forces of the  navy must be concentrated in the North and Far East. What then  of Russian interests in the Baltic and Black Seas? The U.S. has  already announced that the Baltic countries and Ukraine are  zones of their vital interests, and consequently they are  prepared to defend them by force of arms. On March 19 of this  year, on the "Vesti" [news] television show the new U.S. Defense  Secretary W. Perry, allowing for the instability in Russia,  spoke in favor of further development of nuclear forces,  including the "Trident-2" sea-launched strategic missiles.  Interest in the Baltic and Black Seas has also increased in  other states.    Remember, however, that the appearance of a regular navy in  Russia was prompted by an historical task, to penetrate the  community of European states. Peter the First, after building  St. Petersburg and creating the navy, had formed a great  European power. Since then Russian has not been a guest in  Europe, but an equal partner. Cooperation with European  countries supported commercial and other interests in the  Mediterranean. With the help of the navy dispatched from the  Baltic, the Far East, Alaska, and Russian America were  conquered. For Russia, remaining in the community of European  states means having an army to protect it from possible invasion  from the West and having freedom of navigation in the Baltic  Sea. The latter must come from the small but combat-ready forces  of the Baltic Feet. Here one must remember that during the Great  Patriotic War, in the Northwest Strategic Axis the goals of the  war were achieved through the joint efforts of the fronts, the  navy, long-range aviation, and the National Air Defense Forces.    Russia's second geopolitical task has been and remains the  furtherance of free trade of states at the crossroads of three  continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. The annexation of the  Crimea and the creation of the Black Sea Fleet met the needs of  rapid development of the southern regions of the state. Rivalry  with Turkey, England and France in this region led to wars, the  demise of the fleet and its new restoration. Now the Near East  is an enormous storehouse of oil. It is also a tangle of ethnic,  religious and cultural contradictions, as was demonstrated by  the Arab-Israel wars and the punitive operations against Iraq  ("Desert Storm"), effected from naval and ground axes.    For Russia, remaining a Black Sea power is an historical,  unending task. How can it be achieved without reliance on the  base system in the Crimea, after losing the ship-building  capacity in the south of the former USSR? Clearly we must  continue to look for new forms of cooperation with Ukraine and  the other Black Sea states.    It has developed historically that in Russian foreign  policy,  Far-Eastern and Pacific problems derived from European-Atlantic  problems. The flood of international capital into Southeast  Asia, and in particular to China, led Russia to create the  Pacific Fleet, and resulted in two wars with Japan. Now in this  region the task clearly is not to "ensure full superiority" but  to maintain a reasonable balance of forces between the U.S.,  Japan, China and Russia. According to reports from the SMI [not  further expanded], all ship-building plants have stopped running  in the Far East, and without them there can be neither military  bases nor a fleet.    At present public opinion supports the idea of a need to  create more mobile and better armed forces. In this we cannot  help but allow for past experience. In the 20th century, Russia  (the USSR) participated in two world wars without having  concluded the formation of an ocean-going fleet. This made the  "Russian front" very dependent on the status of the battle in  the European-Atlantic and Asiatic-Pacific theaters of war.  Retention of naval might exerted a great influence on the  results of wars. In the period of the postwar confrontation and  the "Cold War," the USSR constructed a powerful ocean-going  fleet, but excessive military expenditures, including those for  the fleet, were one of the causes of profound economic crisis.    We should support in every way the proposal of Gennadiy  Voronin regarding the need to discuss the question of the navy  before adopting a 10-to-15-year ship-building program and  assigning the appropriations, not only in the Security Council  but also in the Parliament. We need a Law on the Navy. The  situation of the navy is so serious that perhaps its rescue  should be started with the formation of an independent Ministry  of the Navy.</p>

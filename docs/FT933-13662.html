			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Revenue doesn't need to know about gifts I INTEND TO give my nephew Pounds 3,000 a year until I die. Can I take it that this will this be free of death duties and also free of tax on him? Am I obliged to tell the Inland Revenue about it? This gift falls within your annual exemption. There is no need to inform the Revenue so long as this exemption has not been exceeded. For the record, if you were to give more than Pounds 3,000 (so that it became a potentially exempt transfer), you would not need to tell the Revenue at the time. The gift would need to be notified by your executors only if you died within seven years of making it, in which case the potentially exempt transfer would become chargeable. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

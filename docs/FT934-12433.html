			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Europe to press US for Gatt concession THE European Community yesterday warned the US that it must improve its offer on market access if there is to be any chance of meeting the December 15 deadline for resolving the Uruguay Round talks on world trade reform. Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, after briefing EC foreign ministers on the talks, said the deadline was 'within our reach, but not yet within our grasp'. Sir Leon will give a written account of the talks when EC foreign ministers meet in Brussels on November 8 - a meeting at which France and its allies are expected to press their misgivings about the Uruguay Round. The ministers had shown 'overwhelming support for the view that the American response on market access. . . was inadequate,' he said. At July's Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations, the Quad group - the US, Japan, Canada and the EC - agreed to cut 'peak tariffs' of over 15 per cent by half. The EC has lodged an 'illustrative offer' along these lines at the Geneva talks, and is challenging the US and Japan to 'respond to what we are doing,' as Sir Leon put it. The commissioner said that the EC had 101 peak tariffs covering Ecu1.1bn (Pounds 855m) in imports, whereas the US had 683 covering Ecu17.3bn, and Japan 495 covering Ecu2.7bn. 'It is of course the high tariffs which are the real obstacle' on market access, he said. On the Blair House farm trade agreement between the EC and the US, to which the EC, driven by French threats to scupper the Uruguay Round, is seeking additions, Sir Leon declared: 'It is not for the French to move on Blair House; the ball is in the American court.' He implied that the US refusal to discuss Blair House or farm trade was linked to Washington's current absorption in getting the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico through Congress on November 17. Sir Leon nevertheless signalled further progress on talks with the US for a special regime for audio-visual, cinema and broadcasting trade to protect European cultural interests, and said other negotiations with the US were continuing quietly.</p>

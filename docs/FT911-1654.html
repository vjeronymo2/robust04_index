			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Leading Article: No FT, no comrades THE WORKERS' flag is deepest pink, or so we might conclude from Wednesday's Labour party election broadcast on television. 'The Financial Times says: 'Today the Labour party looks like the competent party with sound ideas on local government. The Conservative party has no policies.' ' Thus went the first of no fewer than four ringing endorsements for Labour from this newspaper. The attentive viewer might have noticed that on the subsequent three occasions the phrase 'on local government' had disappeared. But it would have taken a viewer with considerable powers of memory to recollect the context of this remark, from our political columnist, Joe Rogaly. It was as follows: 'Labour governance of the poor by the unemployable has given us nuclear-free zones, gender-based support groups, and the visible ruination of perfectly good schools by infesting them with sub-standard teachers with not a thought in their cotton-wool minds. The cost, reflected in local taxation, has soared beyond the reach of public acceptability. Yet today Labour looks like the competent party with sound ideas on local government; the Conservatives are the knuckleheads.' Perhaps for its next broadcast, the party might like to take highlights from another recent FT column, by Samuel Brittan. He wrote: 'Unfortunately, it is still not possible for market economists to support Labour with a straight face.' There is no reproduction fee.</p>

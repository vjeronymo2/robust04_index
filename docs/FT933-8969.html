			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: GPA plans to lay off 20% of workforce GPA Group, the Republic of Ireland-based aircraft leasing company taken over by GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US, is to lay off more than 20 per cent of its 230-strong workforce. The company said that many of the near-50 redundancies would be compulsory. They were part of a general restructuring following the takeover and were necessary to 'take account of current and anticipated levels of business.' GPA, which has been experiencing difficulties since the collapse of a Stock Exchange flotation bid a year ago, has 1,000 aircraft for leasing.</p>

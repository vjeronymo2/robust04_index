			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 26 Jun (MENA) -- Responsible sources in the  Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry have stated that the reason for  postponing the meeting of the Damascus Declaration countries'  foreign ministers, which was scheduled to start on Tuesday [28  June], is these countries' desire to wait for the outcome of the  UN Security Council decision on Yemen, in addition to the  foreign ministers' commitments to unforeseen activities.    Ambassador Khalid al-Jarallah, director of the Gulf  Cooperation Council's affairs at the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry,  said that consultations are now under way between the Damascus  Declaration countries' foreign ministers to set a new date for  the meeting, adding that there is a proposal to hold it next  week.    In an exclusive statement to MENA's correspondent in Kuwait,  he said that a number of issues will top the agenda of the  meeting, the most important of which are the situation in Yemen  in light of the expected Security Council resolution, Iraqi  intransigence in implementing the UN resolutions, the Middle  East peace process and its developments, and other issues of  concern to the member countries.</p>

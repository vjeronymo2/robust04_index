			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In reaction to the decision by Greece to close its  consulate in Macedonia and close the port of Thessaloniki to  Macedonian goods, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski  made the following statement:    [Begin Crvenkovski recording] The Republic of Macedonia  deems  that the latest decision by the Greek Government on the  suspension of work of the consulate general of the Republic of  Greece in Skopje and the interruption of transport of goods  between the port of Thessaloniki and Skopje, which in fact  represents an embargo against our country, is an act  contravening the UN charter, CSCE documents and international  law. By this act the Greek side has violated a conclusion of  the EC council of ministers reached at the Edinburgh summit on  12 December 1992, according to which our country must be  provided with regular oil supplies.    Such unilateral and unacceptable measures taken by the Greek  Government are particularly worrying since they are also in  contravention of the UN Security Council resolution in which  both Macedonia and Greece are called on to overcome differences  through UN-mediated negotiations and thus contribute to the  strengthening of peace and security in the region.    The Republic of Macedonia has always pursued a peace-loving  policy regarding all developments on the territory of former  Yugoslavia, has avoided war and managed to build a democratic  society and a free market economy and regulate interethnic  relations on the basis of dialogue and tolerance.    With regard to the dispute with Greece, Macedonia has shown  the maximum flexibility and readiness to display goodwill in the  resolution of open issues. This Macedonian policy also applies  to the rest of the world.    Macedonia has managed to preserve peace and security on its  territory and by this has become a factor of peace and stability  in the region. Therefore, it is surprising that at the time  when the international community is investing enormous efforts  for the peaceful and negotiated resolution of the most complex  problems, including halting the war in Bosnia, the Republic of  Greece, a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the European  Council, and the current president of the European Union, should  be taking such measures against our independent and peace-loving  country; these measures violate international law. By this the  Greek Government wishes to exert economic, political, and other  kinds of pressure on our country, taking advantage of the fact  that Macedonia is a land-locked country.    The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to stress  that this inflicts huge damage on the permanent interests of  both countries and nations, and also on future mutual relations  and cooperation for which the Greek side bears responsibility.    Despite this, Macedonia firmly abides by its resolve to  build  good relations with all its neighbors, including its southern  neighbor, and is ready to continue the Greek-Macedonian  dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will  collect evidence of all possible consequences caused by the  Greek blockade -- which was not caused by the Macedonian side --  and in this connection it will take the necessary measures and  activities in the international arena.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Tories move to defuse sleaze row The government is to review its code of conduct for ministers as part of a wide-ranging initiative to counter the recent spate of allegations of financial impropriety. Mr David Hunt, public services minister, said yesterday the government would 'look at anything which is possible to prove to people' that the highest possible standards applied in British public life. Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record programme, Mr Hunt acknowledged that an outside body might be set up to inquire into the area of MPs' outside interests, saying such a step was 'always an option'. But he said it was 'very difficult . . . to argue in precise terms about what sort of inquiry there should be when parliament has already decided to set up a committee of privileges investigation'. He said he hoped the committee of privileges would 'find a way of looking into the wider issues involved so that if there is a need for new guidelines, they will be drawn up'. His comments came after Mr John Biffen, former Conservative cabinet minister, used a newspaper article to argue that an inquiry conducted by people drawn from outside the House of Commons might be needed. Sir Norman Fowler, former Conservative party chairman, said last week that the best way forward would be to set up an independent body - modelled on the Cadbury committee on corporate governance - to examine the whole question of MPs' outside interests. Mr Hunt said he had been given a remit by Mr John Major to look at 'some of the wider issues involved' because the prime minister was 'determined not only to have but to prove to have the highest possible standards in public life'. He said he would be examining ways to 'open up even more' the process of making appointments to non-departmental public bodies. He said: 'I would like to find ways in which we could ensure not only that people can nominate themselves to sit on public bodies but that other people can nominate those they consider to be the best possible individuals. 'I have been trying to secure more openness, to make people aware that they can nominate individuals for non departmental public bodies,' he said.</p>

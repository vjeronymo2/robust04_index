			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn/Ankara (DPA) -- According to eyewitness  reports, Turkish and Iranian troops have intervened in the  internal Kurdish conflict in northeastern Iraq. In the  Sulaimaniya area, thousands are fleeing from the fighting,  Eberhard Walde, chief of the German Liaison Bureau in the  region, told DPA in Bonn in a telephone interview on 19 May.    He said that while Iranian artillery attacked Kurdish  settlements from the east, Turkish aircraft dropped bombs from  the north, which has led to another stream of civilian refugees.  Meanwhile, the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq has virtually  been shared between the two rival parties, the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, which are  continuing their armed conflicts, Walde said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- Contrary to current  rumours being spread by the international press, Hungary has not  delivered any weapons to the secessionists in South Yemen,  according to Gyorgy Buda, deputy head of the Export Control  Office at the Ministry of International Economic Relations, who  made an official statement to MTI on Thursday.    Information on weapon exports is usually secret, unless the  head of the inter-departmental commission monitoring exports  gives permission to disclose specific data. Having received  such permission, Buda said, "Hungary's Government has not had  any contact with military forces in South Yemen in the past  three years, as it officially recognizes the Sanaa government,  and there cannot have been any legal weapon deliveries from  Hungary to Yemen without an official end-use guarantee from this  government."    "Under a decree issued to Hungary's inter-departmental  commission monitoring exports, the delivery of weapons to crisis  zones is prohibited. Accordingly, Hungarian weapons cannot have  been exported to Yemen, even with Saudi Arabian assistance. In  addition, the falsehood of such rumours is obvious from the fact  that Hungary has no weapons for sale of the type mentioned by  the press."    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Janos Herman told MTI that the  Hungarian ambassador to Yemen has visited their Foreign Ministry  twice in order to assure all the officials concerned that these  rumours have no grounds. Hungary's official statement on the  issue has been acknowledged.</p>

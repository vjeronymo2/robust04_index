			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HIGH COURT DELAYS KRISHNA CASE RULING  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court has delayed a decision whether to hear the Hare  Krishna's appeal for relief from a $5-million judgment involving an Orange  County mother and her daughter, who had once been a member of the religious  sect.  </P> <P> The court also refused to hear an appeal by Marsha George and her daughter,  Robin George Westerkamp that it restore part of the nearly $10-million Orange  County Superior Court judgment. But Westerkamp said the family had not had high  expectations of success.  </P> <P> The big disappointment, she said, is waiting for the high court's decision on  the Hare Krishnas' appeal.  </P> <P> "We've waited seven years, I suppose we can wait a few more weeks, or even  months," Westerkamp said Monday.  </P> <P> An Orange County jury in 1983 had awarded $32.5 million to the Georges, who  claimed that the Hare Krishnas had coerced Robin into running away from home  and joining the sect at age 14, then had hidden her away from her parents, who  lived in Cypress.  </P> <P> The trial judge, James A. Jackman, reduced the award to about $10 million, and  the 4th District Court of Appeal further reduced it to $2.9 million. The  interest on that amount puts the total at about $5 million.  </P> <P> The Hare Krishnas claim that the only way they can raise enough money would be  to sell some of their temples, including the one in Laguna Beach, where Robin  George had spent time as a teen-ager.  </P> <P> The Hare Krishnas argue that sales of the temples would destroy the sect and  would be an interference of its religious freedom.  </P> <P> Today, the Hare Krishna leadership in San Diego issued a news release stating  that the high court's decision to delay a ruling "is a positive sign."  </P> <P> "The longer the justices have to examine the facts surrounding this case, the  more obvious it will become that the lower courts have trampled on the  religious freedom of hundreds of thousands of people," according to its news  release.JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

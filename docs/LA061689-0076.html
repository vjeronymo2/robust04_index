			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST MAN IN 15-YEAR-OLD SLAYING CASE  </P> <P> A judge dropped charges Thursday against a San Fernando man recently arrested  in connection with a 15-year-old slaying.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber dismissed a charge of involuntary  manslaughter against Juvenal Camarena Mena, 51, of San Fernando, who had been  arrested on suspicion of murder during a routine traffic stop.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Michael E. Plotkin asked that the case be dismissed because  the law requires prosecutors to file involuntary manslaughter charges against a  suspect within three years after a crime is committed.  </P> <P> Mena originally was charged with murder in the Jan. 12, 1974, shooting of  Carlos Rodriguez Camacho, 32, during a drunken argument. That charge, which is  not covered by statute of limitation laws, was reduced to involuntary  manslaughter after Mena's arrest in February because of a lack of evidence in  the 15-year-old incident.  </P> <P> San Fernando police said Thursday that witnesses had identified Mena as the  gunman, but that investigators were unable to locate him.  </P> <P> "We talked to numerous family members," Detective David Harvey said. "Nobody  knew where he was. After awhile, you can't keep up with every arrest warrant  ever issued."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Owns Business  </P> <P> Plotkin said his client owns a house and a wrought-iron business in San  Fernando, where he has lived for 15 years.  </P> <P> "They screwed up," Plotkin said of the police. "They had 15 years to arrest  him, and he was sitting right here in his house in San Fernando."  </P> <P> Mena was arrested in Burbank in February after he was stopped for a traffic  violation. But prosecutors said they were unable to locate witnesses to the  shooting and could not pursue a murder charge against him.  </P> <P> According to court documents, witnesses told police that Mena and Camacho had  been drinking at Camacho's apartment when the two began arguing.  </P> <P> Mena left. But as he got into his car, Camacho came after him and they fought,  a witness told police. The witness said he heard a gunshot before Mena drove  off.  </P> <P> After his arrest, Mena told police he was afraid of what the victim might do,  so he pulled out a shotgun and aimed it at Camacho. He said that he did not  intend to kill Camacho, but that the victim grabbed the barrel of the gun and  it went off.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (1): Birth of a business - Large law firms in New York and London now earn as much as 40 per cent of revenue from work with an international element. But expansion overseas is expensive. Will a handful of powerful law firms dominate global practice? If the large Anglo-American law firms which dominate the international legal services market ever doubted that the practice of law changed from a profession to a business during the boom years of the 1980s, the recent recession on both sides of the Atlantic can have left them in no doubt. As spending on legal services in the 1980s in the US alone moved inexorably through the Dollars 100bn a year mark in a welter of mergers and acquisitions and property deals, lawyers must have felt they were in clover. It meant hard work and long hours, but fees rocketed and so did profits. The earnings of senior partners scorched past those of their counterparts in finance and industry. Legends were born: Martin Lipton, senior partner of New York's Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz, inventor of the 'poison pill' defence; Joseph Flom, senior partner of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, king of M&amp;A. If this was business, then business must be easy. The recession changed that - probably for good. For the first time, lawyers were exposed to chill winds of competition as they fought for the dwindling supply of high value work to drive the bottom line. Clients who had stuck like limpets became fickle when legal services were no longer in short supply. Forced to cut costs themselves to cope with the economic downturn, clients haggled over fees. If they didn't get what they wanted they went elsewhere. Profits stalled; law firms were forced to cut staff. There was no more talk of huge Anglo-American law firms dominating the international legal services market. The law business pulled in its horns. The recession held another lesson for lawyers - they are only just coming to terms with it as recovery sets in. The legal services marketplace in both Europe and the US is oversupplied; too many lawyers are chasing too little work. In spite of recent statements by Mr Flom that another boom in corporate deals may be just around the corner, and the optimism expressed by Robert Harman of Travers Smith Braithwaite, the City of London solicitors - which is mirrored by others - that lawyers in Europe can look forward to an increase in cross-border deals as business begins to adapt to the single market - lawyers recognise that if they are to grow their businesses in the 1990s, they need new markets. For most of them that means they must look overseas to the emerging markets of south east Asia and eastern Europe. The problem which they all face, however, is how best to service these markets and secure a slice of the cake. After three lean years, most firms simply do not have the resources to finance and staff new overseas bases. But of the dozen or so on either side of the Atlantic which do, only a handful see the future in establishing international practices along the lines of the Big Six accountancy firms. At the moment only Baker &amp; McKenzie (1,640 lawyers, speaking 60 languages, based in 55 offices in 33 countries) can stake a claim to be a truly global legal practice. But others make no secret of their ambitions in that direction. By the year 2000, they believe that global legal services will be dominated by fewer than 10 US and UK firms. It is not hard to identify most of the candidates. From the UK: Clifford Chance, Freshfields and possibly Allen &amp; Overy if it eventually merges with France's Gide Loyrette Nouel. From the US: B&amp;M, Skadden Arps, Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue, White &amp; Case, Shearman &amp; Sterling, Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton and Coudert Brothers. Bruce Buck, head of Skadden's London office, believes the trend towards global law firms is unstoppable. The business community is getting smaller and volume of cross border work is growing fast. The legal profession must adapt accordingly; firms which do not do so will be left behind. Skadden's current strategy is to be able to practise local law in those jurisdictions where the firm can add value for clients and make money at the same time. But there are restraints on the speed at which global expansion can be achieved - particularly, he says, in ensuring the quality of the service provided. Inconsistent quality of work is an accusation that has been levelled at Baker &amp; McKenzie over the years by competitors deriding its unusual structure of knitting local lawyers in different countries into its international network. John McGuigan, B&amp;M's chairman, accepts that quality is very important and that poor work done for a multinational client in Bogota could damage relationships in more important markets such as Europe and the US. 'We're only as strong as our weakest link', he concedes. But he feels the quality issue can be over-emphasised. Imposing the way in which business is done in one location or another is wrong because it fails to recognise that there are different degrees of sophistication in the various legal systems of the world, that local lawyers' qualifications may not be up to the standards of the US and Europe, and that different issues are relevant in ensuring clients get the right service. 'Some US banking lawyers believe that what they need to do in Jakarta is to produce the same pile of closing documents they would in New York. They're wrong,' he says. UK firms with similar global ambitions believe that clients welcome the ability to be able to use their own lawyers in foreign jurisdictions. 'They like it, provided they are going to get a service just as good as a good local firm plus all the benefits of using an integrated firm with knowledge of their business and with whom they have good relations at HQ,' says John Grieves, senior partner of Freshfields. But Mr Grieves and others accept that there may be more than one way of dominating global legal services in future. Firms such as Linklaters &amp; Paines and Slaughter and May in London, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore in New York believe it is unnecessary to have offices world-wide in order to dominate the marketplace. They point out that firms with the biggest number of overseas offices may not be the most profitable. Baker &amp; McKenzie has the highest gross revenues of any firm in the world, but is only ranked 40th in the US when measured by profits per partner. Opening foreign offices to practise local law is not ruled out by firms such as Linklaters. But in general, the 'best service' to the client can be delivered by maintaining strong relations with the best local law firms and referring work or working with them on individual deals. Emerging markets are best tackled by following the investment banks. James Wyness, senior partner of Linklaters, says: 'There is no way we are going to set up in China and practise local law, but we would follow the investment banks to Shanghai to do Shanghai listings and international privatisations. The same is true of eastern Europe.' But he accepts that such a strategy is only viable for the handful of firms in the 'magic circle' used by the investment banks. For those outside it, the problem of how best to deliver international legal services remains. 'My advice to them would be to check what their clients want and follow demand, but even then only take on the work if you've got the right people,' he says. There is a third approach to the delivery of international legal services: the formation of law firm affiliations such as the Minneapolis-based Commercial Law Affiliates, a non-profit making organisation with member firms in 180 cities around the world. They see it as the best means of servicing the international requirements of their clients. Such associations, which monitor the standards of their members, must seem to provide the only practicable solution to the provision of international legal services for most medium-sized commercial law firms. As firms jockey for position in the international legal services market, there is one possibility which few of them like to contemplate but which could upset even the best laid plans: a merger between a large US and large UK firm. The heads of the top firms on both sides of the Atlantic are adamant that this will not happen - the cultures and remuneration of US and UK firms are too far apart. But there are firms whose cultures, working practices and remuneration structures are similar - for example, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell of New York and Freshfields of London. A merger such as that would be 'dynamite,' says Mr Buck. There is also another possibility to consider: a merger between one of the Big Six accountancy firms, a big law firm and possibly even an investment bank. Arthur Andersen and KPMG have already signalled their intentions to move in on legal services and must be considering how best to capitalise on their international networks. If such a huge multi-national multi-disciplinary partnership were to emerge, all bets would be off as to who will dominate global legal services by the year 2000.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US TOP 10 LAW FIRMS RANKED BY GROSS REVENUE 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Gross    Profits per  Number                                         revenue  partner      of Rank    Firm                         Dollars m   Dollars'000  lawyers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Baker &amp; McKenzie                      503.5          415       1,604 2  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom    440          885         920 3  Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue            394.5          310       1,170 4  Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher                 291          505         612 5  Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges                287.5          725         605 6  Shearman &amp; Sterling                     270          680         548 7  Sullivan &amp; Cromwell                     270        1.080         361 8  Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell                   267        1.020         400 9  Cleary, Gottlieb,   Steen &amp; Hamilton    255          880         436 10 Sidley &amp; Austin                         244          410         646  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The American Lawyer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK TOP 10 LAW FIRMS RANKED BY GROSS REVENUE 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Gross    Profits per  Total                                        revenue   partner      fee Rank    Firm                         Dollars m   Dollars'000  earners  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Clifford Chance                         210        256        1203 2  Linklaters &amp; Paines                     154        322         779 3  Freshfields                             124        302         635 4  Allen &amp; Overy                           117        377         590 5  Lovell White Durrant                    115        260         642 6  Slaughter and May                       112        333         600 7  Herbert Smith                            77.8      249         472 8  Simmons &amp; Simmons                        72        222         450 9  Norton Rose                              69        218         468 10 Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens             62        185         431  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Legal Business  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

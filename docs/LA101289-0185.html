			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> TRUCK DELIVERY HOURS EXPANDED  </P> <P> Modifying a proposed ordinance, the City Council has expanded the hours that  commercial trucks can make deliveries.  </P> <P> Representatives from the Arco and Mobil oil companies protested the council's  Sept. 25 action that limited delivery hours to between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., with  no deliveries allowed on Sundays or federal holidays.  </P> <P> The action came in response to complaints from residents who live near shopping  centers and must contend with the noise from deliveries being made throughout  the night.  </P> <P> "Something had to be done to alleviate the problem for our citizens," said  Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age.  </P> <P> The oil companies complained that the new hours would cause a hardship since  many deliveries are made to gasoline stations late at night.  </P> <P> As a compromise, the council voted 5 to 0 to extend the hours of delivery to  include Sundays and federal holidays from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. Companies  seeking an exemption from the ordinance must apply for a conditional use  permit.  </P> <P> The modified ordinance will undergo a second reading before the City Council on  Oct. 30.  </P></p>

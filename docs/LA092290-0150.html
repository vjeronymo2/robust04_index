			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: NOT JUST A NUMBERS GAME  </P> <P> Especially poignant and praiseworthy was festival director Peter Sellars'  invitation to the local Native American community to participate. The inclusion  of indigenous American artists and performers, the reverence and respect for  Native American spirituality and the opportunity for the traditional,  indigenous cultures of the Pacific Rim to share their arts will have a deep and  long-lasting effect on all who were able to be there and even those who  weren't.  </P> <P> PAUL BURTON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Book Review: The view from Silicon Valley WHO'S BASHING WHOM? Trade Conflict in High Technology By Laura D'Andrea Tyson Institute for International Economics, Dollars 25; Longman, Pounds 19.99. 324 pp 'If the US fails to choose the semiconductor industry as a winner, American producers may well become long-run losers in the rigged game of international competition.' No sentence better encapsulates the attitudes in Laura D'Andrea Tyson's book. The book is both thought-provoking and important. But it is important even more than it is thought-provoking. It is important for three reasons: because of the ideas it advances; because its author is now chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers; and because the president's choice itself sends a signal. Where the Reagan and Bush administrations went shamefacedly and half-heartedly, this administration will advance with conviction. Professor Tyson's appointment has been roundly criticised by academic economists, mainly for the wrong reasons. Being a first-rate theoretical economist is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being a good policy adviser. Believing both in the division of labour and learning by doing, economists should understand that. Certainly, Mr Clinton has no cause to share the snobbery of professional economists. What he will want to know is whether his adviser shares his objectives. If he has read Prof Tyson's book, he will know that she does. It argues strongly for government support of American 'high-technology' industry. Its core is a set of case studies of how international competition in high-technology production is distorted by foreigners. Her principal conclusion is that the US 'can no longer afford the soothing but largely irrelevant position that market forces alone should determine industry outcomes in the future.' Prof Tyson argues that: Competitive advantage in high-technology production is man-made. High-technology industries are 'strategic', in that 'they fund a disproportionate amount of industrial research and development . . . and provide quasi-rents or higher returns to labour than those available in most other economic activities'. 'The potential strategic threats posed by foreign oligopolistic control in some high-technology industries should be a cause for policy concern, . . . especially when this control is exercised by the Japanese' (my emphasis). Many of America's trading partners 'are convinced that high-technology industries are strategic, and they are willing to protect and promote them'. Finally, 'it is utopian to imagine that the world will have enforceable rules for high-technology trade and investment any time soon'. Her answer, one derived from her case studies of obstacles to access to the Japanese market in computers, cellular telephones and semiconductors, and of experience with Europe's Airbus programme, is what she calls a 'defensive trade and domestic policy'. 'I recommend,' writes Prof Tyson, 'that the nation's trade laws be used to deter or compensate for foreign practices that are not adequately regulated by existing multilateral rules . . . In addition, I believe that, in pursuit of defensive objectives, US policymakers should be guided by the principle of selective reciprocity and motivated by the goal of opening foreign markets. Wherever possible they should favour approaches that encourage trade and competition over those that discourage them.' Prof Tyson is right to call herself cautious. She recognises, for example, that 'even if one accepts the notion that competitive advantage in (high-technology) industries can be created by government action, one need not conclude that such action is warranted - it all depends on the costs and the benefits.' She accepts too that 'trade policy is incapable of solving the competitive difficulties facing this nation's high-technology producers' and shows particular awareness of the many drawbacks of voluntary export restraints and anti-dumping measures. What is more, she even admits that 'flawed domestic choices, not unfair foreign trading practices, are the main cause of the nation's long-run economic slowdown'. Meanwhile, her favourite industrial policy seems to be support for civilian R&amp;D, including direct government funding of 'precompetitive generic technologies'. How far are her positions persuasive and, persuasive or not, what would be the consequences, both for the US and for the world, of attempts by the US to do what she recommends? Questions must be raised about many of her arguments. Is Japanese success in high-technology manufacturing not explained by the country's high savings and its hard-working and highly educated population? What about the failures that litter the history of attempts by governments to promote high-technology industry? Is Airbus an economic as well as an engineering success? If high-technology leadership generates large positive spillovers, why did the US, the unquestioned leader of 20 years ago, perform relatively poorly thereafter? Do the spillover benefits of high-technology industry offset the costs imposed by incompetent attempts to promote it? Yet the principal concern must no longer be whether Prof Tyson is right, but rather with the consequences of her views. One could be to give carte blanche to US politicians and lobbyists, who are itching to have a go at perfidious foreigners, particularly the Japanese. Another could be to flood the world economy with high-technology products, to the great pleasure of consumers and the frustration of producers. Yet the most important could well be still more trade friction, as the US adopts her narrowly sectoral and bilateral focus. Prof Tyson believes in 'cautious activism', but who will rein in the incautious activists?</p>

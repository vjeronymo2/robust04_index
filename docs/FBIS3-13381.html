But they denied a local radio report that a grenade exploded  overnight Sunday 200 meters (yards) from the British embassy in  the residential hills of Rabiyah, overlooking Beirut.    A spokesman for the embassy refused to comment on the  report.    The dawn attack targetted the Shahbaz restaurant in Burj  Hammud, a popular neighborhood in Beirut's Christian northern  suburbs. Police said the grenade caused slight damage but that  the restaurant was empty at the time.    It was not immediately clear if the attack was politically  motivated or the result of a personal dispute.    A series of bombings in recent weeks has heightened fears of  a resumption of terror attacks in Lebanon, where Pope John Paul  II is due to visit in May.    Lebanon's Christian community feels it is the target of  these  attacks, which the government said were aimed at destabilising  security in Lebanon.    The Lebanese army has stepped up patrols and security checks  around churches, mosques and schools after a bomb ripped through  a church during Sunday mass on February 27, killing nine people  and wounding 55 others.    Last week a six-kilogram (13-pound) gift-wrapped bomb was  defused on the doorstep of the French cultural center in the  port city of Juniyah, in Lebanon's Christian heartland.</p>

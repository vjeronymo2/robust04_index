			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The issue of whether to  impose economic sanctions on North Korea has reached a  "delicate" stage with recent new developments, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [17 June].    He said the U.S.-proposed halting of remittances to North  Korea would be effective, with other nations expected to  cooperate if the United Nations decides to adopt such a  resolution.    The United States has proposed a two-staged sanction plan  against North Korea over its refusal to allow full international  nuclear inspections. The halting of remittances is included in  the second stage.    Meanwhile, the U.S. is making last-ditch efforts to solve  the issue through negotiations with former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter, who is now visiting Pyongyang.    "I must refrain from commenting because the North Korean  issue is delicate with new developments in the making," said  Fujii in an apparent reference to Carter's visit.    He noted that the Foreign Ministry is now tackling the issue  and his ministry has not received any "details" over the  U.S.-proposed sanctions.    Turning to the domestic issue, Fujii said the recent rises  in  long-term market rates reflected "market perception over the  global trend and slight brightness in Japan's economy."    But he refused to comment directly on the interest rate  directions, unlike Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno who said  in his press remarks Wednesday that long-term rates would settle  at levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run.</p>

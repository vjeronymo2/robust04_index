			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Appeal to Mr. G. Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan </F> Republic, and the National Assembly of the Azerbaijan Republic"]    [Text] The appearance of the private television company  VMTI has played an appreciable role in the life of independent  Azerbaijan--which is experiencing a difficult sociopolitical  situation--by contributing to the establishment of principles of  freedom of thought and pluralism and to the formation of  democratic institutions of power.    From the day it was created VMTI television set for itself  the goal of serving the people who are experiencing a difficult  period in their history, who are tired of political cataclysms.  By advocating human and national cultural values, the  television company has contributed to the development of high  aesthetic taste in the viewers. This is why in a short period  of time VMTI has been able to win the sympathies of a broad  viewing audience.    Any success begins with creative competition. The newly  created television company has helped in all ways to develop a  high level of professionalism among television workers. There  is still much for the television channel, which is not even a  year old, to do along this path. But as in other areas of our  life, obstacles have appeared on the path to the new--in this  case the television company. The sudden closure of VMTI, which  was founded in compliance with existing legislation, has evoked  protest from the intelligentsia.    We, the undersigned, request that you provide for the  restoration of democratic norms and overturn the illegal  decision to close down the private television company VMTI.    Respectfully,    Anar [Azeri writer], Mikhail Abdullayev, Fuad Poladov,  Dzhevanshir Kuliyev, Rafig Guseynov, and others.    (A total of 22 signatures.)</p>

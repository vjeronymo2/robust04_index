			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Berkeley rides recession with 27% rise to Pounds 6.9m BERKELEY Group, the Surrey-based housebuilder, continued to buck the sector trend with a 27 per cent increase in first half profits; the interim dividend goes up 10 per cent. The group also said it plans to increase its investment in the UK commercial property market through its joint venture with Saad Investments, subject to shareholder approval. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.92m in the six months to October 31, against Pounds 5.43m last time. Turnover expanded 47 per cent to Pounds 75.8m (Pounds 51.7m) with the number of house sales increasing 39 per cent to 468 (336) units. Earnings per share increased to 7.6p (6.1p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.5p to 1.65p. Both turnover and operating profits, ahead to Pounds 6.43m (Pounds 4.33m), include St George, the London-based builder, which became a 100 per cent subsidiary in September last year. Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said the results had been achieved 'in a housing market in which demand has been extremely uncertain and in which house prices have continued to decline with a consequent adverse effect on margins.' He said Berkeley Eastoak Investments, the commercial property joint venture with Saad Investments, has so far invested Pounds 63m and is in the process of investing a further Pounds 22.4m. Its portfolio of 66 properties has mainly blue chip corporate tenants and is producing an average net yield of 10.7 per cent. Because of 'the continuing acquisition opportunities arising out of the depressed conditions in the UK commercial property market,' the joint venture partners plan to invest a further Pounds 100m, of which Berkeley's commitment will be up to Pounds 25m. As with the initial Pounds 100m, the majority of this investment will be financed by bank loans. COMMENT The secret of Berkeley's success has been timing. It decided in late 1988 to liquidate the land bank and since then has operated a 'buy-build' policy of acquiring small parcels of quality land, mostly for immediate use. As a result most of the land used during the first half was acquired in the last 18 months - at reasonable prices. The balance sheet is strong with shareholders funds expected to top Pounds 140m at the year end and Pounds 2m of net cash. The off-balance sheet joint venture in commercial property is structured in such a way as to minimise risks for shareholders and appears to represent a low risk speculative play with the potential for significant medium term capital gains. Even without improvement in the core private housing business, profits should top Pounds 15m pre-tax this year. The shares, which jumped 20p yesterday to 290p, are on a deservedly high prospective multiple of about 17. This is a stock to hold, or buy on signs of weakness.</p>

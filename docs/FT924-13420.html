			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Gengold climbs 3.2% as gold price weakens GENGOLD, the gold mining subsidiary of South Africa's Gencor group, lifted net profits by 3.2 per cent to R72.9m (Dollars 25.4m) in the September quarter from R70.6m in the three months to June, despite producing less gold and receiving a lower gold price. The advance was largely attributable to a 1.5 per cent reduction in the cost of gold produced to R27,099 per kg from R27,508 per kg in the June quarter. This helped offset the fall in the gold price, which was R31,383 per kg in the quarter compared with R32,071 per kg in the earlier quarter. Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the fall in the average gold price had placed considerable pressure on the mines. The 11 mines in the group produced 17,961kg of gold during the quarter, compared with 18,091kg the previous quarter. The average grade was unchanged at 5.6 grams per tonne of ore milled. At the after tax level, six of the mines improved their performance compared to the June quarter. Mr Maude said Gengold was planning its operations on the basis that there would not be a significant increase in the gold price within the next two years. He said most of the group's mines would be able to weather the difficult period ahead.</p>

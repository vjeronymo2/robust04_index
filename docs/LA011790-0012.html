			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Reporting Late: The Hollywood Reporter, which prides itself on being first each  morning to bring entertainment industry news to its 23,000 readers, had trouble  getting out of the starting gate Tuesday with its special 204-page issue on  film and television music.  </P> <P> While receptionists fielded anxious calls from studio subscribers, there was  some confusion in-house over the reasons behind the tardy distribution. A  spokesperson for managing editor Glenn Abel blamed the lateness on "a problem  with one of our printing vendors" while business manager Michael Leonard  claimed the oversize issue simply took a long time to print. "I can't really go  into details over the phone," Leonard said. "You could be from Variety."  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

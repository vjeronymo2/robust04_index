			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today under the headline "Separate  Deals Do Not Make Peace," the newspaper TISHRIN writes on the  Israeli practices regarding the peace process in the Middle  East. TISHRIN says: When Israel goes too far in its insistence  on separate deals, it proves that it does not want peace.  Neither does it want the region to enjoy stability and  tranquility. Israel's proposals of separate deals and  settlements have become an indivisible part of its true  objective of evading a just and comprehensive peace. It is  simply a part of its maneuverings and deception to circumvent  the Madrid conference's bases and its objective and true formula.    TISHRIN adds: The escalation of confrontations in the  occupied Arab territories is a natural result of the Israeli  policy based on peddling separate deals. Its weapons in this is  the Oslo agreement. After signing this agreement on 13 September  1993, Israel was able to drag the Palestinian side into making  further concessions and into relinquishing Palestinian rights.  Israel used this agreement as a pretext to continue its  terroristic and oppressive measures, and to perpetrate massacres  against the sons of our people in the occupied Arab territories.    TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for the escalation of acts  of violence in the occupied Arab territories. It says: This  violence began in a form of terrorism, oppression, repression,  and killing at the hands of the Israelis and their brutal and  fascist practices against the Palestinian people. These  practices have become even more rancorous since the signing of  the Oslo agreement. They continued in a form of sporadic  massacres, the biggest of which were the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the Jabaliya massacre.    TISHRIN adds: All developments indicate that the occupation  troops, the settlers, and the Israeli terrorist organizations  threaten to perpetrate new massacres in other places in the  occupied Arab territories similar to the Hebron massacre.    TISHRIN notes that by all standards, Israel's terrorism is  the source of tension and disturbances in the occupied  territories and the region. Had Israel been really and truly  serious about the stability of the situation, it would have  responded to the requirements of the just and comprehensive  peace, first and foremost showing readiness to withdraw from the  occupied Arab territories, recognizing the Madrid formula, and  implementing it in letter and spirit, especially since it is  based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the  principle of land for peace.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: The comprehensiveness of the  solution, a return to the Madrid bases, the end of the Israeli  occupation, and the renounciation of separate deals will  contribute to achieving a true and just peace.    In an article under the headline "Peace and Occupation  Cannot  Go Together," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH also writes on the  situation in the occupied Arab territories. It stresses that  the Israeli occupation troops exploited the comprehensive  military cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to  launch an arrest campaign that has affected some 500  Palestinians on the pretext that they do not have Israeli work  permits.    AL-THAWRAH says: It is no secret to anyone that the clamor  the Israelis have been creating since the resistance operation  in 'Afula, including the imposition of a comprehensive military  cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is  fabricated and aimed at diverting interest from the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist  settlers through support from the Israeli occupation forces.  This clamor has also come in the wake of the crime Israel has  committed by blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church near  Beirut, and later the crime which was perpetrated by the  occupation soldiers themselves at the Jabaliya camp a week ago.    AL-THAWRAH says: The Israelis will be making another grave  mistake if they think or imagine--after all that has happened  and is happening with acts of resistance and confrontations  carried out by the Arabs against the Israeli occupation forces  and settlers in the occupied Arab territories--that they can go  ahead with the peace process in the Middle East and push it  toward its specified objective of establishing a just and  comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the  Palestine question while they insist on the continued presence  of the occupation troops and settlers in the occupied Arab  territories.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The international community,  particularly the Middle East peace cosponsors, especially the  United States, which assumes the responsibility of a full  partner and an honest broker in the bilateral talks, must tell  Israel loudly and clearly that the just and comprehensive  solution to the region's crisis for which the Arabs,  particularly Syria, are calling for, must guarantee the  withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces, the departure of  the Zionist settlers from all the occupied Arab territories, and  the restoration of the Palestinian people's natural rights.  Only this solution can bring security and stability to the  entire region.</p>

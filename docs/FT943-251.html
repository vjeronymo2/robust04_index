			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Capital gains tax should be top priority in November budget A reform of capital gains tax should be the top business priority in the November Budget, the Institute of Directors said yesterday, Gillian Tett writes. IoD director-general Tim Melville-Ross and policy unit head Ann Robinson (above) also urged the government to reduce public spending significantly to improve government finances and pave the way for tax cuts later. The institute is calling for a package of carefully selected tax cuts of about Pounds 1.25bn for the next financial year to boost business investment, followed by Pounds 5bn tax cuts the following year, and a further Pounds 10bn in the third year. Capital gains tax should be abolished for all gains on disposals after more than three years, the IoD says in its Budget submission. Tax on disposals after two years should be 10 per cent and after one year 20 per cent. Inheritance tax should be abolished and restrictions on reliefs for trading losses and management expenses removed. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has repeatedly indicated that he does not intend introducing significant tax cuts in this year's Budget. However the IoD argues that a reduction in government spending should enable a gradual reduction in taxes, and proposes a reduction in public spending of Pounds 20bn to Pounds 30bn in the next two years.</p>

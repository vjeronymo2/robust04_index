			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It may, however, require additional effort for the employer to determine whether a new employee has received training that meets the requirements of the final rule. An employer cannot merely ask the new employee whether he has been trained. Rather, under the training certification requirements of this paragraph (see paragraph (i)(10)), the employer must make a determination of whether and when the past training was adequate to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine whether past training was adequate, the employer will have to go through two steps. First, the employer must inquire whether the new employee had training in each of the elements specified in paragraph (i)(3). When the new employee indicates that he has not received training in a particular element, the employer will need to provide training in that element. Second, when the employee indicates that he had received training in each of the required elements, the employer must then determine whether the particular training was adequate. Most likely, the employer will make that determination while the new employee is working under close supervision of a designated person, as required by this paragraph. When the new employee, who has been previously trained, can demonstrate the ability to safely perform the job independently, the employee can then determine and certify that previous training had been adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (i)(6) of the final rule, OSHA requires that each new employee and each employee who is required to be trained by this paragraph, to work under the close supervision of a designated person until the employee is able to demonstrate the ability to safely perform the new job independently. The proposed rule contained two provisions specifying initial close supervision. One provision specified initial close supervision for all power tool and machine operators and associated maintenance personnel. The second provided initial close supervision for each new employee, and each newly trained employee. In addition, the State of Oregon logging standard requires initial close supervision for new employees and requires experienced new employees to demonstrate their competence before being allowed to perform the job independently (Ex. 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 9&hyph;9; Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, 172&hyph;73, OR 151&hyph;52, 216, 373, 377, 410). NIOSH said it was important in the logging industry to have an adequate balance of classroom and on-the-job training (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said working with a designated person would be especially effective for pointing out poisonous plants to inexperienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Several commenters also supported limiting this provision to only inexperienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has carefully considered the comments and has decided for several reasons that it is necessary in the final rule to retain the requirement that each new and each newly-trained employee work under the close supervision of a designated person initially. There are several reasons for this determination. First, this requirement acts as a final check on the competency of a newly-trained employee by allowing the employer to measure in practical terms how well the employee has absorbed the training. Second, this provision is also a measure of the general effectiveness and adequacy of the employer's training program. When employees are not able to demonstrate the ability to perform the job safely, the employer needs to review and correct the training program and retrain the workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, OSHA believes this provision is essential given the inclusion of an initial training exception in the final rule for previously trained workers. As discussed earlier, more than 60 percent of all loggers who reported injuries in the WIR survey had been previously trained (Ex. 2&hyph;1). This data supports the need for safeguards to integrating new employees into the workplace if initial training of each new employee is not required. Finally, this provision is also a safeguard for integrating newly-trained employees and employees whose unsafe job performance has necessitated retraining.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(7) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding first-aid training for each employee, including supervisors. Paragraph (i)(7)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee receives or has received first-aid and CPR training. This provision also requires that first-aid training meet at least the requirements of Appendix B. The proposed rule would have required only supervisors, fellers and at least one additional person in each operating area to have first-aid training. The proposed rule also would have required that the first-aid training content meet the training programs of the American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) or other equivalent program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

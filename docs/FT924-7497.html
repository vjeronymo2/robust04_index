			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (11): Getting the green message across - Environmental Issues THE appointment of the new head of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) reflects a fundamental change in the strategy of the peak environment group which, until 1990, could make or break political parties. The shift also puts it on a different course from Greenpeace which maintains a radical stance. The new ACF executive director, Ms Tricia Caswell, is at ease with business and industry leaders and has a strong background as trade union negotiator. She heads a new-look ACF which is more economics-literate and willing to face industry representatives across the table and negotiates in economic terms. Until 1989, the ACF had a confrontationist image, fired by a swell of support from an increasingly conservation-conscious population. It rode high on the support and used it to score major victories against big industrial projects. It also wielded great political influence which it mobilised during the 1990 federal election to put the Labor Party back in power. But the movement now seems to recognise that a confrontationist stance no longer works magic on a population whose main concern is unemployment, not the environment. A recent government-funded survey found that while the environment was now a permanent, deep-seated and genuine concern among the community, unemployment and the state of the economy were 'top-of-the-mind' concerns in late 1991. For example, consumers told the survey they wanted to switch to natural and environmentally-friendly products but they were deterred by their higher prices. Many who had previously made the switch reverted back to normal or generic brands during the recession. The resurgence of economic issues in the development-environment debate is evident in a new legislation designed to protect Australia's endangered species. In effect, the legislation puts economic cost-benefit analysis high in the list of criteria to be used by government agencies when deciding whether or not to approve projects that may harm native flora and fauna. The legislation, which applies to Commonwealth land, was approved by the cabinet last month. It is a weaker version of an original draft which would have given the environment minister the right to veto or delay projects that might threaten endangered species. During cabinet debate, Mrs Ros Kelly, the environment minister, was forced to give some ground to the economic ministers. The final draft gives much of the decision-making process to the portfolio ministers. Final decisions are to be made in cabinet. Despite the watered-down laws, the green lobby's reaction has been circumspect. The ACF said the group was dismayed but said it would want to ensure that Australia's remaining native forests and endangered species were protected, while accommodating the country's economic aspirations. 'It is necessary to do both. It is possible to do both,' a spokeswoman said. The group hardly sees the weak legislation as a defeat. It has had a big victory in getting the government to adopt a national policy which makes environment an integral part of development planning, along with economic and social considerations. The national policy for 'ecologically sustainable development' (ESD) which was set up in 1990, has brought together conservationists, industry and union representatives and federal and state bureaucrats to resolve many of their disagreements. They did manage to agree on specific proposals on such issues as greenhouse, land degradation and forest conservation. However, business, unions and conservationists are disappointed that after adopting the ESD strategy, the government has been slow in immersing itself in the process. The ACF now believes that lobbying the government may not be the most efficient way of getting the green message across. It has instead begun forming alliances with former enemies to work directly on environment problems. The ACF and the National Farmers' Federation have a massive joint project aimed at countering soil degradation in farmlands. The ACF is attempting to convert workers to the green philosophy, and through them get their message to industry. Ms Caswell goes on frequent trips back to her old turf, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, expounding the idea that a well-protected environment creates more jobs. As to the arch enemy, industry, Ms Caswell has a ready opener. She has said not all industry people are greedy.</p>
